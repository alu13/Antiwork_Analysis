4,The problem with working too much,this post was originally on rproductivity a user told me you folks would appreciate it too     for the ambitious among us we feel that success in todays hypercompetitive world can only be obtained by pouring more and more time into work long hours grinding it out in the office is almost taken for granted as a prerequisite for success  ascending the corporate ladder or making your business succeed can come to seem like a punishing endeavor especially considering that we have other important priorities like spending time with our families or keeping up a social life  however the scientific literature shows unequivocally that more time does not translate to more productivity in the long term it seems we have been seriously mistaken in our approach to work in fact working for longer hours can actually bedetrimentalto your work   the problem with overwork  in the productivity project chris bailey examines the optimal amount of time we should spend working per week in order to maximize our productivity  gtone study found that when you work sixtyhour weeks in order to accomplish one more hour of work you need to work two hours of overtime yet another study found that your productivity falls off a cliff after 55 hoursso much so that someone who puts in 70 hours produces nothing more with those extra 15 hours   after thirtyfive to forty hours of work studies show that your marginal productivity begins to drop until at approximately eight 60hour weeks the total work done is the same as what would have been done in eight 40hour weeks the same study found that with seventy and eightyhour weeks you reach the same breakeven point in just three weeks   studies show that the ideal number of hours to work every week is even lower than that they suggest that the optimal number is roughly thirtyfive to forty hours  the human brain cannot handle long hours it simply does not have the capacity for such prolonged periods of concentration beyond a certain point you simply do busy work instead of meaningful work that actually moves the needle forward  you mightfeela lot less guilty when working longer hours but those hours arent really contributing to anything when you consistently work long hours its usually a sign that youre not spending your time and attention wiselynot that you have too much to do   where did long hours come from  today we treat stress and overwork as a badge of honor we brag about how little sleep we get and how few vacation days we take we even want to be known as workaholics the time we spend at work is seen as a direct indicator of our commitment to the job but where did this deeply pernicious idea come from  our tendency to pile on more time is a remnant of the industrial age when more time actually did translate to more productivity back then the work was mostly physical in actual factories and creating tangible products it didnt require high levels of concentration  gtmeasuring time first became important during the industrial revolution when factory owners needed their workers to arrive on time today in the knowledge economy if you want to become more productive managing your time should take a backseat to how you manage your energy and attention   when we transitioned into the time economy we began to trade our time for a paycheck but as we have transitioned into the knowledge economy weve begun to trade so much more than just our time most people who work nonfactory jobs trade some combination of their time attention energy skills knowledge social intelligence network and ultimately their productivity for a paycheck  now we are all very much knowledge workers in factories and fields we could point to physical products at the end of the day but in the knowledge economy thats not possible the product is intangible and projects may take years to complete but we still assume that spending more time will lead to better work simply pouring more time into work does not improve the quality of the end product  rest  gtthe assumptions that knowledge is produced rather than discovered or revealed that the amount of work that goes into an idea determines its importance and that the creation of ideas can be organized and institutionalized all guide our thinking about work today when we treat workaholics as heroes we express a belief that labor rather than contemplation is the wellspring of great ideas and that the success of individuals and companies is a measure of their long hours  santiago ramn y cajal in his bookadvice for a young investigator argues that a view of work as demanding countless hours of dedicated effortas a kind of intellectual workleads investigators to waste their energy on small and superficial problems  rest  gtbut this was a style of work ramn y cajal argued that led to asking only shallow easily answered questions rather than hard fundamental ones it created the appearance of profundity and feelings of productivity but did not lead to substantial discoverieschoosing to be prolific he contended meant closing off the possibility of doing great workemphasis mine   the proper approach to knowledge work  so if not time then what how do we get ahead  the proper approach to knowledge work is according to santiago ramon cerebral polarization or sustained concentration in other words working with great intensity of focus and concentrationalso known as deep work  knowledge work requires vigorous concentration of mental energy this state of sustained concentration writes ramon refines judgment enriches analytical powers spurs constructive imagination andby focusing all light of reason on the darkness of a problemallows unforeseen and subtle relationships to be discovered  except it doesnt seem possible for the human brain to sustain such intense focus for too many hours each day the daily maximum is about 4 hours any longer and your thinking becomes hazy and nebulous  all manner of high achievers attest to this rather contentious assertion charles darwins daily work schedule consisted of just three ninetyminute periods gh hardy one of the leading mathematicians of the first half of the twentieth century said four hours creative work a day is about the limit for a mathematician countless writersincluding charles dickens and anthony trollopeexpress similar sentiments in fact this is even endorsed by modern tech entrepreneurs as alluded to in paul grahams makers schedulehttpwwwpaulgrahamcommakersschedulehtml  deep work can only be sustained for a limited time each day work too little and youre not maximizing your progress work too much though and you increase the likelihood of simply resorting to busy work draining yourself mentally or burning out to succeed you must avoid exhaustion and limit work to an amount from which you can recover on a daily and weekly basis  thus if you want to achieve maximally in your job the proper approach is to break your workday into a few sprints and recoveries the foundation of high performance is balancing rest and recovery during sprints you focus all your energy and intensity and work forcefully then you recover you allow your mental energy to replenish by resting you go on a pleasant walk take a nap do some breathing exercises practise yoga poses listen to some music read a magazine eat a snack take a shower or do anything else you find pleasant and relaxing a good rule of thumb is to schedule an inviolable twentyminute break every 90 minutes  the utility of recovery is most obvious in the lives of scientists many famous stories of breakthroughs involve periods of intense work then during a break the answer suddenly appears in a flash of insight in contrast the scientists who cram their schedules with shallow work sacrifice profound insights to carry out a lot of superficial tasks   work for the sake of work  nietzche wrote what could destroy us more quickly than working thinking and feeling without any inner necessity without any deeply personal choice without pleasureas an automaton of duty this is the very recipe for decadence even for idiocy  you see many of us work for the sake of work we tend to see work as meaningless drudgery we may work so that we can feel productive or so that the boss can see us sweat hard perhaps we might even genuinely feel that all the hours were putting in are really making an impact all of this does not lead to great work being done  if high performance is our goal we need to understand the necessity of rest and recovery rest is not the adversary of work rest is its essential partner rest and recovery allow us to perform maximally it replenishes our mental and physical energy and permits us to give our best it is for this reason that american business journalist berties charles forbes wrote how we spend our nonworking hours determines very largely how capably or incapably we spend our working hours  the data is in the conclusions have been drawn we should not be working long gruelling hours its bad for our productivity and for our lives instead focus your energy and intensity into sprints and work with sustained concentration for shorter amounts of time make rest a priority  in the modern era we have overridden the natural rhythms of work the challenge now is to deliberately create boundaries and take time for recovery

7,I genuinely think we will see a change in the future,no maybe not in 510 years hell maybe not even in 20 years but it is blatantly obvious that people ages 1230 do not have the same outlook on life as their parents did our parents were driven by their work they define their life and their success based on how their work is going its all they know the internet has allowed us all to share our experiences and deepest secrets it has allowed us to tell each other things we are too afraid to speak out about publicly weve realized nobody likes work and its okay to admit that our parents are afraid to say this because it defines them if they say work is stupid then theyre admitting their life is meaningless   seeing how unwilling younger people are to take shit from authority or as older folks would call it being lazy gives me hope the internet allows us to join up in larger numbers we actually wield a small amount of power now albeit still nothing compared to the government but alas we can make a difference when we become the ceos and when we become the parents we can change the rules and im confident we will to an extent the world is changing and i believe we are opening up to the idea that life is more than just working this subs success is proof of that do you think a newspaper section about antiwork would ever garner support in the 50s hell no   so dont give up fight and stand up for yourselves one day well see a change even if its only a little change itll be worth knowing we did something to improve not only our lives but the lives of the future generations,l8g0iv

16,The actual meaning of working/studying and us losing touch with it,i am a social worker and yesterday me and my manager had a talk between shifts one of the subjects being how overworked she was since there is so much to do the most interesting thing she mentioned was that working five days a week or even more felt fine when she had the same position as me no managerial responsibilities but only direct frontline work since it was more about actually working with the clients and focusing on their needs instead of having to attend meetings being available around the clock dealing with bureaucratic bullshit having to be a liaison to every authority or organization involved etc on top of the usual work now five days a week feel like just too much for her which is understandable  for those of you who have a client contact based profession you probably recognize this dilemma the higher up you become in the field the less in touch you are with the clients and the heart of the work you become more responsible and have an opportunity to change how things work from within however you lose much of the relationships you build directly with them which for me is the core of actual social work  using your interpersonal skills to empower support and help clients through this society filled with poverty and terrible work environments shaped by inequality racism and bureaucracy jungles   after i graduated university i moved to another country to do the same type of work one of my colleagues back home asked me why i said why not i want to travel and learn and do things that make me happy his response was yes sure but dont you want to have a job that is more prestigious all i could think was if you think having a prestigious job is the most important thing youre going to be a terrible social worker  humans are natural learners and labourers we all have different types of skills that could contribute to our society the value being the products itself and not the money be get in exchange for it this doesnt only apply to actual materialistic products but other human intra and interpersonal skills such as being a good listener giving advice singing problem solving sharing knowledge storytelling and so on however all these skills are losing their actual face value since it is now more about how much you can work and how much money or status you can make instead of actually accumulating and developing abilities what is the point of doing what you love if youre going to water it down or even drown it with thoughts of climbing up some status ladder and for what apart from improving your resume the worst thing you can do is letting others expectations ruin your passion  has anyone experienced or have general thoughts about this meaningless and almost hysterical climbthecareerladdermantra especially in north america in some way that has affected your interest for your actual workstudies how did you cope i would love to know especially if you work in a different type of field whether its being a lawyerdesignerfactory worker anything really,l8th4t

21,No Degree-Customer Service Trap (Rant),so college has never really been for me i attempted to attend community college after high school in 2011 over the past 10 years ive lost interest in countless classes and continually either fail out or drop out voluntarily truthfully the only reason why ive tried at college so many times is because ive felt pressured by society and familyfriends i am knowledgeable in many areas including photography computers and writing however the problem is that i dont have the piece of paper that says so  i love to learn but on my own terms am i just destined to work jobs that provide littletono respect garbage pay and often times have to deal with customers   im on my 18th job in 10 years and its gotten no better my friends who graduated from college still work sucky jobs i have strong opinions about work in general so trust me my goal in life isnt to find some dream job but they at least get to do things that are somewhat interesting i always get stuck working with customers or being someones assistant in one way or another right now i work for a software company its mondayfriday 9530pm i hate the schedule and it has me completely burned out the job was supposed to be for a desktop support technician but of course it turned into a role where i call rude customers on the phone and help them with softwarerelated issues  sometimes i sit at my desk and i just get a wave of depression because its like here i am 10 years later and i feel that im in the same boat ive always been in   of course when i tell most people about this they call me lazy and say what can you expect you have no skills even though no offense but most of these people cant even form a proper grammatically correct sentence but they have a degree so they feel superior to me im not lazy at all its just that none of my interests provide profit and my knowledge has come from my own learnings instead of a classroom   so is this it for me unless i submit to higher formal education even though i suppose it may be no better we all just end up working for some asshole and are supposed to be grateful for it  i dont know i guess i just needed to vent maybe someone else feels the same way,l7yvf7
22,What is The Solution,medium link httpsmediumcomthewayoutofthismesschapter1whatisthesolution1ad34e7bda36httpsmediumcomthewayoutofthismesschapter1whatisthesolution1ad34e7bda36  the solution is the decommodification of everything through sustainability automation and essentialism easy right in more concrete terms the solution is to strengthen the relationship between production consumption and sustainability the solution is to design society in such a way that things are not just produced forprofit but actually for the benefit of humanity as a whole this means abandoning the concepts of money unending growth and thoughtless consumption and instead of building a society based around community intention and sustainability to do this it is not possible to work within the current bounds of liberal democracy it is also not advisable to try and seek a violent nonconsensual revolution  lets go over what i just postulated in detail decommodification is the process of taking things that were once traded as commodities ie for our purposes branded products in a capitalist market and turning them into something else a good example of what this looks like is the free upick fields in the midwestern united states these are fields of usually blueberries that have been left to grow and now are a community resource that you can harvest from freely another example from before capitalism took hold were the british commons before the enclosure movement these resources werent traded werent branded they were just resources that existed making resources the property of all is not the only way to decommodify resources for soldiers in the american military mre and other government equipment are not commodified  sustainability can be hard and nebulous to define its often much easier to start off with what not sustainable and then try and postulate what a world without those things might look like therefore a world with no unsustainable elements  a more sustainable world things that are unsustainable usually produce nothing of usable value to either nature or humans after they have been used due to the nature of thermodynamics everything will eventually end up in this state but how long it takes to reach that state give a good metric by which we can measure the sustainability of a given object how long until everything associated with it is unusable or a system what sustainable vs unsustainable distribution does it produce or a society how do many of the systems which make up a society are sustainable by this definition there are very few things that are unsustainable but there are plenty of things that arent that sustainable for example many plastics are considered unsustainable because once they are used they cant be recycled into new highvalue items but they can be used for all sorts of things they are just of lower value building material decoration synthetic thread etc so we see that certain plastics can be rated on how after each use how much value does it lose after each use both to humans and to the environment and how other plastics such as bioplastics for example are very sustainable because after reuse they maintain a larger percentage of their value and actually gain value to the environment applied to products this means practices like planned obsolescence are unsustainable because they are built upon the product losing value over its lifecycle applied to systems this means that inflation is usually unsustainable as it makes the store of value such as the dollar lose value overtime with no gain in its worth to the environment  automation is not really that hard to pin down it is the completion of labor the process of adding or transmuting value being done by a nonhuman autonomousselfmanaging agent that means tool use is not necessarily automation having a better axe does not make ones job more automated usually this takes place when machinerys lifetime cost is less than that of a human laborers this can only happen however is the machinerys initial cost can be paid integrated automated systems lead to an astonishing network effect of rapid and efficient just in time manufacturing  essentialism is an offshoot of the minimalist movement with minimalism being a response to hyperconsumerism the goal of both minimalism and essentialism is to consume less essentialism goes about this by practicing the disciplined pursuit of less what i am advocating for is not the mainstream version of either minimalism or essentialism what im advocating for is what id like to call the disciplined pursuit of nonsuperfluous self which combines the tenants of essentialism nonalienated labor and zen buddhism the idea is to have an intimate relationship with the things you come to possess by making sure you only possess things that you truly care about what this looks like is when lets say you need new jeans you either find an artisan that knows how to make jeans and make an arrangement by which you receive jeans you love and they are fairly compensated or you learn the craft of making jeans or realizing that the particular type of jean does not matter to you go and get a generic utilitarian comfy pair  putting all these concepts together results in something magical completely automating the supply chains of things allows for those things to become decommodified without having to endure the tragedy of the commons through this you can then treat those automated decommodified supply chains like you would a 3d printer meaning that for essentialist consumption it allows you to customize every step of the manufacturing process allowing consumers to have more say in the products they consume ultimately leading to less waste and more selfidentification with the product this whole system can be engineered from a systems design approach from the beginning with a mathematical definition of sustainability in it from the start allowing for it to rated on sustainability  as long as these things can be produced sustainably after the startup costs are recuperated the things produced by these supply chains need not be bought or sold the end result of this means that there is such a way in which you could set up a society like ancient athens where for the citizens the basic necessities of life can be guaranteed without cost to anyone this society is the solution a society where production consumption and sustainability are inseparably intertwined this society where things are produced for the benefit of each and every member of the society this society in which money is a construct of the past where consumption is not the rule of the day,l8o1ad
23,A positive story about my work place,thought id throw this story in because i think its really positive to change to working culture and id love views on it  im an auditor for an insurance company standard 95 office job soul destroying i work for one of the largest maybe actually the largest insurance companies in europe this year weve seen massive changes to how we work mostly due to covid but also i think the execs actually do care about our working culture  the way things work now is i dont have set hours anymore my job is 100 remotely done every quarter i get given all my work and the deadlines and i get to create my own hours so far its been a huge change ill have days where i need to send off a request for data but after thats done all i can do is wait and pretend im busy now i can send off my request and just stop working  the idea behind it being ill make up that time when it comes to the bulk of work being done like report writing analysis etc   dont get me wrong im still very much anti work but this seems like a huge positive change to office culture actually being treated like an adult feels nice,l8mlnl

62,Leeching Off Taxpayer Money? Not Quite.,i hear this argument a lot in critique of antiwork and leftist thought that many of us are lazy and entitled and are living off taxpayer money its usually meant to express outrage from people who are financially successful and have been working hard however since the argument is both pervasive and illogical i thought it perhaps worthwhile to write a briefish response     to begin with if you have been financially successful consider yourself lucky increasingly most of us do not have that privilege and i do agree that taxes are too high this is because most of your tax money is going to pay for wars prisons and billionaire subsidies moreover the welfare that does exist such as medicare as inefficiently run to the point where the people administering the service make more than the people benefiting from the service itself so if you dont like paying high taxes first take a look at where they are going     secondly though i cant speak for others i myself have three to four sources of income at any given time i own a motor home and an rv by the legal classification in my country im homeless ie without a home rent is too high food is expensive medical care is too expensive i must rely on subsidies in one form or another even with all the money i make the rich people of my country america have monopolized real estate and cornered various markets to the point where they have collective monopolies put together they can charge whatever price they please and pay their employees whatever wage they like     so perhaps you can imagine the feeling i might have when i see someone come in and say work harder or youre just lazy i know its not true i know that many of us here in this sub actually do work hard were just tired at the end of our shifts and we have little to nothing to show for it were being squeezed from all sides were doing the best we can trying to survive in whatever way know how     if youre this angry at us the working class the poor then youre on the wrong side were like you were tired of things being expensive we want to have a bit of money set aside at the end of the month we dont like the fruits of labor disappearing down rabbit holes we cant reach we dont hate folks like you in fact most of us dont mind when someone works their way into success honestly thats something to be celebrated be proud of yourself for youve done well     the animadversion comes in when you judge us even though our struggle is so much like your own when you try to set yourself up as above us as though you are a better class of person somehow the vast majority of us arent tax assessors or politicians we dont determine the taxes you pay a lot of us dont even like politics to begin with please keep this in mind the next time you try to be judgmental and insulting     were all just trying to live and get by thats all,l93hvv

90,"Work isn't bad, capitalism is",work is the way in which humans relate to their surroundings many on here would love to step away from their jobs and create art but that creation is obviously work for others they may find more traditional jobs as fulfilling as we find out art whats important is that our work comes from a place a creativity instead of from the threat of poverty the problem is not work its capitalism in our current economic system in which profit is valued over human need many are forced into debilitating work to serve the uberwealthy who screw us over at every turn we have the resources manpower and drive to house feed and pay for everyone to live comfortably we could raise the standard of living of everyone without them even needing to work the rich do not need their wealth they tie it up and keep it from the public for the sole purpose of profit if those resources were fairly given everyone could right now live without having to work of course many would remain at their jobs but now if you cant deal with the crushing forces of capitalism you can step back and create something truly valuable without the threat of poverty instead of scorning those whove been beaten by the bourgeois we should stand together and show the true benefit of our work we are creatives and we are artists unvalued in this system despite the vital importance of our work youre enemy is not work it is capitalism,l8ytso

120,Early morning thoughts on work,please excuse the following ramblings for i am typing them as im thinking  i was letting my mind wander this morning and for some reason i had a random flashback to a job interview i had years ago it wasnt particularly memorable but it made my mind go down a path  i hate the idea that you basically have to lie or sugarcoat your answers in a job interview in order to get a job when someone asks you what is your biggest weakness youre supposed to say something clever like well im a bit of a perfectionist so that makes me care a lot about my work blah blah blah or some other bs like this  what would happen if you were honest well my biggest weakness is i cant stay focused performing a job i hate in order to avoid starving or living on the street or i hate dealing with the entitled general public but i need to do so otherwise i cant afford basic health insurance and run the risk of going bankrupt if i have a serious medical accident  if you said something like that youre not getting the job you have to lie about who you really are to get a job you dont actually likeget fulfillment out of and more or less maintain this facade while working so you dont get fired for having a bad attitude  personally i dont have a bad attitude im generally nice and easy going and make friends fairly easily but being at work just puts me in a sour mood knowing that im performing tasks that do nothing for me personally dont advance my life for the better in anyway  some people say well weve all got to do things we dont like sometimes but i think thats bullshit why why are we spending our tiny bit of time on this earth doing something we hate making up stupid clever sounding things for our resumes and trying to maintain a smile through a pointless job interview oh yes sir i can maintain this smile while cashing out my 10000th customer for the day while being screamed at by my boss that my productivity is too low thank you sir now i can afford the absolute basic necessities of life such as food water and shelter   i just have a hard time comprehending why this is the way it is and the shitty part is i actually enjoy doing work that i find fulfilling i like working in my workshop and making stuff i like tending to my garden stuff like that but because its on my own time and its for myself being at the beck and call of some boss like a damn dog is beyond depressing wearing a name tag and an outfit of some company that can give two shits about me and would replace me if i died tomorrow id beyond depressing im supposed to represent the company but when does the company have to represent me   and whats the alternative option living off the grid running your own business then you become a slave to the customer i dont want to sell things i want to enjoy a quiet fulfilling life with my family i want to be able to have dinner together every night and not live in constant fear that we wont have the rent money next month because we might get laid off   i dont think thats a lot to ask,l9dqn6

127,Wake up. Spread the message.,  theyve been deleting comments like mine that are trying to wake people up to the lies now theyve turned off comments on this video and possibly others on the entire channel and maybe all of the news channels  money is taken as a result of your efforts without people putting in effort there is no way for them to tax you because you wont be putting in effort to earn money therefore no tax can be taken from that money because where does the money come from to begin with its created out of thin air by the banks how because there is a law that states banks are allowed to createprint money that we the tax payer are expected to pay back in the form of interest tax you see what a scam it is they create money that they never had that we have to put in effort to get why should we what effort did they the banks and ruling elite put in to earn it they didnt they expect us to believe the lie that money has intrinsic value it doesnt never has never will  people are waking up i dont use netflix or instagram i torrent pretty much everything why would i pay some corporation for movies when i can get them for free i dont because i know if i were to pay that money would end up in the hands of the ruling elite somewhere down the line if every single person on the planet torrented and otherwise didnt use money for anything digital their precious toilet paper money would lose its value so fast that their heads would spin  brokerage firms and the ruling elite are liars  so basically they robinhood brokerage firm had no money to cover but they took peoples money anyway that is a scum move it is bullshit  so the retail investors us everyday people put in our time and effort for essentially nothing we are working for free stop believing that money has value it doesnt never has never will the ruling elite need to be held accountable for lying to us money has never had any value stop putting in time and effort for nothing to be clear when you go to work you are not getting anything of value for your time and effort ask yourself why are you even bothering  watch and learn youll begin to understand how weve all been deceived and controlled since birth  i already knew this before i ever heard of anonymous and before the internet was mainstream as it is now  anonymous message to the citizens of the world iii  httpsyoutubezpnzj9avwne  anonymous  if you think you can handle the truth well here it is  httpsyoutubekqhsbh1plg8  the sad reality of this world  you have no choice ft george carlin  httpsyoutube3fgq8pf3wyu   httpsyoutubev3pcjzdvyew,l985j6

215,I need input on a problem,i was working a seasonal position with burlington coat factory all employees were supposed to use an app called vtime to get updates on my flexible schedule i had never used this app prior to working at burlington as my previous jobs were student work placements that omitted certain routines from the work schedule   on my first day the store managers was helping me set it up but due to bad internet my phone was taking literal hours to download the app and neither i nor the store manager had that much time to wait so they told me they would help me set it up on my next shift this never happened as every time i had a shift the store manager just told me next time and resorted to simply putting me on literal call in which she would call me in to work through text or phone a day to 30 minutes ahead of my scheduled shifts apparently this was common with seasonal employees   according to all the documents my seasonal position was supposed to end on january 11th my last shift was on january 4th and absolutely nothing happened on january 11th after january 11th i tried applying for more jobs to no avail   tonight i just got a call from the assistant manager telling me that i had a shift scheduled to start 30 minutes ago i informed her that i received no notification of this was never able to set up my vtime due to the manager always rescheduling it and i was under the impression that my work term ended on january 11th as according to my employee profile she told me not to come in and she would speak to the store manager   ive had a very bad day so far and this has just added to it i dont know if im in the wrong or if my manager is and i think its very likely that ill be fired for this   i suspect that i may be at fault here i have aspergers and one of the many problems i have is that i cant remember who is who in the chain of command at a job especially a job in a large store where the chain of command and number of employees are obviously larger i may have been going to the wrong people at the wrong times and i never tell an employer that i have mental disabilities because that just guarantees that i wont get the job so basically to them im acting like a complete and total idiot  i dont know what to do here and i need input from people,l6mms6

217,My boss doesn’t give me any space,i graduated college recently and spent six months looking for full time work my father who is just as antiwork as me always told me the only silver lining to working is working from home so i spent the last six months trying to find a remote job and got to the final 23 people several times for jobs i really wanted then was rejected  my biggest reason for seeking remote work is partially because of the pandemic and partially because i dont want to have to go to work and act like i care but the biggest reason is because im a musician and want to play gigs every night once the pandemic ends and i want time to work on my music everyday  i got a job as a social media coordinator last month and when i heard the hours were 105 instead of 96 i thought i won the lottery those hours are perfect for what i want to do i can sleep in and still have the whole night ahead of me plus social media is trendy and i had a few internships doing this before i told myself no matter what i will keep this job even if its awful just because i need to move out and to a new city where music is booming  but im finding it very hard every day that goes by im more depressed my boss never leaves me alone she texts and calls me on my off hours ill wake up at like 9 and shes already trying to call me shell text me at 9 at night asking me to do something she makes me do shit on my days off  including new years day i had to wake up and immediately do something to our website she spent over two hours on the phone with me last friday night after i was already done with work telling me what to do shes incredibly narcissistic thinks shes the shit because she built all of her companies from the ground up and makes it clear that nobody should work with her unless they are willing to not have a work life balance she also makes it clear that she does not care about other people and will do anything to step on them and rise to the top  even though i work from home i truly feel like i am never home all of a sudden i have no work life balance and am constantly thinking about work both my parents work from home and get to leave at 5 and dont have to worry about it for the rest of the night or weekend me shes always bothering me always giving me shit to do i guess people were right about working from home  theyll exploit you because they think that just because youre home youre not busy i found myself looking at indeed yesterday even though i should be perfectly happy  its everything i asked for but not everything i imagined,l6z8mv
218,"What do you think about ""remote working"" software that completely shuts down your own computer to monitor you all day long?",i think its totally insane that we cant just work at home at our own paces even outside of the workplace employers must find a way to threaten us if we spend even one measly minute not being productive i personally think such an obvious breach of data protection should make this sort of thing totally illegal i thought i would be able to get a work from home job and id be able to just do my work in the background while i studied other things i am interested in but noooo you are an employee how dare you try to have your own time in your own home  tangent here  luckily my bills are just barely affordable without a working income but im one financial surprise away from losing everything i have ever worked for i am 27 and i have never come out of work with more than i went in so im not going to be doing it for as long as i can even if that means eating only a bowl of rice every day not driving because insurance prices are insane and getting myself signed off as clinically depressed so the system doesnt harass me into taking the worst paid most abusive fastest to get into job anynore after taxes it really isnt worth it my 8 hours are far more valuable to me and my growth as an individual than any abusive scum employer is willing to pay me for every day in the time i would be getting yelled at and constantly threatened for not hitting targets i have been learning coding and art at my own pace and in the last month i have skyrocketed my abilities to a place i never would have seen coming and guess what i dont have to have a productivity tracker forcing me to do x amount of extra crap each day or ill be punished to achieve any of this i do these things when i feel like it i leave my desk when i feel like it and i have never been broker but i have also never been happier  learn to budget and see if you can manage with just financial aid i dont feel like a sponge because all these employers want to do is abuse and underpay i think the fact that the people paying my unemployment make more in 6 months than i could ever make in ten years working 16 hours a day just gives more reason to feel like actually they owe me for helping their bullshit system continue  sorry i initially had a point but i guess i needed to vent about this more than i realised as i was typing it,l6ujyg

222,Please act your wage!,so i work in a large clinichospitalorganization where i check in patients and schedule follow ups or other appointments not a bad job but not something i want to do for years on end despite supposedly high turnover we have some people who are complete lifers cliques and stockholm syndrome are strong im not knocking people who stick with one job but goddamn itd be nice if we could rotate some of these people but thats me ranting because i know its not a good idea but it still sucks  ampx200b  im a little biased because as for what department i work in it actually varies it sounds like a bad thing but for me its a good thing i am a floater so where i am working day to day can change if i dont like somewhere i have a very good chance of working somewhere else and trust me some of the clinics arent that great theres been times where ive been at the same clinic for a month and other times ive worked three different places in a day thats cool because its something different my schedule and hours are always the same though and the schedule actually works for me and my family so thats good  ampx200b  theres one clinic i am in a lot and for the most part its really easy and a few people i really get along with and theres one person i have really hit it off with and we have a good time working so i sometimes look forward to going there more often than not however we have two people who have the same name and they are both annoying but the thing besides name they share in common is that they do not act their wage what do i mean by this they act above their pay wage thinking they are supervisors and trainers they are at a higher paygrade as my job has various levels tied to production and to keep that level you have to meet the production im not really a fan of this concept  ampx200b  look im not against or above needing assistance but in this case i didnt need it and i had something today that really pissed me off ive spent most of my time in this clinic as ive been working this job anyway i was checking in a person and they wanted to speak to the nurse which they normally dont see for this appointment i let the patient know when they get back there they can request to speak to the nurse and i was almost done checking them in butone of them butted in and were like well you can zoom the nurse if you look in the directory and get their name oh they write it for the supervisor or zoom the group of which we have three zoom groups for the same job in the same clinic oi i could have done this yes but honestly the nurses are busy dealing with imo more important things like patient care they may be in a meeting a training the schedule may change they may be at lunch busy helping another doctor etc and it may take a while for them to get back im not afraid to approach a nurse if i need something but im not always going to make it the main solution would you want a nurse to always rely on the doctor for everything they do or that comes out of their mouth so they are doing this while i am helping the patient im pretty much put in a position where unless i want to look stupid or rude i have to call the nurse they surprisingly answer and get the same answer i told the person initially  bring it up when you come back if someone says something that needs a clinical answer i always tell them to say something when they get back there jfc  ampx200b  i was going to say something to the supervisor of that clinic but they are aware of how the person acts  way too perky and too eager to help to where they butt in its a lot like spongebob and a couple other characters i cant think of right now and hes never done anything and you know what why would he turns out they supposedly do a lot of his work if what i was told is true do too much work in general and are too eager to jump in anything and everything that arises its ok to say no its ok to stay in your lane if you want to be a supervisor or trainerthen do it we have a supervisor position open but that will require you to leave this clinic  ampx200b  tldr  act your wage if you arent a supervisor or a trainer please dont act like one,l7ff25

248,Got my vacation request denied.,my workplace has a policy if you schedule a vacation day either the day before or after a weekend you arent subject to mandatory overtime that gets scheduled on that weekend so on wednesday i saw the writing on the walls for overtime and opted to schedule a day preemptively to avoid it my boss tells me hes leaning towards denying it but hed get back to me on his decision fast forward to today he comes to a conclusion he denied it on the grounds that they need all hands this weekend i dont give a fuck what you need hire more people then oh turnover rates high maybe because you keep assigning us obscene amounts of overtime making a lot of people pick between family and work naturally im raising hell im sick of it if i get fired so be it i have more than enough saved to live a few years without them the conversation was as follows  supervisor 439 pm i must decline the request for this weekend we are all hands on  all trainers scheduled as well  me 441 pm with that being the reasoning behind declining my request is this setting a precedent  that if vacation time is scheduled it will be denied anytime everyone is scheduled i just want clarification on what to expect here  supervisor 442 pm the decline essentially comes from higher than me due to the current time taken  me 443 pm despite the fact that the time taken was the bonus time id earned and not at all yet cut into the standard 11 days i dont mean to be overly contentious it just seems like the decision was made in poor judgment to myself with all due respect  supervisor 445 pm i dont know of an easy way to answer  the decision came after discussion with sevral others  there are times we double down and throw down together as a team  it comes down to judgment this request is determined to be one that is declined  i feel for your disinterest for ot  this weekend is one we need you  me 58 min though i feel that my vacation time should be just that my time to use in whatever manner i please i do however acknowledge the decisions made as much as i believe theyre poorly made theres a high turnover rate now and decisions like that are not in any way conducive to turning that around if when these discussions come up you could mention that i have ideas that could both help with turnover and help with company name i would appreciate that a complaint without suggestions to improve is whining however i do have suggestions to improve the situation if they have the ears to listen on that note i find it odd that the decision to approve vt doesnt lay solely with you my direct supervisor but i do digress  on that note what hours will our department be working saturday im guessing regular hours as thats what all the other departments seem to be getting and similarly which department will i be expected to report to  supervisor 37 min i would love these suggestions i have had some of my own of late and look forward to any thoughts if ever the chance to discuss comes about thank you for your thoughts in regards to potential improvements i know there is a lot that happens over my head and a lot that happens on the floor too i find myself oddly stuck in the middle at times right on at times out of touch saturday is a day for picking all trainers and you as cubiscan scheduled to assist in picking ill see who needs the help and discuss with general manager name  me 32 min just feels like it sets an extremely bad precedent in my eyes that time scheduled could just be canceled at the leisure of uppermanagement if they just want us in here rendering vacation time kinda moot if you know you cant even use it it makes me lose any shred of faith that managerial staff is working in good faith with us and shows a distinct disconnect between them and us especially respect for our lives outside of the building like i get denying if like im trying take weeks off in a row in january thats excessive but attempting to utilize it within reason is justan extreme faux pas and further increases employee resentment towards them and the decisions they make  though i will say despite things turning out as they have i do at least appreciate you for letting me speak my mind without repercussion anyone else would just shrug me off and probably attempt to write me up for insubordination so kudos to you on that front  and understood though i sincerely hope i wind up going to skf as i know it well a question goes unanswered though regular hours correct  me 29 min and i know you would love my suggestions you have an ear out for me but honestly i want the chance to give these suggestions and feedback to uppermanagement myself i the humble floor worker want to be the one that they hear it from so they can get the words directly from me exactly as i want them to hear them no paraphrasing,l7d40c

259,I feel like I want to say this under almost every post I see,the unfortunate reality is that we all need income to survive and unfortunately i cant give you a solution for that problem however there are some things that you can do right now  the first thing you need to look into are worker coops basically the workers own the business and get to vote on important matters and the best part is that all those extra profits go right in to your pocket instead of some asshole ceo this way get more influence and agency in the workplace and overall better working conditions you also get better pay for the same work or you can keep your salary the same as in a capitalist business but work less hours if a cooperative is doing very well in terms of revenue there are several options which might be bizarre in a capitalist enterprise option 1 is to raise wages this is always a winner and you cant really go wrong here option 2 would be to keep wages as they are but reduce working hours and hire more people option 3 would be to keep wages the same but lower prices of products and services in either case you are more competitive and a better place to buy from and be employed at if you hate landlords look into housing cooperatives the way you feel about work and jobs is shared by many and they will be willing to start a cooperative with you  the other thins that is super important is mutual aid that is when you work for no pay but you take care of your local community and they take care of you a strong community makes sure everyone has what they need it serves as a safety net so the members of the community can focus on doing more fulfilling things and not worry about basic stuff like food or shelter so if you are unemployed and get bored at home or if you arent and just want to help think about lending a hand to some volunteer groups or homeless shelters if a mutual aid network doesnt exist where you live try starting one of course covid is still a thing so be safe and if you or your family members are high risk just stay home  none of the work you do is worth it if someone dies in the process,l5edyn

262,The Way Out Of This Mess: Prologue,the way out of this mess is an antiwork postcapitalist manifesto outlining in detail an automated society which provides for all it is based on marxism anarchism and inspired by jacque fresco bjarke ingels paolo soleri and many more but it is written to attract moderate americans would love to have somebody else read it and give me feedback  medium httpsmediumcomthewayoutofthismesshttpsmediumcomthewayoutofthismess  prologue  people were fucked i mean like reeeaaaally fucked im writing this at the tail end of 2020 we are in the midst of a global pandemic due to which many people have restricted their lives leading to a 7 drop in carbon emissions  in spite of all this 2020 is shaping up to be if not the top at least in the top 3 warmest years on record climate change isnt coming its here  its not just the climate though income inequality is the highest its been in 50 years political polarization is at levels not seen since the last civil war which is keeping us from foreseeing the upcoming thucydides trap and employment crisis due to automation human civilization is rushing headlong into a cyberpunk dystopia  if we dont do something and fast then we can kiss this long peace goodbye now im not the only one to think this even mainstream news outlets have caught on that the jig is coming to an end plenty of people are looking to solve our current problems through ideological means the revitalized american left seems mainly to think that through electoralism they can shift american policy enough to avoid the impending climate catastrophe to put that in perspective the ipcc says that to mitigate the worst effect of climate change on human society we should limit warming to 15 above preindustrial levels that is not to avoid climate change thats just to mitigate the worst effects 2016 was 11 above preindustrial levels the wmo says that we will hit 15 above preindustrial levels by 2024 to be honest given the current geopolitical situation we can kiss our nice stable climate goodbye that doesnt mean that theres no hope it just means we have to switch the current paradigm of thinking around climate change  the current idea is that we will get all the nations on earth to drastically reduce their co emissions and keep them down not only does this require levels of global cooperation never before seen but it also disproportionately benefits rich countries who have the money to transition to cleaner fuels thats just for the climate issue instead of relying on a moonshot that the world is consistently making more and more infeasible i propose a different approach instead of waiting for governments to change i propose we change instead of hoping that the climate doesnt change i propose we change so that it doesnt matter if were are not only going to survive but thrive in the next 50 years then we need to with intention plan out a route from our current catastrophe through sustainability the lands us in a promising future  we can create a better society we have to create a better society one that can stand up to the problems of climate change and wealth inequality and finally secure a basic livelihood for all to do this we need to realize that there are two major fronts that demand attention and intention that being the technical issues of how to build a climate changeresistant sustainable society and the epistemological how to organize that society sustainable equitably and such that it doesnt collapse now this book is strictly meant to deal with the technological side of this issue though if you subscribe to certain sociological theories then the technological mode of production implies a certain sociological structure  this book is more of an introduction to the types of solutions we could apply to the problem of work and nonsustainable production i have limited my scope to make the task manageable however this means that not everyone can partake in the society that i am laying out i dont take this to mean that there is not a sustainable solution for all it just means that i cannot as an individual find it i propose that the approach i take in this book can be applied by others to their own circumstances to produce similar results  resources full bibliography in final book,l6dv8i

309,am i crazy for having bad work anxiety?,over the past few years ive had a few jobs 3 that ive quit because it came to a point where i was experiencing extreme anxiety abt having to go in its always been bc of coworkers the first job my managers and coworkers were all rlly into drama and apparently didnt like me so they would all talk behind my back and exclude me in everything and everytime i went in i always got told i had to stay late or come in early the next day it got to the point where i just didnt want to go in anymore bc it was so exhausting the second job was also similar i was of a different race as everyone else there so i was talked abt and excluded all the time and it seemed like where my coworkers could do no wrong ie they never got punished for calling out or showing up late i would get a stern talking to if i was even a few minutes late and i had contacted the manager to let them know now the job im in now is very problematic its a gas station truck stop so what did i expect right but im a woman and nasty men come in all the time harassing me ive even had some follow me to my car and shout at me or try to ambush me behind the building once thankfully a manager came out with me and the managers just dont care and wont protect me from them at all by telling them to leave or anything there was also an incident of a guy coming in with obvious head trauma and was bleeding everywhere and i couldnt get the manager to call 911 even after the guy passed out in the subway attached to our gas station on top of that they messed up my paychecks so i only just got my first one 4 weeks in and they keep asking me to come in for more shifts and when i say no they change my schedule to make me work more the gm recently got mad at me bc i switched shifts with a girl even though i told the gm i was before hand and ended up not only yelling at the coworker i changed shifts with but changing both of our shifts so we have to work overtime i just dont know what to do and i have such bad anxiety to go in tmrw but i feel like if i quit another job i just wont get another one since i havent been able to find one in months bc of covid here hence why im even working this job in the first place what do i do do i quit this job and just hope i get another or just buckle down and try to get through it until an opportunity arises,l4i232

317,A letter to myself - Why must you try so hard?,i was trying to study my homework for my college class but i kept thinking about the naive and young new college grad im training at my job i kept thinking of all the things id tell not just her but a younger less experienced me  for context the industry i currently work in is highly conservative and the workers of this industry view themselves as extensions of law enforcement eww i have also worked the normal shitty foodretail jobs and generally approach tasks with a perfectionist and caring attitude in spite of knowing it leaves me vulnerable to increased exploitation i just cant help it   approach to handling corrections from management  it is middle managements job to find problems and fix them if there arent any problems to fix then upper management might think middle management is not needed  thus if everything is going smoothly middle management changes either the pace of work faster or the amount of work higher and see if you can handle the new requirements under pressure these new job requirements do not require an increase in pay as they fall under the catchall clause of other duties as assigned a clause that is in virtually all job descriptions and contracts another technique is to point out the 1 of things you got wrong the more detailed your work tasks are the greater the opportunity for error and correction  so it follows that while it is admirable and of strong character to try to do the best job you can at least in my view in a perfect world people would endeavor to take care of each other and their environments in a thoughtful and thorough manner you can never do things perfectly not just due to minor human errors but for the fact that management needs to find flaws in order to maintain their station status and the larger social hierarchy by putting you in your place workers put in the most effort when they feel easily replaceable disposable workers who are not as assured and confident of a stable place within the company will be more obedient less challenging to the established norms and conventions   this is especially true in industries and particular companies that by their nature the importance of risk management business expense reduction and the maximization of profit and their organizational structure banks for example make money on large loans not deposit accounts  checkingsavingscds especially not personal deposit accounts for which the bank must pay interest this drives salesfocused service tend toward a conservative culture  the ladder to the top of the corporate pyramid is built of coworkers heads  ampx200b  i appreciate constructive criticism of either the writing or content i know a lot of this has already been said and i would like to read more theory but am not quite there yet,l486cm

361,"People no longer marry other people, they marry the corporation they work for",it hit me recently how personal relationships are now like an afterthought its peoples job that comes first   even married couples seem to put more emphasis on their jobs than on their relationship even more scary is how there would probably be no relationship without the jobs as though a relationship were some hidden perk of working  like my neighbors the husbanddad lives 1000 miles away so he can work every five weeks he visits the family for a week and then back he goes and nobody seems to see a problem with this in fact they see it as quite heroic but this man is not married to his wife hes married to his company since that is where his heart is the majority of the time  ive also seem the rise of the single person living in a bland cookie cutter apartment living with a cat or a dog going to some soulless job that they are married to many in their 30s and 40s the job is their spouse their coworkers their extended family none of these people profess to be happy many are lonely depressed and neurotic  people in the past worked hard but their relationships were more important to them now work comes first and they submit to work the way a fearful person submits to an abusive spouse  i just dont see how people can go on like this we are not meant to live like this society can only continue to deteriorate,l321g8

368,My anti-work “solution”,for years i perused this sub at my office job obsessing about quitting and all the ideas we talk about here  like many i started to think that id rather die than live the miserable work loop  the entertainment industry is so exploitive that i was being watched like a hawk by managers having timed bathroom breaks if you were in the bathroom more than 5 mins youd get reprimanded and other constant belittlement by the company  i was beyond burned out  in summer 2019 i finally cracked and chose to quit my job without any prospects of getting a different one  it was incredibly reckless from a normal persons perspective but to me it was simply the tipping point  with only a couple thousand saved up i realized i had to relocate out of the insanely expensive los angeles where i had been living in the past decade  i moved 2000 miles to a state with a much lower cost of living  i have a creative profession where essentially i am paid to create artistic products  shortly after moving to my new city i picked up a remote job at a company and i have been taking full advantage wherever i can  basically the company has no idea that what i produce for them in a work week actually only takes me something like 10 hours of committed work  but they absolutely adore my work and couldnt be happier with me at the company  they think im a superstar  they believe im working my ass off but since the job is remote theres no way for them to know what im really doing all day  im just astounded at this enormous change in my life from absolute misery to being loved for my talents  this i think is further proof of how bullshit office culture is  its the product that matters not the means to get there  if i can produce something that a company finds extremely valuable in just a few hours then shouldnt that be all that matters  if they want to believe it took me 40 hours then fine but this proves to me that what i do has always been very valuable  so fuck my old employers fuck office culture and i thank my past self for having the balls to give it all up  risks can pay off,l4c5ad

401,"I feel like the lottery is my only chance at life now, but the odds are discouraging me. I don’t care about “long-term” investments that might make me comfortable when I’m OLD. I’m 25, not sure I’ll even be around next year.",i am a 25 year old male virgin ive never even had a girlfriend this is now worsened odds of it happening anytime in the near future by the fact that ive struggled with basic retail jobs and now been working in a grocery store as a goddamn bagger for the past 2 years   barely 10 an hour abused by customers threatened and humiliated by supervisorsmanagement ive been accused of slacking even after honestly being really productive all day id quit and walk out if i didnt feel suicide is my next option  theyre talking about firing people for not being friendly enough to customers and for the past week ive started going by their script making sure to properly greet customers the word by word way immediately after the cashier right in front of me just did   i get scolded by one of the supervisors for not shouting hello as soon as the customer walks up to the lane to checkout even though a store manager actually told me to wait until the customer has gotten up closer to me so they can actually hear me through the masks common sense   but it doesnt matter i can be on a perfect streak and then that supervisor points their goddamn finger at me and whispers make sure youre speaking to our customers i just want to smash something or someone and walk out and never go back  but then it wont be long before my parents are on my ass again for being unemployed and it will likely get to a point of me ending up in me getting arrested i cant deal with society i cant deal with the system i cant even socialize very well its definitely hell being required to socialize as part of a job  i failed my fucking driving test i still feel overwhelmed at getting back on the road i just started community college but havent been in a year after my first semester because i tried to let covid pass covid doesnt just pass apparently and im not even super sure what im doing there  im an antinatalist thanks to my miserable childhood and familys traditional and fucking religious and conservative views making me hate life and definitely religion even more  im against bringing a child into their world against their will and thats kind of how it works even if i have a woman who wants to procreate with me i can not it goes against my selfmorals now i wouldnt be a healthy parental figure anyway and thats kind of mg whole point in assigning a negative value to birth   but i wouldnt even be here if my parents didnt procreate me i know i kind of wish they didnt  i sure as hell refuse to accept my assigned gender role i identify as male not never cared for a lot of traditional male interests i am attracted to women never got any real attention from the opposite sex but thats another problem and not what this post is about   i dont really care to be a productive member of society at least not as much as living the way that makes me happy which requires being a productive member of society because thats how you afford to live many jobs pay less than a living wage like my current and past ones  my dad has always been a hardworking but also a real cheapass he thinks hes been living the way an adult is supposed to but where has it gotten him yes the alcohol is why you got divorced and we live away from you but if youre so good at working hard and saving money why do you still live in a house thats physically falling apart in the middle of nowhere you talk about wanting to do more but apparently you have to keep doing what youre doing because i guess its just the right thing to do where has your responsibility gotten you in life doesnt seem like it paid off but hey at least you can blame the alcohol on your misery now right  and my mom thinks shes doing the right thing working a fulltime service job making maybe even less than me but its ok because step dad pays for all of the big bills never mind his constant rage and threatening of divorce god wanted it to be so the man provides not sure where that leaves single women but  i dont want to be dependent on anyone else relying on remaining employed under someone else is bad enough  im losing my parents health insurance in a year my ssri and other medications will cost hundreds a month out of pocket ssri withdraw is the worst just google pssd and dyskinesia  i need to just grow the fuck up and pick myself up by the bootstraps although i just lack a lot of apparently basic skills and experience in life   and the way i feel working for a living serves no purpose when i dont even want to be alive  oh but i can pay taxes to help the poor nope the us government doesnt do that probably just goes into rich politicians pockets  i cant believe that the lottery seems to be my only chance at life now  but ive already missed so much of my life idgaf about 401k or whatever slow longterm investments to have a little social security or retirement when im old  i dont even want to live any longer now and even if i do ive already missed out on my entire youth idgaf about my oldass   thats why quick turnaround money is important to me but unfortunately becoming rich overnight is extremely random luck based  i dont know what the fuck to do,l376iz
402,Free land minimum,nobody ever brings this up so think about it back in the day people could be hunters gatherers and farmers theyd put there house somewhere and everything was rantiwork friendly then one day kings and queens said the farmer who only has food for his family had to offer more to them that they didnt have god only knows what they did to the family that didnt pay the forced taxes and thats where we lost our right to land nobody ever says we need a right to land and if someone does the other people argue people would just claim huge tracts of land but were civilized and thankfully i dont think like a wild animal so i thought of the free land minimum a minimum square footage for every adult that can be zoned a minimum because overpopulation is a serious problem even if we are fine now and if you want a lot of land you should pay because we have limited space until space travel is perfected homeless people would have somewhere to go the only work people would have to do is grow their own food and work to build a fee less shelter and people could pursue dreams like arts athletics or learning skills instead of wasting most their life doing useless tasks they could do something good for human evolution please advocate for this because people arent and its disgusting our greater grandparents had this right so what would they think if we didnt fight for it,l1do1c

437,Hard worker vs smart worker....,my dad is a hard worker he always put the company first and worked his way to management at every company he worked for he did the weekends and 60 hour weeks he is older now his hair has turned white hes back to being a cashier he needs back surgery from lifting boxes and heavy objects at a grocery store my uncle ran a nonprofit through this time period hes written for fox news and major networks he was a bad student and lied his way into a masters program and a phd he even received a scholarship for being a white male christian he argued he was a minority and received funding for college he has traveled the entire world and was paid to do it he slept with his secretary and lost his job temporarily then he said he was sorry and received his job back he bought houses tax free in france and italy start lying more often the truth will keep you poor and it will break you the system in america rewards the narcissist my uncle has a lot of money and kept his wife after cheating no one cares if youre a good and hard working person be smart be unethical and keep doing it if you want to make it in america my uncle has received jobs hes not qualified for and has had a better life by just lying use this on your next interview be confident and lie with confidence if you need to,l1rswi

443,Employers need to understand that it's the workers doing the work. The work is what generates the money.,a whole lot more respect and fairness needs to come from employers toward their employees  there are extremely few businesses that would produce much of anything at all without the people to do it  this is why every single business needs to appreciate their employees contribution  if they dont they need to cut the position or change the employee  treatment of workers needs to change as does the selection processes,l1y8pd

450,No raise this year despite double the work,my job sent out an email saying no one will get raises this year citing covid as the reason even though it doesnt seem like it has had any real effect on their business its a mental health facility and we switched to telehealth when the pandemic started were getting more patients than ever because they can log in from anywhere im doing double the work that i was last year at this time its just so demoralizing to have your salary not keep up with inflation i feel like every year i have to figure out how to live on a little less than the year before im tempted to quit because im pissed but i know realistically that would just put me in a worse situation there arent many good paying jobs out there in my field im really stuck with them so they can pretty much do whatever they want with me its a shitty feeling,l1q3sw

452,Do I hate nursing or just working in general?,when i first failed a nursing class my teacher asked me why i went into nursing as an immigrant my immediate thought was to help my family out of poverty she said that that was not a valid reason to go into nursing and that i should be going into it because i wanted to care for people yes i do care for people but i care about myself and family more why is it wrong to want to improve your economic level  fast forward to now ive been a nurse for almost 2 years and cant seem to be satisfied with any workplace that i go top  i love caring for patients and their families but every nursing job ive had is always short on staff every single fucking one they always ask oh can you please stay were rly short plz and so tons of us would feel guilty so we end up staying for a whole ass 16 hours and then go to work the next day with less than 5 hrs of sleep also missing your 15 min30 min breaks is the norm lots of times im charting or doing paperwork during my break even though im clocked out for lunch because our supervisor gets mad at us for missing our lunches how could they get mad at us for missing lunches when they dont even give us the fucking support that we need and dont even get me started how it was like working in a nursing home all i can say is that dont end up in one if you can avoid it,l2ajyq
453,They are literally kicking me out of my office. And they have no where to put me.,i work in the legal industry for a good sized firm today the office manager came in to my office and told me that they need my office for a new employee they are hiring a new hr drone the kicker they dont have anywhere to put me because the ownermanaging partner of the firm is richer than croesus but wont spring more money to purchaserent a larger building so the office manager in all her disorganized glory is presenting options to my superior  1 have me share an office with the chief operating officer 2 have me work from home  honestly 2 would be the better solution but of course they wont provide any computer or supplies for my home office if that were to be the case  this is pretty dystopian im so fucking tired of this place,l1hqev
454,Very close to giving up on my art.,i have no time for anything outside of work and when i do have a day off i work retail so weekends dont exist im so tired i cant do anything anyway or i have to spend it with family or friends spending time with other people is starting to feel like a chore thats keeping me from writing i know thats super conceited but i guess im a conceited person  i have all these novel ideas in my head but i selfreject all of them because since i cant write them down or really take the time to develop them i find flaws in them and give up i have a few stories that are developed well enough that they werent killed in the nest but working on them is a distant dream   i work 30 hours but consistently under 40 so they dont have to give me benefits so theoretically i do have the time in fact i have more time than most people and its killing me that i cant use it i feel like i should be able to   i guess part of the problem is i spend so much time on social media but if i dont have the time to work on my novel anyway then i cant really get involved in something that demands uninterrupted hours of my time which most of my hobbies do  im starting to feel like its pointless but the thought of giving up my art makes me want to kill myself because it would basically be the same thing im completely at a loss,l1ca4j
455,Narcissicsm rises to the top,i was ambitious in my early 20s climbed the stupid ladder and as i did encountered more and more narcissists they seem to gravitate toward positions of power the higher i went the more narcissism i encountered i want to climb back down the ladder but prospective jobs are dubious about that decision why on earth would anyone want to earn less money surely youll want to find a better paying job as soon as you start working here id gladly take a 20 pay cut to not be bullied anymore,l1cfr4

457,I hope my boss likes the new asshole I tore her,so i work at a certain three lettered pharmacy and as you can imagine because of covid the workload has increased massively we have 7 techs who share responsibilities in the pharmacy     of the 7 techs 4 are vets and 3 of us are new all been there less than 2 years so not really newnew     once covid started we started doing covid tests for those who dont know covid testing basically requires a dedicated tech for the entire day and its extremely boring so were basically down a leg at any given time and also our pharmacy is located right in the ghetto and accepts medicaid and its the only pharmacy in the area that accepts medicaid so we process an immense amount of prescriptions average of probably 500600 per day our customers are extremely entitled and demanding despite the fact that theyre paying nothing      and my pharmacy manager decides to put up four techs for full time covid vaccinations so now we only have three techs right before committing the techs she gave me a piece of paper to sign asking how many extra hours i was willing to work and requesting that i work overtime i told her no and checked 0 extra hours on the paper      she went and scheduled me for 2 straight weeks of overtime with no days off which i stupidly worked without complaining so she went and did it again      two nights ago she demanded a girl come in to work while sick and the girl caved she ended up getting me sick and that was the final straw   ampx200b  i showed up to work in person to let her know that i wont be coming in for the next 2 days demanded a raise and told her if she ever fucking schedules me for more than 30 hours without asking me first i fucking quit      i have enough money to last me 7 months of mortgage and i just got my stimulus check i can very easily find a new job but me dropping right now will fuck up her schedule        just something to throw in  shes moving to another state on the other side of the country in 2 months so shes been working us extra hard because shes trying to get bonuses before she leaves but at the cost of hurting us workers i have a son who i never get to see and one of the new girls has elderly family members that need her the other one has school and she hasnt even had time to start her new classes because the fucking cunt pharmacy manager has no heart,l1s4gg
458,The Burnout Society by the philosopher Byung Chul Han,full article here linkhttpspsychologyspotcomtheburnoutsociety  han points out thatthe society of the 21st century is no longer disciplinary but a society of the performancenor are its inhabitants called subjects of obedience but subjects of performance these subjects are entrepreneurs of themselves  this change which apparently empowers and is liberating actually becomes a boomerang that soon beats us with all its strength because it hides a great psychological risk of which we are not aware  the violence of the society over its members has not disappeared but has been camouflaged and is now based on the selfexploitation of the subject this is much more effective than the exploitation by the others because it is accompanied by a feeling of freedom the exploiter is the same exploited victim and executioner can no longer differentiate this selfreferentiality generates a paradoxical freedom which because of the structures of obligation immanent to it becomes violence  in this society of obligation each one carries with him his forced labor field  basically our society would be the evolution of the disciplinary and controlling societies of the past but in reality it does not imply more freedom but continues to exert its power over each person through the introjection of the duty this situation turns us into slaves of overproduction superperformance work play and sex or supercommunication  the most emblematic example of the problems caused by this social pressure for performance is depression this philosopher thinks thatin reality what sickens is not the excess of responsibility and initiative but the imperative of performance as the new mandate of the late modern labor society  the depressive man is that working animal that exploits itself that is voluntarily without external coercion he is at the same time executioner and victim the depression is unleashed at the moment in which the subject of performance can no longer do anything  the depressed is tired of the effort to become himself  the problem is thatthe i cant do it anymore leads to a destructive selfreproach and selfaggressionwhen we realize that we can not achieve everything we wanted to do we feel frustrated but we do not think that society has deceived us but we selfreproach feeling that we are incapable,l2nkvq

464,Why I support women being housewives and homemakers,after reading all these posts i have to agree working 5 days a week week after week sucks  so this makes me like the idea of what the older generation did which was that the men slaved away at the job and women didnt have to work but just took care of the house took care of the kids focused on hobbies making themselves pretty socializing travelling  so one gender had to deal with the harshness of work accepted it and embraced it but the other got to enjoy life and focus on higher pursuits and retain that innocence kinda and ideally a mans wife helped him relieve stress from the harshness of work  i am not advocating for controlling women but for doing this on a voluntary basis  like for myself when i had a girlfriend in the past i remember that her beauty love  support etc really helped me to push harder at work and i would gladly if i had the money let my girlfriend or wife renounce work or work less hours or work at something she is more passionate about that makes less money  the way it is now both genders everybody has to deal with the harshness of work but if only one gender had to deal with that and the other didnt im sure the world would take a step towards being a happier place  please ask questions if i said something that seems off or doesnt make sense  in the older generation there was a lot of male abuse of women that is unfortunate and not ok  edit sorry i thought this was the sub rantiwork,l253qq

505,"People need to change the attitude that exists about work, particularly in the Western mind. Meditation should be part of the work, not separate from it.",people need to change the attitude that exists about work particularly in the western mind meditation should be part of the work not separate from it  work and relaxation are not contradictory in fact the more you put yourself into work the deeper you can go into relaxation so both are important the harder you work the deeper you can relax work is valuable it will bring humbleness and silence people should feel that their work is something very special and that whatever work they do is respectable  the emphasis should be on fulltime work 6 hours a day is perfectly okay work is part of the whole program  when you work work as if it were a group therapy call it work meditation if you really want to meditate and get into yourself at least 6 hours work is a necessity  is part of the whole change in your energy it is scientific for 6 hours you should forget everything else  forget the whole world forget your problems  whatever work it is be total in it then something is possibleosho   insomnia is not a disease insomnia is a certain way of life  man is made by nature to work hard for at least eight hours unless he works hard for eight hours he does not earn the right to have a deep sleep and as a society grows richer people are not working hard there is no need others can work for them the whole day they are doing small things which they enjoy doing but it is not hard work like that of a stonecutter or a woodcutter the body is made so that after eight hours of hard work it naturally needs to fall into sleep to rejuvenate its energy but it seems difficultyou have earned enough money and still you are chopping wood for eight hours then for what have you earned all that money it seems stupid you could have chopped wood even without becoming a millionaire so if fifty million people in america are suffering from insomnia that simply means these are the people who are not earning the right to sleep they are not working to create the situation in which sleep happens,l1egei

529,An interesting story about work and priorities...,i was recently reading phillip shorts biography of pol pot   hold your horses now this isnt some diatribe about bringing back a khmer rouge year zero style revolution  lots of the book examines khmercambodian society and howwhy it works the way it does  the great angkor civilisation builders of angkor wat were so successful because they used irrigation to grow rice 34 times a year rather than being locked into one seasonal harvest the 20th century cambodians pre khmer rouge revolution had regressed to just once per year leading colonists to deride them as lazy  a famous phrase went the vietnamese grow the rice the cambodians watch it grow the laotians listen to it grow  so onto our main story an american entrepreneur visited cambodia post overthrow of pol pot to teach farming techniques to farmers who were still using quite medieval methods right until the 80s90s using machinery fertilizer and pesticides they were able to double their rice yields lets say from 40 tonnes to 80 tonnes the khmers were ecstatic   2 years later the american entrepreneur returned to find the farmers were continuing you use his methods however they were now only working half as much land as they had before hed instructed them they had chosen to use the gift of efficiency to cut their work by 50 continuing to grow 40 tonnes of rice whilst only working half the land  short the writer tells this story as a sort of gotcha moment to illustrate that this society is in fact more concerned with leisure than work although he does concede that its also due to essentially people being happy with what they have and what they need rather than striving for more and more  i think the story has some pretty big lessons for us too over the last 3040 years weve developed incredible technologies that have cut the time it takes to do things in half or more and yet we continue to work or be forced to work a 95pm schedule if not more working hours are going up rather than down clearly we are doing more workachieving moreproducing more  yet we are not earning doubletriple what we were in the past in fact weve gone from a scenario where one breadwinner was able to provide for a family with children on a sole income to working couples struggling to combine their incomes to cover the bare essentials while home ownership and having children remain a distant dream or a seriously stress inducing risk   tldr  cambodian farmers worked out a way to do half as much work while producing an equal quantity of product giving them more leisure and the same amount of wealth our society demands that we work more produce more while rewarding us with less and tying our happiness to greed,l2fqsx

545,Once got an improvement period for calling off..,figured you guys would like this story  once upon a time i was a prison guard worked ungodly hours with the threat of violence for 10usdhr  shifts were 77 but with oncoming shifts role call and things like that you didnt get relieved until 730 at the earliest some days relief didnt come at all and you would get yelled at if you called someone in charge to ask what was going on they were allowed to mandatorily keep you until 11 for any reason   needless to say in these conditions we were always short staffed so at one point for a few months we were working sometimes 7 days per week often 16 hour days during this time i called off several times just because i needed the rest 8 hours between shifts is rough when you consider your drive home trying to eat sleep get ready for work then drive back all within 8 hours  my annual performance evaluation was coming up around this time and they told me i was calling off too often and put me on an improvement period any call offs during the 6 month period would result in a write up   i immediately began looking for a new job and found one in a similar field but with much better quality of life worked alone evenings free cell phone car and gas card etc even beat some of my supervisors for the position the day i got the job i called in to work sick really because i left after a 14 hour shift had to go shower and dress up for the interview then drive an hour to get to it my captain warned me that i wasnt allowed any call offs for 6 months so i informed him i wouldnt be coming back at all,kzydz8

557,Ramblings of a disgruntled night shift factory slave,this is mostly a rant and the only way i could truly vent this because i could never express this to coworkers  glad i found this sub  for a good portion of my life i could never really find the words to describe how i felt about work i never vehemently opposed it but i hate the mundane nature of most jobs whether it was working at a pizza place and being slaved by corporate policies or working in a small business and being exploited there i could never truly find a job where i felt like i wasnt some mindless simian performing a task that could be done by anyone with basic motor functions  i had just graduated from uni thankfully it allowed me to avoid working anything full time or long term however now that im not doing anything and looking for an actual career i took it upon myself to make fast cash in a local factory i wont mention the name of corporation i serve but theyre a well known decoration chain in the us and canada   my dad had asked me if i could handle nightshift for those wondering he worked in a factory for most of his life because he grew up fairly poor and didnt have a choice i told him it cant be that bad right  i could not have been more wrong in my presumptions about this job i signed as a regular warehouse associate ie slave that can get moved around anytime any day i work 11pm7am every day except saturday we get 1 10 minute break then a 20 minute break throughout the 8 hr shift but we often work mandatory ot every other week we only get an extra 10 minute break for getting to work at 9pm  the job is physically grueling the one shift supervisor saw me on my first day and moved me from a relatively decent spot sorting boxes to manually loading an avg of 1000 box orders into a truck so i stand in a fairly dark box in 15 degree weather for 8 hours every night ive seen about 10 people come and go since i arrived about a month ago and thats just in my department the people i work with are all older men who have been reduced to limps no seriously all of them are limping and look visibly in pain during our shifts they have cameras in front of every truck dock to nonstop monitor us so if we sit down or go on our phone theyll send an underling to yell at us for not working   i do the bare minimum i function on a workflow of 50 efficiency nonstop its mundane to work overly hard because they carefully made it so that boxes come down in certain intervals so you basically work until the final minute of the shift apparently coworkers snitch on eachother all of the time for phones falsely believing theyll get some sort of handout or pat on the back by higher ups for rating out your coworker the coaches and supervisors constantly preach about being a team and helping eachother yet everyone is so cynical they wont help eachother out regardless of if were busy or not  i dont exactly subscribe to the communist and capitalist bashing thats prevalent in this sub i get it though the whole worker being exploited thing i see higher ups who literally sit in their office playing youtube videos and having a ball of a shift meanwhile im over here trying not to get hypothermia at 4am im only at this job to save up enough money to last me into the summer so that i can find a decent non physically demanding job and move out of this god forsaken town   does anyone know how to make the time go by faster i feel like my days just sorta blend together now that i have no inherent free time for myself cause i have to catch up on sleep otherwise ill be a zombie for the next shift its really soul crushing im not sure how people do this for years on end i hate it,l02f6m

577,My job at Pizza Hut was living hell.,i feel like theres nowhere else i could post this without people thinking that i was exaggerating over a year after leaving this company and i still struggle with learned anxiety that has never left my body   the worst part of my job was that i never got to leave on time my shift was usually about 8 am to 4 pm but we had a list of prep every morning that we had to do id make the doughs sauce them and cheese them usually about 2040 in every size and style so most mornings about 120200 pizzas and yes i have pictures of my prep lists left to me but i had to cook those pizzas if anyone ordered them and so after lunch rush i essentially would have to remake the prep from scratch alone as the only cook every day i was stressed out to no end just trying to get it done  because i knew the managers wouldnt let me go home if i didnt  and usually even if i did if we got busy or if the person after my shift didnt come in he was a teenager so he missed often they also would refuse to allow me to clock out and then as the cook id have to stay for the full dinner shift until it calmed down completely at around 78 pm but some nights they forced me to stay until closing said i couldnt leave until the store was cleaned up and everything was packed so every day around 4 pm i would feel the most tremendous anxiety because either i got to go home or i might not for hours upon hours  this also got in the way of my dates with my girlfriend i remember getting yelled at for having to call her because they refused to let me clock out i realize that this is completely illegal yes but if i had said no they would have fired me and to put this kindly at the time i was eating out of the trash me and another coworker waiter would split untouched leftover slices people left on their table or wed salvage a burnt pizza later after throwing it away in a cardboard box in front of the boss  theres more too if youre willing to hear it the main manager that i worked under was an extremely loud ridiculously aggressive woman who scared the absolute shit out of me a 17 year old she would brag about how her son threatened to call child control on her and say in regards to it i laughed in his face and told him to go ahead see if hell have anywhere to live i feel like she couldnt talk to anyone without screaming at them and it terrified me so badly that id freeze up she thought that was even more funny and so shed wait for me to do things like walk inside and would scream at me about how i was in trouble and then laugh when i got scared and flustered   and she was mean to me in other ways too shed shove her crotch in my face when i ever leaned down to take ingredients out of the fridge below the make table   there were some saving graces occasionally we would get a waiter that id become friends with or a particularly motherly female employee that would step between me and that manager but these were good people so within weeks or months theyd have quit to find better jobs  i described in some comment on here that i felt like i had lowgrade ptsd from working it seems fucked up to say that when its a real disorder but ive never been the same since working there having people raise their voice at me or indications that i might leave somewhere late cause me such deep panic that they scramble me up really bad  and i do feel like this is stupid and pathetic and i dont know why im putting it on the internet but i feel like you guys would understand when my parents put pressure on me that im lazy and need to find a job that they dont understand it but my head rationalizes it as them wanting me to go through all of those bad things again   as a cook i made no tips i would be asked to come in early some mornings to cook ten or fifteen or twenty pizzas for a school or a local car dealership they always worked me as an only cook so id make the pizzas with dough i prepared cook them through the oven cut them and box them myself and then the manager would get a big 20 tip for it by the company that i couldnt have any of  i couldnt go to my boss either our strongest pizza hut managee was the area coach but he despised me he accused me of being a pothead even though i was arguably the only one of the entire staff who didnt smoke weed and threw similar insults at me and i feel like i was a worthless piece of shit sometimes too because everytime he was near us i would hide or change stations or do anything to get away from him,l0ea6n

602,Company starting new policy punishing employees for situations outside of our control LONG RANT,i work for a huge multinational company in the uk who sent the work force to work from home since march in the surveys that theyve sent out the majority of the people had a very positive response  since then the offices have slowly and partially reopened now with the people that cantdont want to wfh working from the office currently at less than 5 capacity  of course with working from home there are some additional problems that can arise internet and electricity issues may not be common but with several thousands of employees it wouldnt be weird that it happens  however they will now roll out a new policy where any downtime will be taken out of your pay or you will need to use pto their reasoning for this was that there are apparently people who havent worked at all since march and its losing the company a lot of money  now the obvious question is why they wouldnt just do something about the people not working instead   but the worst part is that they brought up an example where the city was doing maintenance on the fibre of her street and knocked out the internet of the whole street for 2 days it couldve been the isp or whatever but the point still stands a situation completely out of your control just caused you to lose 2 days pay and you cant just drop into the office as that needs to be planned 7 days in advance  the even more interesting thing is that we have paid sick days so if you get a power outage the most financially wise decision is to call in sick   they did however say that in extraordinary circumstances there may be exceptions the example given was if there was a city wide power outage  now this may be understandable if internetpower issues were common i can of course only speak of my team but i dont think anyone in my team in the past 9 months have had issues more than once  sorry for the long rant i just had to get it off my chest,l03g2g

613,I got fired today for standing up for my morals and code of ethics. Fuck employers.,im a barber and this pandemic has been fucking awful for me ive lost 70 of my clientele and new clients have been really hard to build i worked at a shop that was recently bought by a new owner and i started after they opened under the new name our cuts are 25 across the board but i have had some clients come to me that either have a very simple haircut that takes less than 10 minutes or are elderly and on social securityolder vets that barely have income i have 34 clients that i charge less than 25 everyone else is 25   so now boss wants to raise the prices to 30 across the board im not comfortable with that and i say so i tell him that most of my clients are able to pay 30 and will do so gladly but a very select few cannot pay that or shouldnt a cut on a 3 year old that takes me 15 minutes isnt worth 30 and that is unethical in my opinion boss starts going off on me about discounting and making our shop seem cheap no man i just have empathy and actually care about my clients one of the discount clients is a developmentally disabled man thats living off of disability checks and lives with his elderly parents hes basically bald and does one guard size all over and doesnt even let me shave his neck 59 minutes in and out i charge him 15 somehow that is worth 30 in my boss eyes   today he called me and told me that i wasnt pulling in enough money for them and that their business ideals arent congruent with mine i know ive struggled to build a clientele but ive brought in a couple dozen brand new clients in addition to the 40 that followed me ive had clients switch from their barber at that shop to me because im a way better barber honestly top 2 working there and i clean the shop for free did i mention that im an independent contractor and i dont get paid unless im doing a haircut fucking garbage ive done so much unpaid labor for these people and they just fucking fire me because im not pulling in enough money during a fucking pandemic   they immediately signed me out of our booking service that has all of my clients names and numbers i have the vast majority saved to my phone thank god and changed the lock code on the door ive never proven myself untrustworthy and they immediately start treating me like a fucking criminal all of this after we just have to work together to get through this if we all stay the course and wait it out itll be worth it this is such a good lesson im never trusting a single employer again every job ive left is because of a terrible fucking boss ive also never ever been fired in 7 years of working i feel like fucking trash and like i got taken advantage of so hard im humiliated and ive been anxious and nauseated all day if you read this far thank you im gonna be doing everything in my power after this to get myself set up truly independently so that i dont have to rely on greedy fucking assholes,l0ak7a

626,Anybody else think eLearnings are extremely pointless?,i always found it ridiculous how much time and how many resources employers waste on these theyre unnecessarily long tedious the majority of them are designed like shit and the content is either dry as hell or cringe  every employee skips through them as fast as possible and even actual managers and supervisors dont give a shit if youre actually paying attention to them yet for whatever reason corporate really wants you to do them  i shudder to think of how much time is wasted by having employees watch a computer and click through a module for 2 hours rather than i dont know having them learn the job practically with their manager  i guess they bother me so much because theyre the embodiment of corporate culture lifeless dull pointless and seems to be there just to be there,l0csr9
627,Working in finance has made me anti-work,all day i sit here and move millions of dollars around and it means nothing its just numbers on a screen that dont represent anything real  they arent the measure of someones actual value in society or what they contribute my job is literally to facilitate other people making money and i dont get any extra benefit from it id quit and go live in the woods if i could   its bullshit that a persons worth is determined by their wealth,l0s2e7
628,"You are a number, you are expendable, you are replaceable on this earth. Just be content with what you have in this life and stop chasing the corporate dragon, our time on this earth was not meant for working ourselves to death.",from the uk here but i seriously hate the attitudes of work both here and in the us everyone is so caught up about their high and mighty status in their jobs and how high they are and all the professor bullshite masters and phd degrees they have recently got news of someone at my age who i knew only 25 died unexpectedly   he had spent all of his life in education getting degrees and phds whilst working a minimum wage desk job in the hopes of promotion never even left the country to go travel or explore never got his own place or anything all because he was too caught up in that corporate death trap its made me so scared because of how much i see others doing exactly what he did in this world   think about it boom you die unexpectedly its all over everything you ever did for your high and mighty job and academics now means entirely nothing just under 24 hours of mourning from those who knew you  then the world just moves on if not sooner your job position is replaced within a matter of minutes all turned to ash   and did you live your life no because you were too busy trying to be better than everyone else and not ever being content with what you had in life and just living you were too busy chasing after a meaningless high paying job that takes many years out of your already short life and for what a bit of praise at those fancy social gatherings you very occasionally have once every few years pfft yeah because that was really worth it   just remember my fellow antiworkers you are replaceable you are expendable you are a number you do not matter to those corporate companies all the degrees in the world which take years of arduous work to complete wont just magically land you a high paying job i see it all too often on reddit in general everyone is going for a masters in this that and the other just for a minor possibility of getting a slightly higher pay check all because they just cannot be content with anything in their life and always chase the corporate dragon without realising their time on this earth is finite   enjoy your life and remember that all the happiness doesnt come from your job status or wealth you may think everyone cares about it but they really dont we live in a selfish world where everyone is always out their to try and be better than you just be happy with what you have and live   peace out,l19u6p
629,Why do people take their work so seriously?,as the title says i never understood why people that earn a barely living wage take their job so seriously no fun while working no music no joking around everyone thinks they are the best at what they do and making themselves something they arent ive experienced this a lot of times where people that earn 16 an hour do more work for the boss than they do for their own life and they think they are some kind of hero at the workplace   outside of people who have very serious jobs where someone can die or if they work as a medic etc i do not see any reason to take shit that seriously,kzxpdl

635,I've recently found job ads even more stupid than usual,first off on linkedin i never see the salary listed anymore this is inarguably the most important part of the job thats why youre doing it yes things like actual work environment and location are important too for job tolerance but you only find out 1 and 2 once you start there should be no interview without the salary first ideally not even an application first but they know people get desperate   secondly i noticed a lot of ads here in the uk list 28 days leave as a benefit i used to get upset thinking its sad i have only 20 days plus 8 bank holidays it finally clicked the 28 days include the bank holidays which for most offices are off anyway cant speak as to retail or anything else so thats not a benefit 28 days are the bare fucking legal minimum why is this listed as a benefit and why is it ok to mislead so people think its 28 days plus bank holidays,l16ri2
636,"This is a rant about my previous employers. It's been over a year since I worked for them, and I still laugh at all their bullshit when I think of it",so i worked as a breakfast line cook at this very prestigious well known 5 star hotel in a nice town in the canadian rockies it was my job to get up at 430 in the morning to make it into work for 5am and work breakfast service the hotel has nearly 800 rooms and in the summer we have almost 100 capacity most days an average room runs for 300400 cad per night just to give you a picture of how much money this place makes anyways for an 800 room hotel the breakfast team consisted of 45 people with a team that small running breakfast for hundredsthousands of people was beyond brutal for my entire 8 hour shift i didnt have time to use the washroom or even time to unscrew the lid on my water bottle and take a sip of water worst of all they wouldnt allow us to work overtime so we had approximately 2 hours after breakfast service to get rid of the breakfast buffet and do all our prep for the next day taking down the buffet took about half an hour so our team of 45 people had 15 hours to cut literal buckets of various fruit and prep anything we were going to be serving the next day this was never enough time so what the sous chef told us to do was clock out then come back and finish up the task every day i would put in at least an hour of unpaid work   6 weeks in i was totally drained and hated going to bed knowing that my 430am alarm would go off just to wake me up for another day in hell one day after we were having a meeting in the dry storage one of my coworkers raised her concern for the fact we do not have time to get anything done and constantly being yelled at did nothing for our productivity and she ended up breaking down in tears in front of our whole crew as she was as stressed as i was the chefs reaction was to say something along the lines of you a phillipa woman you get emotional and dramatic over anything suck it up that comment pushed me over the edge to quit after my shift i talked to my boss and told him im handing in my two weeks my boss not the misogynistic chef but the man overseeing all the food and bev outlets in the hotel asked why and i told him my reasons i told him that i am working far too hard for minimum wage the constant time pressure and being yelled at and called names by my chef was having a negative impact on my mental health this job is not my life nor is it my career and im not willing to sacrifice my health over it he then went on a rant about how my generation has no work ethic that i should be expected to suffer for minimum wage if i ever wanted to be successful and good luck finding a job that pays more than we do 3 days later i found a job that payed 4hour more than they did   i hate that companies suck the souls out of people just to make more money that could have been an amazing job if they just cared for the well being of their employees but i guess making 1 more money per year is more important than peoples lives the priorities of some people are totally fucked how can some people become so detached from reality and consumed by greed ive had good jobs and bad jobs this being the latter but even in a good job i just want out from this rat race im not a lazy person but spending my life making money for someone else and someone else profiting from my labour is not how i want to live,l0bw6a

641,Few thoughts and questions on the responsibilities of the individual in the world.,there is this notion that goes uninterrogated quite often about the purchasing power of the individual somehow being ultimately responsible for finding and funding the solutions to all the macro complex systemic problems of the age all the wrongs in the world at your feet and yours alone  dont like sweatshops then dont buy at hampmdont want battery hens to die in misery then switch to plantbaseddont like your carbon footprint then buy solar panels etc  those things definitely matter they really do that is how cultures change  very slowly and through the habits of discreet individuals  but is the onus really entirely on you to fix the world through your wallet only expressed through thousands of little transactional increments at a time hoping for change  its not the responsibility of the actual people directly manning the levers of industry and government not anyone in positions of authority in a board room or an elected office to just stand up and do their job one day  nope apparently its entirely yours and the only way you can express this is to petition these people with money and prayer like theyre a minor god on the off chance that maybe mcdonalds will start stocking a vegan patty or some paltry shit  so youre the input and if youre strong enough theyre the mechanism for getting you what you want thats how it is does anyone looking around today really truly believe that is what is happening here  this is what billions of people believe they are reduced to and accept does that not frighten you some  that there are dopey fucking people walking around today acting like when they bought the wristband in 2005 they actually made poverty history,l0vo13

649,Lack of appreciation at work / productivity is all that matters.,the company i work at pretty much exclusively cares about productivity and we are project based every single project my manager asks me if i can find ways to raise my productivity or do more in less time bla bla bla  every time i get the usual bullshit remarks like colleague x did it once why cant you or it really isnt that much work just do it and make some overtime    you know what shes right i could do it i could run so fast my legs would outpace my ass and do overtime and be stressed the whole time   its unhealthy though and they dont pay me nearly enough to endure that  i work in a laboratory and one tiny mistake can ruin a whole days work so the more i have to run the more likely im to miss some small detail and that gives me anxiety    im not going to get a goddamn burnout for this shit     especially with our company being way over profit targets all the time   like fuck that shit they make way more profit than they anticipated and theyre still cracking the whip they can go to hell   and when i make extra effort on my own ive made a couple of python scripts that automate parts of the job such as processing data instead of appreciation i get shit for it     i did those things on the easy days where my workload was relatively small     ive happily shared it with my colleagues and shown the managers you know what they told me  where did you find the time to make this why didnt you spend that time on more productivity instead  why didnt you come to me when your planning was finished   and now they think that i have all this extra time on my hands and are demanding even more productivity from me what the hell  and during my evaluation they ignored my extra efforts and went straight for the mistakes i made even showing me a list of aaaall the things i did wrong like forgetting a signature failing to add a couple of reports bla bla bla bla all insignificant paperwork crap that can be solved in 5 minutes     you made too many mistakes so we cannot give you a higher raise this year  im fucking sick of it next time i make something that makes work easier i will keep it to myself and the time it saves me will be my extra break time why would i bust my ass for this fucking crap,l0e2jd
650,I'm tired and feeling pretty depressed,english is not my first language so please bear with me this is my rant because i have no other place to get it off my chest  im from brazil and i didnt know this subreddit until today its good to see that its not only me that think that this work culture and the corporate world sucks so much  im a privileged software developer working 44hweek making 48k reais  year just for comparison a brand new 2020 toyota corolla the cheapest model costs 100k reais i have a masters degree in computer science and many of my friends with the same experience are making much less than me and i cant complain with people around me because im privileged  ive joined my current company in january of the last year ie 1 year working there this is the worst job i ever had during this year the company earned more money than ever increasing revenue by approximately 60 and at the same time 30 of the workers resigned complaining about high pressure and high workload the company started the year with 100 employees today i complained about high pressure and the manager just said to me that they will hire more people and after they do this ill probably stop feeling it the problem is that the first person of these 30 people that resigned complained about it as well so it doesnt matter how many workers there are this high pressure is part of the companys culture one of these people was earning 84k reaisyear and now that he left they are trying to find someone to replace him for 156k reaisyear so they were basically paying him half of what he did to work more than 50 hours per week  before this job ive worked for a company that has almost no pressure and with a better worklife balance but only earning 31k reaisyear some excoworkers said to me that the salary has increased and considering that im fd i thought maybe i could go back there with the same salary im earning now but with less pressure  last month this old employer asked me if i wanted to come back and i said no but now im considering accepting this request ive messaged him today and he asked me how much i was thinking and i said 60kyear but considering that now ive finished my masters degree and have more experience i thought it was fair i also know that my excoworker that doesnt have as much experience as me and doesnt have a masters degree is earning 56k reais there so what he said to me is that he would see the step and the salary that was available and talk to me later but he thought it is a little less than 60kyear  he also said that they are increasing the pace there so the pace is not the same as before i think it will be much better than my current company or maybe its a red flag im just tired of this sh he even said to me that if the company goes well and im being productive i can earn more in the future wtf man this company probably makes more than 50myear in profit  i hate everything about this corporate world you cant be sick cant work less cant have a bad day  cant say anything wrong because your manager could not like  these employers have all the power in their hands and they dont hesitate in using it because they know people need to eat and to pay rent,l0as51

701,A realization that I just had about filling out past salaries on a job application for the chronically underpaid.,a company that your applying to will base their salary offer on what you entered as your previous salary if you worked for years at 20 below market you will likely get an offer that is below market and they will keep you there  do market research on the job title you are applying for have a printout of an average job description and pay scale and compare it to what theyre offering obviously it could be offputting if you get too intense about it but there is no harm in doing research and advocating for yourself  if you are chronically underpaid and you dont feel comfortable advocating for yourself in that way your only option to break out of the cycle of underpayment may be to do the research ahead of time and give them a plausibly inflated rate of pay for your last job its dishonest but you need to break that cycle  i suspect that hiring managers would feel uncomfortable flat out asking a past employer about someones rate of pay unless it seemed suspicious they mostly want to know that you exist and werent a known thief addict sexual predator or psychopath depending on the job  i dont usually advocate for dishonest practices but i know so many people who are underpaid at their job and it makes me so sad,kyr0ww

711,Engagement of BIPOC: is using the term wage slave hurting more then it helps?,my main concern here is how to engage bipoc in the cause not to discredit or minimize the pain and suffering endured by those under in capatilism  i think that by using the term wage slave in present day america it encourages the listenerreader to compare it directly to the atrocities of american chattel slavery and as a result people will want to focus on the differences between the two and take a stance on which iswas worse and this is completely unnecessary and this can even extend to ranking oppression based on race v class encouraging people to take sides and encouraging people to ignore how they are intertwined  and if the comparison is involved but the differences between the two are not dicussed it will only disenfranchise and disengage bipoc   if anything the differences speak more to how american chattel slavery went above and beyond the minimum threshold of what is required for something to be considered slavery it reached into genocide eugenics forced medical expermination physical torture rape stealing children and the dehumanization of people into literal animals  i understand that some of these things happen under modernday wage slavery but its akin the difference between coercion and duress abuse and neglect firstdegree and seconddegree murder theyre both awful and often the results are the same but they are different and there is no need to compare the two when each are individually reprehensible on their own merits  but when it comes down to it wouldnt the cause benefit from speaking in language that seeks to engage and reach out to bipoc any thoughts,kyh5ev

717,Giant Space Rocks,interstellar objects pass freely through a star system  what should be done  developing a system to protect a planet from a collision should be the top priority for any civilization this planetary protection system would require both detection and defensive capabilities in order to be effective  once a civilization has developed their planetary protection system pursuing other goals becomes practical and desirable such as space exploration the search for other forms of life etc  but what happened here on earth  as soon as our ancestors developed an understanding of impact craters  which are clearly visible on the surface of earth and especially on the moon  they should have immediately recognized the threat of extinction and began planning a solution so where is our planetary protection system  how did the conversations go  giant space rocks have hit the planet and killed most living things said the person observing an impact crater  yes but what about those people with different skin color what about those people who worship different imaginary beings what about those people who speak different languages what about those people who govern differently said almost everyone else  giant space rocks will hit the planet and kill most living things the craterobserver clarified  yes but what about controlling people controlling their appearances hairstyles clothing and what they do with their genitalia controlling their beliefs their hopes their dreams controlling what they consume and what about all the punishments we need to punish people in order to control them the masses clamored back at the craterobserver  none of that all those bad ideas will matter when a giant space rock hits the planet and kills most living things the craterknowitall said  that crater looks really old the planet doesnt get hit very often weve probably got plenty of time it wont be too bad ive never met anyone that went extinct humanitys nearconsensus sang out in unison  all life as we know it will come to an end the humanskeptic warned  lets talk about money and how much its going to cost giant space rocks are expensive the damage they do sounds expensive can we really afford to spend money dealing with giant space rocks what about the economy what about the stock market how will we fund this giant space rock program which social services should we cut from the budget said a nations government the one bestequipped to deal with giant space rocks  we should devote all of our resources and efforts toward saving the planet its the only planet we have at the moment the craterpropagandist opined  this planet is disposable and so is the human race because our brains cannot understand priorities we forgot that our planet is our first priority instead we became obsessed with the concept of governance obsessed with controlling human behavior so we created these labyrinthine systems of laws and customs the human conscience grumbled from its coffin its raspy voice escaping as the hammer of capitalism took aim at the final nail a nail forged from the skeletons of logic and reason  imagine an alien planet the craterpreacher proselytized we the human race observe the aliens living on their planet happily doing their alien activities one day we notice a giant space rock hurdling toward the happy alien planet to our surprise rather than do anything about it the happy aliens just keep going about their routine busily conducting their alien business practicing their alien traditions and so on as the giant space rock gets closer they start eating alien cakes  how silly why would the aliens eat cake instead of blasting away that giant space rock the dying breath of humanity chuckled  because they like cake the craterfanatic proclaimed the aliens enjoy cake and thats all they know their whole existence revolves around pursuing the things they enjoy and their entire alien culture was designed to prioritize consumption  so what happened to them did the aliens just eat cake all the way until the end the ghost of humanity asked wiping away the royal icing and belching methane into the atmosphere    we know giant space rocks enter the atmosphere ive seen firsthand evidence of their treachery ive visited their impact craters and watched those demons streak across the sky both in person and through electronic representations of them i also know im not the first to understand a little about their evil worldending quirkiness  so it was a bit of a shock when i as a child started learning about our priorities on this planet you see we teach children everything else is of utmost concern except giant space rocks sure the gsrs could be mentioned at some point in a science class if science education is available to the fortunate child but they are certainly not prioritized ahead of everything else and if they are actually ever taught gsrs seem to only feature in relation to the dinosaurs  humans like dinosaurs they like them so much they want to go extinct like them  is it an issue of time it happened too long ago it wont happen again in my lifetime  then i say tunguska and every nearmiss since  at around the same time i learned about the dinosaurs i was also informed of a new version of mail that would replace traditional postal mail in the future a good idea i thought at the time and i couldnt wait for the electronic version to take over so we could finally bring an end to the era of the papyrus scroll  but no we decided to cling to bad ideas like weve clung to the papyrus scroll era the disregard for our own survival is a deathwish actually and it thrives in all aspects of human endeavors outside of the science to stop gsrs surely once humans developed an understanding of the cosmos and the threat of giant space rocks they must have also had the potential to at least start preparing a plan is it still an issue of technological limitations  tycoons could have done more the industrial magnates of the modern era could have focused on our survival especially the ones dabbling in natural resources but they chose to exploit an injured and dying planet rather than try to save it shortterm thinking for industrialists and for the human race they could have become famous for building humanitys giant space rock defense system humanitys planetary survival system but instead they chose to build automobiles and railroads and sell products and trade resources and   why are more people not upset about tycoons destroying the planet instead of saving it we should have already had a head start on solving the giant space rock problem and it is a huge problem and always will be until we either build the planetary defense system or follow the dinosaurs it is a problem that will never go away  but we procrastinate if the news broke that a planetkilling space rock would hit us in a century i imagine several tycoons would get to work today saving the planet or at least start developing actionable plans for the next generation they might see it as an opportunity to exploit the burgeoning industry of space industrialization and colonization but i suspect some minor progress would be made toward building a solution  it will most definitely need to be built whatever the giant space rock defense system may ultimately turn out to be and it will require abundant resources technology and engineering on a scale never attempted before the device or whatever will actually redirect the giant space rocks away from the planet will be the most important human technological development of all time perhaps even the final product of the earthbased human era whether we survive or not so what are we waiting for  however if the news broke that a gsr would strike in several millennia i doubt much would change from our current state of inaction we have plenty of time they would say since no one currently alive will need to worry about it thats what we do act like we have plenty of time  but without a perfect detection system in place able to detect all objects over a certain size at a certain distance time is an unknown variable it would be a good idea to proceed as if we have limited time to defend the planet because actually we have limited time to defend the planet everything is limited for humans in our current state of existence limited time limited resources limited intelligence were down to just one single habitable planet not that we ever had or deserved more than one and we act as if everything is unlimited  humans feel the same way about our closest star oh sure itll blow up one day but thats too far in the future for me to care about lets go back to hurting each other and fighting over nothing while we exploit our only home exploding stars and giant space rocks are not part of the current human agenda but there may be more interest in the future one can never truly know for sure what ideas may captivate the masses  survival became too easy and commonplace for certain groups those groups became so successful at the game of resource acquisition that they also became lazy and forgot about the difficulties of planetary survival their forgetfulness and complacency lulled them into a false sense of security belief in an afterlife didnt help  i often return to this idea of giant space rocks whenever life seems absurd because nothing is more absurd than humanity continuing without a planetary defense system are other analogies helpful  for those still living in the wildwest imagine an infinite number of bullets being fired at your home from all directions for the entire time that your home exists youll never know when a bullet will hit you and it could the size of a 22 or 50 bmg it could even be the size of a cannonball and kill everyone in your home since huge caliber ammunition has killed almost all of the previous inhabitants  would you try to detect the bullets before they hit your home knowing about the bullet may be helpful especially where and when the bullet will hit and whether it will be a flesh wound or a bulls eye  would you try to stop the bullets in some way preventing the bullets from hitting your home will help you and your family survive  wildwesterners respond your analogy means everyone on earth is my family and im not entirely comfortable with that in fact im downright offended are you even legal in this country youpeople are the reason i carry guns  does anyone else need an analogy    how grotesque and absurd is it that we dont already have a planetary defense system how is it not a global human effort to stop the giant space rocks from killing us all find any headline from the news and recontextualize it by adding  and in other news another giant worldkiller was successfully diverted humanity will continue after all  our little stupid priorities our stupid money our stupid governments our stupid religions were so accustomed to killing people ourselves we cant fathom a real entity that will do it for us instead we invent imaginary beings who exterminate humanity with silly floods and other things that frightened ancient people but while stupid people made up their silly stories the real humanitykiller was always out there on its course careening through space and time a speeding bullet with our name on it  who wouldnt want to contribute to the global human effort to save the planet antiglobalists if an extinctionhungry space rock has us in its sights is there another job someone would rather do  you guys can go stop the planetkiller im fine staying here sticking with the wageslaving people gotta eat you know while the giant space rock is being diverted  sure yes life and commerce would continue in some form while humanity dealt with the gsrs but how long would capitalism and the laborconsumption cycle persist after humanity successful dodged a space bullet  cynics and perhaps everyone would say profiteering would be commonplace after a nearapocalypse with industries and commercial interests taking over the maintenance of the planetary defense program others would say the militarization of the space defensive system is inevitable  i say the threat of a giant space rock would cancel capitalism  would an industry or an individual business refuse to supply the antigsr effort how would that play out on earth  if the global effort to build a defense system against giant space rocks required for example an enormous amount of natural resources that were scarce on earth capitalistic interests would attempt to control and profit from the demand for those resources if capitalists were allowed to do so a scenario might occur where humanity could not afford to save itself  apologists would say it could never happen that if the planetary defense system truly needed a specific resource to be successful then the people who control that resource would acquiesce and donate it to save humanity instead of demanding payment why should we assume capitalists will resort to charity when the world is about to end do we want to take that chance that mr moneybags tycoon will give away his resources for free  tell me how a stubborn individual  who happens to control a rare commodity and also wants to watch the world burn  will be convinced to donate their resources to the global protection effort or a rogue nation that is the sole producer of a specific resource  how will they be convinced  capitalism allows resources to be controlled by individuals it also allows and in many ways encourages the hoarding of resources what are we to do if the planetary defense system requires a rare element and only one individual or corporation or nationstate owns the lot of it sorry world we cant afford to buy the last bit of pure promethium off the floridaman hoarding it i guess we cant finish building earths meteor defender  if not promethium then some other element for historical reference think of it as oil or diamonds or gold or spices or any of the other multitude of possessions humans have killed each other over we are experts at fighting and killing each other for resources perhaps that will be the plan to negate capitalism and simply exterminate those hoarding the elements and utilize them on the planetary defense system does property still exist when the world is about to end  it is entirely a possibility that humanity will continue to produce individuals who will encourage our own extinction will capitalism become associated with suicidal tendencies in the future is anything more misanthropic than our laborconsumption cycle  i imagine a tycoon sitting on his golden throne watching the world burn because we couldnt afford his fancy space lasers or more realistically perhaps hes watching earth burn from the comfort of another planet or moon or space craft because nasa couldnt afford his srct space rock capture technology perhaps that will be the philosophy of the future space tycoons exploit the planet of its resources to ensure their own survival while simultaneously bringing about the extinction of everyone else perhaps the future planetkillers will actually be just resourcehungry space tycoons sailing from planet to planet stripping them of resources and bombarding them with space rocks on their way out who needs evil aliens  can we afford to save the planet the question itself is absurd yet how many people read it with a straight face lets examine the costs  giant space rocks are located in the void so our technology will have to travel in the void as well but luckily we have experience in that arena we know the rockets in the apollo program used several tons of fuel per second to achieve escape velocity and reach orbit now taking into consideration the duration of the flight the weight of the payload and the cost of kerosene we can calculate the enormous cost with an average of twenty tons per second and  see how easy it is to become absurd under capitalism to begin saving the planet we would need to calculate the cost of fuel  is saving the planet too expensive is there a more complicated question that capitalism cannot answer what are our alternatives  start sharing resources now so when our survival truly depends on it well be ready to pool everything together and succeed  i dont believe a single space agency is capable of building and maintaining the planetary defense system and even a collaboration of agencies may not be enough private business interests may surpass and dominate government space programs but this is an even worse idea than allowing capitalism to exist in lieu of a planetary defense system can you imagine a hostile space corporation allowing a small space rock to hit their competitors headquarters  or one nations space program letting a few villagekillers land in their enemys territory not every country will be able to contribute financially or at all to the planetary defense program so perhaps we should let them get wiped out by a tiny meteor cut out the middlemen between the resources buried in their ground and the planetary defense system in orbit above them they were just getting in the way and then the mind wanders to the other side of the equation and ponders the concept of using space rocks as offensive weapons  no human would consider such a thing thats not in our immediate future right  what are we going to do who has a better plan than what were currently doing which seems like almost nothing will we just keep killing each other arbitrarily over nothing until we all get wiped out ourselves  oumuamua  all of these interstellar objects that seem to just magically appear in the vicinity of earth need to stop and by vicinity i mean within any distance of our star where the object can be given a name by the media the speculation about where they originate is neat and everything but the fact that they zip through here in the first place should have alarmed everyone into action  oh look another mysterious interstellar visitor we knew nothing about hey wait its already left our star system its moving that fast came out of nowhere barely knew it passed through more importantly what are we going to name it  wildwesterners imagine a bullet whizzing past a person but instead of trying to figure out who shot at them theyre more concerned with everything else they falsely believe is a priority hey buddy there are many more space bullets on the way so you better stop what youre doing and figure it out before its too late  as a child i assumed adulthood meant working on the planetary defense system in some capacity or another perhaps employed in the electronic post office delivering electronic mail to the meteorhunting robots in space but no lets not get ahead of ourselves the papyrus scroll tech was a good idea right  good ideas are the most limited resource on a planet without a defense system  just think of all the things we prioritize instead of the safety of our planet how are we not overwhelmed by our collective shame    perhaps its too late for humanity to change its course so i like to imagine plans for other emerging civilizations who might fare better than we did what would this plan look like  first before you do anything else develop the technology to defend your planet from giant space rock impacts keep your planet clean until you can find another one which leads to the second part of the plan find another planet or moon or figure out how to live permanently in space all of this requires resources so make sure youve optimized your utilization and allocation of those resources see the first step keeping your planet clean  by all means dont waste resources and whatever you do dont allow anyone to hoard them dont let the idea of ownership or property evolve on your planet if capitalistic ideas do take hold in your civilization find a way to educate your people and move past that stage of greed and selfishness it is merely a phase of early development of civilizations constantly remind everyone of the giant space rocks looming above giant space rocks  every time a person says something belongs to them correct them by gently informing them of the needs of the planetary defense system we may need that particular resource to save the planet so it cannot belong to you personally property is a myth  when a giant space rock is going to end life as we know it  ask a capitalist who owns the giant space rock that will exterminate the human race an absurd question you may think as its just a lump of detritus floating in space but at the same time humans claim ownership of this lump of detritus floating in space that we call home we believe we possess something when in fact it is the other way around the planet possesses us and we are most certainly its temporary disposable possessions we are beholden to the planet  it owns us we are the planets servants until we can become its custodians  until we reach a different realm of existence if thats even possible there are no other decent alternatives to having a place to live whether its on a planet moon space station or spacecraft we are delusional and falsely believe we still have options or time  you cant ask the dinosaurs what is more important than the threat of giant space rocks but you can ask yourself what have i done to protect humanity from giant space rocks    imagine if you will mr moneybags tycoon with his infinite wisdom and bottomless coffers proceeding to undertake the business of saving the planet from the giant space rocks he uses his own business to facilitate the construction of the detection system in orbit utilizing corporate partnerships in various industries to supply the materials and labor for the defensive component he partners with the military of certain governments but not others the planet is saved by his business  but what happens after that is his business accused of monopolization is the tycoon himself deified is there any dimension in the multiverse where this actually happens  i suspect there is not it seems logical to me that giant space rocks exterminate most civilizations in the universe especially the civilizations stuck in the laborconsumption cycle perhaps most civilizations never progress beyond that stage the era when they thought they had the luxury to choose to ignore the threat perhaps the laborconsumption cycle is the greatest filter  suppose they are not such a big deal these giant space rocks and dealing with them is actually easier than we think the technology may be less resourcedemanding than we assume in our doomsday worstcase scenarios but as i type these words there is not a single thing happening in the entire world that convinces me people are ready to undertake any of this the senseless deaths during an avoidable pandemic are just an example of how illprepared governments and humanity in general will be when dealing with the magnitude of giant space rocks  giant space rocks we couldnt handle face masks  the extinction of the human race we executed people during a global pandemic instead of executing people why not declare them essential workers and sacrifice them that way  we are simply not ready half of a country joined an antireality fascist deathcult during a global pandemic some of them even died still in denial of what was killing them   giant space rocks are an alien hoax  less than one percent of civilizations get struck by giant space rocks young civilizations are immune from giant space rocks  i dont trust your planetary defense vaccine its unnatural the atmosphere has enough natural immunity from giant space rocks  we believe these two things simultaneously 1 the planetary defense system will suffocate us and 2 giant space rocks will pass right through the planetary defense system so whats the point clearly alien mind control propaganda right  never forget many millions of people voted against their own interests like healthcare during a pandemic these same people would vote to dismantle the planetary defense system if they could something that like healthcare is in everyones interest always    what are your priorities how will your life change when they discover a giant space rock will strike the planet during your lifetime in ten years in five next week tomorrow  what will our excuses be we were busy we had other priorities  they love to refer to certain eras and the people from those eras as great generations but what will they call the generation that builds the first planetary defense system the generation that actually saves the planet  some people ponder the reason or purpose or meaning of life those people could use a job working for the global effort to develop our planetary defense system once thats taken care of they may experience a brief lull in their quest for meaning but i can assure you finding another habitable planet will be a top priority for every future generation why because thats the other meaning they are searching for  finding other forms of life in the universe  yes another great longterm goal after surviving the giant space rocks is obviously to find other life forms in the universe need more reason more purpose figuring out why most of the universe is invisible to us is another great longterm goal surely we must pursue an understanding of dark matter and dark energy advanced civilizations will have answers for most of our questions what else does anyone need to know  surviving giant space rocks leaving earth and finding other civilizations or their compendiums to teach us about dark matter and dark energy are admirable and achievable goals for humanity  but who actually supports giant space rocks in their quest to destroy us  bad ideas religion science denialism the spreading of delusions  capitalism in all its forms valuing property and commerce over human life  politics the deathcults the obsession with governance and control the perpetuation of the laborconsumption cycle  please join me in redirecting humanitys priorities toward creating a planetary defense system it is how we save the planet from   giant space rocks  while we solve gsrs we also need to discuss gamma ray bursts in my next post ,kzkleb

736,Just discovered this community and I'm worried about my father.,im in grad school but with reading everything on here its become clearer my dad was the perfect model of person for the work culture to exploit hes selfless has low self compassion and wanted to provide for his family any way he can so he worked 2 sometimes 3 jobs my mother sucked money out of him when they were married and still does with alimony  my dads a software developer that works for a bank and he teaches on the side he works 6 day weeks all day long im really worried about him and i feel like this lifestyle is crushing him  hes constantly tired and drained and taking naps whenever he can but theyre not good naps  because of the demands of both jobs but especially the bank one also the bank is supposed to be socially conscious and progressive meanwhile they appear to be driving their employees like cattle at least from what i see  this culture seems to have gotten him so much that even when his gf who has a high paying job and much less hours came into our lives and offered to help with his debtsbills my dad feels wrong for being a mooch like goddamn i wish i could do something feels like he lost his whole life to working and supporting us and i wouldnt be lying if i said i felt guilty being one of those he had to support  any advice about anything would be appreciated otherwise thanks for just reading,kzvldr

750,Modern jobs and management are an absolute joke.,i recently started a new job because my old one was the worst  maybe one day ill make a post about how much of a joke that was yall will love it they made me work while i had corona refused to pay me and regularly guilted me into doing illegal shit  just started at this new place and they have all sorts of unnecessary policies that scream we dont trust our employees you have to log in to this monitoring software at the start of your shift when you go on lunch you have to set up your monitoring bs to show lunch  just this morning i was about three minutes late logging in and my manager called me on my mobile asking why i wasnt working yet monitoring software had frozen on startup every day theres some mention from the manager about this thats phrased as a joke  were watching you so dont run away from your desk they repeatedly say they cant wait until everyone is working in the office so they can keep an eye on them giving me babysitter vibes  the icing on the cake was about two weeks ago everyone is working from home which some people love and some people hate i dont mind it too much  its mentally exhausting but not the worst thing in the world for other people that have kids it can obviously be horrible especially those that have to answer the phone and deal with customers 8 hours a day management said in the weekly meeting that they were no longer going to allow people with kids liberties on their tracking software and that they cant keep taking twentythirty minute breaks in the afternoon to handle the kids if they did this would be reflected in their performance reviews and they could suffer hr meetings or pay freezes i hated this there are only two people with kids on the team and targeting them like that for having reasonable problems with their children while everyone is home during a pandemic in front of everyone made me feel filthy  the job is advertised as flexible working hours  as in you can start and finish any time you like between set hours provided you hit your 40 hours a week i thought this was great  my job is very data heavy and not dependent on other people being around so i thought i could essentially work from 8am to 7pm two or three days a week and finish earlier on friday provided i had finished everything i need to do or take an early finish one day to run errands and catch up later in the week the managers made this very clear on day one that this isnt the case i start any time before 9 and finish any time after 430 but i have to work at least 7 and a half hours every day and hit that 40 hours every week how does that help me how is that flexible  oh and management is also fishing for people to work overtime but wont offer anything other than the standard hourly rate for context every other job ive worked in has offered at least 15x pay for working nights and weekends and from the sounds of it lots of other people i work with hold this standard too fucking hell i got 25x pay working bank holidays christmas eve and nye working in a shitty independent restaurant when i was 18  i recently offered to handle some data management for my team if you can call it that as everyone seems pretty computer illiterate the task was basically to move data from an old server up to a new cloud server so it could be accessed across the board by everyone in our organisation it was basically a drag and drop process but took like two days mostly because i had to fight for the permissions to access the right folders but i eventually got the data over and let my manager know that the job was done and the procedure could be rolled out to the rest of the team i didnt get a thank you or even an acknowledgement of oh you finished that thing instead i was asked if i could build a database for some other task other people were struggling with i dont want a medal but a thank you for something that everyone else seemed incapable of doing would have been pleasant  i was already disillusioned with the corporate life before i came here my best case scenario is to work in a field i love but covid makes new jobs so tough to find and dont see that instantaneously changing postcovid  my frustration is that i show up i do my job i dont cause problems and i dont bring problems to management unless i cant solve them i have gone beyond my job role multiple times and my two performance reviews ive had so far are marked at 100 i still feel like managers dont trust me and wont leave me alone despite my onpoint performance adults can do their jobs gasp without someone breathing down their necks  its also been a shitty week for me for other reasons but i really needed to get this off my chest here its hard when everyone is locked away and theres nobody around,kzt1wz

799,What is work?,i was talking to a friend of mine who was telling me that theres a distinction between work and labor   in his mind work is when you are fit like a cog into a company where you do a job that you have no real negotiating power over and you slowly feel your soul being sucked out of your body in the interest of shareholder profit   labor on the other hand is where you have some negotiating power over the terms of your contract its benefits and so arent treated as a resource to be strip mined hence labor unions  so i was wondering what you all meant by work do you mean anything where you do a thing and someone else gives you money for that thing or just where you do a thing that you hate but you cant really change cause you really really need that paycheck and complaining might get you fired or something completely different,kyek26

886,Perspective of a 16-year-old,for the past week near all of my free time i have been engrossed in the reality of the world of corporate america poverty increasing unemployment increasing job dissatisfaction and the seeming impossibility of a healthy worklife balance as someone who has never really worked a full 8 hour shift in their life and whose parents dont work up to as many hours as the typical 40 this reality is quite foreign and incredibly terrifying  of course i am a dumbass when it comes to the complexities of these topics and any real world topics  just a list of some of my thoughts   a universal basic income is absolutely necessary the fact that cost of living is so high that minimum wage workers often cant get by is absolutely ridiculous to me we should be provided basic needs and have to work for wants    rich people dont have to be so rich like seriously why the fuck are they allowed to hoard so much if we go off the probably quite incorrect in many ways data that jeff bezos makes about 9 million an hour then that means he makes 600000 more than his employees he certainly hasnt worked 600000 harder than them   office culture seems like cancer    the average person shouldnt have 5 8 hour shifts a week from what ive heard that extra time is never needed if science says that 32 hour work weeks make people more productive than 40 hour why not do that and save money on office upkeep   the standards for hiring seem ridiculous people used to be able to buy a house with a carpentry job from working straight after high school why are bachelors degrees considered so worthless   life should be measured by happiness the idea that more money equals more happiness is stupid though i would like to say that everyone can be happy even with poor financial situations the fact that access to basic necessity isnt always available can kill a persons soul   hustle culture is so toxic and keeps the mindset that you have to impress other people to be happy   the fact that many people are made to feel guilty for not doing overtime or having a side hustle is so unbelievably sad   automation might cut about half of my ages potential careers   working enough not the hardest to make the most of your free time shouldnt be shamed   i want to volunteer really badly but covid has stopped that i had a previous weekly position at a kids church program that was cancelled and it sucks to not see the kids and the other volunteers just as it felt i was starting to be a part of a community volunteering right now seems really important to get experience and learn what i like but that has been taken from me while i have the most time to pursue it as a high schooler   i already know im going to have to live with my parents for a long time compared to how they went about it   going to university is seen as an expectation at my school but i dont see it being worth it for a lot of my schoolmates   though i am impressed by their motivation it is sad seeing my schoolmates be so focused on making every moment of their time an opportunity to study more or fill out college applications i feel like so many will burn out and regret not reaping the rewards of being a kid   i just want to earn enough to live a modest life i want a job that doesnt burn me out that doesnt take so much of the day i want to be able to see my loved ones happy and not burnt out too i want to live in the now   it is getting harder to believe that hard work will pay off   for such a troubling time i dont feel people my age have the discipline to keep up   the very close relationship between ethnicity and social class for the africanamerican population is simply because of the abolishment of slavery not coming with a chance for slaves to  join the working class so they were left with no money to give to their children   elon musk is a fucking idiot not really related but i hate the perpetuation of the story that he lives a rags to riches kind of life when that couldnt be farther from the truth   minimum wage jobs shouldnt expect anything more than minimum wage work   i dont think the idea that the homeless are lazy and stupid is all that accurate and even so they should be treated with the respect and support to get better   goddammit responsibility comes at you pretty fuckin quick doesnt it   the future seems pretty bleak when it comes to the shrinking middle class and wage slavery the more i read the more i can see me and my friends dying on the streets from starvation and exposure   invisible additions to already expensive medical bills seem like lifeenders   why are so many dying and suffering and so little care a lifestyle of living to work kills all human passion for nature and common good excuses are always made look at the cambodian genocide look at the rwandan genocide the un and the states promised to never forget yet i had never even heard of anything about them other than the name what genocide means   the knowledge that i will almost be guaranteed to be depressed in my future makes me depressed now   success in capitalism is built on luck i am eternally grateful that my family doesnt have to worry financially even if there was a medical emergency,kwyqlg
887,"Will probably delete this later, had to rant a little",this probably sounds pathetic but i have never felt anxiety like this before and i hate every minute of it im a very laid back person nothing bothers me but at this job i sweat constantly my heart races and i shake so bad to the point i feel like throwing up when im trying to go sleep so im well rested for tomorrow it starts back up again and i shake til i fall asleep lol three months ago i broke down crying for five minutes and ive been feeling low ever since i think theyre starting to catch on that i hate it here because whenever i speak its in a low disinterested voice and i dont bother partaking in their long and very dragged out conversations anymore  i cant even relax after work either because the type of work i do requires continuous study to build knowledge and keep up with all the updates i just want to clock off and catch up on my books and webtoons instead of studying i made a massive mistake majoring in the course i did and an even bigger one choosing this job  ive started looking for a new job recently and hope i find something soon i honestly dont know how long i can bullshit my way through this i cant just up and quit bills need be paid i wish i could i really wish i could i cant fall back on my parents either because then theyll view me as some disappointment too since my older sibling has been jobless for years and that annoys them to no end   i feel really awful and stuck and im just trying to get myself out of this situation  im sure this whole post sounds whiny but i just had to say this to someone they say telling someone how you feel will make you feel better i hope it works  even just a little,kx4e9r

890,What is your opinion on refusing tasks at work?,although i am anti work i feel i try to have a decent attitude towards it and i have never refused a task before sometimes meaning i take on more than i should   i work in a bank and my role is a mix between doing cash at the tellers and opening accountsmaintenance etc in an office one of the tellers is taking more time off than usual as she needs to babysit her kids on school holidays which means she has been working around me and when i can cover the tellers this obviously means i am falling behind on my office based targets which i feel is out of my control and theres been increased pressure on me lately to catch up   so yesterday was an extremely busy day i had half finished tasks that i needed to complete and i also hadnt had my lunch break i have family stuff going on and my mental health isnt as great as it usually is so when my manager approached me and told me he had 2 account openings for me to do 15 minutes before we shut this would take me at least 45 minutes 30 if i am lucky i calmly said look i am feeling really overwhelmed with my work load at the moment i also have stuff going on at home didnt have my lunch break and im not feeling it i dont refuse stuff very often but i am not taking this on the customer can come back tomorrow and ill do it then my manager stood at my desk and questioned what i had to do he also said  this will be good for you you need to reach your targets  after him standing at my desk for a few more minutes he walked away   this morning i came to work and had my first panic attack in several years when i approached him about needing to go home he was at first supportive but then said  you cant keep refusing customers when you have a target to reach  i guess the reason that i am asking this question is because i was made to feel like i was being unreasonable and in the wrong when i at first thought i was being perfectly reasonable and i guess i need reassurance on that   i am at home now and after an appointment with my psychologist i have decided to book a doctors appointment tomorrow and have a sick day tomorrow too i am genuinely upset by this as i have more important things to worry about at the moment and the passive comments and unnecessary pressure is not needed   i would also love tips on how i can approach my manager about this as i dont think i did anything wrong   thank you if you have stuck around to read this i hope you have a wonderful day,kwycmr

900,Working at a Home Shopping Channel,i feel like if i dont vent im going to lose it one day soon  i have worked a lot of shitty jobs and im gonna start with its redeeming qualities before i dump on it   1 its work from home 2 the pay was reasonable for the workload 3 it saved me a huge amount of expenses from commuting  now to elaborate  i think i work for the single most incompotent company on earth  we are perpetually short staffed we have absolutely zero heads up about price changes on major products and many times the live demonstrations are confusing or set unreasonable expectations of product quality its all cheap chinese crap  our support team will not answer any questions and takes multiple minutes to respond to even basic requests like price overrides  our management never communicates any changes until the last moment and is slow to respond to any requests  many of customers beat even the worst i met at brick and mortar i guess not having to face me helps their courage last night for instance i was called stupid for not being able to locate the product a customer wanted they could not provide the product number and no product wed had on in the past 2 hours was within 10 of the price they thought it was  our shipping system is horrific and its impossible to get updates on why things havent been shipped and you cant cancel an order even if the item hasnt been picked yet   the postal service bless them cause they got some shit going on too loses probably 5 of what we ship  but what really started raising my ire is the crosstraining  i was hired to work sales only new orders  i have since been crosstrained to check orders file claims submit requests for updates on shipping reorder customer orders that have been lost take monthly payments update customer accounts add an entire program of record keeping despite us not supposedly being allowed any aftercall work  all for no additional pay despite all these added duties  and last but certainly not least the moral issue of selling pandemic supplies to elderly people when im skeptical of their efficacy,kxbms8

909,Humble brag post: reached the laziness goal I didn't know I could ever achieve,not sure posts like this are allowed or if theres a better subreddit for this since i do work a bit but here it goes feel free to delete  over the last few months ive been putting in less than 8 hours a week at work from home im still getting an average but nowhere near googlelevel software engineer salary ive read stories similar to this in the past but never imagined id be in this kinda situation  wish i could help yall find a situation like this but for me this happened out of privilege laziness and a lot of luck laziness for the obvious reasons but also because i was too lazy to get a new better job this job wasnt always like this ive wanted to leave for over a year but i was just too lazy to interview and then covid happened people got laid off priorities switched management got shuffled around multiple times salaries got reduced so i started slacking off a bit here and there and wow that was a slippery slope now here i am doing a few hours of work a week  one reason this has worked so well is that my manager isnt technical at all this is probably why they have been super happy with my work over the last few months and im not sure but i guess their boss is as well whenever i finish something theyre like omg i cant believe this is done already thanks so much confetti emoji  the rest of my team is only 3 other technical people and theyre working on different products since everyone else got laid off due to covid they dont even work in the same programming language and theyre not exactly producing much either to top it off theyve all heard horror stories about the projects im responsible for some things are not easy to accomplish and people have quit due to burnout back when the workload was more intense so that gives me a decent out if something is taking a while longer than it seems like it should overall not really worried about them getting me fired  sometimes ive been feeling a little bad about slacking off so much but i have to remind myself theyre not exactly helping to cure cancer here theyre mostly salesmen making huge commissions because they or their dad are rich or know someone rich  fuck em  and yeah ill go fuck myself too thanks,kxar33

918,Knowing this is how it has to be is debilitating.,found this sub a week ago and i am now going to let off some steam i hope thats okay   ive suffered with mental illness for a long time now and having the responsibility of working is just too much in itself i had to move back home after giving up my job because covid would have left me homeless in the city i was on the edge for months and in that time where i wished to recover the guilt creeps in you need a job or youre worthless  ever since high school the idea of working most of my life away terrified me and now im here i still feel that way my partner reached radical acceptance with that and isnt too bothered about it but it shakes me to my core i cant accept it and i dont think i ever will thats equally terrifying being forced to live this nightmare until you physically cant anymore   my eyes opened wider with an old coworker at my job i had to give up working for 40 years and still does not make a living wage she lives alone no children the only reason she has a roof over her head is because shes continued a beneficial affair with a married man all this time she cant quit that because shed be homeless i became so angry at my boss then he goes out golfing with his doctor friends and rich clients gets gifts of thanks and offers for free stuff for his job he pays us minimum wage and we do most of the job my old coworker is worth so much more than she gets her life has been so tough shes so underpaid it upsets me so much if i ever got lucky with money the first thing i would do is show up at her door with more money than she knows what to do with that maladaptive daydream gets me through the bad times   i got that job i needed to feel worthy and i hate working it its a worthwhile job but i just wish i was doing something else ive been sick for almost two weeks now and theyre not happy and overwhelmed because of my absence i feel so guilty guilty that i am sick and that i left them but i am also doing nothing and i love it i feel dizzy and my head hurts but id rather wake up knowing i didnt have to go to work than feel better its sad admitting that  my dream would be to be my own boss but the creative market is over saturated and i dont have any new or sought after talents  or maybe wake up a millionaire and spend my time volunteering and making the dreams come true of the people i love   i wish i didnt feel like such a burden not wanting to be a part of this bullshit society that cares not for my health at all it doesnt deserve my time but without being another cog in the machine id have not even a roof over my head   sad,ky96nw

930,I quit my job in Sept. And I am happy!,i want to preface this by saying i have been antiwork for a long time and have known for that workers mean nothing to employers for just as long    i only work as a means to an end but would gladly not work again my entire life if possible that does not mean however that when i do work i dont put in effort if i am doing something i like to do it well in all aspects of my life     i was employed at a major hotel company up until a few months back working nights from 11pm to 7am technically on a 0 hour contract on minimum wage     i was there a year and did well got employee of the month straight out of the probation period helped them cover my managers role for a while and i was put forward again for employee of the month just before lockdown happened    the team consisted of me the assistant manager and manager with others coming and going as it wasnt the best hours or best wage never more than 4 on the team though   towards the end the 3 of us were getting annoyed with everything we were all looking for other jobs as this one was not good   nights increasingly had more work piled on us while the days literally stood around or sat in the office for most of their shift the gm and dgm 2 males in their 30s were extremely biased towards the day staff who were all womengirls we were regularly understaffed and when covid hit we were made to clean dirty rooms without even leaving them the required amount as well as shitty pay and shitty hours   the assistant manager had accepted a job offer and put in his notice which was about 1 month  the general manager asked if i wanted to apply for the position of assistant night manager already knowing what the current assistant manager was on i asked how much it would be    the salary would have been a whopping 3 pence higher than minimum wage and because i would be salaried i would not be able to get overtime   i later looked online as i knew they usually post for those positions they were advertising more online than for what i got offered  i decided right then that it was my time to leave too i waited until the night before the assistant manager was leaving and handed in my resignation effective immediately   best choice i felt i could make and it was     right now i dont really do much i take each day as it is but because of lockdowns covid etc i am mostly in the house playing games talking to people watching whatever i want cooking and all around generally happy   thankfully i had money saved so i have been spending the last few months riding on that it has been the best time ever   but im getting towards the end of my savings i had allocated and i reallllly dont want to work again work makes me anxious and depressed i feel i have no life and work just to survive i have never found any job that i even like let alone love and this realisation that i will have to start looking for another job and signing on uk unemployment soon is killing me     i am happy i had a nice few months i guess but this whole situation has solidified that even if an employer seems to notice your hard work you are worthless and replaceable to them,kx4b32

933,RANT: Pandemic + working,so my brother and his girlfriend work at a large petstore chain here in canada she is a groomer he works stock a couple weeks ago they both got as a thank you for putting their health at risk in the middle of a pandemic 10 dollar gift cards to mcdonalds and some dice and a deck of cards the filthy rich bastards who own the company also made videos of them sitting in their million dollar homes thanking the wageslaves of their company for putting their lives on the line for laughable amount of money they make   so i sent customer service an email   good evening  my brother and his girlfriend both work for  and id just like to say that i think it is incredibly insulting that s thank you to them and the other employees there was a 10 dollar gift card to mcdonalds playing cards and a video of the billionaires who run it sitting in their cozy mansions safe from this virus thanking them for risking their health and potentially their lives for the measly paycheck they get i understand whoever receives this is not at fault and to whoever does read it i hope you stay safe during these times   regards    this was the response      thank you for contacting  with your feedback   we sincerely apologize for the misunderstanding causedby thiswe completely understand your concern and are happy to assist   we appreciate the time youve taken to share your comments regarding your concerns we value any feedback that you can provide as it helps us to understand how our pet parents feel and gives us an excellent opportunity for selfevaluation    your comments are definitely welcome we continue to be committed to providing you and all of our pet parents with the highest standards of service in this industry pet parents such as yourself are truly important to us and deserve the best of what we have to offer    if you have any other questions or concerns please let us know thank you for shopping with  for all your pet supply needs   i had worked for them but was laid off right as the pandemic started was told by my manager that i wasnt and that this was happening to everyone at the store and to be patient then found out  later through a coworker that i was actually laid off no call from my manager no text nothing im 22 years old and i am honestly tired of being told to accept shit like this i got written up once for not noticing a fork behind a garbage can told i wasnt professional told that when i asked if i could switch to pet care that i would be someone elses problem if they did i have add and was in the middle of getting new meds which i made sure they were aware of funny considering how the first day of my job i was sat down to watch training videos and do quizzes and one of their first guidelines is that employees who might need accommodation are not only entitled to it but encouraged to seek it out if needed all i was asking for was a bit of understanding while i was getting my meds sorted out not to be treated like royalty not only did i not get understanding but my manager took to hiding things under shelves for me to find to make sure i was cleaning properly she also got mad when i would miss pee stains somewhere in the store it is one of the bigger stores and i know i did my best keeping up with it and went on about how it would turn pet parents away but would leave it there for days to show me when i was scheduled next so it was okay for the pee to be left then but not when i missed it one of the real kickers was when it was december of last year 5am im waiting outside the store to be let in for my shift its snowing freezing cold and nothing is open my manager showed up two hours late and was snarky the entire shift last but not least the shit show that was petcare there were a few good people there but not good enough apparently because animals was consistently escaping from the room behind petcare three times in one month it was a python that i found when i was cleaning under the isles another time it was a robo hamster on the brink of death because it had escaped and had been gone for who knows how long a majority of the time the bottles in the cages were set up way too high and the hamsters couldnt reach them youd think a pet store would actually take better care of their animals   all in all i have no hope for the future right now this pandemic the fact that money rules everything and the fact that the system works to create mindless wage slaves as opposed to enlightened and free people makes me feel so sick i want to throw up   stay safe everyone,kxtd76

952,Work-Life Balance Is A Lie,work life balance is among the dumbest of corporate slogans that has been created  it is an attempt to brainwash people into thinking such a thing could even possibly exist when you work from sunrise to sunset and use all your energy before you are let to go home and rest to repeat it again tomorrow there is no worklife balance in this slave system corporations use up your productive hours of the day and leave you to go home once youve been milked for the day  imagine this  doing 8 hours of one activity every single fucking day do you take 8 hour showers everyday do you eat 8 hour long meals how about when you watch a movie do you like them 8 hours long  how about you give me true work life balance and have me work every other day rather than 5 on followed by 2 off that sounds a little more balanced doesnt it  if i have worklife balance then the amount of time i spend working should be fairly shared with the activity time i spend not working it isnt i guess i shouldnt be surprised just another dumb hr driven brainless concept that rather exposes the corporate world as the actual opposite of what they are trying to be seen as  tldr  no work and life isnt fucking balanced not by a long shot,kxfjj3

1014,Ended up having to find work,tldr i use to have a job at the mall pay sucked and workload was too much so i left needed funds for school in the fall so i took a warehouse job that pays 1350 only plan on staying for 6 months and im out   my last job was at my citys mall and it was in the arcade hours were long despite being a part time employee place was understaffed and i was only being paid 8 dollars an hour it sucked i left and never got a job after that i managed to live off of school checks i got by budgeting carefully dont get me wrong even the worst jobs and the scummiest of management can be ignored with great coworkers i just couldnt handle the workload and more people were leaving because of that and management   as of recent days i had to job hunt again i didnt want to work service or retail because most places are notorious for underpaying their employees severely i found a warehouse production job that pays 1350 an hour significantly better even if it isnt the minimum wage i thought i could suck it up and make it work i only plan on staying for 6 months give or take until i go back to school in the fall i was getting desperate and needed to save funds for school anyway hopefully things go well while im there i plan to just clock in and out and keep my head down i wanted to avoid working for a while longer but couldnt cheers everyone,kvewj8

1032,Employer not giving a single flying f**k about Covid.,alright this is gonna be a long one so i apologise tldr at the bottom i just need to get this off my chest im based in the uk doing sales for a company that claims to have values that promote employees working with each other helping each other and keeping employees safe  however during the time that the part of the uk that i am in was placed in tier 4 basically government advice was to work from home when you can the company decided that we should all come into work sit at desks that are within touching distance of the person next to us and answer the phones all day which are as busy as before covid so no reduction in staffing levels instead of allowing us to work from home   when asked about this they said that it was because of the phone system that they use not being flexible enough to allow working from home essentially meaning that a year into the pandemic they hadnt planned ahead at all this isnt a small company this is a company that has sales figures in the millions each week   they then gave employee of the month to a colleague who came into work for two and a half days with all the symptoms of covid before announcing at lunch on the third day that he felt ill and wanted to go home meaning that everyone in the office had to isolate and a couple of members of staff have since tested positive   when we raised concerns with management we were told that they would be unhappy if someone caught covid in the office as they had apparently taken all reasonable steps to ensure employee safety yet did absolutely nothing when their reasonable steps were proven to not work that quote above was from a manager who has been working from home since march so hasnt been into the office in about a year   just to clarify the employee of the month thing happened several months ago at the end of the first uk lockdown ive only just got reddit tho so didnt have somewhere to rant about this until now   tldr im sick of employers claiming to care about employees health yet not doing anything to actually keep them safe  edited to make it actually readable not just a block of text as im on mobile,kwtbjn

1037,"Rant on work, from a teenanger's perspective",please excuse errors or maybe even this post in general i am young and not a native speaker   sometimes i wish it was still the 1950s and i was supposed to be a housewife i feel like saying that is like saying youre a nzi but honestly i really do feel like that i know women deserve to be treated equal to men and have the opportunity to educate themselves and work in fact from what ive seen womengirls outperform menboys quite often but the right to education and the right to work is not the freedom for women as some people think it is and society makes it out to be in my opinion v awkward because ive always considered myself a feminist  for me eventhough as a child i was labeled smart i cannot help but wish my life was different again it feels weird to say that because i am a woman living in a first world country in the 21st century how could i possibly complain well i always thought of the ability to work as freedom but as ive grown up i realized i have little a job is what you need to feed yourself and your family an education is a requirement and a completely soulsucking experience that will also leave you with not only the wish you were struck by lighting or hit by a bus every once in a while but a nice debt   speaking of family i wish i could have one but how am i gonna combine that without impacting my career and in this economy i dream of having a big family sometimes but cant imagine having more than 2 a child is so incredibly expensive and time consuming from what ive heard daycare costs alone it makes me sad i also feel like getting a house is gonna be so hard i am nineteen and already constantly thinking about money i still live at home and dont lend money because i dont wanna fucking go into debt when all my pimples havent even disappeared yet lol  my dreams of becoming an astronaut or hockey player or whatever the fuck i soon realized were completely  unrealistic i am but my competences and weaknesses and there will unfortunately always be too many that outperform me at every fucking thing i do didnt choose the right subjects when you were 15 and had no clue how important it would be sorry youre fucked now   futhermore with every major im reading on im switching majors i get extremely worried about the job market and how people are gonna perceive my major and job i am sorry society but i prefer history and english over math and psychics people around me tell me dont worry but how can i not worry every major i like gets ridiculed and i hear stories about ppl studying it and not getting a job psychology after you finish that you stil got nothing x you should just learn how to get on benefits in the mean time also many people here are highly educated meaning that a bachelors that used to be considered impressive is now a requirement i feel so much pressure to not be an embarrassment and do a prestigous major eventhough i truly want to do something most people think is riduclous and have a successful career i look at my female friends who were smarter than me and do prestigous majors and feel like a failure i long for a simpler life with less stress honestly i am a total homebody and love cooking etc and i despise the idea of having to go to a soulsucking 9 to 5 job with a boss that dictates me around think im too pessimistic its just reality for many people i will try to get a job i like and a major i like but at the end of the day we all need to pay our bills but all society does is tell me to suck it up and think of the people in third world countries that have it worse   the parttime jobs ive had were hell and make me pretty scared for the future i could write about them for hours mistreatment when you werent your boss bff having to stand for 8 hours behind the cash register with less than 1 hour break being the only one on the floor while it was busy and i had worked there for 3 months bc my boss and coworkers wanted to get lunch being paid scraps not being paid for more than 30 minutes everytime i worked but 5 minutes late qnd you commited a war crime hearing the music from the store and feeling like i was on a boat at the end of the day in bed i cannot imagine what is must like to be poor and not be able to quit a job at least i have something to fall back on somewhat of a choice some freedom but god i cannot wait to be financially independent and god am i jealous of people like kylie jenner  i am expecting negative reactions maybe i am somewhat of a brat but it feels good to get ny thoughts out and felt like this subreddit wont be too judgemental,kw19z1

1060,Overcoming Guilt,ive been slowly collecting straws since the start of the pandemic and i think i picked up my last one i am constantly tired i dont do anything with my life but sit in my room ive had this gut infection for a couple of months now which i put off seeing the doctor for due to being stressed from work i can barely eat resulting in me sleeping 1213 hours a night which leaves me only a few hours a day to myself my job isnt fun its frustrating and unfulfilling and i dont think i can handle some of the more stressful aspects of it anymore due to my anxiety disorder despite the events in washington dc where we are in the past week everyone is just going on as if nothing happened on top of that i am trans and not out at work which is starting to wear me down but i also do not have the mental capacity to go through another wave of coming out  ampx200b  the thing is i can quit i applied for grad school last month and assuming i get in i have enough money saved to last me until then if i dont i have half a year to look for another job and otherwise my parents said they will gladly house me after my lease ends and somehow i feel incredibly guilty for wanting to quit and feel like i failed as an adult this is my first job out of college and i guess i took a lot of pride in my independence and felt like i was finally doing it right i also keep thinking about all of the people who lost their jobs in the pandemic and how my job is allowing us to work from home indefinitely and that my job does pay pretty well and how i need to feel grateful for what i have  ive discussed wanting to leave with my friends and family and theyre all supportive of me doing whats best for me and i know that quitting will not be the end of the world then why cant i just bite the bullet and do it,kv9wrq

1098,Did an interview for a university,i think ive exposed the fraud of the interview format last week a day before the capitol hill riots i basically predicted something like this would happen when asked about my own research i really despise interviews as i find myself always inadvertently saying something that will upset them for example i asked where they saw the department going with online teaching in light of covid and their course development in general outside of that context they immediately took me up as saying i just wanted to teach online i clarified that wasnt the entire content of my question that i also meant in general but nope in one ear and out the other   anyway at no point did they tell me anything about the position just asked me questions about how i would teach and my research projects when i mentioned that my future research project explores the limitations of neoliberal policy and its corrosive effects on civic institutions leading to collapse i could see the micro winces on their faces academic departments really have been defanged  for 12 years i have been applying for positions in vfx or academia that would lead to some semblance of security and career progression i never get them maybe its because i may be partially autistic not diagnosed but i have trouble relating to people maybe its because im not intelligent enough to think on my feet when posed with an unexpected question or maybe im just not good enough overalli mean i was interviewed twice by the same vfx studio and never got work with them   however i think it reveals something namely that the interview format is a lie they say they want the creme de la creme but they usually have someone already picked which i think was the case in this instance or it devolves into a high school popularity contest where you get to join their clique the majority of adults are mostly babies in their behaviour i found the experience humiliating they were aloof and rude given 12 years of failure which has condemned me to future economic poverty im walking away from this shell game i refuse to participate in something so rigged as i have nothing to lose its already over,kvrb0q

1119,"Now, even WFH has me feeling done with the whole thing", tldr i had already been antiwork until i got a  temporary position in my field from homewhich has been awesome i may have fucked up and cost me the chance to stay employed and im back to being glum about everything again    ive been a member of this sub for awhile and i guess i just need to vent to some who would understand where im at right now  i recently rejoined the workforce after having a kid feeling ambivalent about the state of my career and then ultimately the pandemic had kept me away for a total of 2 and a half years  then out of the blue i got kind of lucky and stumbled on to this opportunity to do something in my really specialized field remotely and completely onlinewhich i had considered rare to impossible to find the only caveat is that they were recruiting only temporarily for seasonal help as their volume would greatly increase over the holidays they couldnt guarantee any opportunity to stay working with them after the first of the year but also asked if i was looking for something long term so it seemed like a possibility they are also giving us seasonals a sprinkling of work right now even though its after the 1stkeeping us dangling on in hope of course the 2 dozen or so others that were recruited withme are just as hungry as me to get this opportunity and i can tell that they all see this like i doa rare find and something to fight for the chance to keep  them hiring me got me really motivated to work again and figured i would do my damndest to stand out and show that i was worthy of a permanent position also working from home is amazing compared to the last decade or so in my field its a freaking cake walk i had always needed to be on site for years and my past jobs had been physically mentally and emotionally demanding usually fast paced with a good amount of stress no work  life balance   again this online job has been an absolute breeze and a breath of fresh air it doesnt pay quite as much as i had made before but in these times i wasnt going to complain too much 20 an hour is something i know a lot of people wish they had its using my defined skill set without the crappy face to face interactions with customers co workers or management no being told to smile no having to worry about having a certain type clothes to wear to work no long commute with transportation delays fucking up your arrival time you get the picture it really opened my eyes to the nature of work itself and firmed my belief that we have been whoring ourselves and our precious time out for corporations benefit for a measly income good enough to just live for working  so here i am doing the most bang up job i can possibly do and hoping i stand out when i made a fatal mistake today last night as i was signing off from a shift i briefly checked my schedule to verify my in time today and saw that it was 16 pm cool shut my laptop and headed to bed well im an idiot because i had actually glanced at next weeks schedule instead not realizing i was really supposed to work from 8am to 1pm today and didnt realize it until an hour or two into working when i wanted to check my break schedule   i think the new schedule for the following week had just come out and the last time i accessed the app i was checking that and when i reopened to check my schedule i didnt take careful note of the week or actual date i was viewing stupid mistake i know but given everything going on these past few days maybe my mind has been a little distracted whatever not here to excuse my momentary stupidity   what really bothers me though is how much i fear what comes next for me now ive been feeling physically sick about it all day and almost shaking how stupid is that sure they could overlook this one infraction but i am not even fully employed there   they keep talking about how they are in the process of making decisions about their staffing needs for 2021this could be a deciding factor in whether they decide to keep me among their permanent staff i could have ruined my chance with this one stupid mistake seems dramatic i know but thats a potential reality  perhaps im just carrying over a little residual emotion  from when my previous job a couple of years ago terminated my employment right when i was about to go on maternity leave for some stupid technicality and it completely traumatized me the termination caused me to lose my stored vacation pay and disability pay i was going to use to cover living expenses during maternity leave and it completely screwed me i had to take out cobra insurance and i was super stressed about the whole thing i ended up getting induced early because my blood pressure was high from the stress of being fired   now im just sitting here today sick to my stomach about looking at my schedule wrong i feel like im back in that place i was 2 years ago feeling the absolute terror of being jobless again   i decided to be forthcoming about it as soon as i realized i was working the wrong shift and immediately messaged my lead person on microsoft teams to tell them i screwed up no one had even seemed to notice that i showed up 5 hours late when i made my sign on greetingmaybe i could have just kept working acting none the wiser and maybe no one would have even noticed on their end but i felt that was way more risky and could get construed as me being sneaky so i told on myself lol i even said that i wouldnt mind staying on to 6pm to take clients like i had originally thought i was scheduled the lead was very matter of fact that we were just too slow to have extra people on and that i needed to clock out  if this is it for me with this company at least i can say i have my integrity and i didnt try to hide my mistake but again why am i beating myself up so much about this one mistake it doesnt define me as a professional people do shit like this all the time send the wrong email show up to the wrong day for a meeting send out a false nuclear missile warning to an entire island of people causing a major shit storm people make mistakes and this wasnt some huge thing that screwed the whole company over i cant believe how physically ill this has made me all day i cant even get up the nerve yet to write an apology email to my manager i will leave that for the morning with a fresh cup of coffee  anyway way too long of a rant i know but if anyone reads through it and gets me then it makes me feel a little better,ku6luv

1159,"I loved not working during the pandemic, but I feel guilty af for several reasons.",2015  2019  completed my arts degree  mid 2019  mid 2020  my gap year ruined by coronavirus  ever since i finished my degree i had no clue what to do i looked for jobs related to my degree but i wasnt interested i loved doing my degree but it had no real prospects anyway i worked hard in two retail jobs i genuinely gave my all in those ungrateful places i wanted to save as much as i can for a trip somewhere in 2020 i had told my parents who were hellbent on me getting a proper job and securing my future that the gap year will allow me to think about what i really wanted to do before the pandemic hit during my gap year i considered 2 different courses but i didnt end up continuing either of them  then the pandemic hit and the lockdown came into force when i was 34 into my gap year  my parents pressured me to leave main job as it was dangerous side job closed due to the pandemic i had enough cash to spare to survive months i really enjoyed being at home waking up when i wanted watching so much tv doing my hobbies listening to music etc at times my mental health was bad but overall i really liked it  anyway by mid 2020 my gap year ended if everything had gone to plan i would have solidified on a course to pursue after my trip in reality i still hadnt found anything to do the lockdown was still in place and the world  a mess i also lost my side job who let me go after reopening my parents were still asking me every week if i found anything i kept saying im looking i researched for several weeks before i found something it was just an okay course it was a bit boring in fact but the job that i could get at the end pays alright so i decided to go for it its a selfpaced course that takes most students 9 months however you have 2 years to finish it and i would receive tutor advice for 2 years i aimed to complete it in 9 months lol  it has now been 6 months and ive barely halfway through 18 modules  i have been procrastinating and i feel like shit ive been watching so much stuff just chilling out that i didnt want to do any work my parents regularly ask for updates and i say im progressing well i wasnt and lie which module i was on its come to the point now where they think im halfway through the course now  thinking back i liked working at my two jobs because i was there to achieve a goal make money for the trip and i dreading dealing with customers and just being there i realised i didnt really like working it was just something to do i guess i just want to sit at home chill and exist but since i signed up to this course ive just felt so guilty about all this shit the lying to my parents to keep them happy i feel lazy and stupid for feeling this way i feel as if im insulting those out there putting themselves on the lives for us etc,kt9fru
1160,[Advice] How do I convince a close friend to work less? Is that morally okay for me to do?,let me know if i should post this elsewhere im leaving out a lot of details for privacy but heres the gist  both me and my friend have mental problems and suffer from general fatigue and low energy despite this he seems to be constantly working on something hes in school taking some advanced science course in hopes of getting a dream job in the future hes also keeping up a job way below minimum wage for his state he gets mountains of homework and seems to be doing it continuously even during winter break and even while at work me and another friend wanna hang out with him but he generally tries to do homework at the same time as hanging out he drinks lots of caffeine and has prexisting problems with caffeine addiction and overdose  understandably this is bad for his mental health less importantly its sad to see him working constantly even when hes supposed to be taking breaks but despite me asking him repeatedly he doesnt want to stop or even attempt to streamline or reprioritise hes determined to keep working hard for perhaps ten years to get this dream job i dont want to tell him to abandon his dreams but i also deeply care for this person and i feel useless just watching him work himself to death he vents about the stress frequently the stress is causing him to have muscle tension problems that require medicine to cope with   his mother isnt a great help as she encourages this workaholic behaviour his dad is also a typical narcissistic dogshit money hoarder manager who lives in another state makes 300k a year which he doesnt give a cent of to his wife or son  is this a lost cause or are there methods that i could try this feels morally questionable,kv3sun

1163,Why does my work environment suddenly feel better just before I plan to leave?,this happened to me thrice whenever im in my last few months of work before moving over to a new job then suddenly the workplace that i hated becomes calm easy going it makes me doubt moving ahead  on 2 different occasions i left a job for a better position more experience and in this case now better pay i enjoy the work i do but my company abuses me by overloading me with work 2 years now and underpaying me weve had numerous discussions regarding pay and its always empty promises   i have now decided to switch careers higher pay less hours also a field i think i would enjoy however suddenly my current job situation seems better manager is suddenly starting to make empty promises again and trying to encourage me to stay talking of all the opportunities workload seems lighter maybe its in my mind   i think he gets the feeling that im thinking of moving on and is trying to talk me into staying before i make decisions   have you guys ever experienced this its like being in a toxic relationship and when you finally decide you want to leave things are suddenly calm and makes you question why youre leaving in the first place but then you also know that the same shit will just continue happening if you stay overworked  underpaid  empty promises,kv2jnh

1165,Job Applications are so dumb,im searching for a job yay i know that i dont want but need because whatever i want to do is not realistic to get a job in so im writing applications and talked to a friend who manages applications for the company he is is working for and the things the company wants to read are just so dumb  like i get that you should tell the company why you are good for this job if youre good in maths or good in writing text or good in analysing stuff i can get bheind that but why do companys want to know so much about my private life its none of their buisness and the funniest funny meaning absolutely disgusting and sad here thing he told me that he actually judges people for their private life and that if you have a nice private life the person gets the job and if not then not what  i get that some things may be unacceptable like if you say oh privately i kill puppys or i like to insult black people thats obviously a no go but wtf is so wrong with liking gaming or watching netflix they rather want me to write that i play theatre privately and help in countless ngos or go bowling every week   its a fucking 9 to 5 job where should i get the time to get so much free time for interesting hobbys its not like im representing the company in any way as a face on ads im a guy in the back that nobody notices and you want me to live the perfect tv healthy happy family with lost of hobbys life fuck it,kv60c5

1198,"Job tried to fire me for No Call No Show, even though I did indeed email the attendance inbox.",i work for a call center we are currently working from home and the policy for call offs is to email the attendance department and cc your direct supervisor i was taking calls when i got an email from the department manager telling me to stop my calls and get on a zoom with them they proceeded to tell me that i was being terminated for a no call no show i asked them to provide me with the date of the supposed infraction as i always follow the protocol they provided me with the date and i searched through my emails to find that i had indeed sent an email that day before my shift start time indicating that i would not be in that day manager asked me to forward that email to them and got an attitude with me saying well it does look like you followed the proper protocols im not sure how that got marked as ncns so well get that removed watching that manager have to eat their words was so satisfying so heres a lesson kiddos never delete your work emails you never know when theyll come in handy i would have been fired had i not saved that email even though they were 100 wrong   side note i think that just reflects on how poorly said company is managed how do you accidentally miss that email the attendance inbox is managed 247,ktx1tt

1211,"Paid transportation and lunch, lunchtime included in paid 8 hours",i am still very much antiwork but i guess in our  country have got somehow better compared to usa these things are coming from our socialist past  most jobs are unionized workers in many companies has their representative in management   lunch is provided and paid by employer  if it cant be provided worker gets compensation for it   lunchtime of half hour is part of the workday and paid by the employer so there is 75 hours of work per day and half our lunch   commute is paid for by the employer gas bus or train ticket   holiday allowance is demanded to be paid by legislation   health insurance has to be paid by employer  every couple of years medical exams have to be provided and paid by the employer   severance payments have to be paid when employee is made redundant  amount depends on how long worker worked in company  i guess we have got a little bit better compared to usa but work is still work it still feels like slavery,kuq6m3

1234,"For those spreading around ""learn to code"", be very careful.",for about half of 2020 i was spending some time studying web development in the hopes of a better life i ended up leaving partly due to a developing disinterest in the field and my own ineptitude but there was another reason the work culture seemed extremely toxic  i was using a free online resource called the odin project the curriculum is excellent and is maintained quite well by a passionate volunteer community the issue is the community elitism seems to be the norm in this field as you can see in places like rcscareerquestions and that was no exception for this community   i was in the discord for it for the longest time and i went to them for help with various things like setting up linux dual boot understanding some quirks of javascript etc and they were good there but whenever you started a conversation about working in the field thats when it got concerning   there was a time when this guy got his first job in the field and he was excited he mentioned that it paid pretty low comparatively about 31k a year but he wasnt complaining because it was his first one and that salary was enough for him in his situation instead of being happy for him some of the people who work in the field started belittling him for settling so badly saying he should have negotiated harder saying that working for such a low salary is going to screw himself in the future because other employers will think he was paid low because he wasnt a good worker etc   i defended this guy saying that i personally would be ecstatic to make 31k a year because thats double what i make now i mean shit i could probably live on that for life since i dont want to have kids it ended up started an entire debate about how they said that you should see more worth in yourself where i responded why does ones salary judge your worth how does he even know how much hes worth as an employee if hes never worked in the field before and they responded you studying the subject and making projects shows your worth short selling yourself for such a low salary is damaging because you need to see that you are worth more than that  idk it came across as extremely better than thou coming from somebody who claims to make six figures after 2 years in the industry i know this is just one instance but i warn all of you to be cautious it seems that programmers are extremely judgmental over things like that i didnt even scratch the surface of how they got judgmental with me over not being as passionate about it as they were i literally was just studying this because i could get a job without going to college the subject bored me a fuckton,kt6j0j

Here is a list of things within my company that drive me crazy,1 once there was a fatal wreck blocking the entrance to my companies parking lot you had to use what they call a late occurrence which you get 2 of per year and you have to have vacation time to cover it if you didnt wanna be written up for being late because of not being able to get in   2 when you are sick you have to take fmla and fmla can only be taken if a dr writes you out for 4 or more days if not you get the sweet ass deal s of taking a 2 for 1 or a 3 for 1 which means of a dr wrote you out for 3 days you can take all 3 and you will only be written up for missing one day all scenarios are unpaid   3 there are no windows in the building you have no clue what the day looks like until you leave   4 the plant is so big that you cant even make it to your car for a lunch break to sit in peace and solitude it takes gt10 minutes to get out to the parking lot  5 they schedule weekends and make it mandatory with zero time to prepare and their asses are covered in the employee handbook citing that as business needs  and finally just to stop rambling  6 you cannot have food anywhere in the facility that isnt the cafeteria if you are caught with a candy bar its a write up,kup6xd

Don't know what to do.,im in the uk 19years old first year in uni  before the lockdown started in march i was in my last year of sixth form i was severely depressed for two years prior but would numb myself because ive never been able to open up to anyone about my feelings i never handed in any assignments in my final year used to fake sick to stay home would cry in the bathroom at school always had my earphones in underneath a beanie during my classes because i needed stimulation   i never wanted to go to university my parents forced me into my course i started the semester in september and havent had any motivation to attend a single online class ive skipped since september havent handed in any assignments so i have 0s i havent done any homework quizzes or lab work i have a big project due in 14 days worth 70 of my grade and an oral exam due in twodays  also worth 70 of my grade im fucked for both units because ive done jackshit since september   on top of that i havent even told my parents that im failing ive just been lying to them telling them that im uptodate with my assignments and studying even though im using video games and entertainment to escape my life because those are the only things that keep me sane im suicidal without a plan and unable to do anything because i have zero motivation   its not laziness this affects every aspect of my life im not even able to do the things that i want to do i just dont see the future consequences of my inaction i used to be able to get through sixth form and secondary school with pressure from deadlines but depression has killed that i feel nothing when deadlines pass now  i believe that im struggling with adhdc autism depression and anxiety my anxiety is crippling i have asian parents who dont understand mental illness so i have no clue how to explain adhd autism depression and anxiety to them without them just assuming that im lazy because i play video games instead of studying when one thing is clearly more fun than the other i feel guilty for wasting 9000 and because ive not received any diagnosis and im not on any form of medication i dont know what to do especially because i live in a tier4 area and im in lockdown  i never wanted to go to university in the first place i have zero interest in my course and im so far behind i wouldnt mind working a deadend job for minimum wage and working on my dreams even though i have zero work experience however that isnt realistic in this shit world that requires you to be a robot just to survive   im an infp btw dont know if you really care i hate the entire concept of working and school and i really dont understand how people are motivated by it and actually enjoy it i wouldnt mind working but the whole concept of work and school makes me want to kill myself   i have dreams of being a youtuber or singer but those are unrealistic pipe dreams so i see no other option other than killing myself i dont have a plan to just telling myself that gives me peace   im sure that i dont have a neurotypical brain and it sucks that were in a global pandemic right now i dont know if my parents would let me drop out since theyre paying for it or if they would let me take a gap year so i can sort myself out mentally   im scared to open up about my mental struggles and how ive done nothing all semester i dont know how to tell them  what should i do here  sorry for the long read the semester ends on the 15th by the way,kre41u
1282,"Piracy is digital anarchy, and should be practiced at all times.",i understand that creators of entertainment and educational material deserve a living   im not saying they dont im saying that they like everyone deserve the basics of human life no matter what i understand that piracy under our current outdated economic system hurts them but this is not a good reason to be against piracy as a whole   the ability to share the worlds information to one another is a beautiful thing and should be defended at all costs the fact that were letting capitalism prevent us from sharing knowledge and happiness to one another is putrid nobody is ever going to stop piracy regardless of how many fuck wits want to pretend that sharing is the wrong thing to do digital files no longer have quantitative value no one has to like it its not subjective you can copy digital files and people are definitely going to this fact destroys the entire concept of capitalism and that is a beautiful thing   if you truly care about progressing our species you should pirate fucking everythinghttpswwwredditcomrfreemediaheckyeahwikiindex dont support their antihuman economic system kill it yes people will be hurt in the process but thats the fault of the mass of idiots who defend disgusting economic systems that think human life doesnt have default value the amount of good done by refusing to take part in their system far outweighs the harm overall choose to be on the right side of history not the archaic side teach your kids to pirate your friends your family show them that refusing to transition to a world that functions for everyone is no longer on the table,kritkr

1299,[Rant] Took the job listing offline before the deadline,so ive been at my soulsucking job for over 4 years now and through a friend i finally came across a job listing for a position that actually excited me id be applying for a job with an actual benefit to society and it would even pay better than the job i have now  of course i still have to go through the motions of investing my own time into drafting a letter to explain why they should give the job to me showcasing that i stand out from all the other applicants like im in a fucking talent show in which the winner gets to work to ensure rent payments but thats fine this is one of the few times that im actually excited about a listing so i suck it up and start spending a couple of hours on that letter choosing my words carefully and musing on what i need to put in there to make sure they understand how suited i would be for the position   the deadline for the application was the 14th i was working on my letter when i pull up the website to check the listing just to make sure that my highlighted competencies correspond to the demands in the listing and its closed they just fucking closed the listing no explanation it just says closed  ive now invested hours of my own time on something that is instantly completely irrelevant because of this bullshit system in which a worker has to invest their own time and resources to show an employer that they are worthy of providing value to them and the realizations just hit me hard  fuck this fucking entrepreneur of the self bullshit,ksoblx

1303,Asked for a raise recently [rant],ive been working at the same job on and off for about three years when i come home from college for winter or summer break im put back on the schedule to make a little extra cash between semesters im a trusted valued employee and my boss often reminds me of as much and i am one of four out of twelve employees at this location trusted with a store key despite the fact that i only work there for a month to three at a time   for brief backstory the coffee shop i work at is very understaffed where we used to be open until 9 pm were now only open until 7 pm and before i came back hours were reduced to being open until 1 pm with a staff of just four people the management of the coffee shop is in my opinion sloppy and in the states opinion illegal   among many other past offenses my boss has forbidden us from discussing our wages illegal discouraged us from taking breaks illegal by telling us that oh we just dont take breaks here and only scheduling two baristas for any given shift so we cant leave the store without abandoning the other and disallowed us from sitting in the cafe area while not providing any seating in the back and disciplining us when she finds us sitting on the tables or floor in the kitchen where the customers cant see us during our eight hour shifts probably illegal  when i came back in the beginning of december i immediately knew someone had reported her behavior within the first fifteen minutes of my first shift back my boss informed me that we are required to take our federally mandated breaks because she had no idea you guys werent taking breaks and suddenly enough people were scheduled for us to do so because of covid our cafe is closed and she said that the couches were treated as a place to sit when we werent working everything seemed a lot better   maybe its the rise of communist ideologies in my brain or my general discontent with capitalism but i quickly realized that i was being asked to do much more work than i was being compensated for on top of me training the mostly new staff on tasks they should have learned during their actual training with our boss i was given the title of senior barista making me responsible for my and the other employees side work being completed while i was on shift and locking up and opening the store when i worked  i know being a barista is a relatively cushy job but i get paid minimum wage 725hour in my state and my back has been in constant pain for a month straight from standing all day in addition our boss told other employees that business has never been better because the starbucks near us has shut down for a quarantine period i also am often closing because other baristas have time commitments at night where i walk away with 510 in tips as opposed to the morning shifts 3040   so about a week ago i asked my boss for a raise my boss well call her sarah owns the franchise location i work at of a small chain of coffee shops the following is basically how the conversation went with me having memorized the first thing i said to reduce my anxiety about talking to her about it   me ive been thinking a lot lately about my worth to company and between being a senior barista training new employees functioning as a manager when youre not in the store i my labor is worth more than im being paid last night i closed the store alone and not only was it done well i completed it earlier than most other employees could while i have no issue with the fact that i closed the store alone the fact that i did and that you trusted me to do so shows how valuable my labor is to company these are just a few of the reasons that after three years of hard work i am asking for a raise to reflect this   sarah i agree that your labor is valuable to company and i appreciate everything you do but we just dont have a structure set up for giving raises when we formally establish a title that comes with a raise we can talk   me i thought that was the function of senior barista to show that were the more experienced team members who have more responsibility   sarah well weve also had issues in the past of some employees getting paid more than others and discussing that leading to employees asking for a raise and quitting when i tell them they dont work hardwell enough to play one   i started to get what she was saying and played along  me i dont plan on discussing my wage with other employees   sarah well i know you would t do something like that and of course i would never ask that of you haha but so close to the holidays is such a stressful time for me and my family and im sure understand   me i understand that youre busy but ive put in a lot of hard work for company and i think you know i would only talk to you about this if it was something i really believed in   sarah well how about we talk about it the next time you come back im sure well have something figured out by then i had already told her i most likely wouldnt be returning because ill be graduating from college soon  so i took the hint thanked her for her time and hung up recently one of my coworkers who worked at a franchise location owned by someone different told me that at their old store the title of senior barista always comes with a 1hour raise   so now i dont really know what to do ive been trying to discipline myself into only doing minimum wage level work but that just fucks over my coworkers who are also making minimum wage i guess im just frustrated and wanted to rant to likeminded people idk,kre943
1304,How to build a voluntary safety net,ill be upfront and say i dont believe in the inherent goodness of people  if a voluntary safety net was created it would largely attract those who are looking to do as little as possible amp have more potential takers than givers   i think it would be a good idea to give  to people who are stuck in a bad system like minimum wage in america that doesnt pay enough to live so they could get a basic qualification amp climb up the ladder a few rungs i live in australia so we already have a decent safety net if people want to rise through effort they can do it but in third world countries amp america it seems like people at the bottom are trapped   even with democracy theres no party that wants to fix a broken system so being politically active seems like a waste of time thats why solutions like a voluntary safety net that bypasses government seem attractive  but it has to be designed in a way that works with human nature if it was just something like everyone working contributes 10 of their income amp this is split between those who currently dont have jobs this scheme would be finished within a couple of months mostly due to freeloaders wrecking it for everyone else those people who had no intention of ever getting work so if you had a voluntary safety net it would have to exclude those who only wanted to take amp not give  it would have to be exclusive and there are some people who arent freeloaders but have disabilities amp are just not able to work  would anyone be happy to support them if they werent family id like to say yes but theyd have to make up a small  of the network else again people wouldnt want to join   one idea for a network is that to join everyone puts in 5 of their annual income to start with  this will attract those who arent living a hand to mouth existence those who are in a position to contribute then people who are currently trapped but can see a way out of it can make their case to the network for  to improve their lives the network votes on how to divvy the cash if the person given the  successfully pulls themself out of poverty then they are given an invitation to join the network amp are expected to contribute a portion of their salary if members get into financial strife they will have priority over non network members  but all money will be allocated by voting but eventually the voting could be replaced via a computer algorithm members could also vote on how much to donate to those with disabilities  the thing i dont like about the above is how complicated it is if you were to design a voluntary safety net how would you do it,krem1d

1331,"Is anti-work just a sub for venting? If not, what do you think the logical conclusion of anti-work will be?",on the one hand i completely sympathize with people who dream of a life without work i work 70hrsweek 6 days a week at 2 jobs myself  on the other hand i think antiwork people are only thinking of themselves and what they really want is for me amp other blue collar workers to start working 140hrsweek so they dont have to work at all  personally i think having a job is psychologically important what is bad is our current work system i think rather than antiwork we should be profair work less hours more pay more vacation etc  ive thought about this a lot and i truly cannot see any long term positive outcome to antiwork  taken to its extreme logical conclusion we are all replaced with robots and virtually no one works and we all survive on a ubi some people still need to work though would we accept robot teachers doctors psychiatrists  what about the military you cant use robots in the military because the parts required to build a robot could come from regions we are at war with if we wanted to start building more robots here we would need to force people to work again to at least get new factories amp mines set up for production these factories still need a human to look over it amp repair the robots too very few people will join the military if there is no moneycollege incentive so soldiers would need to be paid very well you will end up with a corrupt militarized country  there will still be people who own companies and the few people that work will all be ultra wealthy compared to the rest of us who cant work amp survive on ubi this can only lead to a corrupt corporate country the only way to fix this imbalance is for the government to control all means of production communism and distribute the profit evenly among its people but some people will still need to work they will want more than people who dont work right very very few people will be okay working for free so we will still end up with a higher class and a lower class and only the high class has the money to influence the direction of the country  additionally communism sounds bad in general some people like expensive things or traveling and if they want to work their butts off to get it thats fair but in an antiwork society that will be impossible the available jobs will be so few amp will be highly specialized  everyone on ubi will only be able to afford the exact same things ubi would probably only cover basic necessities as well  if ubi were to include spending money for recreation how much do you think it would be how much would you want do you think what you want is reasonablerealistic,krysxt

1406,"did you ever stop to think of your master—your poor, dear, overworked, tired master?",oh the capitalist has his anxieties too and the worker has often a good time  sure say where were you for the holidays      were you tempted to go abroad did you visit europe did you riot in all the abandonment of a wage slave let loose among the pleasure haunts of the world  perhaps you went to the riviera perhaps you luxuriated in ecstatic worship of that glorious bit of natures handiwork where the blue waters of the mediterranean roll in all their entrancing splendor against the shores of classic italy      perhaps you rambled among the vineclad hills of sunny france and visited the spots hallowed by the hand of that countrys glorious history      perhaps you sailed up the castellated rhine toasted the eyes of bewitching german frauleins in frothy german beer explored the recesses of the legend haunted hartz mountains and established a nodding acquaintance with the spirit of the brocken  perhaps you traversed the lakes and fjords of norway sat down in awe before the neglected magnificence of the alhambra had a cup of coffee with menelik of abyssinia smelt afar off the odors of the streets of morocco climbed the pyramids of egypt shared the hospitable tent of the bedouin visited cyprus looked in at constantinople ogled the darkeyed beauties of circassia rubbed up against the cossack in his ural mountains or  perhaps you lay in bed all day in order to save a meal and listened to your wife wondering how she could make ends meet with a days pay short in the weekly wages  and whilst you thus squandered your substance in riotous living did you ever stop to think of your masteryour poor dear overworked tired master      did you ever stop to reflect upon the pitiable condition of that individual who so kindly provides you with employment and does no useful work himself in order that you may get plenty of it      when you consider how hard a task it was for you to decide in what manner you should spend your holiday where you should go for that one day then you must perceive how hard it is for your masters to find a way in which to spend the practically perpetual holiday which you force upon them by your love for work      ah yes that large section of our masters who have realised that ideal of complete idleness after which all our masters strive those men who do not work never did work and with the help of god and the ignorance of the peoplenever intend to work how terrible must be their lot in life      we who toil from early morn till late at night from january till december from childhood to old age have no care or trouble or mental anxiety to cross our mindexcept the landlord the fear of loss of employment the danger of sickness the lack of common necessities to say nothing of luxuries for our children the insolence of our superiors the unhealthy condition of our homes the exhausting nature of our toil the lack of all opportunities of mental cultivation and the everpresent question whether we shall shuffle off this mortal coil in a miserable garret be killed by hard work or die in the poorhouse  with these trifling exceptions we have nothing to bother us but the boss ah the poor poor boss  he has everything to bother him whilst we are amusing ourselves in the hold of a ship shoveling coal swinging a hammer in front of a forge toiling up a ladder with bricks stitching until our eyes grow dim at the board gaily riding up and down for twelve hours per day seven days per week on a trolley car riding around the city in all weather with teams or swinging by the skin of our teeth on the iron framework of a skyscraper standing at our ease outside the printing office door listening to the musical click of the linotype as it performs the work we used to do inside telling each other comforting stories about the new machinery which takes our places as carpenters harnessmakers tinplateworkers labourers etc in short whilst we are enjoying ourselves free from all mental worry  our unselfish tiredout bosses are sitting at home with their feet on the table softly patting the bottom button of their vests  working with their brains  poor bosses mighty brains  without our toil they would never get the education necessary to develop their brains if we were not defrauded by their class of the fruits of our toil we could provide for education enough to develop the mental powers of all and so deprive the ruling class of the last vestige of an excuse for clinging to mastership viz their assumed intellectual superiority  i say assumed because the greater part of the brainwork of industry today is performed by men taken from the ranks of the workers and paid high salaries in proportion as they develop expertness as slavedrivers  as education spreads among the people the workers will want to enjoy life more they will assert their right to the full fruits of their labour and by that act of selfassertion lay the foundation of that socialist republic in which labour will be so easy and the reward so great that life will seem a perpetual holiday  ampx200b  brilliant piece by james connolly

1460,"Unfulfilled by my cushy 9-5, what to do?",it was a happy accident that i happened to discover this sub on the eve of my first day back in the office this year so i thought id get some feedback from you all on my situation  i work an office job in it that pays well has decent benefits my coworkers are great and my boss treats me well good worklife balance ie no contact on my free time never any questions if i ask for time off or a sick day and my boss genuinely seems to care about my wellbeing most people would be grateful to have this job which makes me feel guilty but it simply isnt cutting it for me  despite being a near slam dunk for me i dread going into work each day because i find it so unfulfilling im so unmotivated that i have to make a very conscious effort to be productive or else ill spend my days browsing the web or chatting with coworkers on our corporate chat application and fear having my boss ask me what i did that day only for me to have to lie or stretch the truth  its getting so bad that ive even begun taking sick days just to get a day off  i would look for other work since im clearly unhappy but i have a mortgage and bills to pay that were all undertaken under the assumption id be making the salary i do now so i feel kind of handcuffed to this job  outside of work i enjoy watching movies playing video games playing and listening to music and reading ive considered starting streaming on twitch in my free time to see if i can get that to take off a lofty goal i know but its the only thing i can think of doing for work that id actually enjoy  has anyone here been in a similar situation what did you do  thanks for the vent,kq5n0v

1472,"I wrote something to try and describe my feelings about being a part of the rat race. I have no idea what more I want to do with it, or what I want it all to mean. But I'd like to hear what you think.",every normal man must be tempted at times to spit upon his hands hoist the black flag and begin slitting throats  hl mencken  helen keller once said not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be counted this is where we live our lives in the immeasurable yet inexorably definable states of our being our emotions live and die in ways that are immensely consequential but entirely immeasurable as an addict ive come to believe that the inside of our heads ought to be treated like a bad neighborhood never go alone and never go at night that having been said perhaps you wont mind accompanying me  plato says only the dead have seen the end of war and jesus says blessed are the peacemakers pahluniak said that its hard to forget pain but even harder to remember sweetness we have no scar to show for happiness we learn so little from peace hubbard says if you take life too seriously youll never get out alive and elmo says if youre happy and you know it you should clap your hands  they dont say what you should do when someone stops loving you or if youve stopped loving them and they dont say what love is or means im beginning to think they dont know    they dont teach you how to mend a broken ego or nurture an emotional bruise they teach you how to measure but they dont teach you the distance between two people in bed when one of them wants to be someplace else and they definitely dont teach you how to stitch the massive gaping hole we all carry around day in and day out pretending were ok i suspect much of that has to do with the fact that we are not in actuality ok at all to quote al pacinos character in scent of a woman there is nothing like the sight of an amputated spirit there is no prosthetic for that   the purpose of all this isnt to fill in those gaps i couldnt if i tried but the simple fact it is that damn near everything that matters defies description   we are jacks complete lack of surprise just as much as were the all singing all dancing crap of the world and we are one and we are love and we are spartacus  what were not generally speaking is satisfied  i once heard a common story called the mayonnaise jar and the cup of coffee it goes like this   a professor stood before his class and produced a large mayonnaise jar he proceeded to fill it with golf balls he then asked the class if the jar was full yes it is answered the class so you dont think i can get anything else in this jar the professor asked he then produced a small bag of pebbles he emptied it into the jar the pebbles rolled around and filled the spaces between the golf balls he then asked the class if the jar was full they again answered yes then the professor brought out a bag of sand he poured it into the jar it filled in all the spaces between the golf balls and the pebbles the class laughed he asked them if the jar was full they werent sure but they mostly agreed that it was then the professor pulled out 2 mugs of coffee and poured them into the jar  this jar represents your life the professor said and the golf balls represent the important things in life your family your friends your passions your faith things that if everything else was gone and only they remained your life would still be full the pebbles are the other slightly less important things your job your car your portfolio the sand is everything else  if we put the sand into the jar first we have no room for the golf balls likewise with the pebbles our lives are like this if we fill it with things that have less meaning we will find we run out of space for the things that truly matter  a student raised their hand and asked but what about the coffee the professor smiled and replied im glad you asked it just goes to show that no matter how full your life may seem theres always room for a cup of coffee with a friend  as i type this im sitting in my office i should be working should be working is not an uncommon state to find myself in whilst in my office why do i do this its not that i dislike my employer hardly in fact theyre the best employer ive ever worked for theyre kind generous and fair they take care of and respect their employees in ways many workers crave im lucky to be here  and yet this job does not define me even a little to say that i want more out of life than to manage operations and finance for 40 hours a week is an understatement to say the least so why do we do this is capitalism a lie should we all just become migrant hippies obviously the answer to many of these questions revolves around our relatively consistent need for food and shelter but doesnt that then just leave us living our lives in the cracks between the golf balls are we living at an impasse in culture one where were sophisticated enough to reject the cogs of the machine and demand fulfillment yet chained to our fleshy prisons that demand the fruits of labor  i once asked my brotherinlaw a man whom i admire greatly how he could stand to work a job that from my perspective was the epitome of desk surfing not that my job is any less mundane his reply was simple i have your sister and i have our daughter everything i do is a means to provide for them and be happy and comfortable with them his sincerity and affection brought tears to my eyes it still does when i think about it i tear up like that a lot mostly when i dwell on things like that i think thats natural a lot of people probably do maybe its because were sad that so many things that matter so much only end up existing with any real regularity in our thoughts but i digress  the lesson from my brotherinlaw is simple we simply must determine what makes us tick or we will live the lives of quiet desperation that the masses of men are said to lead but even my wise brotherinlaw is spending at least 40 hours a week performing a means to an end im simply not convinced weve discovered the optimal way to thrive as emotionally vibrant people  so how did we get here why do we do this well as i said before much of it seems to revolve around our pesky dependence on food and shelter a mans gotta eat i cant live my best life by starving because i wanted to be an idealist but that cant be the only way to answer that theres thousands of monks and ascetics of varying levels who would all argue theyre vastly closer to anything resembling nirvana than your average working joe  it would seem to me that your average firstworld person for lack of a better categorization is living a life of great compromise we sell our time the only commodity any of us really has to the highest bidder in exchange we are offered the ability to do more with our leisure time which really ends up just being a few hours per evening and 2 days per weekend at most are we all mostly destined to spend the majority of our waking hours doing something wed rather not be doing and that which is not particularly essential to our living

1476,My shitty work story and how I turned the situation around.,so first of all im very happy that i found this sub and want to wish everyone the best for this year this is gonna be a long rant so buckle up haha   now to get to the story im 22 years old and had a couple jobs as a cook in different restaurants but i also have ptss from a shitty childhood and have little difficulty learning adapting in new situations i always got the feeling bosses took advantage of me because of this if im a good place i can work good enough and handle a kitchen in rush hour on my own without having a struggle   last august i started this new job in a kitchen of a really nice restaurant and it went very well for the first 2 months my boss started this restaurant 2 years ago and covid has a big impact on it so a lot of times i got told im expensive minimum wage and need to work a little faster and stressing me out while giving every order out of order not really a problem until i got less and less hours every month it went from 15 a week to 2 evenings every month if im lucky i get 80 at this point on my monthly salary  so in november she text me to tell about the last cut in my hours and starts to ask about if i want to work  a couple days from 24 till 27 december i tell her i wanted to work the 24th but not the rest of the holiday because i got it planned with my family she gets mad and puts it on me that i have to work on christmas because its the only good time to make some money for the business and this pandemic  this wouldnt be a problem for me if she didnt screw me over with my hours through a freaking text  so now its december 23rd and she text me again now to let my know i dont have to work the 24th because her family dinner got canceled but she still needs me on one of the christmas days i got mad and told her im really not working on the holidays and how disappointing her way of handling her business is she eventually started to guilt trip me on this covid shit and how everybody is struggling what i totally understand even later that night a colleague comes to my house for a drink and asks me if i really cant come to work nope not gonna happen  so now i havent heard a single thing from my boss since that day but i know one of my colleagues who is 17 and gets maybe 4 an hour and some 30 year old chick are being replaced on my work hours note she probably also gets minimal wage or even more   she totally fucked me over because i didnt come work at her demand  not caring about the fact i live together with my boyfriend and his daughter and i still got bills to pay didnt even wish us happy holidays or something and i really did a lot for her even to the point of writing down less hours and my boyfriend fixing stuff in the restaurant for free   so in the mean time i just started my own online business and resell second hand clothing already making triple the amount of what i would make with that one evening working for her its still not a lot but at least i can handle my own business and dont need to have extra stress and feel depressed about her restaurant i almost broke because of all this pressure on my shoulders but realized on time this isnt my problem and i did the best i could   for now im just waiting for her text asking me to come to work because other colleagues cant and im telling her to fuck off and that im quitting ,kqmgya

1491,I work in a sweatshop,ive made a plan to quit work and look for a real job full time wait till i have three months wages saved up and quit the problem is i have a broken back   my employer is a sweatshop in northern indiana making wireharnesses once decided was the lowest paid employer in the county including mcdonalds and walmart im a supervisor there but if you watched me all day you wouldnt know it i run all of the production in the cell i lead the supervisor title is what i call a weasel promotion the kind of promotion a weaselly person would give a title all responsibilities but no authority   weve been perpetually behind since the guy who started the company retired the people running it are running it into the ground and i think its intentional they do the dumbest things like take orders that are to go out when were supposed to be off they also move stuff around the schedule without updating it so we end up late on orders my boss was promoted to her position straight from production not because of her skill and experience but because she would be easy to control this was her first job after a 25 year stint in prison and within a year she was already manager   we are perpetually behind the company blames the workers of course we talk too much so we are not allowed to speak a word to each other on the floor if you are caught talking you are written up since were behind and its our fault theyve taken away things like the christmas bonus the quarterly raises so now its 25 cents once a year but you have to be absolutely perfect to get it and awards for working hard that would be given out during monthly meetings because of us being behind ive been doing 12hr a day 7 days a week shifts since the middle of november regular overtime started in september 10 hours 5 days a week this is going to be going on till july at the soonest   we used to have a radio but they took it away after a coworker asked why the volume changes day to day   if we are caught with our phone on the premises its taken away even if were using it on break cant keep phones in our cars because people have had their cars broken into several times   all the work ive been doing has prompted me to demand raises i want to make as much as the other supervisors but according to my boss the supervisors dont make as much as i think i dunno they are salary and exempt from overtime in the state of indiana you have to make more than 681 salary to be exempt from ot im only making 490 a week my boss said she doesnt even clear 500 a week either shes lying or the supervisors are being screwedboth are likely   they promised me an it position because i am certified they gave it to the son of the lady who works in hr zero experience the server got nuked quickly and hes been doing nothing ever since doesnt even change the paper in printers when i brought it up that i was promised the job they said they never made such a promise or even brought it up to me  ampx200b  ive got more to say so stay tuned,kq6itd

1496,This is the saddest day of the year :(,the first work day in the new year is like the moment you get on the treadmill with a commitment to run for an hour  youre in decent shape but this you know this will be a challenge the music starts randomly playing in your headphones and its dont stop believin by journey  you think oh this is a great song i love steve perry and you sing along    you quickly turn up the pace on the treadmill and begin to sweat  the novelty of the song wears off as you realize that you have heard the line a smell of wine and cheap perfume no less than 1000 times  you hit fast forward and love shack by the b52s starts playing  you quickly kill that one and hit fast forward again  every breath you take by the police starts playing  you realize you know every song and have no choice but to just roll with it because its too much work to keep adjusting the music and run at the same time  besides if you try to do keep tapping your phone your more likely to fall off the treadmill and break your neck than get a good workout you look down at the treadmill timer and see that you have only been running for 15 seconds  ugh   for those of us fortunate enough to have office jobs the last two weeks of the year represent the one time where you can take a day off and not get killed for it  even those nutty people that live for tps reports and disrupting the widget space shut it down or at least have no right to expect a reply to their emails with 2 minutes  well folks the new year has started  godspeed my friends,kpwmp3

1505,Professional sports are a part of the problem.,one thing ive been thinking a lot about while watching the nfl especially is the constant talk about sacrifice and hard work and countless other manly and strong values that are repeated ad nauseam and the mindset this feeds into  theres very much a strong association with the nfl and the bluecollar working man but that has been completely done away with since the 70s  the days of nfl players having two jobs because they used to be paid nothing is longgone and in as much as these athletes work hard theyre going into practice a handful of times a week getting paid millions and millions of dollars breaking covid procedures with literally no consequences missing games doesnt mean not getting paid for most of them and having one hard day of actual work  gametime a week  what furthers this is the idea that they should be out there sacrificing their bodies for the entertainment of the masses and that somehow this makes them and by extension the blue collar worker tougher than everyone else  as a result the person putting in 6080 hours a week or breaking their backs is somehow the better person in society  this plays into the corporate idea that people are there to be cogs and should give everything they have to a company that gives an absolute rat fuck about them  if were not out there sacrificing and not having a strong workethic were clearly not walking the company line  what we should be doing is taking the approach of professional sports through the idea of only having to work or practice for just a few hours a day and have one day a week to really burn through some of it  youll get better performance out of people have less churn and have people who are excited to come to work because theyre not being hamfisted into a way of existing that quite frankly doesnt suit them    fuck your ping pong tables and pizza parties,kpswm0

1512,"Is fight club an ""antiwork"" movie, or does it just make fun of us?",basically everyone says its a movie about toxic masculinity and yeah okay i can see hows that true but to me it was also a movie about interesting philosophy embracing normal masculinity and anti consumerismcapitalismmodernity that toxic masculinity part was just how tyler treated marla so at the end of the movie it changes its like kill the buddha type of moment   if you assume that tyler durden is just 100 bad then we should be the opposite of him we should believe that were special that we matter and that we will become rockstars and millionaires one day that modern way of life is great and consumerism is normal that we should self improve our lives as much as possible because that definitely will make us complete that we should respect our boss and care about our work that what define us is how much money we have in a bank that obviously doesnt make sense to me at all  i dont even see whats so wrong with the idea of fight club itself maybe except that its men only group its consensual and it makes people feel better about themselvestheir lives so isnt that good everyday life is just way too mundane so its not surprising that some of us feel good while doing extreme things  but then creators say its just all satire and you shouldnt be like these characters so is this antiwork or prowork i dont get it narrators life got better after he met tyler so why does almost everyone sees this movie in black and white,kq65m0

1517,The End of the Holiday,i return to work tomorrow  ive had 12 days off although admittedly holidays are never as restful as they could be i feel good i have energy ive gotten to indulge in some movies and tv that i have put off for months i have gotten to cook some fun meals i have gotten to sleep without an alarm  and i know my first week back will be a good one its the second week back that will kill any of the good that the holiday did   in october i had extra vacation days so i took off every single friday for a month three day weekends every week it was the most happy and productive i have ever been at work and it has also made me acutely aware of how insufficient a two day weekend is   now i know i am going to be tired drained and stressed until my next vacation probably in may i am sort of dreading it  and i have a good job i like my boss and my coworkers my company and hr have had a relatively strong response to covid i am good at what i do and relatively secure in my position and i even enjoy my work pretty often  but i am not passionate about working i dont work because it fills me with a sense of accomplishment i work for a paycheck so i can afford to have a life i enjoy outside of work i just wish i could have the time to enjoy that time outside of work as well but i know that many of my coworkers have drank the kool aid and would be calling for my immediate dismissal if i tried to work from home or if i worked out an alternative schedule because workers have been manipulated to believe that if you arent passionate about your work you are the enemy if you dont live to be productive you are lazy if you dont sacrifice for your career you are evil  so i will go back to work tomorrow i will be tired until my next vacation the cycle will continue until my student loans are paid off and i have enough money saved to tell my capitalist overlords to fuck off and i can retire to a small house away from people and do what makes me happy  probably when i am 80  damn,kpua80

1522,Looking for solutions? You might want to start here,httpsanticapital0wordpresscomannouncingtheschoolofmarxistfundamentals  im a member of a discord server that has the intention of teaching newlyminted leftists about the theory history and practice of marxism we are currently set to read trotskys history of the russian revolution but there is a cycling curriculum that covers philosophy economics as well as history you can find out more about the specific texts in the link above  a common question i see here is a way to end the current paradigm of work and no one seems to have good answers i believe that marxism is that answer but learning what exactly marxism is can be difficult especially on your own the server has weekly discussions as well as more than a few members who have a strong understanding of the theory and practice of socialism although the founder and primary teacher is a marxist we welcome all left tendencies and denominations in the hope of strengthening the working class understanding of the task that confronts it and using the existing history and theory of class struggle to bring about a better world  if youre interested check out the link above which has a link to the discord server feel free to ask any questions here as well and i will answer them to the best of my ability,kqdn26

1535,Is marriage and having children a way to keep you trapped in the system?,one of my friends who is in his 30s just had his second child recently despite him being ecstatic about it i cant help but to feel sorry for him for not ever being able to live freely probably for his entire life of course unless he won some big lottery money or run his own business but none of these are likely to happen in the foreseeable future he barely have time to sleep looking after the kids  then i started to get suspicious about the whole idea of romance and relationship and having a family  like 90 of the movies and tv shows and books and all the other forms of media is covered with finding love getting married and having children like these topics are constantly nonstoppingly shoveled in your face oh and sex like everything is sexualised on media nowadays i kinda start to think its all looking too much like its intentionally promoted to you to have more babies then i see my friend having his second child all i see is him working 95 forever and still living a financially burdened life cuz of the two kids so could romance and having children be their strategy to keep you trapped in the system cuz the only way i see that have the slightest possibility to break free is to stay single save money n side hustle then start your own business somehow before you are too old thats the only way i could see to gain financial freedom so free from 95     so in other words if you wanna become financially free from the 95 not having children would be a good way to help achieve this goal and not producing slave labors for the ruling class as a plus   ampx200b  whats your thoughts on this  sorry about the rambling,kpylyf

1548,"Students Should Be Paid to get Degrees, Not The Other Way Around",when you think about it it is absurd we have to pay for college and get into massive debt to get a degree that may or may not have any worth at all  when we go to college it is the student who does the work the student is studying and completing homework assignments working on projects and pulling all nighters to meet their deadlines yet they are the ones paying for this seriously that is absurd students should get paid to do their programs as it is work they are doing with the intention of later getting a job to benefit society   to put it simply they give up four productive working years to work hard to get some degree that may or may not be worth anything in terms of actually getting a job not only that many are forced into paralyzing debt for this privilege to experience the above this is absolutely insane and shows what a rigged society we live in  the rich should pay students to go get their degrees  after all many of those people with the degrees will then go and make money for these corporations students should leave with money in their bank account for the work they complete to get their degree not the other way around,kozgl6

1551,"Becoming a NEET (Not in educaiton, employment or training) will be my last option if everything else fails",what the title says frens how did you guys come to that path in life or maybe lack thereof did it scare you at first was it a difficult descision how did the people around you react what is the thing keeping you going for me the possible paths i may take are these  1 very odd job very uncommon most people may or may not be aware it exists in the first place requires tons of travelling so i will get to see the world and do stuff i love with unique diverse people around me i dont really wanna name it cause i will need a whole book to explain it or why and how it became one of my possible paths and how i even discovered it was an option but i do not know how my family will react if i reveal it to them it is a perfectly achievable job a lot of times though not always with good work  life balance and my past sports backgrounds give me an advantage as to doing it it is not sex work but it does require selling your body technically it may or may not be more physically demanding andor bad for your health as working in mines or in construction and i guess it may or may not be considered back breaking labor the reason why i am not explaining it is because it will either make me look like a poserattention seeker and because i will have to type ten paragraphs to explain myself but you get the idea my family will call me insane if i choose to pursue it and they already give me weird looks when i talk about it or show them stuff on my phone related to it but my sister says she will support me no matter which path i follow and that i am a very talented girl and that she is mind blown by the fact that i already learnt so much without a coachteacher i do not consider myself talented nor natural at it as many of the people in this field are stereotyped i just think i started at a point in time where it was 10000000000000 times easy so now i come off as i have some type of magical superpower but i love and forgive my sister because she has a kind heart and has faith in me and she is all i have left in the world 2 also a quite odd job but it is not godforgotten or forgotten even by the secretary of god like the above one i have a lot fo creative ideas about it but i doubt i will find success in the mainstream since creativity and passion these days is sacrificed for the shake of sex appeal outward appearance and it is pretty much a dead field in the sense that there is little creative passionate joyful work put out there now it is highly unlikely that i will follow that path for that reason although in my country a nonmainstream marker in experimentalfolk stuff is there too but i have zero clue if that is my style and also i am not sure if this is a path i want to follow yet even as a hobby though i have soooooo much inspiration inside me 3 teacher it sounds beautiful in theory more specifically primaryelementary teacher giving children knowlegde forming deep loving relationships with your students and helping them become happy functional adults it sounds really appealing to me it is the only normal job i have ever dreamed of and actually liked anything else was either very artsy very athletic or both at first i chose teacher as my first option because well i may had had repressed dreams that may have been there since i was 7 that i was never allowed to pursue all and all because my family tried to protect me from the slightest inconvenience helicopter parenting has completely ruined my view of life lowkey and it has also made me afraid to pursue some of my goals that will require me to put effort and fail a lot of times to do them in theory it is such a beautiful profession and it offers so much both to the teacher and the student i just do not know if my mental issues will allow me something like that and i mighty simply be drawn to the idea of being a teacher and not the profession it self because of them so i am not sure if this is my path 4 full time author highly unlikely hard to achieve and while i do love literature and can not live without it it is a very lonely escapist profession and i do not trust myself with it because i do not wanna end up like james joyce or lovecraft i call this one the best worst case scenario for the above reasons i know i probably wont be like jk rowling or steven king but just in case everything else fails or aint for me i like to hope this will be possible 5 glossology hard to get into hard to study time consuming probably will have to become a professor if i wanna use it somehow but it seems appealing and interesting compared to any normal office job there are just too many languages i wanna learn before i die and they do not even have a greek or latin alphabet 6 theologyreligious studies highly unlikely might not find a job again though same applies to glossology i aint passionate about teaching adults but in my country you can teach middle schoolers general knowledge about world religions not indoctrination there is a difference so there is that 7 part time job  youtube it gives me the wrong vibes because again it is a very isolating profession just like writer and it takes time to build a channel anyway 8 neet i saved it as my last option no idea what i will do all day no idea if i will develop a feeling of aimlessness or not

1592,Capitalism and effeciency: What the fuck are we doing.,listing some ways in which capitalism creates inefficiency and how efficiency when it does happen never benefits workers  preface i understand that some of this wasted work has value competition can lead to good things in some sense i am merely pointing out inefficiency not saying another system would do everything better  bullshit jobs beginning with the most simple and widely known inefficiency in capitalism there is a large subset of jobs which involve checking boxes confirming things in other ways or nothing at all jobs which essentually involve no labour but force the laborer to pretend they do something of course made popular by the book bullshit jobs by david graeber probably this concept is connected to many of our awakenings to the nonsense of work culture   bullshit sectors i would expand on the concept of bullshit jobs and add that many whole sectors of work exist without the creation of anything examples of this are the finance sector law government and marketing i am not saying these sectors dont do anything im saying they create nothing they produce nothing they are essentually management of society they are bandaids on a wound  competition is wasteful all competition where sellers are vying for the money of a limiteddemand service or good actually reduces efficiency imagine you are selling haircuts and someone moves in beside you and also sells haircuts this is basically the case where i live so many barbers any time one of you is open for business but not cutting hair while the other is cutting hair is wasted time on the job similarly if you spend a year making a video game but a similar video game comes out and there is no longer a market for your game all the time the studio spent making that game is wasted because of competition rather than cooperation with other studios in fact if you look at the video game industry you see blatantly how many games have no player base because there are just way more people making games then necessary   low income inefficiency imagine i need a haircut but i have no money i dont get a haircut because of this the barber doesnt get paid as much and doesnt buy as much for himself this cycle in our society encourages not just the poor but everyone to spend less meaning demand less in an economic sense this is why the only way to make money in society outside of the arts is to do work that people cannot refuse such as healthcare law and finance nobody can bargain a low price with a doctor people cant represent themselves in court and nobody can give themselves a loan for a house they have to deal with these people and so they can charge whatever they want   money makes money anyone who spends money in our society is losing so we only do it when we have to or we really want something any money saved can be multiplied in many ways especially if you have a lot of it this means that not just poor people but everyone is incentivized not to pay for goods and services which artificially reduces demand for everything except what cant be avoided as previously stated if society was based on demand rather than money many things would be done that arent now i could open a business selling ice cream and anyone who wants ice cream would ask for some thereby creating more product than our system   conclusion which is more efficient a man who cuts down 10 trees in an hour but only works 4 hours a day or a man who cuts 6 trees an hour but works 8 hours a day the answer is quite obvious its the first man but our society would view this man as being low on work less productive per day a part time worker an under employed person society would much rather see us all work 8 hours a day then see us truly improve the efficiency of our system and improve the lives of everyone the fact is society is already quite efficient we make a lot of food and transport it around the world we could all work 3 or 4 hours a day if we would stop doing jobs that dont need to be done and give enough money to everyone so we can afford to buy things and create a cycle of demand rather than incentivizing non spending   there is a postal service union in my area they fought against making community mailboxes why because they represent the letter carriers and this improved efficiency would have led to layoffs the real question is why would it lead to layoffs why would we as a society deliberately make ourselves less efficient because we cannot comprehend the idea of efficiency benefiting the worker instead of the businesses bottom line in a crown corperation no less canada thats truly broken we live in fear of improved efficiency in our society we are worried about robots taking jobs why because we cant just agree to pay people the same to work less  because of this wanting efficiency which we all should should be the same as wanting reduced work or higher pay for workers or both for that reason being antiwork and being anticapitalist are fundamentally linked any leftist should be fighting for increased efficiency and reduced labour as a consequence if all truckers become unnecessary then great what freedom we have created pay them anyway the laughable idea that we cannot afford to pay people when the reason theyre out of work is because we are making things more efficiently then ever is so absurd we paid them befor but now we cant because we are making the same thing without them it makes no sense   side note i wont go into it that much but we should also just reduce our production we

1593,I graduate at the end of this year and don't see a way I can ever be happy in life because I wasn't born rich enough to avoid full time wage slavery.,basically what the title says  will be finishing up my masters degree in november which will have been a nice 2 year break from wage slavery i know i am preaching to the choir but i dont know how i will ever have happiness in life having to be a full time wage slave for the next 40 years it is almost impossible to get part time work here unless you want to be in poverty and dealing with customer service jobs 5 days just sucks up your life and leaves you too tired to even enjoy the weekends im already on the highest possible safe dose of anti depressants and it isnt enough  i dont really know what else to say but it is so soul crushing to know i have no real choice but to do something that makes me desperately unhappy because the world has been set up to force us to participate in wage slavery or end up on the streets the worst part is when my mother says thats life why the fuck did you have me if you knew life was shit both my parents had cancer in their 50s my father died from it so basically my fate is either 40 years of wage slavery and maybe getting to retire or wage slaving until 55 and then dying of cancer   fuck everything i just want to be able to work part time but its basically impossible in my country and i have no choice but to revolve my life around a job i dont even want and barely see my family and friends and never have time for my hobbies i will have to give up my hobby of learning korean sleep when my body doesnt want to sleep my natural clock is 2am10am and be a miserable rat in the race until i die  kinda wish the pandemic just ended civilisation tbh,kowpba
1594,They double their efforts and keep slaving away!,the pursuit of an easier life resulted in much hardship and not for the last time it happens to us today how many young college graduates have taken demanding jobs in highpowered firms vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are thirtyfive but by the time they reach that age they have large mortgages children to school houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family and a sense that life is not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays abroad what are they supposed to do go back to digging up roots no they double their efforts and keep slaving away   sapiens a brief history of humankind by yuval noah harari,kos6q3

1598,Point-less,for the longest time i struggled in looking for a point to my life the utter meaninglessness of everything was overwhelming and so it felt appropriate to ask this question  what is the point  my life has probably been lived like many of you ive had a few brief moments of happiness but the vast amount of this has been just mindless drudgery i went to college like i was supposed to worked hard to get the degree like everyone else and accepted a slave wage job in which i feel perpetually miserable waking up every day to hammer out 8 hours of boring mindless work causing me to feel bitter and frustrated with everything day in and day out i live at home with my mom at 29 because i am not interested in paying the extremely high rent fees for shitty one bedroom apartments in my area ive only amounted to the money ive been able to save up  at the end of the day nothing is happening i chase little simple pleasures when i can but feel like most of my time is spent working and depressed and tired im not working towards anything nothing is really interesting to me its just existing i obviously dont want kids i dont want marriage my life isnt heading in any direction other than more of the same its not like im really doing anything significant in any way or amounting to something bigger  so we come back to the same old question whats the point  the closest that i have to an answer is that there is no point as humans we ask that question because we are often feeling a sense of pointlessness and boredom with our lives in other words we who are looking for a point to life is often because our lives feel pointless to us  but asking for a point is viewing our world though a human perspective which seeks meaning at the end of the day i dont offer meaning to this world i am a disposable person like the many who have lived and died before me i seek meaning in a meaningless world  so what is the point of all this  there is no point it is pointless,kp0zgj

1639,I never really want to work for an employer but I'll probably have to one day (and other stuff),im currently in australia on a welfare payment called jobseeker as the name implies you are meant to look for any work you are physically capable of doing while on it i just dont want to work really the thought of it sucks id never enjoy it the only work i ever enjoyed doing was volunteer work soon i intend to get off this welfare payment and leave my mum to pay for most things although ill pay for other things out of my savings shes elderly so she gets paid for that   i used to do paid online surveys unless you put hours into that youll make hardly anything very very small pocket change but i mean you dont have to deal with people at least its extremely boring though   i liked volunteer work because it didnt feel like work and it just felt like helping others out no pressure no nagging no deadlines had to deal with people of course but nearly everyone was alright   but as long as i can live off her and off my savings ive got 10k but i can live really cheaply if im not paying rent lol yeah that makes me feel a bit bad but i am also her carer as well and help her with a few aspects of her life we usually get along which is nice and yeah as long as there is enough to sustain us both then im not working im willing to do volunteer work for now and thats all  i am indeed sick of the unemployed being treated badly why should anyone have to slave their days away for an employer unemployed called lazy and things like that i figure since im a carer im not really subjected to the bad treatment that some other unemployed might receive dirty looks comments  you have so much more value and worth it shouldnt be determined by how many hours you work at a job for a job shouldnt be what defines you sadly in this society one of the first questions new people tend to ask is what do you do for a living  apologies for the long post thanks for reading if you think i am lazy or such i dont really care and wont reply to such comments,kojxeo
