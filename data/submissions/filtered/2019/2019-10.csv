1,Progressive company culture,my work is big on its progressive culture last week we were sent an email from the exco including ghandi quotes no less how vulnerability is strength and so on and so on   i needed a few of days off to look after my very sick pregnant wife i gave them proof with hospital appointments etc to be told it would go unpaid due to point 2 of section 615 of the staff handbook about listing dependables  they dont really believe in what they are forcing down everyones throats i would prefer them to be honest that they dont give a fuck than this confusing progressive bullshit,doh9uf

5,Not ready for job interviews because unemployment has been nice,today i received an unexpected call from the hr of a big and reputable firm for a phone screening i applied to that position like half a month ago and i have a very vague impression of it i applied to like tons of other jobs the woman was nice and rescheduled the screening for tomorrow so that we can have a more substantial conversation   as much as i would love to explore this seemingly good opportunity in advisory services part of me is extremely reluctant to join the work force again given how horrible my first job was i left that place 2 weeks ago  im also quite puzzled by hr asking me to do more research about their company before the screening tomorrow because there isnt enough information on their website a lot of grandiose words with no meaning being thrown around thats all   i was in a bad condition and had two panic attacks after that phone call nevertheless im going to whatever i can for the phone screening tomorrow  i dont even care if i left a bad impression today during the sudden call might be because i dont feel like working again that soon,dp4geh
6,"“I work for my job” / Meytal Shapiro (opinion piece, translated from a Hebrew newspaper’s financial section)",original version includes art  httpsnewmediacalcalistcoilmagazine241019a04htmlhttpsnewmediacalcalistcoilmagazine241019a04html  the writer is a journalist and at some point was the editor of timeout telaviv it might seem like a dream job from our perspective and then you stumble upon this column    i bought a car to get to work i insured it and i pay for gas to get there   i purchase and prep food to have at work and when i shop for clothes  i buy ones that would be comfortable to wear at my workplace i rather not go as far as saying that i pay rent so id have someplace to rest before work but unfortunately its true soon enough ill have children and ill be paying for daycare and various other similar arrangements for them because ill be at work  in order to escape this vicious cycle known as adulting or in less flattering terms life i could take various classes in what little time i have in the evening after i stood in traffic on my way back from work i could learn flamenco dancing or martial arts or go to a movie to consume some culture and once im done with those enriching activities  i can go to sleep and wake up early so i wont be late for work  i can also participate in all kinds of mindfulness movements live in the moment and choose to be happy statements not dissimilar to ones often uttered by prisoners you can put my body behind bars but as long as my mind is free i remain free  alternatively i can decide that its fine that i live at work and do the following dress up and go to the office as if im headed for a festive event or get the food i really like for myself to have at work they call it selfcare in america when they actually mean the commercialisation of self care i can decide its ohsomuchfun to chat up my coworker in the offices kitchen about what kind of salad she made on friday or establish an elaborate opinion on some reality tv episode everyones talking about to create a genuine and meaningful moment after all those are all tried and true methods to maintain ones humanity even during the darkest times in history even in murderous sects   truth be told i dont even know why i bother going to the gym or apply antiwrinkle creams on my face since the only people who get to see me in full daylight well fluorescent light are strictly forbidden from ever being attracted to me im not actually required to look good just presentable  who is to blame for all of this certainly not the cost of living alone people have been working since the dawn of days often times more than the 8 hours of fulltime employees or 14 hours of it slaves or the bizarre limbo of alwaysworking and neverworking of freelancers every population in this country is working all day long even the loaded ones are at work all day every day they just have to drive a more expensive car to get there   the blame lies in the illusion of free will   if i werent tricked into thinking i get some kind of a choice here i wouldnt have complained but i was always expected to acquire an education and build a career a satisfying career even to strive for selffulfilment and other damned lies so many wasted words just tell me to shut up and go to work ill understand tell me in advance that life is what happens for 3 hours every evening and ill set my expectations accordingly ill treat that time as sacred id prepare for it id work for it   and id be utterly truly happy,dp4jsc

9,A Brief Review on This Subs favorite Billionaire,welcome all today ill be discussing the one ceo who gets a pass the one who is almost godlike and is single handedly saving our lives the underdog according to some users in this sub actually or the only ceo who doesnt care about  yes still in this fucking sub well i thought id throw together some info on this supposed savior its early and i havent had my coffee or nicotine so i might leave out some of his highlights or my writing might not be perfect apologies    i spent a decent amount of time in a thread trying to inform other users of this sub yes of this sub that elon musk is no different than any other billionaire all replies to top comment herehttpswwwredditcomrantiworkcommentsdmym5sselfmadeutmsourceshareamputmmediumiosappamputmnameiossmf   instead of responding one at a time to his boot lickers i figured id just make a big ole list of reasons why you should stop worshipping him   first maybe we could look into why so many people are worshipping him and only him like most billionaires he has a team of workers who monitor his pr he even came out and talked specifically about reddit and his team working there  only linkless claim couldnt find it if anyone has info on it please send it to me from about twothree years ago  people in the thread were defending him for teslas break throughs and how much they help the environment ill touch on this last but first lets talk all things not tesla   hyperloop an idea birthed by the thought that you could be standing by anybody on a subway he has completed a mile of tunnel that was supposed to be offering free rides last december he now hails it as rampd and not the actual tunnel he had a plan to sell the dirt as compressed bricks then someone pointed out the housing crisis in his state now hes going to sell them at 10c a pop   that was may 2018 ive seen small demonstrations of the bricks being used if any musk stans who are lost and still hanging out in this sub have any info about the houses he built please pm   more specifics on the glorious tunnelhttpsusastreetsblogorg20181219elonmuskstunnelprojectinlosangelesisbadjoke   hes info on what the bricks could have been used forhttpswwwpopularmechanicscomtechnologyinfrastructurea20874588muskboringcompanydirtbrickscsebaffordablehousing hint they shouldnt leave the tunnel   phew well musk fans probably downvoted and moved on by now for those of you still with me lets talk maybe theyre reading the good news of musks new solar roof literally just launched v3 yesterday  and idea that originally launched in 2016 and dont worry these arent the same ones from earlier this yearpoor walmarthttpswwwbusinessinsidercomphotoswalmartrooftiedtoteslasolarpanelslawsuit20198 i kinda hope they are going to be like the ones from 2016 where thousands of people paid for a reservation and dozens received a product outstandinghttpswwwcnbccom20180924teslasolarrooftileswherearetheyhtmlutmsourceshareamputmmediumiosappamputmnameiossmf theres a video of a poor sap who paid a huge reservation and is waiting for a third year if anyone has it  now some people might come in and say musk is revolutionizing solar panels and making them used by the common man users also responded to me and said the same thing about teslas batteries people fail to realize musk bailed out solar city in 2015 and bought out his cousin fellow south african billionaire the tech was their before musk same with tesla using panasonic batteries he isnt making them accessible for the common man because the common man cant buy from him he isnt the only business offering solar and most business are going to look elsewhere after the wal mart lawsuit   does musk get new people to use greener methods yes he is a salesman selling things he didnt invent does almost every other billionaire who owns any stock in any energy company get people to use greener methods yes why is musk different because hes a meme and acting like he is your eco friendly buddy is way easier than being realistic   are environmentally conscious people following musks lead no theyve had solar panels for a decade  they drive a 10 year old used car that doesnt need raw materials and lithium that tesla doesnt even know how to recycle   now heres what really gets me people tell me all day that elon doesnt care about profits he only cares about bettering the world if you are in this sub and you believe this in your heart of hearts take three steps back and literally fuck your own face this is an anti work subwwwgooglecomsearchqmusklaborlawsampieutf8ampoeutf8amphlenusampclientsafarisbfbu1amppimusk20labor20laws  so many fucking results you could spend a day reading up on this union busting piece of shit tell me why he doesnt care about money and then explain why someone who has no needs for profits milks every last penny from his workers this link alone should tell you all you need to know   now on to tesla ill start off by saying what tesla not musk gets credit for making an electric vehicle that a younger crowd and not environmentally aware crowd wants  tesla made the first electric vehicle to most people while this is far from true many see it as fact  the battery is made by panasonic so dont be like users in the first thread i linked and praise elon for his battery break through the battery is also the best feature of the car dont get me started with other issues i have with the product worst paint amp panel gaps in the business interior feels like the plastic from a honda oddessy self driving bullshit that his idiotic customers believe and then pull some shit like reading while drivingetc etc  i have him credit where credit is due yes if any musk stans actually read all this please tell me what you think id love to hear you still justify his praise by telling me how he is still different than the others i am 100 sure some one out there will i am prepared to answer with other ceos that maybe we could worship instead because they help more than hurt why is he helping so much because space x do you miss the days we used to praise the astronauts and engineers and not the billionaire over lords who let them use a small fraction of their money or is he helping because rich people are buying teslas then trading them in three years later for a newer mercedes theyll drive for three years maybe the new tesla roadster would help too why make the cheapest ev you could for the masses when you could release an uber expensive one that goes fast    honorable mentions thai cave incident sec fining him over damaging tweets his twitter is more comparable to donald trump than any other celeb reddit user spilling his beans on space xttpswwwredditcomrenoughmuskspamcommentsc7pmafyesspacexreallydidfalsifytestdocumentsnoiutmsourceshareamputmmediumiosappamputmnameiossmf  his claim to help flints water crisis claiming to be socialist while union busting and being the largest donor for a republican pac people believing neuralink is coming in a year or so being a green ceo to all his lap riders and then selling them flame throwers they used once and forgot about   seriously if you read all of this and your thinking about what to comment to defend musk please get the fuck out of this sub you boot

12,Coercion and Choice,two arguments i see a lot from conservatives and capitalists are as follows  1 labor for income is not coercive because you can choose to work somewhere else or you can choose to be homeless and not work 2 labor for income is not coercive because nature is coercive so the capitalist is actually doing you a favor by providing you a solution to your hunger they are not exploiting your biological necessity  i have a couple of objections myself to these arguments but i am interested to hear anyone elses takes,dnx6nv

14,I quit. Feeling bittersweet about it.,hey reddit  cross posting this should have posted here first   i quit my job it feels so good for months i tried my hardest absolute damn hardest to make it work i was a manager at a big company and was extremely proud of my position and it was a big part of my identity until i realized how difficult it was to manage people who are double your age and dont care about you or what you have to say until i realized that people will call in for sneezing and then managers who are salaried have to always stay  until i realized that companies are eager to short staff their branches despite posting profit over profit each quarter sometimes managers managed multiples branches with a minimal raise until i realized nobody cared about what i had to say and just began to feel like i was a robot nobody remembered the good i did they remember the couple times i had to say no i remember putting together gift bags for holidays and barely getting a thank you i remember trying to get them to sign sympathy cards for other staff members losses and it was a bother  i took calls on vacations and off days for anything work related i came in on days off if needed too but it wasnt enough  i had to humble myself despite the fact that my family and friends were concerned that i would be stepping down from the great paycheck and title i worked so hard for i quit i feel bittersweet happy the stress and toxic environment is gone but i feel like a loser like as if i couldnt handle it and just walked away like a failure i feel like everyone is looking down upon me and i wish things could have been different but money isnt everything when its impacting your health and nobody wanted to work together as a team   and i am glad i am done i just wanted this off my chest just looking for support  thanks for reading,do1adn

30,Jobs always want more of you,no matter what i realized this pretty early on though not early enough considering how my dads dedication to his job destroyed our family and any stability i could hope to have as a kid by putting us through endless ridiculous moves and for what my dad never even pretended to enjoy his job it was a corporate job that always promised this time would be the last time wed all have to move sometimes to different countries that he wouldnt have to travel as much just wait another year i almost feel sorry for him if he actually believed them the first and only corporate internship i had i usually babysat for money but my dad figured that wasnt good enough i never had any complaints i love kids and its fun easy summer work for me and got me some job where his friend was the boss it was clear there was no actual work for me to do it was all bullshit but they still had some girl mentor me one day she asked me why i never asked her how i could improve my work i told her that shed never given me any indicator that my work was less than satisfactory she said that i should be trying to do more than was asked of me i laughed and told her this was just a job and i didnt really care about honing my craft or whatever she was trying to sell me she was so offended treated me like shit for the rest of the time   my social skills arent great probably has to do with moving constantly for my whole childhood and i just cant give what the corporate environment wants honestly though even if i did what amount of money could make me give up so much of my life for that for nothing if every corporate job disappeared tomorrow every jobless worker would be left with next to nothing in terms of actual practical skills for normal human life automation algorithms are coming for these jobs too its not like theyre difficult to automate it really makes me sad for the people in those jobs but relieved that im still pretty young and can avoid getting jobs that are essentially like games that rely on a loot crate based reward system but for your entire fucking life,dpjfyk

35,On Work and Appearance,ive been thinking a lot lately about the ways that work follows us even after weve clocked out  specifically ive been dwelling on how our jobs dictate the way we look inside and outside of work for context the majority of my experience comes from retail and office jobs my current office is relaxed in its dress code and most people adhere to something in the realm of business casual mostly i see jeans or khakis and even shorts in warm weather paired with anything from a basic tshirt to a button down there is rarely anyone wearing a tie in the office let alone a suit jacket yet like most offices it still feels like there is an unwritten acceptable look regardless of how relaxed the standard for clothing is    i am aware that my company is not in the norm regarding many of our appearance policies and i am grateful for that many employees have visible or semivisible tattoos and a few have their hair dyed nonnatural colors many companies would not allow even this level of expression be visible in the workplace though it still feels like there is an unwritten understanding that being too far outside the mainstream is basically asking to put a freeze on your advancementmobility or at the very least asking to get asked frequent questions about why you look different  obviously the dynamics of gender presentation professionalism client facing roles cultural tradition and many more factors impact how we look at work however the way we present ourselves to our bosses leaves a lasting impact on how we are permitted to present ourselves to others in our lives because dying my hair or getting an unprofessional hair cut or getting a visible tattoo might offend a potential employer im not allowed to alter these totally superficial parts of my body for longer than a weekend i have no option other than to look within one standard deviation of every other drone in my office with no visible personality even when i am in a situation outside of work where i can wear my own clothes i feel like i still just look like a yuppie asshole wearing a costume   our bosses usually have an oppressive amount of control over what we look like at work and because of this effectively control the limits of what our bodies can look like outside of work the only choice we have is to slave away to afford clothes that will make us feel more like ourselves,dp9l2x

38,Oliver Hart was a true underrated artist,no one really understands the experience that jades logic and paves an agnostic place to lay and decay in toxic waste so most carry identity paraphernalia to familiarize with smiles neatly painted on a robotic face but not this man he played the bucket with his hands and got paid by whatever change people would drop in his can twentythree years ago he was a lawyer by description but i guess all of a sudden he resigned from that position but ive never seen the sky quite as clear as his eyes as his blistered fingers beat down on the plastic and in a twisted sort of way it all makes sense while they rush to die he provides the soundtrack so tragic he sits on the corner of 7th and 1st and i was thirsty for the answer to a question anyone would nurse one day i asked he why he gave up his career he said i didnt i just took off the name tag then he added  make money and die thats the american way it dont matter what name you gave the bucket that you play make money and die thats the american way it dont matter what name you gave the bucket that you play  so i took in what was said but i didnt accept it well maybe i did i mean i just wouldnt admit it i was too committed to the belief that all the hard work from now would improve my future existence somehow so i said you dont accomplish nothing sitting in the street and im sure you barely survive off the pennies you gather he said to your surprise i make enough to eat and i accomplish just as much as you only i stop pretending my job matters he looked me in my face and told me i was a puppet and what i do is no more important than playing a bucket i still hear his voice when i set my alarm before bed i never could wash what he said out of my head so fuck it it goes  make money and die thats the american way make money and die thats the american way make money and die thats the american way it dont matter what name you gave the bucket that you play make money and die thats the american way make money and die thats the american way make money and die thats the american way it dont matter what name you gave the bucket that you play  see i can dress myself up in a white coat and say im a doctor carry a knob on my belt buckle with a gold badge and say im a copper maybe im just a sloppy lazy crazy carbon copy part of the heartlessly deranged nation that gave me the generation ecstasy under water i forgot the survivor of the mind washed and slaughtered ive watched your offers caught your calls and called your forefathers my bosses lost it all in the name of gaining enough to spend consuming the youth since those pray in doom for the hand my friends see when i saw my man playing away on his drum something clicked in my brain and i became less dumb im working for bread crumbs pretending theres a meaning but my employment is just a bucket im desperately beating and one day ill be old and retired looking at my life like what a waste of good fire all because school never taught me how to be inspired and the job concerned applying to myself just wouldnt hire,dp9ut2

40,Figured I’d post here to join the gang.,i work for a food packagingdelivery company a lot like schemas were a smaller company supplying a 5 state area we supply gas stations and grocery stores markets etc we have everything from candy chips snacks to frozen meat frozen breads frozen pastries to tobacco products beauty products and even chemicals like car fluids and a lot more  i work in the freezer in 20 degree temperatures  obviously its fucking shit when you start youre promised 4 10 hour shifts from 4pm 2am that never happens you cant leave until all the orders for the next day are picked and loaded onto the trucks during the summer months 15 hour work days were not uncommon every monday we were there until 7am  at least the rest of the week was about 1213 hours  now the hours themselves i can deal with but we have been at least 20 employees short of what is required to do the job since ive been there the middle management knows this relays this to the upper management but all they say is have a better attitude and it wont be so bad like really the job is impossible to do with this many people the management lies to their employees telling them what they want to hear but then going and literally doing the exact opposite of what they said   recently its gotten worse they are hiring a huge amount of new people however they dont make them start until 710pm everyone starts at different times and it leaves the rest of us to do 70 of the job ourselves while everyone else gets to come in late and still leave at the same time as us i dont know what theyre trying to do with this new shift but its supposed to take some of the workload off the rest of us and recently theyve just fired someone because they made a scene and drilled the president about the horrible health insurance   this place is just a fucking shit show none of our equipment works properly no one comes into work the night shift managers do literally nothing all night and just sit in the office and fuck off until something breaks down then they fix it and go back to sitting down 3 person jobs and pawned off on 1 person and they expect better attitudes out of everyone i dont know how people have been working here and being ok with it im quitting before the end of november and i hope it fucks them good with 60 of the freezer being new people now itll be funny to know that i one of the most knowledgeable working in there will leave making everyone else work harder  rant over could go on for longer but its already long af,dpd3rd

43,How is 9-5 a good work-life balance?,my country is generally overworked people including those in office jobs complain about working overtime and not being able to leave  im supposedly one of those luckier ones who leaves on time and have good worklife balance   the thing is how is 95 or more like 86 a good worklife balance say your day is broken up into 24  10 work  15 commute  1 breakfast and dinner  7 decent sleep  45 left for adult stuff like household chores and yourself you are telling me this is balance and theres those who work 12h shifts without weekends off   am i whiny or are most people deluded its really insane to me that people think they all will live long and healthily enough to enjoy their earnings,dpnxx4

49,Solutions (discuss),so theres plenty of posts of people complaining about the status quo understandable but i think it would be nice for us to discuss some alternatives and solutions for a change i dont mean voting and election related stuff i mean tangible practical strategies for helping each other figure out a way out of the daily grind   some suggestions   1 starting a commune finding some land or a place in ur own or another country to imigrate to pooling resources to build and help build some idealistic socialist or other place where we could live sustainably 2 starting up buisnesses or self employment advice like do people have marketable skills andor ideas for things that could be used for such ends i do software development and are making video games in my spare time id welcome other people with game devs related skills to contact me if they are interested in working on a some projects maybe some day we could sell some games and break into self employment that way 3 off the grid living advice how tos or directions towhere to find such resources like the details of buying land and getting planning permission i know there are curtain kinds of mortgages in some places for the purchase of land with the intent of building your own house on it that are cheaper than buying a house with a regular mortgage for some of us some savings and a good credit rating isnt to far out of the realm of reason 4 bit more wacky of an idea but crowd funding charity maybe if ubi isnt going to be government funded people would be willing to contribute to creating a ubi fund of course who would be eligable for payouts and so forth would be a complicated matter but prehaps some sort of small scale regional experiments could be done somehow   discuss,do97ib
50,"I analysed the music I listened to as a child, teenager and young adult",back in 2017 i analysed some of my music and an underlying theme popped up striving for freedom and going against conformity and control this wasnt even by design i just happened to like the music growing up even more recently with the songs that just stuck in my memory but i didnt particularly set out to listen to eg they were part of a video game soundtrack or something  what odes our music choice say about us was i already on some level aware that people and therefore me at some point in my past selfs future hand over control of their lives somebody else be it for the purposes of work or whatever have you ever had something like this that has just made you think,dnzwks
51,"I want to share my “change of mindset, change of life” story. Hoping to start a conversation and better understand how r/antiwork thinks.",wall of text my apologies   i used to have this mindset that rich people were assholes and because i was working a shitty deadend job that i was entitled to the free healthcare housing and the works hated everything remotely capitalist and attended a few minimum wage protests   at some point in my early twenties something flipped in my brain  i needed to stop feeling sorry for myself and get my shit together because i couldnt wait for anything to change i lost hope that politics in the us would change to benefit me in any way any time soon   i started reading leadership books watching motivational speakers on youtube researching entrepreneurship i realized that i didnt have the ability to start my own business so i started looking around for startup companies that were hiring it took two years from that point for me to find an entry level position at a company that hadnt even opened yet   when i got the job i was employee number five on the payroll and the first hire to my department under the manager my starting wage was 15hr which i thought was amazing because i was only making 850hr before literally felt on top of the world after my first week i had this crazy sense of opportunity at this company  it was a huge motivator for me   i made my job my priority and passion because this was a brand new company there werent really any procedures in place i started thinking about the best ways to run the storefront typed up all my ideas and consistently presented them to my manager   six months after i started there were now 7 employees working alongside me in the same entry level role the manager was an older man and had become less present over time i figured that since he was gone most of the time that i could help the other employees get oriented   fast forward a couple months later and we were open i was working 12hr days doing everything i could to make the business successful was i making the owner of the company a lot of money yes but i knew that he had put in 5 years of work and dumped his life savings into starting this company without making a dime before this point   a year goes by and i was promoted to supervisor making 20hr again i was thrilled i never thought id be making this kind of money in my entire life motivation was through the roof however i was also irritated because the department manager hardly did anything and was certainly making far more than i was he got a new car new clothes i was jealous but that drove me to push myself even harder   two years in the department manager resigned we had no one leading the department except for me i figured that i would be moved into his role right after he left but that didnt happen i stayed at the same wage and same title nothing i was furious and thought about leaving because i thought everything that i had done had gone unnoticed and unappreciated i began drifting back to my old mindset that the world was against me and i had no direction but i had put in so much time and so much effort that i decided to stick it out   another year goes by and now were getting acquired by a corporation son of a bitch now i was going to have to prove myself all over again to these new people i was ripshit but stayed on and continued to try my best   a few months later the acquisition was final and i was approached by the executive vice president of the corporations operations division we had just lost a couple managers from other departments because corporate thought they werent a good fit and i thought i was next on the chopping block but to my surprise they had offered me the position of operations manager with a probationary salary of 60kyear   two thoughts went through my head in that conversation finally and holy shit am i capable of this i had no idea what was going to happen but i pushed on and worked my ass off still 12 hour days and now working from home on my days off i was nonstop and started burning out   they saw what i was doing and shockingly after my probationary period was up i got a review and a massive raise to 80k a year again i was on top of the world and now responsible for the success of a team of 60 people including 5 managers below me   last month over 4 years after starting at the company i was approached again and given a heads up that they want me to soon take over as the regional director for my corner of the country this role will put me in charge of 4 locations and almost 200 people and is sure to send my salary somewhere into sixfigure range   i know my situation is unique  rare and progressing this quickly is nowhere near normal but my outlook on life has changed and my sense of self responsibility has skyrocketed i no longer look at the wealthy and think fuck you now its i want to be you   yes there are some filthy rich scumbag motherfuckers out there that dont deserve what they have but i dont compare myself to them anymore im not jealous im in charge of my life and how it turns out and hopefully im able to make others lives better along the way if i ever am fortunate enough to enter the ranks of the 1 i wont be selfish because i get it i came from almost nothing and know how it feels to struggle every day  rent or food gas or medicine helping others is what i really want to do someday     again just wanting to start a thoughtful conversation and hear your honest thoughts of my current situation do you feel i am wrong or contributing to the nature of the country for making the changes i did,dnvnvo

62,Words,this may be a rant i havent fully formulated what i want to say yet but i need to vent to someone and this seems as good a place as any  i recently moved across state from a rural town to a city im lucky enough to have family here that is letting me stay with them until i can afford a place of my own 21 btw im a creative person and i was hoping it would have more opportunity for me  after being turned down by a few places and ignored by many during my job search out of semidesperation i filled out an application for ups at completion of the form i was automatically booked to meet with them for a tour at 5am in a few days after taking the tour the guide asked us pretty much pointblank who was in i originally wanted to give it a day or two to think it over but since this seemed like a take it or leave it sorta deal i raised my hand in retrospect i believe this is the reaction they were banking on   fun fact the job is pretty bullshit they said so up front didnt beat around the bush on that which i admire in some respects but yeah getting up at 2503am driving 20 minutes and stuffing 1200 boxes into four trucks by myself for five hours with a 15minute break is pretty bullshit especially for a skinny shrimp like me whos not really that physically minded in the first place  so needless to say this is taking quite a toll on me mostly emotionally and mentally ive always try to do my best for my employers and this job isnt an exception so its disheartening when it feels what i do isnt good enough to get the job done well emphasis on feels there because deep down i know that it isnt a problem with me theyve literally said that im in a shitty situation somewhat apologetically most other workers load three trucks with less packages going into each  all i do now is sleep dread work spend money i think the money component is an effort at escapism ive been investing more in things that make me happy like my art or books but this means im quite literally living paycheck to paycheck no real savings to fall back on im pretty desperate to get out of there especially with christmas around the corner but i just dont feel i should consider that option until i have other worksavings lined up im doing my best to get other work but im worried that the longer i wait the worse for wear ill be  so thats a bunch of words sorry maybe this sub isnt the best fit for them just wanted to let it out thanks for listening feel free to advise if you feel so led,dox1ta

95,Celebrating a decade of burnout and exhaustion.,im 29 going on 84  im so god damn tired i have worked myself into a relatively cushy office job but that makes no difference i work the same 40 hours as everyone else doing tedious mental gymnastics for a local health boards it department  its on paper the best job ive ever had but all i can think about while im at my desk is crawling home to spend an hour with my kids before they go to bed  i had a taste of a free life when i was still a kid i was homeschooled between the ages of 11 and 15 and the sense of freedom to be able to up an leave the house any day of the week and go anywhere i wanted was massively under appreciated by 12 year old me  i had the same freedom in 2008 after the recession hit at i was unemployed besides degrading myself for an hour or two a day by groveling for a job i had total freedom over my time it was amazing  ive been constantly employed since 2010 and ive never had the time or money for a holiday every day is more exhausting than the last and not even weekends are a rest because those two days are my only chance to maintain my rental property to the standards laid out in my tenancy agreement  i have retired boomer family who advise me to work extra hard in order to stand out at work to push for more responsibility in the hopes of promotion to strive for my dream job but no matter how many times i spell it out for them they dont get it  my dream job is to not ever need to work again to spend all my time exploring hobbies and chilling out with my wife and kids to finally feel rested  its never going to happen for me  but on the bright side only 37 more years until i reach new zealands retirement age and get to just keep on working because in what world are we going to be able to afford retirement,dpeduw
96,I don't now what to do,i dont know where exactly to post this im sorry if this breaks some rule but i really need it to reach someone  ive spiralling down into a cycle of existential doubt hatred

rforeveralonehttpswwwredditcomrforeveralone raboringdystopiahttpswwwredditcomraboringdystopia rcollapsehttpswwwredditcomrcollapse rmisanthropyhttpswwwredditcomrmisanthropy etc i would be a member of rsanctionedsuicidehttpswwwredditcomrsanctionedsuicide if it still existed i occasionally lurk their forums my view of the world and my life is one of anger regret and shame i cant find any hope and im constantly coping and procrastinating due to having no willpower motivation im not suicidal though which i guess makes me sane enough not to be thrown into the psychiatric system or medications right away i dont have delusions i do have mild anxiety im more of a melancholic  the point is that i dont think any of this is due to having negative thoughts like it were something i can change magically or me having an illness i think the cause to be the state of the world things dont work for me and i just cant get out of this negative state ive been over the last years i think my melancholy and my rage against the system people my past my lack of romantic partners and my social anxiety are too much to bear theres just no way back for me its like ive discovered some truth some hard and dark truth about the world everything loses its mystery its magical properties and becomes meaningless theres no point in pain theres no point to selfimprovement to keep going still i keep going forward like inertia the state of anhedonia is everywhere i want a partner yet i dont care to go out or plan dates i want to study yet i procrastinate i want to write read exercise yet i game for hours without feeling much better  im tired of the common sense advice of go see a therapist exercise eat healthy wake up at 4am and make world peace those things may work for normies people who are stable enough and alienated enough so that they dont see life as something bad that have all in all a sense of progress a sense of hard work and pain paying off in the future protestant ethic a good social circle success in their romantic lives they can at least relieve their sexual impulses but for the many who are left out of the normal pleasures of life who are left out of hope in the future hope of finding a good job or buying a house because they realize those goals are nonsense etc whats left for them for them therapy is useless and medication is almost an insult you cant change reality and your life keeps sucking so you are drugged to calm down and become a cog in the machine once again therapy cant do anything against systemic pressures bad luck or huge feelings of anhedonia and depression the same goes for the other advice exercise play an instrument go out im miserable everytime and i dont think life is worth creating or living in the slightest my life is like a collection of numbing alienating breaks in between of pain boredom stress sadness  i really think theres like two different worlds people belong to and at least i am in the world in which no matter what i do what attitude i try to take nothing matters nothing gives me any kind of realization any kind of joy ive been humiliated bullied rejected treated condescendingly forgotten so many times that i have no will to try in social life anymore i dont care about meeting new people i would want to have sex and a relationship and this may look contradictory i just dont want to deal with the process anymore my interests and my personality are not made for this ruthless system of competition i dont care about jobs making money having a good resume i literally hate the way the world functions and i cant accept it i cant fit in this system is madness the only thing i look forward to is to do nothing at the end of day to lay in bed for hours indulging in entertainment porn music maybe im horribly desensitized by this consumption i also have symptoms of adhd the point of the matter however is that my worries and thoughts about life by far surpass anything that could be explained by mere addiction theory or so i believe as i also have a lot of other fronts to cover  reddit is an escape mechanism i get to comment and read posts from people like me or that think like me in some areas its a safe space safe from all the bullshit media culture social media pages social ostracism or social judging i can write whatever passes through my head no repressed emotions ideas if i hate working i can vent if i feel depressed i can go look other people who are going through the same thing if im angry about society i can complain and share ideas freely without being afraid bless this webpage and some of its communities however i cannot but think theyve radicalized and veered me off some good path of obedience discipline positivity i was bitter and angry before but i never had this kind of existential hatred and philosophies andor groups of people truly dedicated to understanding it  i dont know what to do i dont know which attitude to take how to be motivated i dont know how to even begin to work on my goals and not return to a cycle of hatred and hedonism ive tried the usual diet  exercise  going out combo for months ive tried rnofaphttpswwwredditcomrnofap rstopgaminghttpswwwredditcomrstopgaming rnosurfhttpswwwredditcomrnosurf etc ive turned off my pc and uninstalled everything more times than i can count ive tried meditating learning languages changing countries travelling making new friends nothing does it for me i am not consistent im always back at square one with a horrible sensation of despair always unable to do what id like to be doing always being a shadow of what i could be theres something about people who succeed in fixing their lives and achieving really big changes in their way of life and their socialromantic lives something that i dont know if i have because i dont even know what it is ive always felt i was incomplete like i wasnt like the rest i didnt have that easiness about work friends studies romantic partners etc that they had i had the existential doubts and despair that they didnt but im sure im missing out on some key factors  i dont even know why im posting this to cope to seek help to vent to share my experience to motivate discussion i have no idea i would like to thank anyone who read this mess of a post where i constantly ramble about myself have a good day,dpaywd
97,I've been fired and I don't know how to feel about it,the title pretty much says it all my boss despite being told repeatedly that i had health issues fired me because i took too many bathroom breaks during the day despite the fact that i met his quotas and completed everything he wanted it was simply not okay for me to take an occasional 34 minute break to respond to messages on my phone  while this puts a serious damper on my plan to leave the state and to become more of an independent person i cant bring myself to be upset for anything other than my inability to leave the man was an absolute nightmare to work for and i was only a step above being a slave to him the aforementioned demand that i not take bathroom breaks his constant monitoring that would keep eric blair up at night a workplace that was hellish to try and work in it all came together for the worst job ive ever had  and while im not receiving severance while i only have a few hundred in my bank account now i cant be upset i dont think on the bright side of things hes currently involved in a lawsuit he has no chance of winning with luck he will lose everything hes taken from me,do0uxk
98,"automation of jobs, and an idea",ever since i was a kid my parents have always told me that robots were gonna come and take all the lowend jobs theyre easy to produce cost way less than having humans there and are far more accurate and they were always scared of it it didnt make sense to me then and doesnt make sense to me now if all the menial taskwork we need done can be done by robots then why not just give people money and let them do what they want and let the robots do their job   like im wording this weirdly but it seems like robots are going to take all the minimum wage jobs should be something to be celebrated but because capitalism it means people have to work even harder to not only find jobs but keep them because theyre competing against perfect machines to be paid 15 an hour it makes no sense  idk automation has always been super interesting to me and it seems like a combo of 1 higher taxes on the rich especially ceos 2 automation of minimumwage jobs and 3 redistribution of the wealth from the ceos to those who were laid off by the robots should at least give people time to pursue something that they enjoy doing instead of work the robots are cheaper to maintain so if prices stay the same or even drop the ceos and robot managers are making more money at the same rate of sale and then that can be funnelled back into the pockets of the working class  its not as completeanarchy as i want it to be but its the best explanation ive found that my dad a hardcore capitalist who still believes in capitalism after having to file for bankrupcy when his store shut down last christmas actually believes might work so thoughts,do2721

132,I am 30 years old and have never had a job. I have the benefit of somewhat supportive parents (financially) but not emotionally. Yet the worse thing to me is ending up in a wage-slave relationship. What should be my plan of attack?,basically my parents have helped me financially all these years because thats their only way of showing affection most of the emotional issues i deal with is due to their somewhat toxic behavior   i have never had a job due to being somewhat picky and not wanting a worse life there is a lot of terrible advice online when it comes to job submission dont complain work hard dont think you are better than the position anyone want to work for a toxic chemical plant or a factory that destroys your hearing or amazon that lets a person die from a heart attack just be glad you are employed at all   to me the rants mantras and justification towards wageslave labor feels very similar to how people justify buying apple products   it is a cult   anyways i want something that will give me the skills to progress within a healthy dynamic within work for example if i get any job and end up in retailfast food then 5 to 10 years down the line i will only be qualified for more fast food and retail work  due to the forced selectivity i could not gain better working conditions because there are many more desperate people willing to work for less and work longer in these positions   basically my goals are more inline within the so good they cant ignore you mindset than the cult of work mindset of employed any at all  good   what would you suggest,doskpj

135,PTSD-type fear of time clock systems?,this may sound a bit weird but i thought some people here would probably understand i am very afraid of the fact that my job is now out of nowhere using a fingerprint time clock instead of allowing us to report our time then have our managers check over it i know this is normal for most workers but i have a weird fear and probably privilege for being in a field digital marketing where we are supposed to be professionals and having a college degree from a well regarded school  this job is way better than my last one but i am already scared that this is going to be used to fire me because i know other people have said that time theft is an excuse for firing many companies use  at my old job every minute and second of our work day was monitored through a computer application time clock that required us to log when we used the bathroom to have it deducted from our breaks took screenshots of our computers alerted managers if we visited a nonworkrelated website then tried to clock us out for it and clocked us out if we stopped typing or moving the mouse for more than five minutes it was apparently used against many employees to build a case to fire you or force you to quit not to mention to dock peoples pay   after this experience i became traumatized my doctor actually put me on disability from the panic from this job so now when my new better job added this time clock out of nowhere it makes me feel like the world is closing in on me it feels like this is the first step to cracking the whip and workplace tyranny starting here this is even though my boss likes me compliments me and has given me more hours though some of my duties did get changed a bit for reasons not related to performance   obviously punctuality time on task and not taking breaks are not the kind of metrics that bode well for me so i am really scared of the consequences of a mess up especially since this is the closest thing to a good job i have had in years and i may never find a job as good as this one   have any of you had a similar aversion to time clocks or tracking,dkudt1

137,I feel like my job is holding me hostage.,i work for a police department in a midsized suburb ive been here for 55 years and im about to put a hot one through my frontal lobe its absolutely unceasingly consistently soulsucking i work third shift and my entire job consists of typing reports that the officers have recorded on a little voice recorder and uploaded not only is it third shift but the schedule rotates so i never have the same off days its like the work equivalent of chinese water torture or sleep deprivation torture    i have a wife and two little kids at home and i have absolutely zero semblance of a routine or a schedule because my entire life revolves around meeting their schedule when im not at my job i have to be a dick to get any sleep and it causes a ton of tension in my family i sleep maybe 3035 hours in an entire week i never have time to shower or eat healthy or get any exercise and ive gained a ton of weight from it    this job pays really well for what it is and its probably the most i can make in my current situation ive been doing this for 5 years so my family has built our life around this income and the baller health insurance they give us ive even been told by my boss who is a cop btw that i have no grounds to complain about my job because they pay us too much i feel so guilty about hating it because if i could stomach it it would be a great gig but i hate it i hate my schedule i hate most of my coworkers and i fucking hate cops    all i want to do is quit and be a bartender i feel like im fucking seeping into the chair and floor below my desk and my mental health is shit my therapist even told me to quit my job i want to do something less corporate government structured responsible but in order to quit my family will take a financial hit if i dont quit im gonna end up not being very useful to my family how do you balance paying the bills and not wanting to put my head under a squad car shit if i didnt have a family id move into a van at this point so i wouldnt be so dependent on making money rant,dkxy1h
138,Can't believe this is it until I die,a bit of a rant i guess   cant believe that life is just going to be working an unfulfilling job for people who dont give a shit right up until the day i either die or physically can not work anymore and in the latters case ill likely just end up homeless anyway  i work full time and take something like 14 credits at school its not even a sustainable schedule  i give up the possibility of a full nights sleep every single night during the week so i can make sure im putting in all of my hours at work and getting all of my homework done its wild to me that we live in a culture where doing this make you look like a hard and dedicated worker in the eyes of others when the very idea of it should be fucking insane to any normal person im not doing it because i want to do it im not getting an accounting degree because i just love the thought of dull accounting work for the rest of my life im doing this because im trying to grab at the slight chance that one day i wont have to worry about one financial crisis being the complete death of me  its insane to me that we have to cling on to the hope that someday things maybe wont be awful for us i dont understand how im just supposed to be okay with being miserable and working most of my time away for the rest of my life   ive been sick recently too and by the grace of my corporate overlords ive been granted a reasonable health plan that allows me to get myself screened for various ailments lo and behold i may actually have cancer 26 years old with the possibility of cancer and ive done nothing but serve a corporate master for most of my adult life on the plus side if i actually am that sick and its at a point where fighting it is useless ill just drop everything and spend the rest of my time doing whatever the hell i want with my fiance i refuse to die miserable,dlburx

142,Confessions of a Soon-to-Be Wage Slave,im currently in school pursuing the general field of industrial maintenance ive been living in the south and observing the rhetoric around work so far ive learned many things but below ive listed some of my favorite life lessons  1 99999 accidents in the workplace are avoidable and can be traced back to human error and thusly they are your fault if a machine breaks down and injures someone or impacts company profits it doesnt matter whether or not you slept last night if you even had time to eat breakfast this morning it is your fault and you will be fired   2 you will not have a life at home this is okay though as it will help you work your way up the food chain with the constant promise of finally having enough money to make it in reality youll be drinking applesauce from a tube by the time you can afford the home you wanted but thats your fault   3 your company is always there for you until they arent youre a valuable resource and they will always be willing to take care of you until you need to be taken care of   4 if you have complaints youre acting entitled nothing is free in life and if you expect it to be youre part of the problem you wouldnt show up to work if you had a house and a roof over your head right because everyone is perfectly happy living with the bare minimum incredibly basic needs to live like health insurance some kind of housing and food its simply unimaginable that people would bother going to work for better amenities if they already have what they need   5 if you cant find a job then youre not trying if you cant get a job then you arent looking if you need a car to get to the job ride a bike if you dont have a bike walk if its too farrainycold to do either you shouldve found work somewhere closer if you cant find work closer to you nuh uh theres always a job if that job doesnt pay well then thats your fault   ill be honest in saying that i used to buy into the idea that we need to work for everything now i can hardly utter the words why should i have to work to live before i have every set of eyes in the room trained on me if i had a livable apartment no health insurance costs to worry about and no college tuition my ass would be working double the hours i am right now   there are things i want in life and im fine with the idea that i need to work if i want to build the home i want or buy the car i like as far as im concerned nudging people closer to the things they want is a great motivator having been an athlete for many years ive found that im always sprinting the fastest when i see the finish line   but maybe im crazy right,dl38nt

147,i can’t tell if my boss is walking over me or not,up until recently ive enjoyed my job quite a bit i work at a car wash and the basic premise of what we do is cashier and then guide the cars in with cleaning involved of course i have a good relationship with my boss and hes a good guy but whenever i disagree with him its like im a complete fuckin idiot and clearly dont know what im talking about were not a busy store so majority of the day is spent doing not much of anything once were done cleaning we have nothing to do other then clean the shit we just cleaned so my regional manager my bosses boss is always up his ass and consequently my coworkers and i he always wants us doing something no matter what 2 ish months ago he checked the cameras and watched us do nothing after completing cleaning and kinda just wait for cars to come in for a wash like i said we arent busy so well get maybe 20 cars in 23 hours so once he saw that we didnt have shit to do my man went crazy about our chairs calling us lazy pieces of shit and physically throwing out chairs because of how angry he was no we clean and are more organized then before yet we still spend most of our time in our office since everything is normally always done the only difference is we stand for around 8 ish hours doing absolutely nothing after finishing everything this takes a massive fuckin toll on me my feet have been hurting like hell my hip has been giving out and my back has been giving me problems too  at this point i just want to point out i am 18 years old and this is my first real job   my boss doesnt let me sit down anywhere and if i complain he either makes fun of me or says to go take a 10 minute break in the break room let me also say that i put in so much fuckin work and i come in on my off days if i get called im the main opener i go above and beyond what im meant to do even so far as actually doing my bosss job training a new store leader and pretty much all of my assistant store leaders job i applies for it yet he got picked for some insane fuckin reason and he hasnt done shit but make me clean up his mess   in my honest opinion i feel as if im the hardest worker in my job and i dont mean to be like sucking my own dick but i try my hardest while most people do not and i just want to know if im being taken advantage of or not  i enjoyed the job prior but now its gotten to the point where its a slog and during the winter my hours get cut almost in half while still expecting the same amount of work and not being able to take any sort of break short of a 10 minute rest,dlbe0r

154,"Guys, a question. Please help me out.",so i left my toxic job relaxing to say the least i gave the resignation a few weeks back  after 7 months i was still in probation so there was no need for me to serve the notice period but i wanted closure so i agreed to the notice period   2 weeks before my senior aka an idiot had asked for something i had taken leave between those days and when i came back there was a network issue the whole week   i promptly was unable to do it now this guy called me up and started yelling at me at which i cut the call and left office taking an impromptu leave    when he called me today i didnt pickup his calls nor respond to his messages  well he escalated this to the manager who called me and told me that im an incompetent idiot and told me off   now my mental health id have to say that isnt always the best id had breakdowns due to this job earlier and his telling me off just pushed me off the edge quite a little bit i was on the verge of depression again  if i was the way i was before i definitely would have killed myself   now after this i didnt pick up the call at all from anybody i was not feeling good enough to pick up any calls at all so when they called i didnt pickup any calls  now the manager has whatsapped me asking me what happened why i am not responding etc his last message was threatening me saying that if i dont pick up his calls he will report me as missing me to the police i dont know if thats legally possible that is one part of my question  also should i give them any closure should i explain why i left  i feel like i dont owe him that but i need your advice,dl3og9

160,The main problem with the 40hour work week (for me at least),tldr at bottom  i see a lot of people complain about the 40 hour work week and a lot say its bad for different reasons some state its cause it tires you out so much which is true some say that it doesnt pay enough for the amount of work which is definitely true and most state the lack of breaks which is really true my main problem is how it effects experiencing life ive always been a i would rather have a experience than a expensive object sort of person so ive always liked enjoying life the problem with work isnt that it stops you from enjoying life plenty people will argue that you can just plan around your work work gets rid of spontaneity and thats its biggest crime when i was working minimal because of school about 16 hours i loved being able to do something on the drop of a hat dad wants to get a beer and watch the game on a random tuesday sounds awesome parents have tickets they cant use so theyre up for grabs sounds like a fun night work gets rid of moments like that either because youre working you have to wake up early the next day for work you have a family so your free time is spent watching the kids or youre so exhausted all you want to do is sleep life shouldnt always be planned out life should be an experience that changes and grows we shouldnt be stuck in a rut and fill out forms to experience life  tldr 40 hour work week gets rid of the spontaneity and enjoyment out of life,dn4shy

219,Just got a job where I do nothing for 90% of my day,for the last 5 years of my life since i entered the workforce in earnest working has been the 1 cause of my worsening mental state its not that im lazy at all im just  not the kind of person who feels okay about throwing so much of my life away making money for other people which im sure a lot of you can relate to   then about two months ago i got a job at a university dispatch center i have never had a job like this before where i could just go in and read a book or draw and get paid for it we have a low call volume and my boss doesnt care what i do with my downtime everyone else there hates how boring it is but i love it its the only job ive ever had any positive feelings towards ive been taking some online programming classes in my downtime there and ive read more books in the last few months than i have in years the pay isnt very good but its enough for me to pay my bills and have a bit left over which is all i really need  i think i was so stuck on finding a job that i would enjoy that i hadnt even considered that there are plenty of jobs that dont really require much of you except to show up sure i have the odd stressful day and deal with a lot of stupid people but it certainly beats working in food service not to mention when i am actually doing work its work that helps people im so fucking relieved,dkkll5

229,Job hopping like a happy bunny,hey everyone last night i stumbled upon this sub and read as many posts as i could and i think i want to share my thoughts this will be a long post so heres a tldr  job hopping helped me gain perspective on what is normal in a workplace   i am an almost 25 years old woman i have attended university and the years i was there were extremely busy but also extremely fulfilling i studied classics and linguistics in my country this is a kind of prestigious degree not on par with lawyers or doctors but close in a way i also tutored children and teens for little to no money but i covered my expenses i was so happy i woke up every day at 600 with no alarm clock exercised took care of my diet went to my classes had the perfect notes i would share with anyone who needed them and after 9 hours of class i would tutor for 2 or 3 hours   in 2016 my family had some financial problems i live with my mother my father has passed away and the government cut almost half her pension which was not large at all to begin with for two years i tried to push through with cutting my expenses and tutoring in order to help us but it was not enough so when the father of one of my students told my that their business was hiring i took the opportunity and got my first job   it was okay i was not passionate about it like i am with teaching but the money was good enough and the hours were fair no overtime paid vacation etc after a year and a half it got tedious and some things came out of the woodwork i was the only young person and woman in there so i had to endure many absurd comments my work was not fulfilling i was a bad fit and i do not say that as a bad thing i just didnt click with this job no big deal thats how i see it now at that moment i was rather sad and frustrated   so i applied to any job i thought would be a better fit for me i was lucky enough to find a job as a secretary for a private school i loved everything there except for the owner my boss was horrible he would swear insult me use vulgar language for the shock of it everyone avoided him all my coworkers said that they had cried at work and that it is normal to feel frustrated in there so i tried to do my job and ignore his insults that was until he told me i would be working 12 hours on saturdays and sundays we had a discussion meaning i presented my arguments and he yelled and barked at me that i was lazy entitled the whole nine just because i wanted one day of the weekend for my family and friends   the next day i didnt go to work one morning when he was not there i went to sign my papers and take the money he owed me i had already found another job at a publishing house again as a secretary my feelings were not good for this one since the interview but i needed the money they didnt match my previous salary they expected me to stay overtime no extra money of course and the owner an 83 year old man was a handful he would storm in 2 hours before closing swearing for no reason and expected me to do many things out of my duties and stay overtime because he arrived late he would also go on long passionate speeches about my generation and how difficult we have it and how we must fight the man and claim what is ours all that while he didnt want to give me 10 above minimum wage  i stayed with him for 10 days why when my cousin went into labor and i asked to leave an hour early because things were not going well he told me that my cousin would still be in the hospital in one hour and i could go then   i had another offer by a young man and his sister who operate an eshop with decorative items and furniture i took it on the spot when i went to quit my boss told me i was unethical that no one would want to hire me and give me more than the minimum wage unless i worked in a brothel and that it is a good thing my father is dead and he cant see what his daughter has become   i cried on the pavement outside work and took 10 days to myself where i mostly sorted out the garage and drank i was afraid of my new job but i couldnt admit it to anyone   yesterday was my first day no one yelled no one cursed me when things didnt go well even though i have experience on the job they didnt expect me to know everything they trained me by showing me everything and answered my questions we even joked and shared some stories when they told me i could use the coffee maker if i wanted coffee something the other bosses didnt allow it clicked this is what normal is at least for work not crying not yelling not swearing just working side by side tackling tasks and having a laugh along the way  i am still not too optimistic but things finally seem to go well and with my new peace of mind i will try to make more of my life and pursue the things i am passionate about,dldkb5
230,Boss ruining my day in one sentence; questioning my sanity sometimes,my boss at my minimum wage slacker job i picked this job specifically because i only need to be physically present and aside from that can do whatever i want with my time just noticed that i read a book and asked me what it was she then flat out asked me whether i wouldnt want to make something out of my life someday which triggered a lot of anger and shame i guess  i am 25 and had good grades in school but always felt alienated got kicked out of three schools and after graduating five years ago got hit with depression really hard ive come a long way since then and realized a lot about our fucked up culture how conditioned we all are how most people have their self worth tied to their success in the system in job titles reviews credits etc  in our family we had the good fortune of growing up with a father who came from nothing and made something out of himself all the while not gaining an inch of inner peace or doing anything really worthwhile for society or anyone but our material welfare inside the family he still drank himself to near death had a stroke was overweight and neglected his mental health and spiritual wellbeing essentially emotionally neglecting us in the process of it all i consider that a gift and a curse since i realized early that the rewards of modern capitalistic society are mostly empty he also was very permissive and tried to never shape my opinions in any way always respecting my feelings and never judging me which is probably the perfect breeding ground for someone with adjustment disorder lol  now i dont know how i want to proceed from here on out what i dont want is to make these decisions out of status or monetary fear like almost everyone does i luckily dont have to pay rent for the foreseeable future but god the fucking pressure is almost unbearable sometimes  everyone questions you all the time and you internalize that voice in school   i sometimes feel like im radicalizing and deluding myself with those ideas instead of ariving at a more accurate picture of reality so i guess im just looking for validation and reassurance that im not going crazy,dlfkop

245,Toxic Bullying culture at work,im in the uk currently signed off work for stress ive been in my retail job 11 years in that time my managers have tried unfairly dismissing me and have blocked me moving up both in and out of the company through lying or being wilfully inflexible in the last three years i was placed with an older colleague he claimed the management were trying to bully him out his mental health began declining he became increasingly difficult to work with he would rail at me over trifling differences of opinion on procedural things in front of customers he would be absent for months at a time with stress because he was in litigation with the management they began managing at an increasing distance that meant responsibility for running the shop all but fell to me   in june last year my colleague completely lost the plot and started swearing at me and physically threatening me id never reported his behaviour before as i knew he had mental health issues and issues with the management at the same time i couldnt continue being abused by my colleague hed crossed the line so i reported him but asked not to raise a formal grievance i thought that if i gave him the space to reflect hed realise i wasnt his enemy and hed have room to climb down and apologise on his own my manager had a different idea and decided to raise a formal grievance as a matter of his duty of care he convinced me that i effectively had a similar duty of care to ensure the issue was properly addressed so no one else would be bullied i provided a statement he was found guilty after an investigation he wasnt fired but told he would have to apologise and that there would be an external mediator brought in to the shop to work with us   whilst my colleague considered his position he was off from work i told my manager i had serious concerns about working with my colleague again he had had altercations with several other members of staff and tended to hold grudges after the event my manager said he expected my colleague to hold a grudge against me and that that was the reason he wanted me to continue to work with him i would be a trap he told me once again about my duty of care if i were transferred to another branch someone else would need to be brought in meaning the whole cycle would repeat itself if i stood firm and he acted out again it would be brought to an end whilst my colleagues own concerns about the management trying to get rid of him were in the back of my mind i was still raw from what had happened between us over the preceding 2 years the thought of allowing someone else to go through that swayed my decision to back my managers plan my colleague did not return but resigned   my manager immediately came up to me and thanked me profusely saying hed been trying to get rid of the guy for 18 years my heart sank what had i allowed myself to be a part of 6 weeks later a new manager steps in all the responsibilities that had fallen to me in the preceding years were taken back but so too was the small freedom to self manage my day that had gone along with that responsibility i was being micromanaged on every aspect of the job my colleagues told me the new manager had been criticising me to them behind my back saying i was arrogant useless had an attitude problem and needed putting in my place all the while to my face he kept calling me buddy and was constantly patting me on the back he then moved me to another branch adding an hour to my day and extra travel costs giving me no real consultation i asked him to reconsider but he was unmoved ive never had a bad staff review nor failed to honour my contractual obligations in 11 years in retrospect its easy to see i was naive but i genuinely hoped that after my colleague resigned things could get a little bit easier a little less stressful its been anything but   ive gone through my union but the bar for constructive dismissal is so high that even with statements from colleagues and years of email and whatsapp transcripts which clearly show what was going on theres nothing that can legally be done  i have to leave but i cant afford to expose myself financially all i can hope is for is a negotiated exit which is completely uncertain and could drag on for months all the while im in a limbo being continually pursued by my managers from work the manager even said he wanted to come to my house to find out about my cited stress as a matter of his duty of care making the stress worse   i just cant wait to put them all behind me and move on with my life up the workers,dm1qh9

269,Rough Week,this is a bit of a rant i need to blow the steam out tldr at the bottom  my workplace is split into many manufacturing departments but i tend to bounce around between them ive been working for almost three months almost to the end of the probation period which is kind of a crock of crap but okay since i bounce around a lot i sometimes dont work in a department for a while  at the beginning of this week i went to a department i havent worked at in about six weeks important for story as such i couldnt remember exactly how to read the specifications for our products i double checked with my supervisor and he asked me how long have you worked here because you should know this by now i explained its been a while since i worked in the department but he was still upset sadly i worked with him pretty much all of that day and the next it was very obvious that i was bothering him for some reason  yesterday he pulled me aside to test me on the paperwork the test went fine and i only overestimated one part of the material we would need to build the product he was surprised and told me i did much better than he thought i would internally i was pretty pissed off because literally every job ive ever worked 80 of my coworkers think im stupid but im used to it so i just vented to my wife when i got home and that was that  this morning he comes to me and says that hes been asked to notify my that if i dont improve ill lose my job at the end of the month of course im pissed i diplomatically asked why and he explained that the two big things are efficiency and the paperwork i will credit him that hes very honest and up front which i appreciate he assigned a whole page of work to me which is quite a bit i did fine and surprised him with some of my abilities facepalm  at the end of the day i asked him for more specifics i pointed out that it is difficult for me to know how to improve when i meet the requirements on the checklist for the probation yeah i meet the hard requirements just fine except maybe some paperwork stuff ill definitely admit that im not perfect and should work on the paperwork he told me that he was ready for me to get fired earlier in the week over the paperwork so he notified the owner and lead supervisor then he said that the next day he told them to disregard what he said after i showed that im not fucking stupid i asked on a scale of 110 10 being i keep my job for sure where am i a strong 6 or a 7  i told him that i am having a hard time seeing why im on the chopping block when i easily outperform many of the other employees i might not be the all star but im certainly better than others by a long shot he agreed with me about that he said he had told the upper ups that he wants me to stay then he acted like it was fine he also recommended i talk to the other supervisors since they have a say in my employment too  im pretty confident ill keep my job i dont suck at what i do and im not stupid what really pisses me off is that im in this situation because i made someone unhappy then he gave bad feedback about me and he just acts like its fine and were cool now i have to go through a round of ass kissing which i know some of them dont like me im quiet and dont talk to anyone really so they arent very personable in return which is understandable another issue is that i was supposed to get a raise if i did well on the review which i was pretty sure i would get now thats out of question no raise maybe no job  i would just quit this job and find something else but i live in a college town and this is the best hours  paying job i could find  tldr supervisor thinks im stupid complains to boss boss says i have till the end of the month to prove myself supervisor says next day that im doing better than he thought after i show that im not dumb now i have to kiss ass to the other supervisors and hope i dont lose my job but i definitely lost the raise i was going to get,djfmaz

271,Bosses who are jerks for no reason,hey guys new to the subreddit great reading so far i wanted to make a post about bosses who are jerks for no reason it seems every job ive ever had the boss was a jerk andor had a hot temper if things werent done his way or if you made the fatal mistake of doing something wrong because the idiot boss failed to instruct you properly in other words you didnt read his mind and got chewed out for it i just dont understand why bosses are like this   in my experience it pretty much never inspires anyone to do a better job in fact it lowers moral and makes your job harder causing you to do shittier work when i think back to all the times my boss got angry at me almost every time he could have just calmy explained to me how he wanted a certain thing done and the results would have been exactly the same in other words literally every time they blow up its for nothing and all it accomplishes is to stress the worker out which will degrade their work performance  i can honestly say there is not one instance at my job that ive had for 15 years now where my boss needed to chew me out yet hes done it countless times this for me is one of the biggest reasons i hate the idea of going to work and dread it with a passion never knowing what stupid ass thing my boss will flip about next and its not a question of if but rather when hes going to flip out hate it so much yet i have to put up with it and im not supposed to complain because hes the boss as my idiot coworkers always say  apparently going to work means you have to have stress and just accept the fact that your boss treats you like shit at any given moment usually when hes having a bad day and takes it out on you just because thats the way it is shit is completely unnecessary and adds nothing of value to the company or anything else and im sick of it anyone else feel this way that bosses just treat workers like shit for no fucking reason and thats one of the worst aspects of work,dk13wo

275,Finally gave my 2 weeks notice.,thought this sub might like to celebrate with me   i posted here a month or two ago about my shitshow job and how i feel like im the only one who cares to do anything i feel like im being taken advantage of i have no time to do anything and im so tired all the time etc but i was petrified of quitting because of how lucky i was to get the job  well i finally worked up the courage and turned in my two weeks notice i told my manager its because its too far from my house and i cant keep hitching rides from relatives or blowing my paychecks on lyfts coming to and from  i didnt want to burn a bridge and that was partially true anyway  funnily enough the straw that broke the camels back was actually something that happened at home  the night before one of my opening shifts where i have to get up at 6am i didnt get to sleep until 3 because my cats were going ballistic all night and nothing i did could calm them down or block out the noise of their very loud playing it seems to happen every night before i have an opening shift and combined with my already miserable sleep disorder i just couldnt take it anymore  my last day is halloween im going to take a couple months to focus on finally getting my drivers license so i dont have to rely on anyone else for transportation anymore then ill try to find something new that might treat me a little better i will be without income for a while which is scary because i dont have much saved but ill find a way to make it work im an artist maybe i can try to take art commissions in my spare time i just know i cant stay here anymore  thanks for reading,djn7x8
276,Don't ask me how my day is,just wanted to ventrant but this simple phrase invokes a sense of rage as i cant stand how you are always obligated to say something positive like good or great etc anything that is not positive is usually ignored or viewed with contempt was almost always asked this question by my manager almost everyday and would almost answer with something abstract like i dont know or i cannot summarize my emotions which is the truth especially at that time there was alot going on in my life at the time this would usually leave them with very little to respond back with whilst i at least didnt hate my job this still remains true i cannot stand feigning positive emotions it eats away at me slowly so no my day is not good no thank you for asking nor do i want your fucking attention either this perhaps falls into a term i heard recently toxic positivity definitely happy to hear what you fellow comrades have to say here at least,dkdkel

331,I won't contribute to a system that has so far denied me personhood,for my refusal to work society has punished me by forcing me to spend every single one of my 25 years on this planet living with my parents   i accept that i will never have my own place car friends girlfriend clothes money ect i lost all contact with my friends and family i am just a burden to my friends without money or a car at this point im not willing to take part in a system that has let me suffer for as long as it has i want to prevent people from being hurt by this system not take part in it   the thing is that i dont need help a psychiatrist cant help me because the psychiatrist is trapped under the same circumstances i am what i really need is the ability to make decisions in terms of my own well being and livelihood i need the things required to function in modern life currently im being denied those things talking wont fix that   people have told me before that opting out of this system wont change anything but thats my entire point this system doesnt have to deny people like me personhood it chooses to do so based on a arbitrary number i now strongly believe all humans deserve food regardless of their number value no human should have to give up years of their own life only to earn things necessary for survival especially in a post hunter gatherer society people who support this system dont believe everyone deserves life they believe only workers deserve life   i wouldnt take part in such a clearly immoral system even if it was only taking a year of my time but people willfully give up 40 in my opinion giving up 40 years of your life to do tricks to earn things every human deserves isnt a sign of mental maturity or something to boast about there is no way you can give up 40 years and end up as as well rounded of a personhood as you would have if you spent that time with family friends learning traveling living at your own pace   currently under this system people actually rally against the use of self driving trucks as it will decrease the amount of jobs this system actually tries to create more work even if there is no work that needs to be done the world we live in could already be much more automated if it werent for arbitrary numbers preventing humanities true potential we could already be educating everyone too but instead we reserve education for those with enough money i cant even imagine how a successful alien race would look at the idea of only educating certain members of our species based on paper amount probably in fucking disgust like i do,dkg3rq

336,Just quit entrepreneurship with neurotic business partner and want to die now,sorry for long post  tldr at the bottom but it is an interesting story     i got a call from a female friend a few weeks ago to meet up to discuss business opportunities so we wouldnt have to run this rat race for life  i was skeptical at first but the plan seemed legit and she seemed genuine  we had a grand scheme of building our business and she excelled at a lot of the things i didnt and i did the same for the things she didnt  it was perfect and we were 2 physically attractive people in the health and beauty industry  we worked for the same corporate company before and had a friendship since then so she was not unfamiliar     we met up literally every night for 45 hours even after juggling my 3 day jobs  we sat outside in the cold at starbucks strategizing our business and even brought fucking blankets for the outside of starbucks for when they kicked us out when they closed  we took photo shoots and everything and i was so motivated but i shouldve seen the red flags sooner     she is a bisexual with a lot of masculine energy and is a demeaning control freak who is constantly moody and high on weed and caffeine  she would always explain her vision and then go on tangents which would make our meetings last way too long  and id try to bring her back down to earth to what were actually planning  something tangible  shed get frustrated when i couldnt understand what the hell she was talking about and asked for clarity  shed talk about reverse engineering all the time and end up way into the future when i kept trying to pull her into wtf we have to do right now     most of the ideas i tried to contribute shed think get impatient with so i decided to just contribute in other ways while she did most of the work and i just showed up  plus she was more business oriented than i was  i thought maybe i wasnt understanding her vision but shed be full of oxymorons and kanye west type ego tangents think mlm personality type people but this wasnt an mlm     i talked to her about her miscommunication and her impatience and talking down to me  she apologized and promised to work on it and we pushed forward  we were even going to live in a house together  it was so we can make a calculated business move constantly filming our business in our home environment and generating revenue off of it  i am against moving in with women due to sexual tension in the living space no sexism just had bad experiences that were hard to get out of but she was very butch to the point where shed talk about how big her dick was etc constant ego talk that i shrugged off  plus i was so depressed and in a negative mind space before this project that i was desperate for a change anyway     she ended up making a move on me literally pulling me into her room and asking me to make her cum  i told her that if were going to do business we should not do this  the reality was i was not attracted to her because she is way too masculine for me  we agreed to keep it platonic  this shouldve been a bigger red flag to me but i still saw her as a cool butch bisexual and more like one of the guys  this incident is one reason why we met up in public from then on     then today we have another photoshoot and we were having fun on the ride there then like a flick of a switch she turns into a moody bitch  her energy and attitude is just negative and shes telling me shes gonna flip if i fuck up  ive already had this discussion with her about how she should be encouraging and uplifting and not demeaning and shit yet here she goes again  i try to get in my zen state and not let her disrupt me state of mind but she ends up storming out the room with me and the photographer  we proceed without her and she comes back and flips out again  this pisses me off to the point where i end it all right then and there  i tell her im done     on the way driving her back i tell her about her attitude and how we already had this discussion and this was supposed to be fun but i cant do business with someone like her  she says shes always taking control and she doesnt want to i tell her whenever i do she fucking shoots me down  then she attacks my masculinity saying she needs someone with a big dick to dominate  i immediately see that all this time she was fucking instinctively shit testing me and trying to mold me into some macho alpha male that would tame her and take control of her  i tell her it seems like she wants me to be someone else and i want her to be someone else and we can no longer do this because she is a headache  she goes off on more talk that doesnt make fucking sense and i start to realize she is literally neurotic and undiagnosed with some type of personality disorder  i drop her off and realize that this is over and i have to go back to my shitty work life next week with no other current plan out of this rat race  i was so emotionally invested in this project that i feel depressed that it ended and want to kill myself going back with no end in sight       tldr ex coworker masculine butch bisexual caffeine amp weed addict calls me to start up a business  im skeptical but she convinces me  we meet up 45hours a night planning and executing our business for the last few weeks and plan to move into a house together to film said business to create content  she constantly talks down to me and is a control freak then weirdly hits on me i reject her we push forward with strictly platonic business goal  during photoshoot her attitude gets worse and she has a tantrum and i immediately quit  i have moment of clarity that she is neurotic and was looking for a guy with big dick energy her words to tame her and out alpha her which go figure guys typically dont like  i start the same bullshit work schedule next week and im depressed and feel like killing myself with no current goals to look forward to working on to escape this fucking rat race once again back to square one,dh8f4r
337,Returning to work after time out due to depression and suicidal thoughts,so some time ago i took sick leave due to depression and suicidal thoughts i even posted about this on this subreddit when i initially did that  tomorrow i am going back to work i do not feel ready at all i still feel messed up i cant stand to face the toxic environment at work it was this environment that lead to me taking that time off just for some context some of the senior staff have lied about me which lead to some serious problems for me even after i protested this i was told its my word against hers my line manager knew i already go to a psychologist due to some mental issues i already have and still felt the need to be so overly critical to me over such small issues like for not taking in a notepad to a meeting some of the staff also snitch on me on very small things like leaving 15minutes early amongst other stuff i have to deal with   i was ready to hand in my resignation last friday but due to some unforeseen circumstances i am going to have to delay this i have no idea by how long i just hope i dont fully crack and do something regrettable before i am able to hand in my resignation i cant begin to imagine the relief i will feel when i hand in my resignation   when i see my friends at work who i care about deeply hand in their resignation to pursue a better path i get really happy for them of course im gonna miss them but ultimately i am over the moon for them they have escaped i hope i will escape soon too,dhi2q2

359,"Just came across this sub, wanted to hear your opinion on my point of view.",please read at least the tldr before commenting   so from what i can see you guys are against working for the man you see capitalism as being a system of oppression and slave labour  id like to ask what is the alternative   if everyone were to stop working there would be no food in your kitchen no water in your tap and no power in your home someones job is to maintain the reddit server this post is stored on someones job is to make the computer or device you are reading this on so my question to you good people is again what is the alternative  if humanity automates every single aspect of our lives what is left for us to strive for dont get me wrong i am fairly anticapitalist hence why this sub has been recommended to me but i still think we all need to do something that contributes to society else i believe we will all end up aimless drug addicts with no sense of purpose see idiocracy  work has taught me so much in terms of discipline commitment and self respect yet if you had asked me when i was in school do you want to get up at 430 in the morning and spend 10 hours stacking shelves and mopping floors i would have said no  having to work was one of the best things that has ever happened to me and it is only because of having a job that i am now able to make the most of my time on this earth and hopefully go on to make my mark on the future i think in this day and age we should not have to work nearly as much as the people in charge seem to think but i also believe that abolishing the need to work at a job you dont particularly want to do is an even worse idea than working too much for society as a whole and for the individual who has yet to develop a sense of purpose   tldr you see a utopia where everyone is free to indulge their passions i see a dystopia where everyone exists in virtual reality 247 with an iv drip full of heroin so people of rantiwork i ask you   what is the alternative to having to work  for the record i dont want any upvotes but if you are going to downvote please tell me why thank you,dionu6
360,"Your Time, Their Entitlement",i know this topic has been covered before by books like bullshit jobs but id like to make my own points and observations about this   as we all know the eight hour day is borderline abusive to both physical and mental health in human beings and yet employers insist on it to ensure the most legal production possible well ignore how this is a factual fallacy and employees are markedly less productive during an eight hour day what i want to talk about is how employers enforce these eight hours and why they enforce them  just as in my previous quasiessay post the orwellian workplace ill be taking examples from my own workplaces and applying them as practical representations of the behavior of employers   this entire week thursday to thursday my boss was on a vacation with his family leaving me the only other worker in the office alone to deal with the day to day business now without his intense oversight i was able to relax significantly more portion out my work and complete everything necessary within the first half of the day every day leaving me little to do in the second half however i miscalculated and was today informally reprimanded as he felt it necessary to monitor my station with keystroke tracking software obviously this was and still remains a serious ethical issue that is mercilessly protected by law but the question remains why did he care everything that needed to be done was done i met the necessary quotas so why did he care if i wasnt working extra  that is a very simple question to answer entitlement  as much as the rich enjoy calling the working class entitled and ungrateful the truth is very much the opposite your boss believes they hired you for eight hours and they will demand those eight hours out of you to them it doesnt matter that youve worked what they asked their money to them is a reward they bestow upon you for being a good helper monkey a privilege you should be grateful for employers believe that once they begin paying you they own your time that your time is no longer yours and is theirs to control and that you have to dance to the tune   this may not be the conscious thought of every employer but the underlying psychology is the same because they are paying you by the hour they believe that it does not matter how efficient you are in your work so long as you work for all eight hours   of course the opposite of this is true without you giving up your time to produce for them they would have nothing and this is something we as workers have forgotten at any moment i could stand up and leave and it wont matter any more how many hours i worked hell be shit out of luck with nothing to do but scramble to replace me   in closing i would like to remind everyone that we have the power as workers if you are the sole worker in your department if youre the leader of a group that others rely on if your job is unique you have the ability to stand against these abuses and remind your boss who is supporting who even on your own,dj7efs

403,a follow up on 'work struggle sessions',a few weeks ago i posted that were trying to organize small local based talking groups with a few beers where people talk about their work can vent and reflect on the systematic issues related to work  so far we had two and two more offshotgroups started specializing in given industries and from initial reactions its a tremendous success  where i live is not a very prosocial culture people are rude in general and are rude to strangers but when you get strangers to talk about their work and their experiences which leads to talking about their personal lives their parents their coworkers whatever it opens the fucking floodgates im not saying they leave as friends but it does act as sort of a collective stressrelief and people want more and more  with that being said we did find a couple of faultlines the working class is in itself not just separated by trade but also by corp hierarchy theres people who are closer to the upper echelons who will have a very difficult time transitioning into any form of solidarity theres a fair number of cynical people and were looking at ways to transform the groups so theyre more forward looking lest they just sink into a hugbox sectorbased orientation seems like a good idea as this type of activity builds up at least professional contacts so you can ditch if your job already sucks or find out ways how people in the same sector are fighting for better conditions  with that being said i can totally recommend trying to start your own group we dont moderate ours strictly just have a couple of pointed questions on where do you work what do you do explained to a five year old and people will mention a lot of struggle related topics of boss overreach shitty behavior survival strategies fightbacks fight club mood comes when you ask people about their parents jobs individual education contra parents education job vs education and so on  take this forum offline and local based if you can it fights alienation better than just staring at the screen and it can build real community  were also experimenting with taking the talkedout experiences and giving them online platforms  reddit and similar platforms are not that popular here were still stuck in the blogging era but talking about the actual matter and problem with work really drives readers  best and throw questions at me if this isnt as clear,dg0n6s

417,An antiwork success story.,a few years ago i was like many of you i hated my job the thought of going in and doing the same thing over and over again for 12 mindnumbing hours a day 56 days a week gave me nightmares it had me sitting outside work breaking down my mental health was bad i had no semblance of a social life and every week i thought about ending it all i hated the fact that i couldnt see any way out of this hole that i had gotten myself in for the next 4050 years one particularly bad day i made a decision there and then i simply thought to myself  fuck this enough is enough and went in and quite my job on the spot it was the best decision ive ever made admittedly for a couple of days i was beside myself with worry i was thinking to myself what the hell am i going to do how am i going to survive thats when i decided to be proactive and reorganise my life to the way i wanted it to be i went back to college thankfully something thats free in my country there i took a course on music production a subject i was always interested in but while i was at college i also decided to get rid of all the ties that had been keeping me down in my life i gave up my expensive flat and moved into shared accommodation i paid off all my bills and got rid of any direct debits and credit cards i paid off my overdraft and then cancelled it i went back to basics i removed myself as much as possible from the pursuit of material possessions as i could i dont care about owning the latest gadget or newest clothes i reduced my life down to the necessities food and shelter i went from paying out 1500 every month to paying 200 a couple of months into my course and with my savings starting to take a hit i thought id better go and find a parttime job to keep me ticking over i got a job working the door of a local bar it was 4 hours a night 3 nights a week 9pm  1am this easily paid for my reduced living expenses and still left me with an enormous amount of free time and money to study play music or just generally have a social life again i started loving my life and the 12 hours a week i was working were great eventually i got interested in djing and it just so happened that the local dj in the bar i was working in was planning to leave soon i asked the boss if i could take over for him as i had all the equipment and he said yes and that he was actually going to ask me the same thing himself so here i am 7 years later still doing what i love every week i work on the door every saturday night dj every wednesday friday and sunday i work no more than 16 hours per week and get paid a ton of money im loving my life and am infinitely better off financially and mentally the moral of the story i guess is put yourself into uncertain situations and always try and learn new things the best thing i ever did was walking in to work that day and say enough is enough while quitting on the spot it lit a fire under my arse and made me reevaluate my life and what i want to do with it no job should have you sitting in the carpark crying at the though of having to spend a minute more in its employment lifes too short for that shit,detx48
418,Spending 6-8 hours a day doing any one thing day after day is insane.,i think people realize spending too much time on one thing thing is unreasonable you spent 5 hours playing video games get a life you spend 4 hours a day reading i can barely read for an hour you spent 3 hours at the gym wow youre a gym rat dude you spent 12 hours on that drawing thats a long time     these things are all hobbies and yet were shamed for spending too much time on them and not enough time at work i spend 6 hours a day with a boss who i hate and a fraction of that time with my boyfriend who im often too tired to interact with in a very meaningful way after work     on a slightly different note even passions can grow tedious after too long i like drawing and video gamrs but if you asked me to sit down and draw or play the same game for 6 hours it would get difficult even if its a very good project or game after a couple of days i would need a break yet we are expected to work thousands of hours for years doing the same things over and over again its no wonder that people hate their work so much even jobs that i would be passionate about for a month would start filling me with resentment   maybe im unusual but i dont think there is a dream job for me out there im not built for the stress and im not built for the inevitable monotony,dfpfyy

436,Resisting the urge to be frank in a review when you intend to leave a job?,ive posted a few times about my shitty job its an absolute insult most days now i cant believe i have to put up with it just to pay bills and my boss will not change very toxic environment  they have what was my coworker on a pedestal for some reason brown noser shes now my manager all of a sudden since my boss had a bitch fit because i told him i was unhappy with a few things i thought we were mature enough to handle that objectively speaking shes not ready to manage so i know the change was to purely put me in my place  yesterday she literally repeated what i said and my ex linemanager who is a dinosaur and thinks im his secretary because i work alongside him and i have tits but at the same time seems threatened by me sigh glared at me when i said it but when she did right after me he was like exactly yes you are so right there wtf  anyway i would love to be frank in an upcoming review nothing ranty just truthful instead of things are going great theyre not your changes have made such an improvement theyve not however im thinking maybe i should just channel this frustration of being demeaned into actually applying for other jobs   i hate having to suck this office politics bs up i have a lot more skills technical and higher level of education but they make me do admin for the dinosaur and have always filtered all the important tasks through to her it wont change even when i produced better quality work they got annoyed at me because one of the ceos didnt like hers after im just there as a back up for the dino  tldr should you be honest in a review if you intend to leave a company or just lie through your teeth and leave,dg1xwa

Try being a health care assistant...,i see a lot of you office workers post i just read a post where someone was basically complaining that they were bored at work for hours with little to do  im sorry guys   but please give a thought to us lowly carers because i for one would sell my soul or whats left of it to have a job like that  this past week as working for as an agency hca i along with another girl had to help an elderly man who threw wet tissues in my face said digusting sexual things to the both of us workers he went to grab at her breasts and he groped my bum he then hit me on the arm delightful  we helped a lady who had mrsa always fun helping people with illnesses that i can bring home with me  i helped an elderly man have a wash then had to put his dirty clothes back on him and steal a pad from another persons room to give to him because apparantly the nurses didnt give a shit about him in this nursing home he didnt have any pants or underwear  thats why i had to put the dirty clothes back on him nurse just said well its his wifes job to bring those in i said well maybe there could be some in the laundry she just ignored me and carried on writing  i got scratched on the face good it missed my eyes on my upper lip by an old lady during giving her personal care nurse did not give a shit it seems  i got scratched on the arm by another elderly lady and it drew blood i asked nurse if the lady was on a behaviour chart that i could write the incident down in nurse just shrugged and said thats just the way she is  ampx200b  i work for 12hr shifts this is not rewarding or noble work i am tired of smelling old peoples piss and shit i am tired of senile old people physically attacking me because they stink of piss and they dont want to have a wash i dont care that they cant help it  i need to get out of this work but at this point i cant lower my hours to train to do something else  ampx200b  i just want people to know that out of all of the places i have worked in 7 years and as an agency carer that number is a lot i would say i have worked in 1 count it one residential care home where the elderly people were looked after adequately not well just adequately and the work load was managable for the workers  just the 1  i have been doing this work for 7 years  if you have family members or loved ones in a residentialnursing home i want you to know that behind the scenes the level of care they are recieving is most likely not good enough  for example in so many places ive worked nurses and hcas outright lie about how much fluid intake a resident has for example because in the late morning when we are supposed to help keep people hydrated we are either a still doing personal care on people or b finally getting our late as usual break i admit if someone pressures me with well she had 200mls of tea in the cup on her table i mean she probably drank it all didnt she i just now go along with it and say yeah i lie too  ive had a an elderly lady start crying because she was sat on her armchair and needed to go to the toilet she needed a standaid to help her up and i was not allowed to di it by myself must be x2 hcas it was the second time of me answering her call bell because she needed the toilet 20 mins gap inbetween the calls everyone including me was giving personal carebusy with other people at the time i said to her im so sorry you will just have to wait  if you have family members or loved ones in a home then please regularly visit them to make sure everything is okay with them because i am just telling you the truth that they have rushing exhausted startingnottogiveadamn workers like me looking after them its the truth  when it comes to that time for my own mother i will be looking after her myself for as long as i possibly can  and then a bit more perhaps i would never put her in a home i know what theyre like  this turned out too long im ot expecting anyone to read it i guess i just had to get this off of my chest i need to get out of this,dfgu7f

465,just a few thoughts on commissions.,so  i want to share my three bad experiences with earning commission as a fire protection technician  in all three situations the commission was a  factor in negotiating a lower than average pay rate im curious to see  if this is an issue in other fields im sure it is but im really  interested in how commissions work in a perfect situation ok here we  go  side note  its going to seem  like im speaking ill of fire protection companies and i am but from  what ive heard my experiences are the exception not the rule  first  was a job fixing and selling fire extinguishers and emergency lights  i  took the job for 16hr and 5 of all new fire extinguisher sales over  3k for reference the most common fe we sold was about 60  this  seemed sort of nuts but the hiring manager assured me that with the  volume of work it would be no problem  what  he didnt tell me was that if you had a bad month the next months  sales would go toward making up the difference so if you made 2k in  january you had to make 4k in february to break even  the  real issue is that a fire extinguisher has to look pretty bad to  replace it with a new one otherwise if it lost pressure or was out of  date we would just replace it with a used extinguisher for a more  customer friendly price  basically the cylinder itself would have to be  compromised beyond repair either with rust or a good sized dent or  gouge and even then you still have to convince the customer to buy from  you rather than home depot  so i  quickly found myself way behind considering i was new to the field and  had about two weeks of training  i started asking around for advice and  found out that a lot of these guys would do some shady stuff to make  their numbers some guys would lie and say the building didnt have  enough extinguishers others would smash them with hammers or damage  components until it was more economical to buy a new one but the  consensus was that you had to hustle and cut corners if you want that  paper so i left  i found another  job doing the same thing but this time it was 17hr and the commission  was 7 of all sales and services over 22k 10 over 27k and 15 over  30k now i knew from the last job that the money was in the service  and i knew my last month at the last job i made 25k in service this  was a good deal  after a month of  training i was killing it first month 800 commission second month  1000 all earned honestly and all customers were happy baboom  then  the boss two brothers both employees of the company are both served  with divorce papers within a month of each other dont feel bad if  they wanted to stay married they shouldnt have been pricks  so facing  financial hurricanes they asked for more money and so the boss made  them techs fine but i then come to find my schedules are getting  lighter and lighter and my commissions are dwindling  they went from  the 1000 range to the 200 range and then nothing  i had days where i  had 9 hours to do about 3 hours worth of work and the rest of the time  was just spent in the truck or running errands for the boss  i  come to find that the boss was just giving them the good jobs making  them a ton of money and just screwing the rest of us cool beans so i  and a few other guys ended up leaving and i found another job  third  job this was doing extinguishers and fire suppression systems in  kitchens and spray booths for 18hr and 5 of everything over 22k   they assured me that i would be in charge of my schedule they assured  me that every month they give out bonuses in addition to the commission  for the top earners and they assured me that i would get 30 of all  emergency service hell yeah i cant go wrong here  so  the week i start working they decide they dont trust the techs to make  their own schedule  fine ill just tell them to load me up with work  they then decide they want us to spend more time on these jobs to make  the customers feel better ok ill just be thorough at these places  and really look for things i can fix to make sure the place is perfect  it turns out that the majority of these places are chains and the  contracts stipulate that i need special approval for any work outside of  a basic inspection then it turns out the top three earners at the  company are the managers golf buddies and they get first dibs to go back  and do the work that i quoted so i am out there doing maybe 4 jobs a  day making less than 500 towards my numbers a day and they get to  vulture my high paying jobs that i did the leg work on  in  the last months at that job i found out that whenever a customer calls  to complain about the price of a service the manager automatically  discounts it which affects my numbers i also found that i make 30 of  emergency calls unless the problem is our companies fault which was  almost every time  phew if you  guys made it this far thank you so much for reading my rant  the fact  that this is a super whiny post is not lost on me i just want people to  see the games that some companies will play  i would say that after  these experiences i cant possibly be surprised anymore by garbage like  this but im sure ill eat those words  so  yeah share your experiences with commissions or whatever frustrating  work stories i will leave you with a quote that my dear mother told to  me after all of this had already happened thanks mom  commissions are a way for rich jerks to underpay dummies   momma hindsight,dh1wq9

471,Working with authoritarian women as a woman and work trauma,i have to share what its like to work with bossy women as a woman or at least for me very long post ahead  i have a history of jobs that completely took advantage of me or were downright evil especially because of the women in positions of authority  my first job was at a tim hortons 7 years ago but i got bulied by the cool kids working there and got fired for asking a question about the right kind of lid to put on lattes which i barely ever had to make bc who tf drinks lattes from tim hortons anyway the female supervisor deemed my question stupid because i should have known that as someone who had worked there for barely three months and only 16 hours a week with no decent traning but you know that whole experience was enough to traumatize me age 16 from working i later learned that the bullying stemmed from the coolest of the cool kids because she was in love with my best friend and was jealous of me so my main bully was some jealous girl and the one who got me fired was her best friends sister   i then got a job at a grocery store but i was extremely cautious at this point i didnt trust my female coworkers but i quickly realized that i wasnt going to be bullied this time i had a great time adjusting to this environment after that it was 90 female but i generally got along with everyone i cant say that i experienced anything outrageously wrong after 4 years of employment   i tried a new job as a receptionist for a popular hotel chain it was during the summer and i was still working at the grocery store on the weekends but at the hotel during the week the woman who hired me told me that there was a chance id also work in the kitchen being a receptionist was a dream to me because i had been working with food for 2 years and i was tired of it an understatement i reluctantly said that i wouldnt mind occasionally working in the kitchen hoping that it wouldnt prevent me from being a receptionist the woman lets call her karen had a face and a demeanor that i couldnt trust i ended up working as a receptionist for  4 days they trained me for the kitchen the week after i then got scheduled for one more week in the kitchen i got really suspicious that they didnt need an additional receptionist because they began significantly cutting some of the receptionists hours after yet another scheduled week of working in the kitchen i knew that they didnt need me at the reception and that they had hired me solely for the kitchen i was extremely frustrated but struggled to quit because it meant returning to the grocery store fulltime after being so close to my dream job at the time so i sucked it up  then they karen did the most fucked up thing ever at closing time i was told by my kitchen boss nancy to clean the tables while she sweeps the floor i found that strange because she had never separated our tasks like that before we would usually do it simultaneously its worth noting that only the two of us worked in the kitchen during the week the next day i got called into karens office after my shift she sat me down and patronisingly told me that i wasnt the best fit for the job i told her that i didnt want to be in the kitchen and that i was supposed to be a receptionist even though i had expressed it before she diverted the conversation to my eyelashes by complimenting how long and pretty they were wtf she used that distraction to bring up the pictures that she had taken of the floor the day before it was especially dirty and she told me that it was unacceptable i tried explaining that i only cleaned the tables but she wouldnt hear it she actually reprimanded me for accusing my coworker of my own mistake which i wasnt trying to do just like that i was asked to go home i was fired   for a long time i couldnt wrap my head around what happened i went up to my boss at the grocery store crying telling her that i had just been fired and that i would therefore stay she told me she had a suspicion that it wouldnt work out a shitty thing to say to someone who was just fired by the way i obviously cant say whether karen orchestrated the whole thing just to fire me but it felt like it was done on purpose it was too coincidental with nancy telling me not to do the floor that day i dont know ill never know the truth  i ended up staying at that grocery store for 2 more years i quit in november of 2017 because i was moving out of my dads in december i was a uni student desperate to find a better job than retail and the horror of boomers complaining about the prices of food i have no control over all my attempts at hotel applications failed and i worked at yet another grocery store for a few months at the start of 2018 nothing too dramatic happened but my two coworkers were male so i didnt get many interactions with women  after 3 months i finally managed to get a job at a hotel a fairmont hotel too i wasnt a receptionist though i was working for what they beautifully call royal service its basically an onsite phone assistant that takes room reservations and room service orders amongst other things the female supervisor there was fucking awful a french woman who was so stern and stuck up she was always yelling at me for the most minor things i got in trouble one time when it wasnt my fault at all we had to report on what happened during our shifts so any information that would be relevant for our coworkers the next day in a passon it was an email that we had to send at the end of our closing shift around midnight for the following morning my male coworker and i were doing the closing shift but when i left we had nothing written in the passon because it hadnt been busy he was staying an hour more after i left the next day my supervisor was extremely unhappy with the passon she called me to her office which wasnt at all private so the discussion took place in front of all 3 of my coworkers present and scolded me for writing that nothing happened it was boring in it i had no part in that because my male coworker had written it she had fire in her eyes as she was telling me how disrespectful it was i could feel her hatred i told her i didnt do it she didnt care when my male coworker showed up that day he didnt at all get the same treatment he admitted to doing it and she simply told him not to do it in the future no fire in her eyes that was it   that event was just a clear demonstration of her bias toward me in a long list of unfair things under her supervision nobody liked her and people agreed that she had been unfair to me that one time they went as far as to say that i was her personal scapegoat it seemed like she would scold me for the dumbest shit we had so many stupid rules too it truly didnt make sense i wasnt the only one getting yelled at repeatedly but i seemed to have it the worst out of everyone  that leads me to today i have a data entry job and my boss is sometimes unbearable she is an accountant whos very condescending and who also loves to yell at you in front of other people i still struggle to find my feet around these kinds of women im not confrontational in case you didnt notice i never know how to react and i prefer to keep my mouth shut and suck it up ive always been like this   i have no idea what i did to all these women over my years of employment i just feel like its the nature of women being forced to work with other women a man has never treated me like this im way more comfortable around a male coworker or authority figure than i am around a woman in these same positions im curious to know if anyone else had similar experiences im sorry if this is stupidly long and pointless,dfkice

A bit of a rant on work if you like,had previous jobs but my current one seems different really tired at the end of the day unable to stop thinking about work even on the weekend have to have a weekend strategy now to get maximum weekend hours to do stuff dread going in have the monday blues or is it sunday at the end of weekdays now when i try to do something i enjoy if its after work too tired to do it andor performance suffers and if its the weekend i feel like time is being wasted because i only have x amount of hours before i have to prepare to go to work all over again also find myself thinking is this the rest of my life you may have a bunch of hours after work but youve got no energy to actually take advantage of it therefore your actual life and hobbies die slowly  to me the way  this is set up is all wrong not counting the whole humans cant get work for a solid 8 hours a day up to 1 hours break  because theyre not machines and that the tech exist to fix many problems lets see if i can remember my points since i thought of them days ago   if you decide you want to leave because maybe you find its not for you or something you look like the bad guy  want to work fewer hours you look like the bad guy  turn down an offer because maybe you knew it wasnt for you you look like the bad guy  if you feel deep inside somewhere in your gut that 9  5 grind isnt for you if you consider that nothing in life is for everyone because were all different then it stands to reason the 9  5 isnt either you look like the bad guy  stuff like this makes me increasingly wonder why have children if theyre just going to enter the same system you cant get their consent beforehand as to whether they want to be born and therefore join the system society has set up to me it seems like a bad idea to bring an unsuspecting person into it especially if i didnt like it to begin with   anyone else feel this,dg3zma

518,Anyone else unable to find their niche in life?,im a 25 year old long term neet since i was little i was drifting with no passion or goals through school  or more importantly life then after i was done with school i started to look in the 8 year long abyss that is still my life to this day i was suffering from social anxiety back then i didnt know what it was called but knew i had to get it checked because my performance  and health would suffer massively fast forward 8 years in semi isolation i still live with my parents have tried several therapists psychiatrists who gave me meds 3 internships  that didnt result in anything except the knowledge that im apparently not cut out for any career and all that amounted to me being more suicidal and hopeless than ever you might say 3 internships arent a lot and i would agree with you however doing those required so much out of me that each of them  are a little feat to me besides coping with a bad life with forms of escapism everyone here knows makes time fly scaringly fast if anything those internships ingrained  into my head the importance of finding the right thing for me and not choosing the best from the worst options being 25 is not your oh hes young and still finding himself age its the you should stand with both feet in life and get by on your own age yet im a grown man who was left behind and falls back further every year   i always thought a career that fulfills me with joy is the way to go in life something that i could cling to and would pull me out of this quicksand of misery somewhere where im with likeminded people at this point im not sure this romanticized version or at least some middle ground even exists for me over the years i developed this certain mindset about work i tried to dissect work into pieces that i viewed as problematic for one there are the working hours the people who you work with your duties the salary the actual way to and back from work your private life and lastly the toll it takes on your mind and body so i thought it would be either what i envisioned or nothing at all but   i still was unable to identify a clear passion or certain strengths within me that could guide me the way some people are able to do something on a daily basis which every cell of their body is fighting against im unfortunately not like most people so i cant do that  however it does look like im destined to work somewhere where im just as miserable as now without doing any work that is do i really have to pick my poison   my vague and broad question is how do you find your comfy place in life where you feel safe and happy,dcpw6b

524,Retirement is a scam,the concept of working yourself to the bone for 50 years in the slight hope that youll be able to enjoy 10 years at the end your life makes no sense we should be enjoying life every moment not just in old age besides many people dont make it to retirement many do make it to retirement but with no money to enjoy it many dont have family left with whom to enjoy etirement most have some slew of physical aches in old age the concept of retirement is just wrong there are few people that actually enjoy retirement a lot of people become extremely bored after they stop working because they have become so conditioned to slavery they dont know how else to fill their time many parents spent all their lives working and paid little attention to their kids then when they retire they find that they never built a genuine relationship with their kids we have to change this mentality retirement should not exist living life at a leisurely pace is vital for people of all ages we dont need to be wage slaves who dont know what to do when we suddenly age out of the slave market we need to build our society around quality of life at every age,ddew2k

531,Some thoughts and my current position,these are just some thoughts that i would like to share also if anyone has advice or a way out story id be glad to hear  i dont hatehate my job its fairly decent medium pay and i even get to work from home at least once a week more in the future the reason i like working from home is partly because i work very little still every morning im absolutely dreaded to go to work mind its a 1h15min trip every day is a struggle and every week feels the same mon amp tue suck wed amp thu are fine friday work from home yay weekend is usually fun and there we go again  i think this all stems from having not enough time to myself to enjoy things gaming doggo  or work on myself i would love to have time for leisure fitness cooking laundry keeping the apartment clean doing groceries taking walks with my dog   put this in combination with me not being interested at all in my job the fact that my job does just about nothing for humanity or nature and you have some depressing thoughts  the problem is my interests arent very broad so switching jobs is probably not a solution the only solutions i see now are  keep going suck it up as long as i can take it  find something im willing to put 40hrsweek in  switch to being a waiter parttime i enjoyed working those as a student  more free time  do something about the 40hr work week  kill myself  ive been going to a therapist for the past 23 months and i do feel some benefits he tells me my problem is looking way too far ahead im dreading the 40hr week for 40 years i think hes partially right but im also just not willing to be just another cog in the machine doing something im not interested in and it sucking away my time as a living being i truly believe that 40 hours is too much for a lot of people to have a happy life this is my strongest opinion my therapist tells me this is just a thought as in everything is just a thought in your head i honestly see what hes saying but i just cant get over the fact that im so angry amp helpless at this issue and why nothing is done about it  a lot of times i think theres a fundamental problem with me if almost everyone does it why cant i but then reasoning kicks in again none of this makes sense we have everything we need to live why do we still need to advance at the rate we are going at now countries want growth but why is this only expressed in monetary values a countrys inhabitants are a major part of the country why not strive for growth there on and on you get the jist  note that ive only been working for a little over 2 years ive done loads of student jobs though everyone said i would get used to it but im not i simply cant wake up happy knowing the day i have ahead of me   rant  tldr not enough time not interested in job,dbq0a0

547,Advice for living on part-time work with health issues?,hi anti work fam im a 29 yo with a degree in electrical engineering ive dealt with depressionanxiety for 10 years and chronic pain for about 5 probably had chronic pain earlier but yknow ive been in my current job for 2 and a half years and i filed for fmla about a year ago with that i worked 30 hour weeks for a few months until my pain management was better and since then ive worked 3040 hours with usually taking unpaid time i accrue about 3 hours of sick time every two weeks and my vacation is gone for the year   i feel as though i got burnt out bad after 2 years in my first job after college but i was making enough money to kind of afford quitting outright money went fast though and it took me months longer than i intended to find a new job things were sort of stable for a bit but lately ive been having more fatigue issues im feeling burnt out and done when i try to make up time and work 9 hours im fucked the next day i feel forced to be dishonest about the hours i actually work because i just cant do it  i worry about losing my job a lot or i worry im just going to feel forced to quit because of my health issues  i couldnt find a part time job when i looked for one because i cant do a lot of things physically i ended up as a dog walker for 2025 hours a week for 3 months but my paychecks were horrible couldnt even pay my rent let alone health bills has anyone had success living and working part time my experience in college was that with part time i was always exhausted anyway,ddcsmn

549,why do so many rooms/houses require you to have a full time job?,look i get that you want someone who can pay the rent no one wants to be left in the lurch financially but it just seems so narrow minded to me and i suspect it isnt about whether or not the person can pay the rent it comes from a belief that real morally correct responsible adults work full time like if you dont spent your whole life at work you must be a druggo loser who plays video games all day and never washes your dishes  whats wrong with working part time you know having a sense of work life balance my mum worked part time my whole childhood raised me fine didnt have debts i had everything i needed and seven quite a few things i wanted thats not even to mention there are people who work in alternative ways these days but definitely make enough money to make rent creative professions freelance work fifo workers etc  when i finish my degree ill take a full time job if i have to but if i have the option id prefer part timebecause id like to you know have time for other things because my identity is made up of more than just work because we live in a beautiful wold and i want to enjoy it more than just for a few hours on the weekends between all my other errands  where im looking at moving the rent is not that high wages are higher than average in my field and having a degree im sure ill be able to land one of these jobs and easily make rent while working part time itll certainly be more than ive ever had before yet im worried people wont want me as a housemate or to lease to me if im not working full time its just such brainwashing over this arbitrary standard and this is why i hate work culture  sorry for the rant,dd4ysm
550,"my post about free work for job applications got deleted instantly, maybe it will be appreciated here",this was the post   43 of my callbacks have required hours of free work before the first interview    was just going over my numbers for my job search   more and more employers want you to do some work before they even talk to you its always at least 2 hours often quite a bit more and if its at their office you can add travel time and costs as well a few times ive had the free work sprung on me at the first interview which i think is a very dodgy practice   this is the kind of thing i mean  httpsslatecomhumaninterest201903jobinterviewworkassignmentsfreelaborhtml   i agree with alison green that this is unreasonable in the comments you can many stories of people who did the work and were completely ghosted afterwards ive been there and it hurts like hell   its fine to say that you should just pass on employers who want this but if my numbers are any indication that will deeply affect your job search if you do the work you could get wrung out pretty fast   if i had done all the free work employers have tried to give me it would have run to over 100 hours by now and not easy work you can dash off a lot of it would have been equivalent to university assignments you would spend weeks on magnify that out to all the jobseekers in the usa alone and its a scary amount of free and fruitless labor being done by the unemployed   to the jobseekers out there do you think this is acceptable    on a more antiwork tip i think this freeworktogetwork trend is horrifying  this is in addition to free work via unpaid internships or unpaid internships for college credit that you have to pay tuition for a whole other rant of mine  where is the line  or is there just gonna be no line,dd82y7

613,Being Sabotaged at Work due to Jealously and Being Introverted/Hermit Like,i have worked a number of jobs before and it is always the same  people attack me since i am an introvert who doesnt like to drink smoke or party  i am hermit like and love being alone doing my own isolated hobbies  i dont like being around a mass of people acting like animals in loud clubs filled with nasty cigarette smoke  people always looked down on me for being a loner i dont even tell them about my personal life but they either assume things about so since i am quiet or they go and look up people from my past and get personal stuff about me  they also go and find out about my academic accomplishments and become insanely jealous which leads to verbal abuse harassment calling me stupid to feel better about themselves and bragging that they are better than me due to being more populargoing to parties which i dont even care for since i hate parties and dont want to be popular  they also constantly compete with me and talk trash behind my back to other coworkers to make me look bad and try to mentally abuse me to get me to leave due to fear that i do better than them one senior even told me that he feared i took his job due to my credentials and performance at work   i actually like working and studying if the material is fulfilling but it is the office politics peoples jealouscrueltyinsecuritynarcissimbullying and crap behaviour and the horrible capitalisticnepotism work system which i hate,dcwyrl
614,Story time: Job Trial Edition,so i had a job trial as a barista at a little cafe yesterday i was due to do a 3 hour trial so they could see if i was a good fit and to make sure i like the place  i only lasted half an hour the lady on the coffee machine with me was so nit picky and rude i tried to make conversation and be friendly but she just wasnt having it she kept berating me to hurry up and got mad for making mess or making small mistakes and i was like ive only been here for 15 minutes  so eventually i got fed up and said right well i dont want this job anyway so im out of here seeya and walked straight out the door  the manager shouted out after me go then youre a pussy you cant handle it  i shouted back thats right and never looked back  why is it so hard to find a workplace thatll treat you with at least a base level of respect,decrvs
615,How can parents do it???,i am married no kids most of the time i cannot function if i dont get two full days downtime to begin work week  but i dont have any other chores that i have to do for kids which are so mindless time consuming and monotonous school runs packing lunches arranging birthday parties managing tantrums  cleaning shit are just some few of the tasks i would be putting up with had i been a parent and i cannot fathom how i would maintain my sanity at the end of the day to begin work the next day  how do parents manage to even turn up to work and do something is beyond me thats why maybe they are all shitty at their tasks to begin with as their minds are constantly all over the place thinking about what needs done at home or for school for kids especially the ones with toddlers these guys cant get enough sleep at night and still manage to come to work the next day maybe half sleepy  i cannot do that maybe i am not a human being or i am depressed or its my basic inability to cope with life whatever you call that i cannot be a parent and work at the same time and if i am so sucked by corporations for a pennys worth i would avoid repeating the cycle and subjecting my kids to the same wage slavery anyway ,ddikjy

618,Working as an Immigrant,working in itself as a resident of the country is hell but i am an immigrant on a work visa and thats like double times hell  one your job is tied to your visa and vice versa unless i have visa i dont get to apply for a job and once i have it i need to prove i have been on a continuous employment for a certain number of years if i need to settle down  two unless i get citizenshipleave to remainpr i cannot think of investing in house or getting married potentially my spouse would either have to leave their job if they are from a different country or my home country and search a new one and in the worst case if a dependent is not allowed to work then thats half the income gone  three employers very well know you are on a work visa and if they get a hint that you have taken a student loan in foreign currency which there is no way you will be able to repay back in your home country without having a job its their golden chance to take advantage of you to the max so they make you work two to three times more than what you are paid for and your pathetic situation would mean you cannot refuse  fourth you may or may not adjust to cultural differences and society in general and begin to feel extremely isolated and lonely you would feel time slipping by and you being trapped in such a situation that you cannot take any risk of changing a job let alone quitting  i have seen a lot of my friends take student debts  go to universities abroad compete with thousands of applicants get into the rigmarole of the long queue and years of waiting for citizenship all the while being treated like a slave in eternal servitude of the work visa they were so proud to obtain in the beginning   this is not to discourage people but paint the true picture of what you are supposed to give up and how life looks like as an immigrant many of these people come from third world countries which are basically shit holes but life is not rosy in the western world either   i am on a work visa and i have no student debt i am not banking on a citizenship process here and have made alternative plans should my job not progress for a longer term there is no way i am investing in a home abroad and being trapped into the cycle of wage slavery people should think hundred times before taking expensive long term decisions i cannot fathom how i would maintain my sanity if i didnt have a plan b or c or d,dbwmut

626,Refusing to work: should you live or die?,in the human rights declaration it says   gteveryone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and wellbeing of himself and of his family including food clothing housing and medical care and necessary social services and the right to security in the event of unemployment sickness disability widowhood old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control   ive been thinking about whether this means you always a right to housing and food and being alive or only if you work in the first half it says everybody has those rights with no conditions in the second half it guarantees security but only to those without livelihood caused by things outside their control so if you refuse to work you deserve to have all the things to be alive but no security im unsure what that means  its just a small mind game anyways right now in practise you have to work to be allowed to be alive which in my mind makes it ironic that many deny people the right to die if i dont want to work im not allowed to be alive but im also not allowed to die,ddui3r
