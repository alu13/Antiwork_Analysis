2,Is it the task or the time that kills,i think much of the dread for work is that it takes 8 hours a day   if we worked 4 or 5 hours  those same tasks would be somewhat more bearable   at least you'd have some hours left in the day to do what you wanted ,aqxgpf
3,Post your anti-work quotes here, i don't like work--no man does--but i like what is in the work--the chance to find yourself  your own reality--for yourself not for others--what no other man can ever know  they can only see the mere show  and never can tell what it really means      joseph conrad  heart of darkness,auxk32
4,What job made you hate your life the least while doing it?,hi r antiwork   i am currently out of work right now which is great but starting to hurt me financially  i find that as i am looking for a new job  i am getting a deep sense of dread and my stomach is turning  coupled with the general sense of guilt that society enforces for not working   what job made you hate your life the least while doing it compared to other work you have had  i am hoping to avoid some of the worst aspects of previous jobs i have had  in an entry levelish position    in order from the aspects that i hope to avoid the most    1  toxic abusive workplace culture  fostered by supervisors and managers   2  having to deal with clients and customer service in general   3  inadequate training   4  expectations responsibilities far exceed the pay grade   5  no down time   6  grueling physical work   7  never being able to say i  used  my liberal arts bachelor because the position requires no college  or even high school  degree    i know people generally despise  bullshit  jobs  but i honestly wouldn't mind trying my hand at some office job i can just come and sit at and do the minimal grind  not deal with many people  then go home    any advise  i feel like an ideal position for me would be some type of low intensity forest surveyor for a parks service  but unfortunately i don't have a bs that would qualify me for that  ,aty3d5

6,Is my Boss Disrespectful or am I overly Sensitive?,every day myself and another coworker are pulled into his office for a  meeting   these can last between 30 minutes and an hour and a half   most of the meeting consists of the boss answering unrelated phone calls  or making them  composing emails  slowly  and generally not giving a crap about our time   today he even pulled us in to tell us we're about to be busy and then proceeded to waste an hour just holding us hostage    amp x200b   he has an extreme ego and is very condescending in his speech and attitude   i know that he wouldn't accept this behavior if the tables were turned    amp x200b   we brought this to the attention of hr   they don't care because he has customer contacts that make the company a lot of money ,avk8qq
7,Most jobs are meaningless or even harmful to society and environment,i do not mind working as long as i feel that i am doing something meaningful  but most work is not just meaningless  it's harmful  all around me i see people who are considered to be successful working jobs that do not in any way further well-being of society  instead  they create excess and mental noise  designers who create packaging and aesthetically pleasing labels for absolutely unnecessary products - advertisement industry in general  developers who create apps that at best marginally increase convenience for the rich  fucking instagram museums and the plastic crap they  exhibit  all these things have negative value    i work as a part-time assistant at a large product photography studio  the photographer owner  without a doubt a very skilled person  shoots  content   i fucking hate this word  for ig  packaging  commercials of large brands  the aftermath of a recent cosmetics shoot included dozens of wasted coconuts  pounds of ruined fruit  tubs of medical gel  i absolutely hate myself for even participating in this charade     amp x200b ,ar710p

9,How many of you do warehouse work?,i keep hearing about these office jobs that require almost no work and allow you to go on social media and read during working hours  i'd love to do that but instead i work in a warehouse and literally everything i do is recorded with a scanner  with weekly meetings about rates and bar charts showing who is faster  everything is about efficiency and speed of performance so that the company gets every last cent and even seconds count in certain situations  i've heard about people who work at amazon having it even worse  i'd love to have one of these casual jobs but instead i'm in constant movement always doing mindless boring work but having to do it as fast as possible ,atd4jl
10,Not working and the view that it's selfish?,my no 1 goal in life is to get to a stage where i don't have to work as soon as possible   what do you guys think about this  i have this notion that friends and family would be against it  that if i had enough to do it responsibly  a good few million  over my lifetime  they'd resent me for it at least for a time  how do you think you'd overcome feeling selfish  would you just shutdown all money talk and jibs about being a non worker  what about people thinking you should just work a spend money buying them trinkets or supporting them  parents  i'd feel a bit guilty but hey it's my life  instead of yourself ,aszcua

12,I had my yearly evaluation at work and of course they asked where I see myself in the upcoming years,my boss seemed flabbergasted when i told her i have no desire to become a manager  i told her they work too much and i never want to be on salary and i want nothing more than to come to work and earn a paycheck and go home to my real life  it s crazy because i know she expected me to have all these aspirations to grow in the company and me saying i want a real life outside of work seemed strange to her  i honestly feel bad for people like this  i work to live  not the other way around  i m so over toxic american  work ethic  that becomes your everything  ,arajze
13,Work is Meaningless - An Old Poem,so i hated life  because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me  all of it is meaningless  a chasing after the wind    i hated all the things i had toiled for under the sun  because i must leave them to the one who comes after me   and who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish  yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which i have poured my effort and skill under the sun  this too is meaningless   so my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun    for a person may labor with wisdom  knowledge and skill  and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it  this too is meaningless and a great misfortune   what do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun    all their days their work is grief and pain  even at night their minds do not rest  this too is meaningless   a person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil  this too  i see  is from the hand of god  for without him  who can eat or find enjoyment    to the person who pleases him  god gives wisdom  knowledge and happiness  but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases god  this too is meaningless  a chasing after the wind   ---- king solomon  philosopher ,arb6ya

17,It's shocking how many employers don't bother stating the salary when advertising their vacancies,this seems to be incredibly common  they're happy to list off all the requirements of the role  in other words  what they expect from you  but god forbid they tell you what you should expect from them   work is a two-way agreement  employees provide a service to you in exchange for money  why the hell would you think it's ok to not inform people how much money they'll receive if they apply and are successful  do you think people are applying because the job sounds fun   employers  either the pay is good and you therefore have no reason to hide it  or you're wilfully hiding it because it's terrible and you think it will deter people from applying  and if it's the latter  people are going to find out anyway  so all you're doing is wasting the time of people who apply   or perhaps you're withholding it because you think people should want to apply based on the job role alone  and that  money shouldn't matter  in that case  why not drop the salary to zero  see how well that works out for you ,asqjld

22,I'm wondering how many people here are on the spectrum?,it's my assumption that people with autism are less likely to adhere to the pressure to work that's so prevalent in our society  due to our dissident cognition  the way i see things is that i've been born at a disadvantage in a society that favors the outgoing  charming  and charismatic smooth-talkers  now  i have no desire to participate in the rat race  but if i'm going to be pressured by my peers into jumping into the fire then i should at least have the capability of succeeding  otherwise what you're telling me essentially is that i'm only useful as a wage slave  if you're going to tell me that my life is only worth  10 an hour  an apartment  a used car  10k's of debt and an unfulfilling waste of youth job  then i'm gonna tell you to go ahead and fuck yourself  i don't give a shit about having a ton of money or a fancy car or any of that  it's the hypocrisy of those who do care about material items telling me that i can't have the same things  but that i should still play the game  i am fully aware that there are ways to escape the rigged system and become independent  to successfully do that usually requires some kind of artistic talent  psychopathic behavior  high level of skill at something  and a bit of luck  i have none of that  so basically i'm screwed  but i still won't play your game  i still have the right to enjoy my life in whatever way i can  so quit calling me a loser just because the circumstances of my life have led me down a dead end and i'm not a dumbass who will fold under the pressure and go along with a wayward society  ,arbn9i

34,Turnover is not made of apples,for various reasons  i've quit on a bunch of horrible employers over the past year  but usually only when i had money saved up and or something else lined up that i could do afterward      here's what i found after being on their contact lists for so long       -wis international sent an invitation for me to come back twice  i've quit on them in consecutive years  and they still sent me something wanting me back because they can't find enough staff for their business  this is the company that has practices which are  well highly illegal  such as forcing hotel stays where employees only get four hours of sleep  forcing people to work 16 to 24 hours in a row  things like that  they've had three or four managerial shakesup since i've been on their email list  and nothing ever really seems to change       -pratt-whitney is a horrible warehouse chain that uses ups for their warehouse operations in a town called londonderry  i worked there for six months last year and  surprisingly  it's one of the better jobs i had  this was the job that made me suicidal and feel hopeless about life  they hired a new operations director while i was there  and put in a new staffing coordinator- probably because the ladies who had been doing it up until that point had not been having a good time  this was another job with extremely high turnover to the point where they had a new orientation group in every week  which was highly demoralizing  recently  i got an email saying that they are hiring again  and could i please apply       -callogix was a terrible company that i worked for  and they let me go for various reasons- at 8 in the morning  knowing full well that i would have to sit and wait over three hours for the next bus to come by so i could go home  every now and then  when i pop on indeed to see what's available  i see that they are hiring  this happens about every two months or so  they just can't keep people working for them  their turnover is incredible  and not good like the ones made from apples  more like bad  as in it's appallingly obvious there's an upper class and a lower class at work  these two classes were separated by a locked door with keycard entry      i wonder at what point will managers realize they are costing themselves money by being terrible  i wonder at what point will business owners finally wise up and stop the fast revolving door of entry-level employees and the slowly revolving door of mid-level management  i kind of think it might never actually happen  not as long as employees have to prostrate themselves before a boss just to earn a living- something adam smith was opposed to  believe it or else      and all of these reflections are coming to me while i'm contemplating how to initiate a class-action lawsuit against my current employer  which self-identifies as an escrow company while they pocket 20  of every transaction while refusing to offer payment protection for people who prove they completed the work they were asked to do       i've heard that there's no ethical consumption under capitalism and while i don't necessarily agree with that statement  it occurs to me that a different sort of axiom might also be true  there's no such thing as an ethical boss or workplace under capitalism  either ,at7ah3

37,Interview for a state job,today i have an interview for a state job as a court security officer  i want this gig only because it's a state job and will be less painful than the private sector  i'm not getting my hopes up because  a  if i had to hire me  i wouldn't  and b  i don't know any state employees and it often come down to who you know  government jobs have less of the  shitty factor  but it's still a soul-less grind  if hired  i'd have to survive a year-long probation and not give them an excuse to get rid of me ,aq6t6i
38,There's nothing wrong with being unemployed., and although it was free  i made some money off it which was cool and really surprising  so i definitely recommend also finding a creative hobby if you have a lot of free time   on top of all this though  i highly recommend taking some time out of your day to just  be  no phone  no tv  no distractions  just spending some time observing your own thoughts  we're always doing  so it's good to take some time off and just do nothing  literally  we're called human  beings  after all  not human  doings ,aq53gj
39,Work should not be more important than your life,but it is  or  your boss certainly thinks so   this has been a rough week for me  scratch that  this has been a rough month for me  well  more rough than usual i suppose  on january 14th my grandmother died  we were very close  and she has been an important part of my life for as long as i can remember  this isn t really the proper forum for a eulogy  and its not my angle here to fish for sympathy this is  for our purposes here  background information  her memorial is this friday  and i requested the day off  thankfully it was granted  but i m having a difficult time grappling with having to work this entire week with my entire family in town  people i see maybe once every few years or so  i should have taken the whole week off  knowing full well i would be a wreck  this is valentine s week  however  and i work in the produce department  which covers floral  this is arguably the biggest week of the year for us  even if i had requested that time  i would not have gotten it    i have been thinking a lot about this particular subject since her death  as coming into work has been extremely taxing  as i work for a company that prides itself on customer service  i m not really  allowed  to express any other emotion than obsequious happiness  but i am not happy  in fact i m downright miserable  this feeling  the subject of this post  really hit me hard this tuesday  my cousin had just gotten into town for the service  and we went to lunch before i had to go to work  it is the peak of season here in florida  and i was rushing to finish lunch so i could get to work on time i didn t and when i clocked in i wasn t in a particularly jovial mood  having just powered through a lunch with a family member i enjoy the company of but almost never get to see  just so i could had the pleasure of working for 8 hours  anyway  i had a thought upon clocking in and walking into our cooler  which essentially came down to this  the company i work at doesn t care about any of this  the particulars of my life  the petty travails of its employees  are nothing compared to that of the singular drive for profit  i suddenly realized not for the first time but for the first time in a visceral way that work and life are utterly incompatible  the world of work is not the real world  but ironically it is the one we inhabit the most  everything about work is fake  plastic  a charade of pretend emotions and pretenses  just so people will be slightly more comfortable buying groceries here instead of walmart  a grand illusion constructed for the ever-expanding acquisition of more monetary wealth  and the paltry lives of the gears that make up the machine mean nothing  the death of a slave s grandmother doesn t generate any profit  especially if said slave isn t at work to be squeezed  so he has to come in  the company requires it  we have a duty to uphold the value of our company for our stockholders  after all  its right there in the mission statement  there are some other bullet-points in there too but they aren t as important as that one  and it s the only one that matters anywhere  not just at this company  it s like we live behind a mirror  and what ought to be meaningful  and real  is reflected back at us as threadbare  unimportant  the dark reflection of a grim specter refracted through the dizzying haze of surplus value production    i work on saturday  the day after my grandmother s memorial service  i work at 7 in the fucking morning  no time for silent thought  no meditation  no time for family and friends  no time even for tears  you have work to do  there s money to be made  don t you know  and you better fucking smile while you do it ,aqgrkx

74,I've just found this sub and I'm so excited,there's so much to read and so much to share   i'm very happy to find a sub covering this topic  i'm even thinking of using the last 20mb in my phone's storage to install the reddit app  d  i've started working full-time 9 months ago and since then i've been developing a pretty hardcore work-refusal mindset  you know  almost everybody hates their jobs  but only a few are really willing to question the dominant role that work has in our lives  that's why i'm happy to find a community with 16k  people that share this point of view   i'm also a bit scared because the more i feed my anti-work mindset  the more uncomfortable i feel with my current job  ,aq8q9a
75,Fed-up,quick rant  i work in an office  like many of you a lot of my time is spent trying to look busy and just making it through the day  i used to come in around 8 00 am and leave at 5 00 pm on the dot  you know  because i value my free time and would like to go home and see my wife  a few months ago  my boss pulled me aside and said it was  unprofessional to run out the door at 5 00 every day and she'd really like me to stay until 5 30 every day in-case someone needed something last minute  i reluctantly obliged  even though we all know nothing productive is going to happen in those extra 30 minutes that i could be using to get home and start dinner  so since then i've been watching the clock and then leaving at 5 30 on the dot  last night when i said goodnight to everyone my boss  in a very condescending tone said  oh  it must be 5 30 because el-diablow  never  stays past 5 30  i was taken aback  so i just glanced at her  didn't say anything and walked out  seething with anger on my drive home  i should also mention i'm the first person at the office every morning and typically alone for at least an hour or so  ,aqlyak

79,"Fellow Idlers, I could use some Job Advice! (Please help)",so  i've been basically getting paid to  sleep  for  months  now at my job  i work an overnight shift job with dogs but i make sure they have water and get to go out before i go to sleep  i then wake up 3-4 hours later and take them out again  re-fill their water  etc  if there are any problems i'll separate dogs  but typically i catch things when i'm awake   last night however  a dog  destroyed  one of the doors  really just a bad paint job as far as i could tell from the pic  and my manager discovered that this happened  because  i was asleep through the cameras  of course  that's nonsense  i would not have been able to stop the dog from doing that to the door even if i  had  been awake   the dog was  probably  upset because i separated him from the other dogs because he kept knocking over their water bowls and i believe at one point got aggressive  though i'm not sure  in any case  i didn't give him water in the new room because he  always  does this  which is also what bit me in the ass  i should have done it  but i barely thought to  honestly   here's my question   what should i do   1  keep doing what i'm doing  2  take micro-naps and do the walk-throughs  3  stay up all night  this job  is  actually important to me  somewhat  it's the best job i've had in a while and i'd prefer not to lose it  so please no suggestions of quitting  picking another shift is ill-advised because i could only do evenings  i hate mornings  and besides i already do an evening shift in the week as well    let me know if you have any questions  thanks ,aub852
80,New comer with some questions (serious),hey everyone  i ve just discovered this sub and have a few questions  they are all serious as i am curious to learn and the best way to learn is to ask for clarification when you have questions     1  people on here seem to be talking about not working  but what would you do instead  no i don t mean how would you fill your time  i mean literally what would you do without money  is the plan to live off the grid or something    2  i understand the desire to leave a job you aren t fulfilled in  i am an avid reader of fire subs and blogs  but what about speaking out another more fulfilling career   i understand it would be great to never have to work but isn t minimizing the pain best  especially when working is a requirement if you want to have the money to buy stuff    3  are the majority of people on here american   i am a canadian and grew up there  but as an adult i have lived in europe and australia which are both more socialist than capitalist  this whole idea seems like the capability system failing the  little guy  and i m wondering if there are people on here from non capitalist countries    4  are there any people on here who actually enjoy their job but are seeking things like early retirement   i ask because i 100  love my job  but i have a lot of freedom and challenge  and a great  return on my time investment    thanks  and again all questions are serious  i m just trying to learn  ,avprvm

82,what a waste of a life,i was talking to my best friend last night and she told me about this boy she knows whose parents are rich so he lives at home and doesn t work or go to school  i said  personally  that s not the life i want for myself but if he s happy and not harming anyone then good for him   my friend kept hounding me about how he s lazy and stupid for not owning a car or having any credit  to which i told her credit was an arbitrary concept created by the government and does not determine one s intelligence  if he doesn t have a car and has some other way of getting around then good for him   she s brainwashed so she heard absolutely nothing i said and she finally said  what a waste of a life  which really upset me  how can you tell someone who else that their life was wasted  we determine whether our lives were wasted or unfulfilling because we are the ones who live them every day   do some people really think that the only way to live a fulfilling life is to work a 9-5 for 40 years  buy a house and a car until you re 60 and too old and tired to enjoy your long-awaited  retirement  i feel bad for people who are so brainwashed by society to think that this is the ultimate goal  they re selling you a false idea of happiness in order to use you in their machine to pump more product and money out into the world  all to benefit them  not you  neither of which measures your utility or value  i don t want to live a life strictly confined by the self-serving goals forced upon me generation after generation  that doesn t make my life a waste  ,aveamj
83,We are literally monkeys forced to sit in front of a screen and press buttons for our reward.,our bodies  our minds  and out total physical condition evolved out of the tribal hunter gather environment that was africa  since then our body as stayed the same  the only difference is that we have been forced to live in a new environment where there is constant stimuli  constant pressure to perform  and an expectation that you must meet this next goal  what this has done is put our bodies under constant stress and forced us to sacrifice our health with things like sleep   this is not the way our bodies were built to perform  all across the board in the us people get minimal exercise and sleep which is literally killing them  i would even add that it is even more dangerous than smoking cigarettes because of the multiplier effect of ignoring other things like family that result from treating work like a mandatory obligation   we are just monkeys  in suits pretending like we know what we are doing  but we aren't  the system is sociopathic and doesn't care if you have such and such a personal issue as you are easily replaceable  that is why people feel lost  because they choose money and status and those things are only temporary in the grave the poor man and the rich man stay at the same depth  six feet under ,auha2h

86,Why would I work for a society that's willing to let me be homeless?,i just don't understand  i'm 25 and i've never had a job  it's been miserable  i've never had a girlfriend  a car  a apartment  friends  gotten to pick my own food  gotten to  go out  i have lost all contact with my family  not because i don't like them or they don't like me  but because i'm in a constant state of misery  i don't want to bring other people down   i just don't understand how i'm supposed to give any effort to society after a lifetime of being treated like complete scum    i understand i haven't ever flipped a burger or stocked a shelf at wal-mart  but should that really mean that i have to wake up everyday in complete agony at the idea of another day in a life that i have no control over    i didn't pick the way my brain works  i've tried working before and it makes me completely miserable  if that makes me worthless then why not offer homeless people a pain free method of euthanasia  i don't see the difference between letting me die painlessly and letting me die to overexposure    i'm not trying to be thick  i just don't understand it at all  and i don't understand how i'm supposed to be  normal  after 25 years of not having my own life  there's no snapping out of it  and after being treated so badly for my whole life i don't think there is anyway i could happily work for this society everyday    the world has made it clear that it doesn't think people like me deserve food  water or shelter  so how could i possibly ever give it even a second of my time    honestly  if universal basic income was a thing i could see myself actually having a job  if i was started out with the basics like a tiny apartment  food and water  it would give me the abiltty to do things like have people over  have girls over  go out and meet people  i would be much less of a mess of a person  but because i've been treated like a child my entire life because of my refusal to work i literally don't understand how i'm supposed to do anything   i can't have people over when i'm forced to still live at home  i can't go out with no money  i can't learn to socialize  i can't do anything except wake up everyday and wish i was dead   until ubi is a thing i will continue to refuse to work  it's funny that people thing people who don't work have it easy  they only have it easy if they are born into a rich family  if you are born into a poor family it's literal daily hell  the fact that i haven't killed myself yet is a fucking wonder of nature  ,ar6n36

91,21 years of life in a mountain wilderness - I wanted to share this here...,  from the description      story-line   their home most certainly has a view  ramiz palos and his wife zemina fled the hardships of urban life in bosnia as soon as the country had emerged from a 4-year-war two decades ago    they choose to live on mount vlasic in central bosnia at 1 300 meters above sea level  separated by kilometres of dirt road from the nearest inhabited place    palos says he is not a recluse and was not looking for an escape from traumatic memories  instead  he says  he wanted to take control of his life   after 21 years of primal existence in the wilderness palos feels in control and happy  insisting he would never return to  civilisation    i had several reasons to move here  i came here to secure means for existence  but also to live an exciting life  to not have a boring life  he says    life in the wilderness has many challenges  but palos insists embracing it was easier and more productive than if he had waited for the government to create a job for him    people here  in bosnia  are too willing to surrender responsibility for their own life to somebody else  they are not thinking  people need to think to come up with ways to find work for themselves  i don't have to worry about the work of the government or anyone else  he says   while he sometimes has to fight off bears and wolves and to endure pouring rains  winter storms and strong winds  palos has an abundance of food  fresh air and a warm home    you need to know how to behave  in nature  because we get heavy rains  winter storms and strong winds  you need to know how to behave in such circumstances  he says    sometimes it gets so cold that i cannot leave home for two months  but i have enough food and everything else i need so it does not matter  winter comes and goes   with an unemployment rate of close to 30 percent  finding a job in bosnia can be hard and close to a fifth of the country's population lives in poverty   the country is failing to fully capitalise on the good climatic conditions and an abundance of fertile land that make it one of the most favourable spots for farming in southern europe   but aleksandra nikolic from the sarajevo faculty of agriculture and food science believes that a growing number of bosnians are recognising the advantages of rural life    agriculture is a way of life  it is no longer identified with the image of an exhausted man farming a rough patch of land in the middle of nowhere with the help of emaciated farming animals  she says   agriculture is a sector of economy that helps people in local communities to weather the periods of financial  economic  political or any other crisis by securing a source of income that helps them get through hard times  palos might be the best example of that  when he first moved into the mountains in 1996 he lived in an old van and then in a makeshift tent  but after just a few months  he had built a simple house for himself and was joined by his wife   they still live in the house with no running water and off the electricity grid  but they grow their own vegetables and corn  raise goats and farm fish in the wild mountain river  palos used local wood and stone to build his barn  hatching tanks and the watermill where he grinds his corn   from time to time  palos ventures into the nearest town to sell extra produce to urban dwellers and purchase essential supplies that he and his wife cannot produce for themselves      ,asegbb

93,Best description i saw on why anti-work isn't anti-effort, gt sufjanfan 3 points 26 days ago  we can't have a society where everyone could or would want to do nothing all day    gt but even  work  is a modern idea  humans have been working for longer than we existed but we only recently carved our life into spheres of work and leisure  in a very crude way that's left lots of paradoxes - one great example from feminist theory is the wild amount of work done in the home that's ultimately beneficial to society but still mostly unpaid  this dichotomy means that when people suggest doing away with work as we know it people assume we're going to replace it with the only other thing they're familiar with - digital streaming services and maybe a couple hobbies  hyperbole but you get the point    gt in actuality  growing food  teaching people  building buildings  raising children and animals  cleaning important spaces  and organizing with the people around you - the kinds of labour that are most necessary - are pretty rewarding or fulfilling despite being really hard  work  especially when do you decide to do them when you want  a world without work would still have an abundance of productive exploits like these  and on top of that it's not like we'd ever be wanting for creative media to consume  since people find even more joy in producing that ,au4g06

111,The Ongoing Saga of the Terrible Client,so today  after i gave a client on upwork five days of initial labor  and another three days of revision labor  amounting to eight days in total  he cancels the contract and asks for a refund on funds in escrow      and this is after i went out of my way to try and make him happy by providing the changes that he requested to a fictioanl manuscript- which  mind you  he wanted after three days of us coming to an agreement  highly unrealistic      i advised him today that the work i produced is my own  and that i'll use it for my own purposes  i'm sure he was just running a scam to try and get free work out of someone so that he can turn around and make a profit off it later    ,amgexr

113,Living as a street artist,i've been doing street art for two years now  after having a terrible experience in retail i decided i would be happier out of working system   last year i got an office job  i've been living as an artist for a while  let me see how well i can handle an office work  it lasted for three months  got no time to do the things i enjoy and got so tired and stressed out  left that and came back to the streets    an ex coworker told me  you are weak for not being able to sustain a job for too long  you are not professional  all i could think about was  who is the weak one  i work 4h daily and get almost the same amount as a closed and stressing job  i have enough time to study and get good at the things i actually like to do  so in the future i'll make a living with those things  i can exercise  i take natural vitamin d  i have time to read my books  to draw  to spend with people i love  to see my therapeut  to take care of myself  i've never been so healthy  my body is in shape  i look way younger  25 f  and i dont need an expensive car or makeup to feel good about myself  who is the weak one   i don't have children and live by my own so i guess that makes it easier to live this way  i'm living a minimal life without any luxury  out of guarantees  i don't have payments in my account every month - it's day by day  but i guarantee my mental sanity  also i can get good at the stuff i like to do   people call me crazy and childish  i may be a lunatic but i'm happy the way things are going on    sorry i'm still learning how to express myself in english  not my native language ,ams6iz
114,I'd like to share some thoughts about meaningful work,i am now in a job that i do not hate because it would exist relatively unchanged in some kind of utopia  and i'd like to tell you all about it because i want to talk about best-case scenarios as well  i won't go into much detail for privacy reasons  sorry   i am a personal assistant to a disabled person  now  i don't know if this is common outside the nordic countries  so i'll explain  if someone with a longterm disability requires regular assistance from another person for daily tasks - not medical care  and not  looking after  - it's possible to hire someone to come help you out with whatever you need  my employer has a physical disability affecting mobility  and their own life that they live  so i am just there when needed for logistical support  so to speak  it allows my employer to focus on their own life  rather than meshing the role of assistant with friends or family  i don't have any opinion on something like whether anyone prefers an employee to a relative taking this role  my point is more that this option is available to people here  and i'm not trying to toot my own horn here  anyone with mobility in their hands could do this work  so i'm not special but i think that this particular position is pretty cool   so  i'm very motivated when i go to work  it helps that my employer and i get along well  but the fact of the matter is that this is work that needs to happen  in an ideal world  in my opinion  disabled people would be not bred out nor segregated nor considered a burden  so this is work that absolutely needs to be done and an option that absolutely needs to exist in order for everyone to have self-determination  compare to some childcare jobs i have had  where the parents and kids expressed the desire to actually stay home  but for serious financial reasons couldn't  that was so frustrating to me  and left me with a lot of dissatisfaction in my work   the other thing i like about my job now is that this comes at no cost to my employer  they are the one who put out the job listing  interviewed me  hired me  and who sends my hour log to the city  but it is the city who pays my salary  to speak of the salary  it is enough for just me to live without much stress  but it's likely that other people with more responsibilities would need help  but for me  this particular situation is very stress-free   if things were different when i woke up tomorrow  and i didn't need to go to work anymore  for the first time in my life i would still go to work anyway as long as my employer required my assistance  i sure couldn't say that working in restaurants or cleaning houses  or at some of my childcare jobs  i prefer my free time  but i don't dread work at all  and i don't feel dead from it    i hope that whatever kind of things you're interested in and good at  that some kind of employment like this comes up  where it would exist in relatively the same form even in an ideal world  i wish you all meaningful days and fruitful effort  ,anta6b
115,Whats your vision for a realistic anti-work society?,obviously plenty of shitty jobs will still have to be done for the world to continue functioning  but i truly feel that if we acknowledged that they are as shitty as they are and paid a more fair wage while scaling back hours everything would be so much better  studies show that scaling back hours leads almost always produces the same amount of completed work  example  janitor  no one says  i want to be a janitor when i grow up  but unfortunately  that kind of job has to be done  if they were paid a higher rate and had less hours they would be much happier right  so lets say a hospital wing has one janitor making  10 an hour working 9 hours a day 5 days a week  if they were paid  20 an hour and only worked 5 hours a day 5 days a week they would be much happier  even more so if a second janitor was hired to make up for when janitor   1 isn't there  where does this extra money come from  idk  the same imaginary place all money comes from  how will this be implemented without fucking with inflation  idk  i don't have an economics degree  but if this could somehow work and we could hire two people for every single position while still paying them at the same rate they are currently making everything would be so much better  ,anfdh9

118,Employer wants to increase hours,my employer recently announced that they're changing everyone from 35 to 40 hour contracts  there's been no mention of salaries increasing accordingly yet and i don't envision them offering me an amount that would make it palatable  because fuck work  i'd rather have the free time   what are my options here  in the uk  obviously they're going to try and pressure everyone to sign the new contract but what happens if i refuse  can i just stick with the original contract   consultations  will begin soon so any advice is welcome ,anxo64
119,Really feels like there is no escape... (Told that happiness over money is immature),so this happened a couple hours ago  but keeps grating at my nerves  sorry if this gets long  need to rant    i was talking about how to find a job since i have left uni and have 8k in loans  understandable  i have to get those parasites off of me as soon as possible  but the issue seems to be when actually deciding what to do to get rid of the debt  my mom was poking around for ideas since i write and hope to have passive income self-publishing eventually  asking what i could find online for maybe a site or something local  something that i could not get too stressed over and had some experience doing    the issue came when my dad started getting angry because i wasn't receptive to the idea of wal-mart or a factory like him  he knows it would be stressful  early hours and i am not a morning person  and half the places listed don't even do the basics of allowing unions  which all i mentioned to him  he proceeded to tell me that i had to have something  i had to agree  and anything is better than nothing  so the chance of some money at the risk of burning out and suicidal thoughts like the reason i left college because i work for whatever company can exploit me the easiest is fine  as long as i make at least  10 hour  literally his bar of making a decision on jobs    i reminded him about why i left  severe depression and anxiety  in combination with incompetent faculty and he says that's life  suck it up  not every day is going to be fun  yeah  but i don't want everyday to be a shit show like where you work and constantly pissed at co-workers that you complain about to everyone  i say i don't want the boomer gen-x mentality and would rather be disability and poor if that is the life he wanted me to have  all he cared about was how it would be a stain for future employers and wouldn't get me anything good later  not i don't know  wondered if there could be a reason i felt so broken  not saying people on it are anything negative or worthless  but i don't know what i am good for and it is all my minimal self-worth i use it for myself  i feel like shit and life right now is breaking me   he then goes on to talk about how i am going to end up working until i die and have no retirement  to which i mention because i am a millennial and the way things are going with the jobs he thinks i should take  i will anyways  which leads to the main reason i was mad enough to make this post  he says it's because my generation has smartphones and video games  and waste money on that to be happy instead of putting it away for retirement  i asked if he was joking  that spending a little money on something that brings joy is why we cannot escape from this pit at 65  this leads to him going on a rant about two single moms working two jobs and happy because they don't have those  and i realized it was pointless to keep arguing  he really has no idea and wouldn't change his mind  i was tired and i didn't want to hear how i was being lazy and a hippie with my ideals  rather sleep on the couch and be too depressed to actually cry  ,aonkz0

123,My mom got fired today,my 60-year-old mom works as a fitness instructor at various gyms  she teaches different fitness classes to different groups and ability levels   i got a call from her this evening  and she was crying  she said her boss left a sealed envelope for her in her office  in it was a notice of her termination  my mom didn't read the letter to me  but she claimed no explanation was given  she speculated the class attendees were complaining about her teaching style not accommodating all fitness levels  she wondered why they didn't simply reassign her to a different class rather than outright fire her   she worked at this gym for 9 years  and really enjoyed that workplace  she made lifelong friends there   she also went above-and-beyond developing her class there  she invested her  own  money to purchase music  portable audio equipment to play the music  and small inexpensive physical equipment to augment some exercises  she purchased all this new music and equipment for an upcoming class  but obviously won't be using it now   on the phone  she kept saying that she felt like a failure  i didn't know how to respond to that  how do i even respond to that   she also claimed the gym still has all her music and equipment  and since she was fired via a letter  she was unable to get her property back today ,aoodln
124,[Whiney vent] I'm not made for this society,i sound so whiney and i can't tell this to anyone  i hope this sub will understand me   everyday i get closer to having to slave away at a job  school isn't going well because i've been struggling with depression and possible add for forever and never got help  not only that  it's simply because i've always hated studying random shit  those two illnesses wouldn't even be a problem if it werent for the school system in the first place  it caused my depression  and add really doesn't fuck my life in any other aspect  i was miserable in highschool  in my country we have this culture of getting overloaded with information from 8 45-2 15 and then we all pay for private tutors  normally for an hour and a half but so many times we stayed 4-6 hours or more because of exams  now it's still bad with uni  every exam is equivalent to studying a 400 page textbook  i'm done with this  but i look to the future and only see slave jobs  it's no better  i'm officially trapped  what's the point in life if you're not rich and famous  that's the only option you have to get out of this mess  otherwise you're just a modern proletariat looking up to the people on top  it's too early for ai to reform everything and just get universal income  and inactivity is horrible as well  i can't do anything worth something for society because i haven't proven i'm qualified  i'll never have fulfillment  i just can't take it anymore  yesterday i bawled my eyes out because i found out a famous girl from my country who's a year older is where she is today because she tweeted  i want to give you a hug  to a famous youtuber and he decided to date her  is that it  got so much to say i can't say anything  the worst part is when your parent no longer has any wisdom to give you  they just tell you that they worked hard  to the point of back injury  and lived for the little things  i can't do that  i can't  i'm so confused ,anr5o6

127,Not working long term: How would people handle that?,tl dr what would people do with themselves if they didn't have to work  would they find ways to remain integrated and social within society  would we withdraw into tv and media  would we find most people lack a passion and drive to make the most of their time  when all they have is time    amp x200b   i'm on the last day of my weekend here  and why there's no way in hell i'm looking forward to work  i'm also wondering how i would fill my time if i didn't have to work  i mean  i'm relatively lazy  and doing the same solitary things day in day out would no necessarily satisfy me  i also know that my relatively lazy self would not thrown myself into all those things i say i want to do and accomplish just because i had the time  it would take work for me and building a good lifestyle i think  for not working to  work  i imagine i'd having to have standing coffee dinner lunch dates  maybe join a sports or community group  rubbish cleanup  charity for the needy  having social appointments would help me appreciate my time by myself  it'd be nice to even have just time to go hiking  or to lunch at the park    amp x200b   so how do we think most of the populace would handle not having to work  we say we'd do these thousands of things  cook  sew  draw  garden  but these require a lot of self direction i guess  and putting work in to get good at these things takes actual effort  would most people be willing to put in this effort  would someone who has the time and patience to learn how to cook well for their family and community decide to be a chef and or open a restaurant  well that's great then if having the space and time has let this person find their passion  but about billions of other people seeking a place and role and purpose in their lives or greater communities  would having all the time make most people better and force them to really seek out their ideal selves  or would most people crumble    amp x200b   like i'm sitting here  i stopped reading 'the courage to be disliked' because it's a bit of a dry book  and right now i'm not sure how it's tittle relates to it's content  but i was getting bored  i'm a super amount of options of what to do  i could go for a walk in various places  maybe a swim  i could nap  i could visit at least one person  i could watch tv  i could meditate or just do nothing  there's no force in me telling myself i have to worry about making the most of my time today  i'm doing chores tomorrow i decided  so now i'm kinda not lost as to what to do  but i'm ultimately in complete control  similar to the books talking points  so who do i want to be  what would society be in such a situation ,ap1bu6

Exhausted.,i love the people whom i work with  my manager is reasonable and accommodating  but this mandatory overtime 12 weeks a year  2 six week periods a year  is crushing me  i secretly sometimes wish i could go back to working part time and be on welfare again  but government shutdowns  and the looming threat of  an unstable economy  scare me  and i feel as though i have to work full time  like my choices are working or being on the streets  turning to spirituality helps a little  like i just finished reading the baghavad gita  and its portion on dharma helped me find some solace  however   i have a serious metal illness  but it's functional enough that i'm able to work  however it makes working hard  even though my job is relatively easy for me--printer breaks down  fix printer  pc is on the fritz  fix pc--and pays well too  i'm starting to struggle with being required to work overtime  even if it's only 3 months of the year  that's still 25  of my year that i have to work 55 hrs a week  at first i loved it because it meant extra pay  but now i'm feeling defeaten  i've been at the job nearly 1 5 years  i at one point loved this job  and in many ways  i love aspects of it and i'm grateful to have it  so i hope this post doesn't sound whiny   my dream job would be something where i could be self directed in my time  doing something i found meaning in  i love to help people  through advocacy and activism  research  writing  public speaking  and so i'm considering going to graduate school to become a minister    but i just feel so defeaten at work right now  like  i'm near tears  i just finished my 6th week of ot  and now i'm facing a 40 hr week  with 1 day off  today    any advice    following unitarian universalist tradition ,ap9tfc
144,Finishing up my last week of freedom...for now,starting a new job on monday after leaving my previous job a month ago  the month off was so freeing and refreshing  not really looking forward to having to start again  at least i ll be working 100  remote making sure to draw a firm line as far as work life balance goes  ,aojd6k

146,On applying for jobs,it fairycosmos  i hate applying for jobs because the employers are always like  do you enjoy working in a distressful environment  do you strive for obtainable standards of perfection  are you good at dealing with people that make you feel extremely uncomfortable  do you mind losing real hours of your life in order to make minimum wage  are you a fan of capitalism  do you love selling your soul just so you can afford to live  ,ao21uf

148,Do you reply to emails on weekends?,for example  i got a message at 1 am last night from upwork demanding a response  the timeframe is just 1 day already after i submitted work on friday evening  i don't do biz on weekends  i also get messages from a school i work for on sunday evenings which drives me mad  this isn't necessary in my experience of working for other schools who never pestered me on weekends  i've had to reply of course though i've force stopped my messaging app today  i've even got messages on holidays  what is wrong with people  i actually find this weird behaviour  are they so indoctrinated that they don't take weekends off themselves  the weekend is a very much needed time of recuperation  getting up early is a killer for me and work is stressful  so i utterly despise it when people show no respect for this boundary and this leads me back to the same question  what is wrong with them  do they ever switch off or are they work robots  ,ap3f8r

150,Good time for me to find this sub...,i'm a college freshman in school to do psychology research- something i'm genuinely interested in  the problem is with the massive cost of education here in the us i need to work  i applied to be an ra last week and the thought came to mind  clear as day   in a world without money i would not be doing this  the next logical question is-  why  do i have to  i've been looking into anticapitalist ideals for a while  hopefully this sub will help me find more ways to apply them    fuck work  ,aoi4o6
151,Is anyone else's manager this inept?,mostly a rant here but i'm curious to see if there is anyone else here with a manager who is this useless and feckless   i work a firm that is owned by my local council  the department i work in has one manager as we're a small part of the company  i should add we do the tree work in the councils parks    he will routinely hand us work we've handed in completed months prior and equipment like saws and hedge trimmers won't be fixed  it's up to him to get it done  we'll hand broken equipment in to him and it just gets abandoned in the shipping container where we secure the tools   he managed to fry the lightning relay on a truck by trying to jump start it with car jump leads  we warned him that would happen  he did it anyway  this resulted in the truck pissing sparks everywhere and melted the cables to the chassy  completely fucking the truck and costing tons to repair   he does underhand things too  a colleague of mine is retraining to be an electrician and enquired to the street lighting department for a new job - our lovely manager had a word with their departments manager  telling him my colleague is lazy and not good at the job  just to keep him on trees as he's deparate for drivers  we need special licences to drive the larger vehicles  funnily enough the street light department turned my colleague down for a job   training is promised and never delivered  he lies about problems he makes and just runs our department very badly  the only reason he has the job is because he was friends with a higher up  who was sacked for racism and sexism  he had no managerial experience prior to this job and it really shows - the man is a clown and a cretin   ,aoff8m
152,Today I got fired,as the title reads  i was sent home  apparently i failed the social media background check and i was deemed a threat to the capitalist establishment  so when i showed up for my 3pm-11pm they told me to go home  i laughed at the them  this irritated the supervisor  i literally found it funny because i am not going to voluntarily give up my social media accounts  he told me i could turn in my uniforms because not disclosing my social media activities was deemed failing the background check  i told him that until i get my final paycheck  you won't get shit  those guys really like the taste of boot leather ,anvd60
153,Might be the wrong forum (FMLA),tldr  employer calculated fmla eligibility into determining office locations    amp x200b   trying to determine if my employer is covered under fmla  we have two offices in separate cities with 50  employees between the two  the issue is that to be eligible the offices must be 75miles door to door across surface streets  the two offices are 75 6 miles using google  they moved offices within the last 4 or 5 years after a bankruptcy and buyout and moved  the old office distance  was 74 3 miles  i can't but help feel this is a calculated move by corporate so they dont have to abide by fmla  guess i wont be eligible for any of the ligament surgeries i need and my health will be determined by the whims and generosity of an inherently sociopathic institution ,aod5vu

156,"I don't even really mind working, I actually feel better when I work hard. My problem is and always will be the exploitation of labor, IE capitalism.",i don't mind working  i don't mind working hard  but  i want my fair share of the profit  i don't want some rich asshole to suck up 90 to 99  of the profit while i'm left behind to suck up what pennies i can through a straw       the only way around this seems to be  join a co-op or become self employed  i've got a lot of experience doing it work and that's what my ba is in  but  i'd need a long list of reliable customers to be able to quit my day job for doing that full time       i don't know of any co-op's where i live  maybe i could put in work in an effort to start one  weed just got legalized in my state  maybe me and my stoner friends could all throw down on a green house or something  then  turn that into our co-op       just tossing out ideas here  not looking forward to spending the rest of my life as someone else's slave  i want to break the cycle ,alzd54

158,Fuck cameras,i'll try to make this quick as i'm currently on break but will update later  so my last job was crushing my soul so i decided to get a new one  in the interview it's mentioned  we have cameras but they aren't for you but they will be watching you    my initial thought was that's weird but maybe they are hoping i don't steal things  fast foward a few months and i feel like i'm back in middle school  i'm constantly being reminded not to sit around or the camera will see me  i've had emails sent telling me that i've been on my phone that they've seen on camera and apparently i'm not being seen on camera enough of that makes any sense   i like this job as it's more money than i've ever seen but this is ridiculous  i'm fairly new to the job market so can anyone tell me if this is normal ,alyvhi

160,Obtaining unemployment for quitting?,hi everyone  i have an extremely admirable work ethic  i come in and try to do the absolute best i can every day  unfortunately  my boss and i do not mesh well and i know she is trying to get me to quit  i have done everything i possibly can to do a good job  my colleagues like me and know i'm working hard  and to be honest  they all hate her as well  with that  i've been documenting everything  my question is  is it possible to obtain unemployment due to mental anguish  i've never in my life been in a position where i'm treated so incompetently and like total shit every day and i seriously can not take it anymore  i've been trying to move internally and apply for other jobs  but nothing is panning out  thanks in advance ,an4783

162,Suicidal from working or am I just a trash human?,well  actually it's not l as simple as work made me suicidal  but it is a big portion of it  i had suicidal thoughts eversince i was 13 or 14 because i just didn't see a point in wasting my time in school  did not have any friends for a long time  also  i eventually burned out at 17 leaving me in a heavily disassociative state of mind  took a year off  and finished school as the best student of my school later  it's especially the latter half of the neet-year  where the symptoms slowly subsided  the last school year and the gap between school and work i look back fondly because it's literally the only time i felt alive  accepted and had hardly any signs of any depressive disorder   but it all backfired so fast when work came around  i used to have a lot of hobbies and friends during these last years and they are all gone now  first the friends went away as i did not have time to spend time together anymore within the first months  my hobbies went away step by step as my energy level got lower and lower from literally doing nothing in an office  i used to draw from time to time  write journal  play videogames  not even this one is fun anymore  smoke less  drink less  go to the gym  this is probably tje only thing i still do a few times a week  skate and most of all i felt alive  it was in the ladder months where i realized my personality might not be able to ever adapt  my parents realized i changed much for the worse again but  01 priority is that i go to work for them  i never was in a relationship and i think this also fuels my mental state  i am not too ugly  just my personality makes it hard to meet people and even sympathize witj them  i don't even know if i have the emotional capacities to keep a relationship anymore  i told my parents as long as i still make and listen to music there is nothing to worry about  i called in sick for work threw on a documentary and vent on here  i don't have the motivation to listen to music right now and it's the first time in a very long time  and i don't know if i can make it through even just 5 more years on this planet  i am 20  lost all ambitions  emotional capacities and interest so fast and i don't know what i should do anymore ,amzoi6
163,Why is it so wrong to only work for the money?,i dont work for fun  im not motivated  i only work because i need to eat and pay bills  that doesnt mean i am a bad worker  i was a solid a b student in school and i always try my hardest at work  but its because its a lot easier to do well than having to find a new job after getting fired  but many applications  especially online  have questionnaires where based on wording they seem to be looking for someone who will work through breaks and lunches  stay late as much as needed without being asked  able to essentially mind read any customers and then upsell based on what they want    its a minor annoyance  but when ive been struggling to find a job that doesnt physically and mentally wear me down and a questionnaire answer option is literally  i am hardwired to serve  i have to draw a line  im not sure if theyre serious or not  the next answer down is  i have always enjoyed serving people  which seems more believable  but i still cant relate  i dont and i cant work because i enjoy it  i work because i could die if i dont ,amvn0r

165,First day @ new job,so  i finally got out of my toxic and overbearring job  today is my first day at a new job with a great company  good benefits  time off  casual environment  but i can't help but feel discouraged already  i know i don't want to work under capitalism but i have student loans and bills   i have no desire to do this job  i took it because it pays more and got me out of my previous shitty job  i want to do something i care about  that feels like i'm helping people  and this is just more of sitting behind a computer all day managing data   my friends and family don't understand it  it's only the first day and they want me to give it more time  i get it  but the feeling of waking up this morning so damn early and dreading coming in  and now my dread being confirmed   it feels like there's no escape from this depression of meaningless work ,an4pyr

169,Book recommendations,i thought it might be interesting to hear about more books on antiwork than are in the sidebar  what're everyone's favourites and why  the two i think most about are   -the refusal of work by david frayne    this one goes through the ideology of the work ethic  the ways work takes over our lives so even free time isn't really free  and has a lot of interesting and well researched sources  but the thing i really like is it interviews a group of people who've tried to push work out of their lives as much as possible and talks about how they reached a breaking point  one really cathartic part was when they talked about these small slices of utopia they experienced that made them realise something better was possible and they were wasting their life  though it also goes through the social financial pressures that come up when you try to push work out of your life  it opens with a quote from a film called the working class goes to heaven  where antiwork students with megaphones harangue the workers going into a factory in the morning saying  it's 8 o clock in the morning  when you come out it will be dark  the sun will not shine for you today   -bullshit jobs by david graeber  this one's already in the sidebar and is pretty well known  but it talks about one of the most infuriating and frustrating parts of work  a significant portion  if not most  of the work we do is totally pointless  increasing productivity hasn't led to us working less  or freeing us from work entirely  it's led to the proliferation of what're essentially make-work jobs  it goes into how alienating and despairing it can be working those jobs  and why  it proposes a ubi as the solution  though david graeber is an anarchist   put your favorite bits of writing below    ,amoxi7
