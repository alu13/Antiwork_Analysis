2,"""I'm rich!""","I found an old blog I wrote a year before I dropped out at 16 and started my business. It could give you guys some ideas if anyone is struggling.

""Every hour and 40 minutes I get 5 clients. 20 minute sessions and charging $50 per client. That is $150 for almost every hour and a half when most get $20 an hour.

For them, they get $160 for going to school for another 9 years and working for someone 8 hours a day. For me, I get $1,200 for chilling and working for myself 8 hours per day. For them, they get $800 per week. For me, I get $6,000 per week. For them, they get $3,200 per month. For me, I get $24,000 per month. For them, they get 38,400 per year. For me, I get $288,000 per year.

Are you ready?

""Most physicians earn an annual income around $150,000""

16,"Capitalism sucks, y'all.","As a follow-up from [my previous post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ih9lbn/i_just_got_fired_as_an_amazon_driver) I'd like to say that payroll can be at least as bad as working. My gf and I were recently employed by the same Amazon delivery service provider (hereafter ‚ÄúDSP‚Äù), but she transferred to another DSP shortly before I got canned. We both got emails from our former DSP on August 28^th about an issue with ADP, saying that direct deposit would come through within 48 hours. It hasn't yet been 48 hours as I write this, but she got paid and I'm wondering why I didn't when we both have direct deposit set up (possibly the 49.12 hours I clocked last week, but I don't know for sure). The email did say that paper checks would be sent out within 24 hours, but I really don't want to wait a week for my money. I'm not saying anything is malicious on any side, but it is at the very least fairly suspicious.

Couple that with the fact that I spent almost $300 on books and uniforms for the coming fall semester (nursing school FTW!) and that was *after* $1000 in school bookstore credit (plus the fact that I had to go downtown to the main campus to get the supplies when there's a campus close enough for me to walk if I'm feeling really ambitious, which is where I'd taken all my previous classes) and I hope you can understand why I'm pissed.

The only saving grace is that classes and clinicals this semester are all virtual because of the pandemic (though I remember hearing something about in-person clinicals later in the semester).

I was taken a back a bit becasue i wasn‚Äôt expecting that test out of the blue. (Btw they dont usually do this, other mangers are okay). Anyways i gave her a bullshit answer. Obviously she wasn‚Äôt satisfied with that answer. 

However she said something that really ticked me off. She told me that we have to work harder for our hours, considering school season is coming and they will be less hours to give to employees. 

First of all i have this job as a part time, second i get pad $10.50 an hour, I‚Äôm not going to bust my ass for a stupid ass part time job for $10. Finally i dare her to give other employees hours considering they are not as experience or well familiarized with the system as people who have been there for years.

20,Fuck these shifts (rant),"Working retail I get how your weekends are non existent and you can work 7 days straight to only get a day off (they can‚Äôt give me two days off in a row), but give me a break with these hours, people!

These shifts aren‚Äôt necessarily horrible. I‚Äôve done ‚Äòclopens‚Äô before where you work 2pm-10 and then come in the next day at 5am, but the 2pm-10 one day and the 8am-4 the next day is one of the stupidest things. At least with the clopens I know I‚Äôm getting fucked. I know when I get home from clopens I KNOW I won‚Äôt get my 8 hours so I can take my time doing my home duties.

These 2pm-10 and 8am-4 give me just enough time to get home, cook, eat, water my plants, brush my teeth and immediately go to sleep.

I have to speed run my few precious hours off of work in order to get the basic home chores before going to bed because my manager doesn‚Äôt know how to make a decent schedule. 

But even if I do get in bed at record time, I start to think, ‚Äúwith the current 16 hours of work, I only have 2 hours of FREE time.‚Äù And I spend the next 3 hours tossing in turning in anger because how fucked I‚Äôm getting. 

But then I realized, I can call out. So I did. I get a strike and if I do it another two times I‚Äôll get a write up, but I‚Äôm okay with that. I think I might call out again tomorrow for shits.

23,"The usage of the word ""work"" in non-English languages","I wanted to ask multilingual members of the community - what is the relationship of the words or words in your other language(s) that serve the purpose of ""work"" in English? 

I am a native English speaker and the only other language I speak even half fluently is Malagasy. In the early stages of learning, I would frequently transpose or map sentences directly using the common words I knew and something that never translated properly was my usage of ""work."" I would want to say ""yes, the pen *works*"" or ""noontime *works* for me."" The (Merina) Malagasy word for 'work' is ""asa"" (n) or ""miasa"" (act. v) and it translates more to 'profession' and 'jobbing.' The verb wouldn't apply in any other way than what you do to earn a livelihood. In place of how I used it in my examples, people often use the word ""go"" in such contexts (the electricity *goes*) or simply that something is ""okay."" Sometimes I found myself wanting to resort to equally insidious turns of phrase such as ""the book gets the *job* done."" English seems to have so many idioms related to money-earning.

What language do you speak and what is the relationship to the equivalent of how English uses ""work"" or ""job?"" How common are money/work related idioms and does it reflect the values of the culture? Is there any reading out there someone could point me to on the subject?",False,ijnnua,XBreaksYFocusGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ijnnua/the_usage_of_the_word_work_in_nonenglish_languages/,1,1

your team, and without anxiety, small
problems can easily blow up into big ones.
Consider one recent study in which
participants were led to believe they had
accidentally activate a computer virus
that would wipe out the files on the
experimented‚Äôs computer. When on their
way to averting the computer‚Äôs owner, they
faced four obstacles, including a door
telling visitors to wait and someone asking
them to complete a short survey. Highly
anxious participants tore past these
roadblocks while their laidback peers
lagged behind. ‚ÄúIn situations when danger
is a possibility... anxiety prevails over
positively,‚Äô Kashdan says.

were struggling to even survive, He can only
empathise.

Any residents who came to Of/SSOs probably have
received an email or letter with similar
title/message during this period, and the pain that
follows. Today | sent ‚Äòthat email"" to our team, That
initial feeling is something that cannot be implicated,
and i's a grim reminder of the true meaning of value,

Of course, none of our staff was terminated, but this
surprise (an onceilfetime shock) experience
ensued the team understood how many others were
feeling and will continue to feeling the months to come.
His letter was drafted instead not to trench them
but to assure them that they are valued in our
organisation

‚ÄòTonight, my tear experienced the meaning of value
too. And | am glad this unteachable moment and
reading their candid reply when they got an ‚Äúheart
attack‚Äô by just reading the subject title and the first
paragraph.

Moved-19 has and continue to teach us - and the
‚Äòcurrent generation - the meaning of value, and the
value of meaning,

Hope that this experimental exercise helps us
understand the real world a little bit more, the current
climate, and hopefully continue keep us humble and
grateful for what we have,

| thank the team for staying dedicated to keep our ship
afloat and | am confident they will continue to rough it
‚Äòout when the storm gets worse, and when it gets
better.

It was a worthwhile AED-shock,

92,"I enjoy living life, why do I have to give it up?","These past few months because of COVID-19 have been AMAZING! I was able to take a much needed break after a burnout at the age of 25 and honestly just enjoy myself. I was surrounded by people I love. I got to sleep in all day, take naps, bake, cook, and be at peace. Then I was able to travel to Vegas with friends and have all this fun, I saw the Grand Canyon and my god was it beautiful! 

I believe there‚Äôs so much beauty to life and we have been socialized and conditioned to make it miserable. Sure, life has its ups and down no doubt but, when I stopped running the rat race I was actually able to be happy and enjoy myself.

Now I have to go start a new job that I‚Äôm sure will suck the life out of me. I enjoyed my escape.

102,Just wanted to pop in a say how disgusted I am in grocery companies,"I had been working for a kroger owned grocery store for almost 3 years. Called out inky if i absolutely had to. Was late only a couple times. Had Glowing customer reviews, had regular customers tell me they onky came to my specific store just for ma and even had a customer tell me that if she had anything to give she would put me in her will.  


So at rhe beginning of COVID grocery stores as you all know were hit insanely hard. It was bad news for anyone working in the stores but GREAT new s for the companies bottom line. 

For YEARS, management left weekly sales reports lying around and even showing associates how well or how bad the specific departments, as well as the whole store were doing. 

After seeing all of the money my specfic store was making a week off of covid and how the company was not only cutting our supplies in half on top of the quality to shit levels they also insulted us with $25 in store credit and measly bonuses later on after backlash happened. 

So after being fed up and admittedly being a dumbass I took the latest weekly sales report and took a picture of it and posted the picture on the /r/kroger subreddit with a SCATHING rant on how we were treated. I was fired a week later.  

My store alone made 100% profit compared to the same week a year before. 1.5million dollars in ONE WEEK and they thought a $25 in store credit would suffice.

103,I walked out of work today,"So I‚Äôve been getting harassed by my manager for over a year now. Everyday he constantly is telling me through out my shift how everything I do is stupid and won‚Äôt work out and making up stuff about me that‚Äôs not true. When I‚Äôm not even talking to him he brings me into his other conversations with people. He tries to piss me off and even some customers have picked up on it. Some of my co workers have noticed too and asked me why he is so passive aggressive towards me. 


The reason is because I got involved with him a while back (sooo stupid) and ended it because I realized how toxic it was. He‚Äôs been trying to make my life a living hell ever since. I know that was stupid of me but I also know I don‚Äôt deserve all the harassment I‚Äôm getting at work as backlash and it‚Äôs honestly gotten so bad. 


Well anyways something set me off today and I almost started crying but then I was like ‚Äúwtf why am I crying, fuck this place‚Äù and walked out. It feels SOOO good. 


I‚Äôve been wanting to leave for a long time not just because of him. I can‚Äôt stand anyone there the only people I‚Äôll miss are my regulars (I‚Äôm a server) but I realized that I feel like shit every time I‚Äôm there and it‚Äôs not worth my mental health or my time to be there.

(Eg. someone lost a document I submitted, the paralegal told me to do something that turned out to be invalid, the client gave me an incorrect email address, etc.) 

He talked at me for about ten minutes. He kept interrupting me, being condescending, and dismissive, and I doubt he listened to a word I said. 

When I could finally hang up, I was barely holding it together. I cried at my desk. 

He didn't even let me explain what the mistakes were, or why I did double my usual workload - hint, it's because I was going on vacation the next week, and I was trying to fucking cover for it in advance, because two weeks ago, I still cared about this goddamn job.

I was not given the option to be born, and now I must work for the majority of my life simply to have shit that I should have an automatic right to? (Shelter, food, clothing ETC)
To make matters worse I live in the USA where our work culture is absolutely ridiculous. People here work the longest hours with the least time off and the lowest wages. People are so fucking sick in the head here they actually take pride in the fact that they work 50-80 (yes ive known people who work 80 hours) a week. It makes me cringe. Maybe its because i actually have hobbies and passions and I value free time more than anything. My only hope in life is to turn my passions into something I can make a living from. I've made money through them but nothing close to a living. Thus am still stuck in wage slavery.

109,What is the dumbest reason you've been disciplined at work?,"I need a good laugh today. Here's mine:

Years ago when I was working min wage retail, my boss was cheap as hell and started scheduling only one employee each day to work. But if the store got busy, you had to be available if that employee called you to come in to help. I'm talking 7 days a week, during the entire 12 hours the store was open (10am-10pm) no matter what. It was so inconvenient and made it really difficult to make plans or have a life outside of work. I'm also certain now that it was illegal.

One Sunday night just after 8:30pm, I got a text from the coworker who was working at the store, and I decided not to reply. I knew she was working but by the time I would get ready and arrive at the store, it would be past 9:00 and I'm not going to get ready and drive all the way to work on Sunday night just for an hour of minimum wage.

The next time I went in to work for my shift, I got written up by my boss for not being available when my coworker texted me. I literally said to my boss ""I didn't see her text, I was driving. She couldn't have called me if it was that urgent?"" My boss had no response except asking me to sign my write-up letter.. which I did... ugh. 

Her shitty business ended up failing and closing anyways about a year later, so karma is a bitch.

122,I just walked off the job site to my car that was 2 hours away in 90 degree weather.,"I quit today. I'm a 25 year old guy working in landscaping. We pretty much build your yard from scratch. Sprinklers, fences grass etc. We usually do them for upper to upper middle class homes. I'm serving wealthy people moving into city (Boise) driving up the cost of living and making the area unaffordable. All while I make a measly $14 an hour in sometimes the blistering heat. I'm building this city and contributing to my own future struggles at the same time. How more cucked than that could it get? 

But it gets worse. My supervisor aka the foreman, who's also I'm the field with us, who also has been with the company for 12 years, makes a whopping $18 an hour. That's right. A 42 year old man with a family, has been with the company for 12 years and is being payed 18 bucks an hour. Meanwhile, the owner makes well over six figures. The company is worth almost a million dollars. It's a small company with about 10 workers so everyone knows each other.  My supervisor is 2nd in command under the owner, and is being payed 18 an hour. 

But this is where it gets sad. 

My coworkers who are getting the same rate as I am, will hop jump and skip faster than anything you've ever seen. If the foreman gives an order to dig a hole and you start going towards digging, a few will step in front of you so THEY can be the ones who dug that hole. Going for that shovel leaning against the wall? Nope! Someone literally jogged or power walked (I kid you not) to that shovel before you can get there. I've never seen anything like it. Trying to stop a tree from falling whole the supervisor moves it with a forklift? Better not take your hands off of that tree even if it's stable. You'll see two hands come from nowhere to hold on to that tree that isn't falling. While you'll now just be left standing there looking like a lazy bum while everyone does the work. Some of the guys show up to work with enthusiasm. Even though they know there is only one supervisor position, and that man only makes 4 bucks an hour more than us. It's sad to see everyone competing for nothing. 

Today, one more guy stepped in front of me while I was about to do a task. And another guy was digging my hole when I came back from taking a sip of water. He even gave me attitude and tried to give me orders. I told him to fuck off. And so there was no work for me. So I just sat back and watched for a second. A few moments later I just told the supervisor that I quit. He said he wasn't taking me back to my car (we all ride together in the morning from the office to the job site). So I walked. With no shame. I only worked there for 2.5 weeks. The owner will be disappointed because before he hired me I promised him that I was ""trying to grind"". That won him over. 

The bad news is that I have no job and I only have 2 months of rent saved. 

The good news is that I have an idea. I'll probably become a con artist and bounce from job to job doing the bare minimum until I get fired. If I could do it again, I would have just hid out in the bathroom and came out periodically to look like I'm working. Until they decided to fire me, and then collect unemployment. 

Fuck this system. I deserve to own the fruits of my labor, especially if that labor is manual labor. No one should be getting rich off of my body.

130,Threw my boss under the bus.,"Have been patiently awaiting a contractually stipulated pay increase since March.  Given COVID, I have been tolerant of the delay. 

Brought it up with boss 8 weeks ago.

Nothing happens.

I bring it up again 4 weeks ago. Say I really want it dealt with prior to next paycheck. 

Yep - I‚Äôm on it, she says. Working with HR. Ever so sorry.

Nothing happens a second time. By the time my next pay rolls around (paid monthly) it will have been a full 6 months without my due compensation.

Email her and HR director saying how disgustingly unacceptable this situation is and include the whole email chain.

She wasn‚Äôt working with HR.  And was forced to admit as much. 

Punctuated my statement by calling in sick yesterday and again today. Will further punctuate by withholding my expertise and generally slacking off and doing the absolute bare minimum for the next...forever.

It has been made clear that I am not their priority, so I will make clear that they are not mine, either.

The office politics are out of control, my bosses are pieces of human garbage that think because they have a couple of letters after their name it makes them superior to anyone and everyone.

Since the quarantine has been lifted here in Canada I've been sent back to work for the past few months. I have to come into the office while everyone else gets to stay home, working from home. Myself and the four other people in my department are forced, not volunteered or anything, but forced to come in. I asked my union if I had any reasonable right to refuse work in what I feel are unsafe working conditions, and they said considering there is a pandemic everything is unsafe working conditions and you'll have to come in if you've been ordered to by your boss.

We have weekly meetings with the other departments of our library. I get to be in the building sitting at a desk while everyone else is all comfy at home in their pajamas and shit.
I've asked my boss if I could have some work from home duties to which I was denied, saying that I wouldn't want it anyway because the people who are working from home are working more than 8 hour days, which is complete and absolute bullshit. I talk to my co-workers, I know exactly how much they aren't working.¬†

I personally know a few sex workers as well as clients of sex workers. I‚Äôm not talking about prostitutes or strippers like you see in movies: think more along the line of sugar babies, OnlyFans, webcam models, etc.. 

From what I gathered, they work flexible hours (most of the work is actually advertising i.e. running social media accounts), and usually earns considerably more than a livable wage. As long as you are careful about protecting your identity, the occupational hazard is not as high as one might think. With photoshop and face/body filter (yay technology), even physical attractiveness has stopped being a hard requirement. Stigma, it seems, is one of the biggest obstacles to entering the industry. 

Granted, being a sex worker is still work; however, it is certainly a less time consuming one at that if nothing else. Whatever online platform you work on will get a cut, but in many senses, you are basically a freelancer and can afford a high level of autonomy. 

I got a degree and work in a highly technical, highly stressful field.

Once you close a ticket, another literally shoots up in front of your face and starts counting again.  

My mentor, who is a nice enough dude says:  ""I normally don't take my 15 minute breaks because we are so busy."" and ""I'm probably not going to take lunch today because we're really behind.""  

I can't do that.  I can't ""simp"" for companies anymore.  I did that for the last 10ish years and all I got was mass-laid off (multiple times) when the going got tough despite me putting in countless free hours, abused, hurt burnt out, PTSD, anxiety disorders, gained a huge weight.  Companies have just been driving the salaries down-and-down-and-down while all my expenses go up-and-up-and-up.  I'm making less than half of what I was 10 years ago.  

I don't think I'm entitled.  I worked my ass off in school.  I got the ""world class"" degree they told me to get.  Now there's nothing to do with it.  I am so frustrated and things have just felt like they've hit a dead end and I'm too exhausted.

178,I sometimes feel guilty and untalented about not wanting to turn my passions into full time jobs,"The title says it all. I always viewed creativity/passion as a sweet escape from the boring everyday life I am forced to live, working 11 hours a day (or less occasionally, thankfully) thanks to school, math, science and physics tutors and homework. I was forced to do a thing I hated or at least did not like that much for most of my day, and then came home, finished the rest of it and did what I wanted. I don't want any advice in this thread, I just want to hear someone elses experiences because I am feeling depressed, numb, and hopeless. Filled with despair. I have severe mental health issues caused by bullying, shunning, school and extreme homework hours. It's been like that for three years but things were so much better before 2020 started, to a point where my problems were somewhat managable and limited. 

Anyway, so I like creating, but how on earth am I still expected to enjoy doing it for 8 hours a day every day? How on earth am I supposed to not get sick of it? Why do people think that the things we adore can always be fullfilling full time careers for us? (I would not mind a part time career related to the things I love. I want to be a part time author, for example).

Sometimes I feel like a hypocrite for not wanting to do the things I enjoy full time. They are the loves of my life, what on earth would I do without them? But the idea of doing them for 8 hours a day makes me feel sick in the stomach. And I often work on projects for more than three hours, because I genuinely enjoy it but why does any sane person do the thing they love for 40+ hours a week? Do they just deal with it because the idea of working a normal job and having less time for their passion scares them? 

Sometimes I feel like my art is less important, like my talent is nonexistent and like I shouldn't even bother to create to begin with if I am not gonna turn this to a full time job. Like I am worthless compared to those who do it for 8 hours a day. But isn't it more mentally healthy to do what you  like for a limited amount of hours a day instead of esentially having your life revolve around it? If I want to create something, I don't even need a boss to help me with it, I can film a whole choreography without even leaving my bedroom, thats what the internet is for. 

I have a cartoonist/animator friend who has similar feelings towards his work. He says he just wants to become a doctor and that he will hate his passion if he starts getting money for it. A painter friend of mine started selling her work, or doing orders for clients and she started hating her art. Now she also has a condition in her wrists that prevents her from painting. 

Why on the fucking planet is doing something, even something you love for so long (many artists, such us ballerinas work for more than 8 hours...) considered normal and healthy? I know a pro dancer whose feet bruised occasionally bc of too much practice, that imo is not neccecary for a good quality play, and even if it did impove the quality, humans above ideas. Mental health above all. Everything in moderation. 

If I watched TV or read books for 8 hours a day I would be called addicted, or mentally unstable and rightfully so, how is this any different for work or even art? 

''Find a job you'll love'' is not the solution for everyone. Is anyone else sickened by the idea of doing their passion for 8 hours a day? Of their whole life revolvin around it I would love to be serious about it, and I am 100% gonna go semi-pro some day, and I won't give up or even retire until the day of my death, but 8 hours is too much even for me.",False,ijwnzc,dearlybeloved998,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ijwnzc/i_sometimes_feel_guilty_and_untalented_about_not/,6,1

182,Day in the life of a factory worker,"You wake up, that incessant beeping of your alarm ringing in your ears, you groan, and hit the snooze button a few times. You finally manage to will yourself out of bed, it's still dark outside. You get up and hastily eat breakfast, get your shoes on, run out the door and miserably wipe the snow off your car in the dark. You drive to work, and when you get there the depressing atmosphere is impossible to ignore. At this point, it's still dark as night out and the moon shines above you, how can anyone be expected to be up this fucking early. As usual you see a group of miserable looking fellow workers like yourself, sitting outside the factory smoking cigarettes, etc, including Larry, who has been here for 20 years and looks to have barely an ounce of life left in him, his hopes and dreams long gone. You look at your watch: ""Fuck"" It's time to clock in. 

You walk in and hear the same machinery noise you hear everyday once again, bursting into your ears. The sounds that haunt your dreams. You walk into that same disgusting bathroom/change room and put on your work shoes/safety equipment, You get back on the floor, and realize you have another 8+ hours of hell ahead of you, standing in the same spot all day, getting pain and cramps from doing the same repetitive motions all the time. The clock is right there for you to see, you can't ignore it, you try as hard as you can to not look at it but you swear it's trying to taunt you, you swear the hands just moved backwards. 

Your supervisor tells you what to do, and you begrudgingly comply. You get to your station and away you go once more, the machines are so fast, you have to keep up or else you will fall behind. You are not able to even go to the bathroom, you are planted to the floor, unless the boss says you aren't, you could ask him to use the bathroom, but such basic things as leaving for 5 minutes to relieve bodily functions are frowned upon here. After an eternity, you go for lunch, hastily scarfing down a ham sandwich and a bag of pretzel twists, before going back to the grind. You get back, has the clock moved backwards again? Eventually, you get home, but all you can do is collapse on the couch, you're too tired that passion project of yours you have sworn to yourself you would get around to someday. Your only option is to try to relax and try to cope with your day by eating junk food and watching Netflix, before you know it, it's time for bed, and you realize that when you wake up, it will happen all over again.

183,New U.S Min wage laws raises min Salary for all states is $684 a week. Info on this and my movement in post.,"New laws activated this January 1,2020 raising the minimum Salary an employee can be paid. It's a drastic  raise to $684 a week. If you are not being paid at least this amount a week for a Salary position you are a victim of wage theft or employer ignorance. 

Also there is a HUGE number of ""Managers"" or workers misclassified as Salary to get around paying hourly. There are specific stipulations as well to be Salary such as you must oversee at least 2 employees, no duties considered blue collar like laundry,cleaning,checking people in. A huge number of Salary workers across America are doing work over 40 hrs that should be paid 1.5 times. You can file a wage complaint with U.S. Wage&amp;Hour division and get all those wages for the last 3 years. 

Lastly many states are now raising Salary minimums yearly. I am looking to help some people with my experience with this issues and perhaps even start a labor union because of my experience with workers comp claims,unemployment and Labor laws. If anyone would be interested in joining a group of workers that are looking to grow to a number large enough we can win employees more benefits and defend the ones being infringed on please DM me or even if you need help I can.

187,Boss Caused Me To Lose A Semester Of College Credits On My Final Semester,"Just saw a post about a boss trying to make someone work on their graduation and thought I would share my story.

When I started at my job 6 years ago I was attending college and at the end of my final semester. I was working part time for garbage money and had been looking for a while for a better paying job that used my skills more. Through someone I knew I had gotten the opportunity (you will have to forgive my antiwork trigger words lol) to be considered for a decent paying and pretty good job doing work that I wanted to do. I knew the timing of my semester and the job might conflict but I assumed they would be okay with me finishing my school. During the interview I even brought it up and the manager who was above the boss said ""of course, we actually are committed to improving our employees education."" So, things were looking good, I could have the job and finish my degree. A few weeks passed and they called me to let me know that I had been selected. I found out the time they wanted me to start and asked about have Tuesday/Thursday off for 3 weeks in order to finish my semester. 3 weeks. I was 3 weeks from finishing my degree. The supervisor (my direct boss) said this wouldn't be possible. I explained that I was about to finish my degree and even brought up that they had said they would let me finish my education. He said that he would go to the next candidate if I didn't work the days.

I was younger and less experienced then, I saw the job as a great opportunity and the memes of not being able to get a job with my degree were going through my head, so I didn't finish my degree and went to the job. This worked out for me in the end, I eventually finished my degree (took years) and I cut throats until I became the supervisor at my job but I really learned the hard lesson of how little ""they"" actually care when it comes down to it and thought I would pass it on.",False,ifsl6p,AdequateAmoeba,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ifsl6p/boss_caused_me_to_lose_a_semester_of_college/,4,1

207,Financially Punished at Work for Being Unable to Drive In Hurricane Laura,"As many people know, today Louisiana is experiencing an enormous category 4 hurricane and all of the wind and heavy storms that come with it. I live in New Orleans so while we may not be on the direct path, today was the day the hurricane tail was projected to be over us. The owners of the coffee shop I worked at closed down last night when they thought the storm would come and when it didn‚Äôt come then opened up the shop all day today. It‚Äôs important to mention that these owners all live an hour outside of the city AND that the other coffee shop they manage a block away was closed all day. At 7:00 am we were texted and told that we would be open all day. At 7:02 am we were texted and told that we would reassess at every shift if we would be open or not. At 7:03 am we were told to disregard that and that we would be open as scheduled. Immediately when I woke up around 8:00 am I sent my manager a series of text stating that I was worried about my cars ability to get to work today, along with a screen recording of the weather radar, the city mandated flood and tornado warnings for my shift time, and time tracked the entire storm for them. I pointed out that at the time of my shift (12:30-4:00) the storm was projected to be the worst and explained that I did not feel comfortable coming into work in such conditions with my shitty car!! I was told that if I didn‚Äôt want to show up that it was my responsibility get my shift covered and that they would not be reassessing the weather. At 11:45 the storms around my house worsened and the wind was blowing things everywhere! I texted my manager again expressing that I did not think my car could make it to work or that I would be safe in out coffee shop which is an ALL GLASS BUILDING in an area that floods. I was.. ignored. I texted again and asked what penalty I would face for not being able to come to work in these conditions. I was told that if I missed my 4 hour shift in the middle of a hurricane that I would be taken off the schedule for the next week. Yep. 1/4 of my monthly income has been taken away because I could not and would not drive in a hurricane. After expressing to my manager how I felt that that was unfair, she sent a text message in the company group chat about how ‚ÄúSorry to be that guy but you have to get your shifts covered that is not my responsibility and I will take away your next week‚Äôs shifts if you don‚Äôt show up. Sorry it is raining but the owners said to open today so there is no excuse.‚Äù Instead of just texting me and the ONE OTHER employee who were scheduled for the day. This is followed up with my OTHER manager sub posting about me on the company slack about how ‚ÄúIf you are a no call no show we will take away your shifts.‚Äù..... I responded to this obvious sub post by an adult woman and stated simply that I do not believe that I am a no call no show since I have been calling them and updating them on my situation since EIGHT AM!! To top all of it off my manger sent me a sassy text to end it all where she tried to guilt me by saying that the other employees who worked there were all made at me... the employees I had just got off the phone shit talking about them with for an hour... Anyway just started putting in applications elsewhere and believe me, this was only the breaking point these situations are ALL. THE. TIME.

215,First ever real internship - Talking about work during breaks,"So, I (23) have never really had a typical job before. I've worked as a tutor at my university and have done some small stuff, but I'm currently at the end of my 4th week in an internship where I work in an office type of setting for the first time. 

Gotta tell ya, I ain't loving it. It's not even necessarily ""what"" the job is, it's more that I don't care for working in an office like that for the rest of my life. I like to actually...you know, be active and do things. I'm now more glad than ever that I'm being financially supported by my mother and that my family is well off enough for me to never have to worry too much about finances. I'm incredibly grateful for that fact. I majored in history btw and will be starting my master studies this coming semester. The internship only has some things to do with history, though. A lot of it is just annoying tasks, especially filling out excel documents...

Anyways, I've noticed some interesting things. One thing I've noticed is that even when I go out with my colleagues for lunch, they still talk about work. Now, to a certain point I get it. It's (sadly) a large part of your life, so talking about it is only natural...BUT CHRIST! It's so frustrating to hear them not talk about any passions or creative outlets, but whom they had to call to organize XY and Z.

218,I'm starting to realize I have a bad relationship with work and education in general.,"I've never had a job that I particularly enjoyed, and ive had several jobs since I started working when I was 16 (24 now). My first job was fast food and I actually didn't mind it at all. I did really well and got along with most of my co-workers, but that was always going to be a beginners job at minimum wage. I graduated with an associate in chemistry and took a lab tech job, which turned out horrifically traumatic (didn't like the job, was assaulted by a co-worker and was eventually fired for failing a drug test-weed). after that I was really naive and got sucked into an MLM, lost a ton of money and of course was treated poorly. I was also treated very poorly at the restaurant and retail jobs that I worked at just to get by. Fast forward to now, I've been at another lab tech job for 3.5 years and I've hated every minute of it. This has absolutely been, by far the worst job and I can't get out because they paid me enough to stay afloat. And, I don't have many other skills- I refuse to go to another lab, I don't even want anything STEM related anymore. I tried to go back to school for a BS, but financially I couldn't do it anymore. I don't see the value in a degree anymore anyway. There's no degree that speaks to me at all. The only thing I really love to do is baking and art. I also got a TEFL certification but couldn't get hired at PalFish so I became disheartened about that field. In a dream world, I wouldn't have a boss and I'd be free to create all day long and would somehow be paid for that. At this point I'm so reluctant to do anything that isn't THAT. Or at least something that pays alright and isn't a toxic environent. And that's pretty unrealistic. I do make some money selling my stuff on Facebook and Etsy, but at this point it's not stable enough to live off of. My current lab tech job has reduced me to part time due to budget cuts and now I'm broke AND miserable at this job. I was recently diagnosed with depression, anxiety and PTSD and all my psychiatrist wants to do is shove medications at me. I don't want medication. I want to solve my problem, and that is my job situation. My boyfriend is a chef and has been helping me try and find at least a bakery job, but nobody's hiring around us. I'm just so tired of having to endure years of abuse just to pay my bills. And, God forbid, spend a little money on myself, or even better, start a savings. Just venting today, but if anyone has some advice... I wouldn't mind.

252,Comparing work life in different countries,"I can only speak for the countries I know through online friends who share their stories in similar lines of work as mine (plumbing)

So in the UK for example, the pay is shit. I mean ridiculously shit. Welfare is decent and helps you make rent and food and healthcare is free, but you have very very little spending money after the necessities because costs are so high compared to pay. You can work hard your whole life and you'll just be doing ""okay."" The UK tends to respect the 5-day workweek like most of the world does.

Then you've got the middle eastern countries where the weekend is only 1 day. THey all have 6-day workweeks. Sundays are counted as a workday. It's always been like that there. And probably will be for the forseeable future. It was and still sort of is informal but is very quickly becoming super formal.

Then there's China. In China most people do not experience weekends. Christianity never took a stronghold and The concept of a god dictating rest on any particular day is a foreign concept. I've spoken to guys who have been working 7 days a week going on months and months.. this is why China is doing so well economically and taking over the world.

I think at the end of the day, China will force the rest of the world to shift to 7 day workweeks. As religion declines, even the supporters of sundays as a rest day will be gone. The human nature of greed does not spare leaders, and they are very quickly consolidating their citizens into more competitive slaves to stay ahead of the next one... endless competition to keep the next guy from invading and pillaging... we're stuck in a loop of quiet economic world wars going on, but it's not soldiers dying in these fields... it's the poor sadass workers who are worked to death and live existences of pain and dread.",False,ifzkab,ElegantDecline,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ifzkab/comparing_work_life_in_different_countries/,1,1
253,"""Is there a difference between capitalism and commerce?"" - Quora","Commerce is the name given to the process of trade - buying an selling goods. Capitalism is a social system reliant on the extraction of surplus value from another‚Äôs labour to create profit. Capitalism relies on the theory of surplus value as below.

[Surplus value - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_value)

*‚ÄúA worker who is sufficiently productive can produce an output value greater than what it costs to hire him. Although his wage seems to be based on hours worked, in an economic sense this wage does not reflect the full value of what the worker produces. Effectively it is not labour which the worker sells, but his capacity to work.*

*Imagine a worker who is hired for an hour and paid $10. Once in the capitalist's employ, the capitalist can have him operate a boot-making machine with which the worker produces $10 worth of work every fifteen minutes. Every hour, the capitalist receives $40 worth of work and only pays the worker $10, capturing the remaining $30 as gross revenue. Once the capitalist has deducted fixed and variable operating costs of (say) $20 (leather, depreciation of the machine, etc.), he is left with $10. Thus, for an outlay of capital of $30, the capitalist obtains a surplus value of $10; his capital has not only been replaced by the operation, but also has increased by $10.*

*The worker cannot capture this benefit directly because he has no claim to the means of production (e.g. the boot-making machine) or to its products, and his capacity to bargain over wages is restricted by laws and the supply/demand for wage labour.‚Äù*

I had to initiate that as she followed me out of the building. Today my interview was for 12:30pm, and guess what? They're 20 minutes late. What would happen if I showed up 20 minutes late for an in-person interview with them? I think chances are I wouldn't be hired. I might not even be seen at that point. The hippocrasy is astounding.

258,Drugs to Cope - It‚Äôs All So Wrong,"Well, here I am, Monday morning fresh off my two week vacation (where I spent a lot of time thinking how temporary those ‚Äúfree days‚Äù are because the rest are stolen from me.) That‚Äôs ok. That‚Äôs ‚Äúlife‚Äù right? Wrong. 

It really made me sick to see JUST how fast Sunday was there and gone since Friday night when I had the past two weeks off. Friday night ‚Äúyay.‚Äù Saturday..‚Äùthis is nice, work is looming.‚Äù Sunday ‚ÄúTomorrow is the start of the next 5 days of jail.‚Äù Laundry, grocery shopping, trying to prepare and of course bedtime at 9:30 so I don‚Äôt feel like a tired ball of unfocused shit at work. Guess what though? The first Ativan I took to push me back in to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sleep schedule after vacation didn‚Äôt work. Needed a second at midnight. Maybe worked by 1..maybe? Alarm off at 5:45. Now I‚Äôm a groggy mess at this ungodly hour. Few sips of coffee and off to make my lunch, get ready for work, drive there, spend 8.5 hours there under great stress, come home, make dinner, do dishes, watch TV on the couch for a couple hours because that‚Äôs all I feel like doing. Bedtime. Lather rinse and repeat.

This is all SO WRONG and yet so many of us don‚Äôt have a way out of this hell. I‚Äôm going to have to medicate some more with the anti depressant/anxiety pills just to be compliant.

I understand the need for society to work to function...but we shouldn‚Äôt be wage slaves. It‚Äôs 2020. Everyone should be paid 5x more to work half the amount we do. This was the first time I was truly depressed on vacation. It shouldn‚Äôt be this way.",False,ifnyvk,Banana8686,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ifnyvk/drugs_to_cope_its_all_so_wrong/,11,1

She was also like ‚Äúoh yeah, make sure to get some people‚Äôs number for next time you call out because it‚Äôs your responsibility to cover your shift‚Äù. LMFAO, I just said ‚Äúokay‚Äù. And walked off. 

Not to mention I was piping hot pissed my entire shift today. There was no online schedule, so I looked at the paper when I got there and I was scheduled. I even started tearing up.

Problem is I have almost 4,000$ in a dollar bank. We get 2$ hr in a dollar bank to pay for medical expenses that Ins doesn‚Äôt cover. I need 3 teeth implants. 2 immediate because it hurts the shit out of my gums to chew certain things. 
The money won‚Äôt roll over because the new jobs are non union and even if I took a union management position I would lose it anyway.
Grant it I don‚Äôt want to work period!!!! But since I am forced to I want to make the best of it. Just really makes me mad as f*** that I‚Äôm being penalized because I want a new job and to move up and get out of my tools.
Iv used my 1,000$ for the year that my dental will cover so for some reason they won‚Äôt pay the half for my implants even though it‚Äôs 9,000$ for the implants so they would be paying 4,500$. So if they are gonna pay pay the half regardless of my 1,000$ a year wtf is the problem paying it now?!

I just have no interest for any of it, I'm here to do my hours then collect paycheck. Having to pretend makes it even worst : I do my job, I do it well, I get paid. Why do I need to also give the emotional labor of feigning interest for all this stuff ? 

Company growth ? Doesn't benefit me, don't care. Profits, sales or whatever ? Not going in my pocket, don't care. If at least it was beneficial to society and even if not to me I would be more interested in it. Is it tho ? No.

This BOREDOM, I can't. I just can't bring myself to care about any of it.  None of this is benefiting me. I'm wasting my life here. None of this is benefiting society either : who cares that y'all hit your sales target ? What's good about making people buy shit they don't need ?

I thought company growth means I could get a better position ( lol ), that hitting sale targets meant I could get a bonus ( lMFAO).

It's election time again in my country and I have been looking at which party I would vote for but upon going down the rabbit hole of our politics I've realized that we are all fucked no matter what. A major point of all parties involved is job creation which is code for ""we will sell out to the BPO sector."" Just the thought that every single person between the ages of 18-30 (maybe) will only have this option. It's a small country and there are very few options for employment you either sell out to the financiers, suffer in the service/tourism sector, go BPO (get paid $2.50USD/hr) or get a job that has no benefits whatsoever. 

There is no hope for UBI or even reform to ensure that all employers provide some time of benefits.

329,Quit my Job Today (USA),"I've been working as a Census Field Supervisor since February. We basically supervise the people that knock on your door if you don't return the census. My operation dealt with people living in RVs, campsites, hotels/motels, etc. I had some reservations about working a government job in the first place, but the pay was good and... that's just it, the pay was good (for my area at least).

I had to train my team on Monday, and was essentially thrown to the lions. I had little to no training, no direction, no checklist or itinerary. I was basically told to figure it out myself, while standing up in a room with 5 people looking to me for the answers. 

My supervisor cares about the workers and is about fed up herself. But this shows me that management can care all they want to, but the system is set up for maximizing output, which in this case is census responses. If the system puts an emphasis in the ""customer"" for a higher return, and less on the worker getting those returns, a nice manager is going to do nothing for me.

It doesn't even need mentioning the safety risks that come with having to talk to 50+ people a day that don't wear masks. 

Here's the real trick: the lowest workers, the one's the entire operation depends on, don't get any sort of benefits because we are only working for 8 weeks at a time. If we are in a car accident, we rely on our auto and health insurance and get absolutely nothing from the government to help, aside from being able to file a worker's comp claim.

I work at Amazon, bad pay, bad conditions. 
Here is a list of things you can do to f*ck Amazon and getting something for yourself.

1.all mattresses that are opened cannot be returned due to covid buy a mattress and call saying yiu wnst to return it but it's open and you cannot package it.

2.all items such as refrigerators, washing machines, air Conditioning units, generstors, coolers, just buy it and say it's defective and you want to return it but the anti freezer liquid is leaking,  they can't take it back.

3.buy anything and say it never arrived, even if we have. A picture  they have to believe you unless you are dumb enough to s√≠ it too often. 

4.call saying your item is damaged and ask for a discount  they will give it to you cause it's cheaper than returning it.

337,RANT - I really hate the people at r/massage and I hate most massage therapists!!,"I'm so sick of the massage industry. In my state, California, continuing education is NOT required to renew the massage certificate. most clients like 99.9% of the time don't give a flying shit about anything other than swedish and deep-tissue which I am pretty proficient at. I have been licensed and certified for about 6 years now. I used to have tons of passion for massage when I was in massage school and also the first year I was licensed but getting a hand injury really put a damper in it. I'm not qualified to do anything else and I would rather kill myself than work in retail or restaurants again. I went to massage school first and foremost to get me the fuck out of retail and foodservice jobs. I also went to massage school because I wanted to move out of my parents house. Lord forbid somebody goes into a job because they need more money. a lot of massage therapist think that people should not get into the industry unless they are super passionate about massage. I can't fucking stand that. I don't relate with any other massage therapist except for maybe one who is this really chill cool ass girl who I have been friends with for a few years. She admits she hates massage and she hates the industry and so she went back to school for esthetician and laser hair removal. She likes that much more than massage. But anyway.

So I go in the massage Reddit and I asked if people can give me recommendations for the cheapest medical massage continuing education course so that I can practice massage legally in my state with the covid-19 regulations. Massage is not deemed as an essential service, which honestly it is not an essential service, there's people who go their whole lives without a massage, it is not essential I will admit that. But the state does recognize medical massage as essential. 

One person actually gave a good recommendation and all the other losers told me that I shouldn't choose the cheapest continuing education class because I ""touch people for a living""  and I should put more care into my education. I don't really give a fuck dude. I give a damn good massage but once they are off of my table I don't really care about them anymore. 90% of the clients in this industry will never ever rebook. Most of the clients you will only see once literally. 

But anyway that's just one situation. most of the spas that I have worked at consisted of other massage therapists who were extremely pompous and thought they were God's gift to The healing arts. They all think that they are way smarter than they are even though 99% of them are completely science and math illiterate. They're obsessed with talking about toxins being released even though there has been absolutely no scientific research on fucking toxins being released from muscles after a massage. I mean I'm huge into New age stuff and I'm extremely spiritual but I know that a lot of things in The healing arts are really just a bunch of fucking quackery and Hocus pocus. 

I really just can't stand all these motherfuckers. I went to massage school so that I could do massage in the meantime of going back to school to get a biochemistry degree so that I can have a real job and a real career making real money. because of the stupid economy this massage career is lasting a little longer than I would have wanted it to. It has taken me a really long time to get going back to Junior college. 

The frankly I used to have a lot of passion for a massage but I haven't for a long time and I shouldn't be judged or penalized for that. Sorry but I do massage for the fucking money. I've been doing this long enough to know how the clients are and the fact that a lot of male clients are just fucking perverts and that you really can't make a lot of money doing massage. It's also too easy to get injured.",False,ihv2x6,Biwhendrunk,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ihv2x6/rant_i_really_hate_the_people_at_rmassage_and_i/,10,1

339,My Manager stopped caring about safety.,"I am a cashier at Goodwill. Over the last few months we have had a hardline policy on masks and people without masks. Whenever we've had people without masks we've kicked them out unless they said they specifically had a medical condition. In the case of them having a medical condition we have offered them a face shield which has no effect on breathing ability because as a team we have decided that regardless of what corporate wants, we will prioritize the safety of our customers and workers over people's convenience. We do not listen to conspiracies or bullshit lying by right wing assholes. Well today we have had two occasions where someone has come in without a mask, refused to wear a face shield, and actively walked within 6 feet of people. First was a man who was kicked out one month ago for this exact issue. He had previously said he had no medical issue, didn't feel like wearing a mask, and went on an insane rant about how we were all sheep. Now he walks freely and is not kicked out cause he suddenly has a medical issue. He purposefully walked by fellow coworkers and customers after being told he needed to stay six feet away and was never punished despite my manager being told by me and other coworkers that he was violating our policy. He also had a ridiculous unibrow but that is beside the point. Next was a man I personally had the displeasure of having to deal with. I walked up to him once I noticed him and asked him if he had a mask. He said no and I told him it was required. He said he didn't care. I offered a face shield just to get him covered and he said no. I went to management and they came out. They told him he needed a mask and he said no. My manager asked me to open my till to ring him up since he was already at the registers. I opened up and when he came up he said he didn't have a medical condition and didn't stay behind the plastic barrier. I got mad. Threw up my closed sign and said I would not ring him up. He then said ""really you need to watch less tv!"" At me and I told him I did not care I would not help him. Then my manager began ringing him up told him he could not come in again without a mask all while ringing him up. He then said he would keep coming back without a mask because he didn't wear one anywhere. He then said we were rude and walked out. This sets a dangerous standard. Other people will learn by watching that if they don't want to wear a mask they don't have to. Because our management is to afraid to piss someone off. Too afraid to miss out on seven dollars.

341,I'm so curious about this sub and the opinions of those here.,"Hi r/antiwork, I'll introduce myself. I am u/diamond_rake and have been lurking this sub for a little while. I've got a few questions to ask about your mindset. When I say ""your mindset"" I mean the users of the sub and not r/antiwork as a whole (I can and did read the sidebar). I hope a post like this is allowed. If not, take 'er down.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll just list some questions and if I could get your opinion on some/all/none of them, I'd genuinely love that.

Do you work/have a job currently? Do you like that job? Do you think you are treated fairly at your job? 

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing you had no necessities (eating, sleeping, etc) to provide for, what would you change about your current lifestyle?

&amp;#x200B;

How would providing for necessities work without work?

&amp;#x200B;

What is important to you jobwise/goalwise?

&amp;#x200B;

What is your ideal society?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start so maybe this sparks conversation. Wish we just had a big convention center to just chat in. Aaanyway, I have a job and I like my job. I work at a large chain auto parts store at the counter. I do like my job. The people I interact with a generally good people looking to save a buck over taking their car to the shop. I believe that, for the skill requirement for my position, I am treated fairly. I'm not asked to do much outside of my job description and get along with my co-workers. However, it is fair pay if I only did what was required of the job (be a robot that sells auto parts). I put quite a bit into the job compared to how I am compensated. This isn't because I am expected to, but because I want to and I'll get back to that in a minute.

&amp;#x200B;

I was raised pretty traditionally. I feel extremely lucky to be in the situation I am/was. My parents are still together and were great parents. I wasn't spoiled as a kid but never had to worry if I was going to eat that night. I'm currently married and at university and loving learning. So, you can say I followed a pretty traditional path.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where I come into what spurred me to make this post. I place high value on hard work. I hate the feeling of not having anything to do in a day. How do you deal with the feeling of a day gone by without having done anything? Do you have sad feelings or is that just not a thing with you? There are some days where I have nothing scheduled and I get chomping at the bit for anything. I always look forward to my days off... until its the actual day and I have nothing to do. Just play video games until my wife gets home then watch a few episodes of Avatar until my eyes are on fire. I try scheduling things for my days off to put in place of my time off from my job. I'll find more maintenance to do on my cars/bike, I'll clean out whole apartment, I'll crave that sense of fulfillment from doing work until I get it that day. I pretty much dislike vacations unless I can find some way to satisfy that feeling. Do you have that feeling of accomplishment with work, even if that work is a job? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am pretty individualistic so your business isn't my business unless you share it with me. I see a lot of posts saying someone would rather die than work which is interesting and raises the question of what is stopping you from ""living"" that dream? Wondering what stops people from becoming vandwellers. Is it fear of the unknown? Responsibilities toward others? Do you enjoy the things brought to you by work such as technology, or homes, or cars? Or would you prefer to be like a nomad just scavenging enough to survive and exploring around?

&amp;#x200B;

My ideal society is one where everyone has common morals. Everyone is there to help each other, not by force or because it's the law, but just because they choose to. I support a free market but I wish people weren't greedy. I wish those who had extra would choose to give to those who don't have enough. However, obviously this is the real world and people are what they are.

345,Here's my rant/vent: Fuck all the middle managers,"As you can probably guess, I just had a run in with my middle manager and I'm fuming. I've been in this job for a year, and one small mistake in copy pasting some bullshit in excel means he can question the work I have been doing for weeks in front of my colleagues, trying to embarrass me. 

Newsflash asshole - I don't care about this job, I'm literally only here for my paycheck at the end of the month. Yeah, I'll make the occasional mistake when I'm on my 1000th meaningless excel sheet of the month. I'm half asleep here every day. I don't want this job and I don't give a fuck about my results. 

I started my career in a corporate office two years ago. I'm on my second job in those two years and my second asshole middle manager.  Does it ever fucking end?  I left my first job because I hated the work and hated my manager, then I got a new job and the work is just as bad and the manager is nothing more than a slightly different flavour of asshole. 

I hate how the power structure of a corporate office makes these wretches into little dictators. They have nominal power over a handful of wage slaves and it gives them licence to treat them in whatever way they please. Total disrespect, zero compassion, constantly demanding work and giving no praise or reward. 

The funny thing is that I would have no respect for this guy if I met him on the street. He is an short, obese 45 year old. If I met him in a bar I would think we was a creep and yet at work I have to scurry around and jump at his every command like a dog. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck this bullshit. I don't care about the job, or the work, or the project. If I had literally any other means to sustain myself and make money then I would do that.

351,i finally quit (but i'm so upset),"so i (20f) have been working at this coffee shop diner for almost a year and a half. its a pretty busy spot and there's usually only 4 employees working at a time, so it can get pretty intense. 

now i *love* this job. i've been working since i was 13 and this was my favorite. its crazy and awful and chaotic and insane but i love it so much. i have my regulars and my chores and routines, and i get all the coffee i want. 

the owner is the worst though. she's super intense and just straight up mean. she makes it an effort to scare away the 'weaklings', so she's super mean to the new employees. it was really bad when i started, the others said they thought i'd be gone for sure. 

i stuck it out, ended up being one of the only fulltime worker for 6 months and became the 2nd employee to be cross-trained. then covid happened and i helped run the show  with the owner and manager (and one other employee) for the entirity of our shut-down (2.5months). i went on unemployment for only 2-3 weeks and was one of the first employees to return. 

the owner and i had been on better terms before covid. when we were only doing curbside she started getting aggressy with me again- asking me if i even wanted to be there, telling me i was doing everything wrong, telling me that the water leaking from the faucet (that she neglected to get fixed) was my 'raise going down the drain' (have never recieved a raise to this day), etc. things calmed down again when we reopened for dine-in and some of the other employees came back as the manager noticed and made the schedule so the owner and i would never have to see each other. 

today she calls me and starts bitching about last nights close. i didn't even close last night, for the record, the last day i closed was sunday and i was training someone in so i was supposed to let her do most of it. she says 'i thought we were done with this, its really not that hard, you have 3 days your scheduled next week and i don't wanna be babysitting when [manager] leaves in a couple months, its not fair to the rest of the employees blah blah blah'. 

i messaged the manager right after hanging up and told her i was done. i'll finish out my 2 weeks but if the owner says one more thing to me i'm out. i'm going to fill out applications today. i deserve better, which is saying a lot because i am a huge fucking doormat. 

i'm just so annoyed. and everyone's like 'its a really hard job, you did your best' in that condescending way. the job isn't that hard, i mean i've been working 3 positions simultaneously this week and its hard but its not impossible and i love it. i just hate that everyone assumes i 'couldn't handle it', like its not that fucking hard the owner is just a massive cunt. 

anyways, i'm going to be reporting the owner. she never pays on time, tries to skimp out on paychecks, and verbally assaults her employees (all while running off to her timeshare in the bahamas every 2 months meanwhile i can't pay my rent because she doesn't feel like filling out our paychecks, and even when she does i usually have to get it corrected because she somehow missed the entire back side of my timecard). plus there's probably a whole bunch of technically illegal shit going on in there, let alone things that could get her business license revoked. i'm usually not one for vengeance but this woman is a fucking monster and i'm sure she's gonna be dragging my name through the dirt for a while so might as well.",False,ighxvf,WearyConversation0,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ighxvf/i_finally_quit_but_im_so_upset/,14,1

However, reading your posts and talking to people it is apparent that if I go into the ""real"" world I will be just as un happy as I am here. Unlike many who join the service I joined after a few years of work in the service industry. And already understand that companies will work us as slaves. In the Marines it is common to work from 6-5 at least and have every understanding that at anytime you are on call. ( one of my junior marines does something stupid? Yes ill be there in 10 even though its 3 am on a sunday).
So going into a job in which I only work 9-5 seems like a step up. However this is not what I want.

364,You guys won‚Äôt believe the meeting I just had with my managers.,"So to preface, I work in a high paced field. I can do the job. I just frankly don‚Äôt give a fuck. But It‚Äôs a stressful and anxiety inducing job. My middle managers in our office are decent. They‚Äôre approachable but still bootlickers. Decent about time off too but still.


So upper management are tyrants. Constant negative feedback, always watching every little thing you do, and thank God they‚Äôre not based in my state because if I worked for them I‚Äôd fucking quit. I had to take Xanax because of them when they were visiting. 

The meeting we just had? I had been making a few very minor mistakes on some forms I did and did not respond professionally to a client, which caused her to not want me as her representative (like I give a fuck). They not only printed out the conversation because they could see my email, but they highlighted every word of which I said. 

They grade us on every little thing. They even grade us on if WE GRADED THE FORMS WE WORK ON. Every single thing you do is graded, watched, tracked, and compared. 

They not only talked to me like I was a moron (‚Äúif you need help responding to clients, just let us know. Step back, take a deep breath.‚Äù) but also questioned if I was committed to this job. In my head I‚Äôm like no, I don‚Äôt want to fill out forms all day and send emails while simultaneously having to be compared to 12 other people and graded on metrics and quality and all this shit, I want to start a sports analytics website. 

But of course I said ‚Äúyes.‚Äù 

I‚Äôve done this job for about a year and a half. It‚Äôs getting old and under our new systems it‚Äôs constant micro managing behind the scenes. My dream is to make my own sports analytics website because that‚Äôs my special interest (highly functioning). 

I just don‚Äôt fit into the corporate world. It‚Äôs all fake restricted bullshit. 

I could quit now, pay off my student loan debt, and still have like 16K in savings. All my expenses would be is my apartment and any bills plus food. I‚Äôm 24.

Any advice? I just can‚Äôt believe they watch me like a hawk... it was VERY minor mistakes and I could tell they were speaking for toxic upper management. I don‚Äôt want to work in an environment like this. I just don‚Äôt fucking care. 

I want to spend time with my niece and family and friends and start my website.

Apart from happy employees being more productive, it;s just the right thing to do. The nature of the business itself is quite fulfilling (won't indulge what it is for privacy) but it's more about what I can do personally. Here's some of my ideas:

1) Actually good benefits (health, dental, vision, matching 12% of 401k contribution)

2) 5 days paid leave per 4 months worked + National Holidays + One day off for voting (I heard you can get fired for taking a day off to vote in USA)

I quit my job at one of the big mail pushing companies this year and started doing gig work only. grubhub, doordash, etc. I am 100% happier because I can work on my own schedule and if I don't want to go to work I don't HAVE to. which is an amazing feeling. I'm making  more than I was at any of my previous jobs so I'm enjoying it for the most part. here is my issue... 

while the money is good for now... I have 0 plans for my future and anytime I think about going back to a ""regular"" job I start getting suicidal again. I see all these ""influencers"" and celebrities make more than any human being working a regular job could ever make in their lifetime and it angers me to my core.

We are trying to make our own business so we can spend more time together. However, we need money to start a business, we have soo many ideas and every time we get money, a new bill comes up ‚Äú council tax, fine, water bills, insurance ‚Äú the worst part is that the poorer you are, the poorer you get as for example, when you can‚Äôt afford to pay your council tax bill which is around ¬£120 per month, they tell you that you need to pay ¬£1,400 upfront- and obviously now you can‚Äôt pay that so they throw court bills on top of that to fuck your over even more. People tell you to that you are lucky to have a job- lucky for what? For pay that doesn‚Äôt even allow me to live only to be pushed around like a farm animal. Then you‚Äôre told that you‚Äôre poor because you don‚Äôt work hard enough- I‚Äôm sorry that I can‚Äôt work harder when I already have no fucking life to begin with.

Who writes this nonsense?  I was making their low ""middle class"" income in my state in 2018.

I wasn't middle class. I was broke. Every month my discount rent ate 50% of what I made.  Food, gas, etc took the rest.

427,Having a really shitty day at work,"This is probably gonna be a long post but I promise the excitement picks up at the end. Also on mobile so of course sorry. Alright. This literally just happened to me and I had to tell someone it was just all so ridiculous and unbelievable. Here goes. So let‚Äôs preface this by saying one I almost never shit myself and two I‚Äôm actually a pretty hard worker when there is work to be done. You give me a task I‚Äôll do it. Especially one that makes sense to me and needs doing. I start getting anti work because no manager/boss gives tasks like that. 

I‚Äôve worked full time since I was 17 years old to support myself, and through the years have just become more and more disillusioned with having to do this. But I gotta make ends meet. So right now I‚Äôm working as a janitor for a university, because I‚Äôm diabetic and need insurance (in a Union). Over the summer, I have been cleaning student apartments top to bottom to have kids move in. I was working my ass off for months. Anywhere from 4-8 full sized apartments that were typically left disgusting because college kids lived there. But I got it done. In fact I was getting compliments from higher ups at how good I was getting it done. Like I said if there is a job that needs doing I‚Äôll do it, even if I don‚Äôt like it. 

Cut to lately. Finished every single apartment on campus. My boss kind of forgot I was over there (normally I work in a dorm). And so for the past 2 weeks or so I have been at same apartments with nothing to do. With all the apartments cleaned, there arnt a whole lot of areas left, just some hallways to vacuum and a very small lobby and laundry room. All in all to completely clean all that takes about 45 min. My shifts are 8 hours. First couple days I honestly tried to stretch it out to last. Even called to ask if there was more I could be doing. Nope keep the apartments clean. So here I am, with literally nothing to do. 

Another important fact is despite having cars were supposed to drive on campus, I take my personal vehicle cause I like going home for my lunch break just makes it easier. So then it hits me. I have nothing to do, so I‚Äôll just go home. So for the past 2ish weeks I‚Äôve had an amazing time at work. I clock in, get my shit done in about an hour or a little more I‚Äôm in no rush now. Then I literally just drive home. Because if my options are sit and twiddle my thumbs at work or go home, I‚Äôm taking door number 2. It‚Äôs been amazing. I‚Äôd make myself nice lunches, watch TV, take a lot of naps. All on the clock. At one point I even went and got a haircut during my shift. Another I slept through going back to clock out and ended up getting paid overtime. The ideal situation for an anti work person right? But all good things must come to an end. 

Yesturday I got a call from my boss while I was at home demanding where I was. It was about an hour and a half after my lunch break was supposed to end, and she was saying she‚Äôs here and where‚Äôs my car and where am I?! I am a bad liar at the best of times, so I mumbled well I‚Äôm on the way. Rushed back over to get chewed out (assured her I just lost track of time that day). She told me I was no longer allowed to drive my personal vehicle (which was always technically the rule) and that she was gonna have to drive me to the apartments (there‚Äôs 2 different buildings) and pick me up. I sighed and said alright. Actions have consequences and I knew my luck wouldn‚Äôt last forever. 

So today first day I‚Äôm being babysat. I get dropped off at first apartment, which only has a laundry room. The laundry room has no bathroom, just a small janitor closet with a sink and cleaning supplies, and washers/dryers. She gave me about an hour and a half till she said she was coming to get me, and like I said I can finish this laundry room in 5-10 min (I clean it everyday it‚Äôs not dirty). So I was actually feeling kinda good like oh ya I‚Äôll just knock this out and sit around play on reddit. Whistling along cleaning away. Another important fact was I had 2 cups of coffee this morning. I wanted to be awake for dealing with this bullshit babysitting. 

Coffee always makes me shit. I had to go as soon as I started, but figured I‚Äôd just hold it out till we got to second apartment with a bathroom. I do hate not being able to go to the bathroom when I want at work though. But I‚Äôm still feeling alright, things aren‚Äôt too bad! Had a pressing fart, no one is there it‚Äôs early, I figure hey I‚Äôll let some pressure out. Like I said I havnt shit myself since I was a literal toddler. But that all ended today. Out it came. I confidently squeezed out a fart, and a heavy rush of warm diarrhea came out instead. Immediate panic. I waddle over to closet and close and lock door. I drop my pants to assess the damage. It‚Äôs bad. It‚Äôs really bad. Step out of pants and underwear, now just butt ass naked at work with my dick hanging out. At this point I kind of laugh at how ridiculous this all is and think I guess I‚Äôll have to just throw the undies away, wipe with a rag and water and go commando. 

That‚Äôs when I remember. I have had the same pair of work pants for several years. I wear my work clothes till you can physically not wear them anymore. This particular pair has a large rip that covers basically the entire crotch. Never cared before, coworkers made fun of me but I‚Äôd just wear sliders no big deal. It‚Äôs a big deal when those very same underwear are now covered in diarrhea because you a grown man just shat yourself. Panic again. I can‚Äôt go commando, I have to drive around with boss. She sits right next to me could glance over and see my dick and balls hanging through pants. Oh no. Normally I‚Äôd just drive home real quick and laugh about and whatever. Not today my car is miles away. 

Realization is slowly setting in but I‚Äôm looking for other solutions. I attempted to make a sort of diaper out of some rags. No good. Time is ticking away before my boss with keys comes a calling. Had this happened any day earlier it would have been totally cool. But today. I did what had to be done. I strapped some gloves on, covered my underwear in cleaning supplies and did my best to hand wash it in sink. I‚Äôm sitting here, butt naked squeezing shit out of my underwear as best I can not so happy to be at work anymore. I do the best I can, attempted to dry them with a rag and slid my wet semi dirty underwear back on. Desperate times call for desperate measures. I got all the shit rags I had used to wipe and clean up with and threw away the evidence. Got picked up and no one was the wiser besides a comment about slight smell. 

But I know I just shit all over myself, and can‚Äôt even change because I am contractually obligated to be here for 8 hours. They determine when I can and can‚Äôt have access to bathrooms. They determine when I go home and when I can‚Äôt. I am so sick of shitty ass work.

453,The last time I worked I almost died,"TW: suicide

The last job I had was in 2019 and I was paid $11.50. That was okay because my folks helped me out with some stuff but I‚Äôm definitely not advocating for such shit pay. Anyways I worked as a linen technician at a hospital and it was physically hard work. I am disabled so it was worse. I ended up falling twice and having a seizure on the job. I ended up in the ER and they sent me home. Well after I was sent home (this was a Thursday i believe) I was supposed to go to the doctor to get a doctors note saying I could work again except I didn‚Äôt realize that since I had gotten one for the previous time. So on Sunday I attempted suicide. There was a trigger for me to do it but the main issue was because I desperately did not want to go back to work the next day.

The whole time I was in the hospital I was still suicidal and scared of having to go back to work. When I was discharged I went back like normal still not knowing I was supposed to get a doctors note and my boss came in and told me I couldn‚Äôt work yet and asked if I got injured so I could fill out a form. I said no and she gave me such an awful look. She didn‚Äôt realize I was in the hospital because I wanted to die rather than work there. 

I left and decided to go back to school. I called my boss‚Äôs boss and told him I quit. I‚Äôve been in school since and I‚Äôve been afraid of going back to work. I‚Äôve been afraid of feeling that bad again. Work shouldn‚Äôt fucking do that. I even took a mental health day when I was there but I felt incredibly guilty for doing so.

466,Work Problems," 

Start by saying I hope everyone is holding up okay during these crazy times.

Little background before I get into the main issue, I have been working for a small IT company for almost

3 years now. It has its benefits such as whenever I have a dentist appointment I can pop out no problem or show up a little late if something happened in the morning you know the typical small company benefits. Previously I worked in a environment where I was completing an apprenticeship (after i finished college) in IT communications and networking. I worked at the previous place about a year and 6 months completed the apprenticeship and moved onto a silly banked hours contract and minimum wage. That office environment really got me down and i worked with some toxic people so i left and came here. I started with a 6 month probation at ¬£15000 a year which was minimum wage for my age at the time I believe then after 6 months it went up to ¬£17000 which is the wage i stayed on for until about a month ago where it became ¬£18000 a year because another guy left. Now this is where i'm going to sound really ungrateful because i know a lot of people would kill to be in my position during the pandemic where i have stable work but if you could try forget that's a thing for this post. I think i'm being really underpaid. Being a small company I understand i'm not going to ever get the big bucks but we recently took on an apprentice who's 27 and i worked out as soon as he completes the apprenticeship he will instantly be earning more than me just because of his age? He has no previous experience in IT and doesn't even know what a VGA cable is.

I've worked so hard to get where i am and i work my ass off every day and in my own time to get stuff done for this company even though we are an absolute laughing stock i've stayed here i even re arrange my holidays to suit their every need (not had one in over a year). The business is MONTHS behind on invoicing and the office is a dump and always has been since i've worked here. there no career progression or organisation at this place.Its become a meme amongst my bosses how disorganisation and stuff this place is they joke about it like its fun.

I spoke with my girlfriend and she thinks its a joke how much i get for how much knowledge i have and how hard i work. She earns more than me at her call centre job which she jokes a child could do her job and it requires no skill or experience.

An example of how un-organised it is? I've worked here almost 3 years and i still don't have a contract because they've not got round to it.

I get no extra benefits other than the ones told previously. My wage doesn't increase with inflation, i get 0 bonus ect. I get clients coming directly to me now which they know they shouldn't do because they know i'm the one who gets stuff done.

For the specifics i handle everything from server builds/installs,VoIP systems,active directory admin,

I am 1st line and second line support, Cisco network admin ect... as i'm sure you know working for a small company you do everything. I've been working on many certifications for years but i don't have the time or money now but i've still retained all the information from them.

This post is me asking a question and ranting.

I want to know if with over 4 years in the IT sector am i being underpaid?

Should i leave this s\*\*\* show of a company?is the grass greener on the other side working for a bigger company?

Talking to them wouldn't get me anywhere.

Please ask me anything. I just need some advice from people who's worked in this industry longer and know more.

Should i scare them and ask for a reference and see if anything changes?or should i quit whining and man up and get on with it because i don't have enough experience to earn more?

If this is posted in the wrong place i'm sorry.

475,I'm tired of this,"I never asked for much. I'd be a NEET if I didn't have to study to wage slave my life away.

I don't waste money outside of some electronics, I don't have expensive subscriptions or hobbies. I don't want a car and I don't even have a license. Why, in a world with such huge production, can't I have something like that, the bare minimum? Why do we have to keep submitting into wage slavery when our productivity is basically divorced from wages and our rights? Why is nothing changing and life just gets worse?

Thinking I'll have 40+ years of actual slavery ahead of me is exhausting, depressing, and destroys any motivation I have. The fact that no one outside of the Internet understands me is even worse. I can't lean on anyone. My family is counting the days when I start slaving and get out of ""their"" house, my friends are completely alienated or got a job through connections, any coworkers I had in the past were oblivious to capitalist exploitation. Psychologists just tell me to ""live in the moment"" and ""make small plans"", they never debate matters relating to our existence. They make you cope with or ignore your preidcament. And that's it, they're the regulatory mechanism of capitalism and like with education, they can't do much to beat the system.

I'm trapped and I cannot commit suicide, I'm already here, regretting having been born, not even being able to enjoy a simple life, when others seem to want so much and need so much. I'm doing great doing lockdown, I don't tolerate being around people for too long and I take care of myself.

476,Getting fired from a toxic job made me change my priorities,"I just graduated college in May. My senior year I was working in my first big girl job. It made me feel really accomplished that I was working in industry while still in school but honestly it was horrible. I was scared to eventually move to a full time position there because all of my coworkers were insanely overworked and everyone I talked to hated it there. Also in the span of a year that I was there I saw our office go from 35 to 20 people, all of those were people who quit. I never really understood what a toxic work environment was until I started there. I cried every single day at work due to coworker pettiness and frustration because I was given little training and a lot of responsibility. I was promised I would be given a full time position once I graduated but instead a few days after I graduated they told me my position was eliminated.They told me it was nothing against me (i think budget cuts because of covid) but said ""if you see were hiring you should totally apply!"" ..yeah right. Even though I knew I wasn't planning on staying I was devastated.The job market is ROUGH but especially so for new grads. But with all this time off my mental health has been a million time better and its really made me rethink my priorities. I've decided to take some art classes because this is something I've always wanted to learn. Also I've started a side business with my sister where we sell vintage items.

The editor was starting his day at 3:30am!

And I was thinking that even those wonderful and creative people that have relatively well-paid and rewarding jobs are sacrificing their personal and family life to release a cultural product that we get to enjoy in a couple of hours and then forget about it. 

And made me think about how would I feel if I couldn't be with my toddler during 3-4 months because I would be leaving and coming home and she'd be asleep already. It sucks and no one deserves it. But there is no way anyone at Disney (or any other studio) would say NO.

482,"People who don‚Äôt want a solution, they just want to complain","Anybody work with somebody like this? I do, and it drives me nuts. She clearly gets a lot of satisfaction out of complaining about how stressed and anxious she is, because she does it a lot - I mean, almost daily. It‚Äôs so difficult to be around. She also will repeat it several times during the same conversation - as in ‚ÄúI am so stressed and anxious. It‚Äôs so busy it makes me so stressed and anxious. It‚Äôs just so stressful.‚Äù It‚Äôs not unusual for her to make back to back to back statements about that, or to go into detail about just how stressed she is.

She is not stupid, nor have I been quiet about my distaste for such statements, so it‚Äôs clear that she‚Äôs doing it willfully despite knowing that the effect she‚Äôs having is to dump her anxiety and stress on others. She WANTS others to be as upset as she is, and makes it her mission.

What‚Äôs most frustrating is that when she is presented with a solution to a certain problem that is bothering her, she has NO INTEREST whatsoever in said solution. She becomes haughty and irritated, and totally ignores or dismisses out of hand the solution. In effect, she is not interested in lessening her burden - she‚Äôs only interested in talking about how burdened she is. I have talked to my boss about her behavior, and he has agreed that it is very annoying and causes discord. Together, we have tried several angles to get her to stop doing this, but nothing ever works, because she‚Äôs incapable of admitting that she‚Äôs her own worst enemy.

483,Tomorrow marks my 1st anniversary of not working,"Last year, I got let go from my last job. I always told myself and let others tell me that I should work to earn more even though I have enough money to live off of. People tried to sell me on a life purpose by being fulfilled while working for other people. People still do try to sell me on the idea of working for companies/business's. I tell them I don't need it, I have lived that life, and the bills are paid. The same people will attempt to invalidate me because apparently my worth is equal to my usefulness as a worker for wages that are a joke.

So last year in the middle of a family crisis and my Dad almost died from heart failure - my employer sat me down and terminated my employment. They were being assholes about providing FMLA so I could help take care of my Dad. They said I didn't qualify but there was no way I would have been able to be there given what did happen to my Dad.

After being gone for almost 2 weeks, management pulled me into a meeting room and said ""we brought you in here to tell you we are terminating your employment today"". I smiled, I felt relieved. I had planned on leaving but they made it easier for me. My now ex-boss handed me a box of tissues thinking I was going to cry over it. I simply replied I would not be needing it. He wanted to know if I was torn up about it and I said ""actually no, this is just the catalyst to an otherwise crappy month. You just did me a big favor. Loosing this job isn't that important to me. None of this has ever been my top priority."" He put the box down disappointed, I grabbed my stuff, and I left.

494,Shady shit from an employer I had an interview with last week,"With my extra $600 ending on my unemployment and only getting $300/week I decided I needed to look for some worn. I saw an ad for a job that paid $16/hour and I got a call back for that job after I sent them my resume on indeed. At the interview there were so many red flags though. First, the $16/hour was only after 90 days. The first 90 days was paid at minimum wage, but they said if you stay past 90 days then they‚Äôll retro your pay rate. My thought process is why not just pay me the rate you‚Äôre advertising then. After they mentioned that strange policy I asked if there was an issue with high turnover and if they had many people not lasting more than 3 months. They didn‚Äôt really want to answer that question. It makes me wonder if they‚Äôll just fire you before the 90 days so avoid paying over minimum wage. They offer little to no training for their property systems which was rather unusual. I held an ace in my sleeve though when it came to my acceptance of the job. I didn‚Äôt fill out their application and since I never gave them an actual application I can honestly say I didn‚Äôt refuse a job in my unemployment certification. 

Oh and to top things off this company is one of them who sent it people to Lansing bitching about how the extra unemployment benefits is hurting them fill all their open positions. It‚Äôs not the extra unemployment that was stopping them from finding people to work for them. It‚Äôs the shady shit with only $9/hour, but we‚Äôll pay you the remainder in a lump sum after 90 days of employment.",False,iep7aw,amanor409,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/iep7aw/shady_shit_from_an_employer_i_had_an_interview/,7,1
495,It feels like my coworkers are brainwashed...,"So, at my company, we have these roughly-quarterly meetings with our directors. These meetings are half Q&amp;A, half presentation on how well the company is doing. I was not surprised at all during the meeting to find out that our productivity was down, given that we moved all of our staff to work-at-home rather than having people come into the office. But who cares, right? Numbers are down, big deal.  


Monthly, I attend meetings with a team of people who escalate concerns of our peers to our teams of supervisors and directors. The meeting started with the topic of our productivity not being tracked correctly. For about half an hour, people swapped personal anecdotes about how their work has a large amount of variety and thus it's impossible to report their ""true"" productivity, so they want something done to show their productivity more accurately.  


At this point, I chime in and the conversation proceeds as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Why does it matter if your productivity isn't reported accurately?""

Group: ""Well, it's just not accurate. It should be made more accurate.""

Me: ""Well, sure, it should be more accurate. But why do you personally want it to be more accurate? Are your supervisors telling you that you're not doing enough work?""

Group: ""No, they say that we're doing fine. It's just that we have a lot of assignments and it's difficult to complete all of them.""

Me: ""Okay, so you feel like you're being given too much work?""

Group: ""No, I don't feel like we're being given too much to do. It's just we have a lot of work that isn't getting done. Maybe if our productivity was more accurate, we would hire more people to get everything completed in a timely manner.""

Me: ""But why do you care if we're getting everything done in a timely manner? It's not like you're being forced to complete extra work to make up for a lack of bodies.""

Group: ""Right, but our directors say our productivity is low. So we need to adjust how our work is being reported so our productivity is higher.""

Me: ""But you say your supervisors have no issues with your productivity as is right now. And it's not like our directors are breathing down our necks trying to get us to work faster. So why do you care about our collective productivity? What is there to worry about?""

At this point the few people who have their webcams on seem visibly exasperated. One person delivers this next line in a way that makes it seem like it's their final say after much deliberation.

Person: ""We need our productivity to be tracked more accurately so we can more easily set goals to increase our productivity. The company wants our productivity to be higher, so that's what we want too. We want to make our goals align with the company's goals!""

Others in the group agree with this person that this is what they meant by saying they want our productivity to be tracked in a better way. Here, the moderator for the meeting cuts us off and abruptly introduces another topic.  


I was completely dumbfounded after figuring out the reason for this impassioned debate. To me, it still seemed like a bad reason. If our productivity goes up, we gain nothing. We don't get paid more. And if our collective productivity goes down, we lose nothing. The company doesn't go around docking pay, and they certainly don't start firing individuals because of the company not meeting a certain goal.

Plus, if our productivity increases, that just causes directors to move the goalpost. Our directors will literally always say they want us to do more, work more, and work better. At no point will they ever stop us and tell us that we're being too productive. So increasing our collective productivity is pointless, as it will never stop our directors from asking for more.

I don't think I'll ever understand why I was the only person to speak up and try to define a goal or reason for wanting to increase our productivity, but I think the team I meet with resents me for it. How  dare I suggest that we're doing fine, right? The word ""stagnate"" was getting thrown around a lot. I seemed to be the only one who accepted the idea of our productivity reaching a plateau, while everyone else apparently wants to do more and more - for the company.",False,ie0upw,JDuCalisson,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ie0upw/it_feels_like_my_coworkers_are_brainwashed/,11,1

502,People on this sub need to be realistic about their expectations and also look at their own behaviour and attitude towards society,"I believe that one day technological automation will reach the point where all of our necessities (food, running water, shelter etc) are provided, supplied and maintained without human interaction. A world where our logistical, medical and agricultural needs are all streamlined and automated. 

Unfortunately, we‚Äôre not there yet. 

Our society still requires a hell of a lot of human labour. People are required to grow, package and ship food. People are required to build and maintain houses and the facilities those households need. People are required to build and service our cars, people are required to look after our sick and elderly, people are required to maintain and update every website and entertainment platform you browse and to secure and maintain the data centres that they‚Äôre hosted upon. For society to function we need a hell of a lot of man hours.

If you want to work part time at a dead end job that‚Äôs completely fine, you just can‚Äôt expect to be able to reap the same benefits from society of those who put in more hours at a higher skilled job, do you not find it hypocritical to expect to be able to live in a house built and maintained by workers, drive a car built and serviced by workers, enjoy food grown packaged and shipped by workers, go to shops and restaurants and be served by workers but not want to work yourselves?

While we‚Äôre on the subject of hypocrisy let‚Äôs talk about wealth inequality. It‚Äôs no secret that our capitalistic society has a massive wealth inequality problem, it‚Äôs awful that we live in a world that has billionaires with private jets and super yachts whilst simultaneously having people dying of starvation and exposure. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll all agree with this, let‚Äôs get to the hypocritical part:

Lots of you will happily complain about wealth inequality while simultaneously buying products from companies which perpetuate this inequality, you‚Äôll complain about what a hard life you have working 40 hours per week but will happily buy Nike trainers and iPhones even though you‚Äôre well aware that they‚Äôre the products of child labour. I understand that necessities such as food must be purchased regardless of ethicality but designer clothes and smart phones are far from necessities.

Then let‚Äôs look at how anti-landlord and anti-corporation lots of you are, you‚Äôll complain about landlords who often just own a single extra property and small business owners who have a couple of employees but you‚Äôll happily pay into a bank account which generates interest, an ISA, 401k or pension scheme. How the fuck do you think these systems generate money? By pooling your cash together and investing in stocks and properties.

He ties it into permaculture, which is an interest of mine, and I believe it may be an interest many of you share. Being a ""manifesto"", he proposes many ideas. While he doesn't detail exact methods, he backs up his suggestions with examples and sources, alongside his own personal experiences.

519,Idleness as a path to a more sustainable way of life,"**Departure into Emptiness - Climate Crisis, Idleness and Mysticism (Essay by Jupp Hartmann, Excerpt)**

I.

**Not as much!**   That is the imperative of our age: less plastic, less CO2, less  consumption, less stress. That sounds like a renunciation: of meat, of  flying, of  driving cars.

But does  this necessarily have to be a renunciation? It would be renunciation to  deny yourself the fulfill¬≠ment of a deep desire. Not doing something  because there is a better choice: that is freedom.

There  are good reasons to use that freedom: need¬≠ing less can be full of its  own  pleasure. It means be¬≠ing less dependent and - instead of  constantly chas¬≠ing after the satisfaction of needs - having more time  for the really important things.

*‚ÄúThose who have lost by being moderate are rare.‚Äù (Confucius, Analects, IV.23)*

II.

**Doing and leaving**  are what shape our perception of the world. A woodcutter, a biologist  and an in¬≠vestor perceive the same forest in a completely dif¬≠ferent  way. Whoever is taking on a task must be careful not to be taken over by  the task. The more the focus is on predetermined goals, the more the  view of collateral damage is lost.

In  a world of numbers and financial streams, every¬≠thing becomes a means  to an end. The earth be¬≠comes a raw material warehouse and people become  human capital. Everything becomes a utility. What is useless or not  useful enough from an economic point of view is in danger. Primeval  forests are being cut down; animal and plant species are becoming  extinct; in the name of utility a huge destruction is underway.

It  would often be better if less were done. But this is difficult to  achieve, because many people despair when they have nothing to do. They  cling to their occupations. Often  work is the centre of their lives -  and for many it is the source of their identity.

In  our performance-oriented times, this can be seen with extreme clarity.  That it is not a new phenome¬≠non, however, is proven by a more than two  thou¬≠sand year old text from China:

*‚ÄúWhen  the farmer has nothing more to do with grass and weeds, he has nothing  more to hold on to; when the merchant has nothing more to do with alleys  and markets, he has nothing more to hold on to. Only when the people of  the crowd have their daily work, do they make an effort. The craftsmen  depend on the skill and handling of their tools to feel themselves. If  he can¬≠not accumulate money and goods, the scrooge becomes sad. If power  and influence do not expand steadily, the ambitious man becomes  desolate.The slaves of power and wealth are only happy when in the  process of change. If they find a time when they can act, they cannot  stop acting. They all follow their path with the same regularity as the  cycle of the year. They are caught up in the world of things and cannot  change. So they run along, internally and externally trapped, sinking  into the world of things and never coming back to themselves. Oh, how  sad!‚Äù (Zhuangzi,XXIV.4)*

So  what can be done is done - and that is often much more than what needs  to be done. We virtu¬≠ally suffocate under the mass of products that our  productivity produces.

**Idleness**.  A word that has fallen into disrepute. Idleness, as the proverb warns,  is the root of all vice; and more than a few even see in it the worst of  all vices: the refusal to perform in a performance-based society.

The  calls for deceleration, which are becoming louder and louder, have  rehabilitated idleness to a certain extent in recent years. In the  wellness sector at least it has found a firm place - and in countless  magazine articles when it has to do finding oneself or burnout syndrome.

Idleness  requires free time. This is more than leisure time: it is a time free  of constraints, empty time that can be filled with what the moment  offers.

Caught in the daily hustle  and bustle, it is difficult to develop new perspectives. One is so busy  mop¬≠ping up the water that one does not even think of turning off the  tap.

In order to get a grip on  things at any time, your hands should be free. Being idle means to have  time to do the right thing at the right moment.

IV.

**Inspiration.**  The Muses like idleness. To be kissed by the Muse is the pictorial  description of what many artists experience: a higher power seems to  guide the creative process. This process is more of a letting happen  than a conscious creation. Not the conscious ego - it paints, it writes,  it composes. This state is called Flow.

In  this way, making art becomes a communication with something unknown.  Are higher powers at work here? Or is it simply neurobiological  processes? Either way, it seems like a miracle.

But the flow does not come on command. You can only create good conditions for it. There's an an¬≠cient Chinese story about that.

*‚ÄúA  wood carver carved a bell stand. When the bell stand was finished, all  the people who saw it were amazed at its divine work. The Prince of Lu  also looked at it and asked the Master, ‚ÄòWhat is your se¬≠cret?‚Äô The  latter replied, ‚ÄòI am a craftsman and know no secrets, and yet there is  one thing that matters. When I was about to make the bell stand, I was  careful not to consume my life force in other thoughts. I fasted to  bring my heart to rest. When I fasted for three days I no longer dared  to think of reward and honour; after five days I no longer dared to  think of praise and blame; after seven days I had forgotten my body and  all my limbs. At that time I also no longer thought about the court of  Your Highness. Thus I was collected in my art, and all infatuations of  the outside world had dis¬≠appeared. Afterwards I went into the forest  and looked at the trees in their natural growth. When the right tree  came before my eyes, the bell stand was ready in front of me, so that I  only had to put my hand on it. If I had not found the tree, I would have  given up. Be¬≠cause I let my nature interact with the nature of the  material, that's why people think it's a divine work.‚Äô"" (Zhuangzi,  XIX.10)*

V.

**Art**  is often the art of omission. Capturing the at¬≠mosphere of a place with  just a few strokes of the pen or grabbing the audience with a few notes  is considered high art. It is often important not to do too much. If  you try to speak a text in a particularly beautiful way, you will  quickly appear artificial. If at a jam session all the participants  constantly wanted to show all their skills, it would be very exhausting  to listen to. Only when others hold themselves back can individuals come  to the fore with their solos.

As  much as through the emphasis of its tones a rhythm gets its special  character through its pauses. A scale gets its special sound by omitting  certain semitone steps.

The white  area left blank on an old Chinese ink painting appears like the water  of a river or like wafts of mist between the mountains. The emptiness  here is an essential element of the composition.

In  the early twentieth century, abstract painting de¬≠veloped through an  increasingly consistent omission of all references to objects from the  outside world.

This led to an  undreamt-of freedom in dealing with colours and forms. And since there  is no predeter¬≠mined meaning in abstract paintings, they are an  in¬≠vitation to the imagination to go walking.

VI.

**Let it happen!**   Trust in the momentum of the cre¬≠ative process! That was my basic  attitude for decades when I was artistically active. For me, abstract  paint¬≠ing became a voyage of discovery.   Painting always had a  meditative aspect for me. When I painted, I let the spontaneous impulses  of my body take their course; I let my hands do it, without a plan,  without thinking. I tried to leave the door to chance as wide open as  possible. What happened to me often went far beyond what I could have  thought up by myself.

I playfully  found my artistic way. Over the years I did a lot of different things:  pictures made of  ce¬≠ramic tiles, lit objects, digital art, abstract  anima¬≠tions ...

It was not a  planned development. One thing led to another, each connected to the  other, appearing   in retrospect to be logical. But for me, every new  turn was a surprise. I saw my own artistic development in the way that  train passengers sitting with their backs to the direction of travel see  a landscape. I never saw what would come next.

I learned to have faith in the continuing process.  And that I would discover more in my journey I‚Äôd ever dreamed of.

VII.

**Cognitive methods.**  The modern sciences are atheistic in their methods, i.e. the recourse  to reli¬≠gious beliefs is taboo in the scientific framework for good  reasons. This does not mean, however, that one needs an atheistic  default position to do science. The atheism of science is purely  methodical and not ideological. Even those who are scientifically active  have questions that cannot be answered in this way. Then one can decide  for or against believing some¬≠thing specific. As long as the scientific  activity remains unaffected by this, all is well.

Besides,  the sciences cannot prove an atheistic world view because their method  is atheistic. They cannot prove what they presuppose. That would be a  circular argument.

Just like a  methodical atheism there is also a me¬≠thodical spirituality. As an  artist, I become more open to inspiration when I feel that there is  some¬≠thing greater than my conscious self, and that I can open myself to  this something in my creative process. I just need to have the capacity  to be amazed. Miracles are more likely to happen when I beleave they  are possible.

As little as scientific knowledge can support athe¬≠ism, so can artistic experience serve as proof of a higher powers.

The  word ""inspire"" comes from Latin and means ""to breathe in"". It raises  the question: who is breath¬≠ing in? But all answers to this question  remain speculation.

It is  possible, perhaps even reasonable, to talk about creative work with  religious or esoteric vocabulary. Then one interprets experiences within  a given pat¬≠tern of explanation. This makes them easier to  com¬≠municate. This is legitimate, but it proves nothing with regard to  the pattern of interpretation.

Beyond  all doubt, the experience itself remains: In¬≠tuition can flow more  freely the less conscious con¬≠trol you exercise. It is an experience  that probably all people can have, no matter what they believe or don't  believe.

VIII.

**Success.**  Basically, it's quite banal: of course my art will be better if I'm  painting, focused on what I'm doing, and not constantly thinking about  what oth¬≠ers will say or whether my work will yield  enough money. The  freer my head is, the more attentive I can work. With attention comes  wonder and with wonder comes awe. With awe I have a good chance of  succeeding in what I do.

In his book Effortless Mastery the New York jazz musician Kenny Werner makes the observation *‚Äú(‚Ä¶)  that there are good players who, for some reason, have little impact  when they play. Everything works fine. They are ‚Äòswinging‚Äô and all that,  but still, some¬≠thing is not landing in the heart of the audience.‚Äù  (p.10)* He attributes this to the fact that they are caught up in  their thoughts and are far too much guided by ideas about how right it  should be. ‚ÄúOne must practice surrendering control to a larger, or  higher force. It‚Äôs scary at first, but eventually liberat¬≠ing.‚Äù (ibid)

I  very often experience my painting when others talk about their art, be  it music, painting or litera¬≠ture. Whoever wants to taste abundance must  be¬≠come empty.

IX.

**Emptiness** is of crucial importance in Daoist phi¬≠losophy:

*‚ÄúHow  the nose breathes and the ear hears, is essentially emptiness. All  things use what they don't have on the basis of what they have. If you  don't believe this, just look at a flute or a pipe made of reeds.‚Äù  (Huainanzi, XVI.6b)*

This is  not about an abstract or metaphysical idea of emptiness, it is about the  very concrete emptiness between things or within things. It's about  empti¬≠ness interacting with what's there. An emptiness that can be  experienced.

Emptiness means potential. An empty space can be filled, empty time can be used, an empty sheet can be written on.

Not burdening oneself with unnecessary things means freedom. To become empty in this sense is the best way to find oneself.

To be empty means to have room for abundance.

542,Wondering what's next after this job...,"31/M. Been at a tech company for 3.25 years in a compliance role the last 2 years. I do KYC/AML which is just approving or denying new customer accounts. This means I don't have talk to customers by phone or email. This is a HUGE benefit. However, I'm grossly underpaid. $17.50 an hour, denied a due raise to $19 that should've happened in June. Due to Covid, I can confirm the company has saved a fortune with it's universal WFH policy (and also a cancelled annual company trip to the HQ overseas that costs millions every year). Instead of throwing every employee a $2,000 bonus as they should've done, they tightened up on every penny, including salary increases.

Now that we realized the company is going to do just fine and is perfectly profitable in a fully remote scenario (We're an online only financial institution with no branches or stores), they are slowly ""phasing back in"" salary reviews. But not before they are going to do a ""benchmarking"". Every year they do this crap, where middle management undertakes a completely pointless 3-6 month project to re-assess the median income for your role in your city and state. I view this is nothing but a stalling tactic. It's data for data's sake and it stalls in the actual implementation of the overdue raises. I'm not sure if the company is run by mouthbreathers with analysis paralysis, or if this is a deliberate tactic. Or both.

So my salary equates to about 37k, which is enough to get by with a small 1 bedroom apartment in my state. But it's a dead end job. Boring as hell and the company has made it clear their priorities are automating and outsourcing. They don't even hide the fact our jobs are threatened and the mood in my department is one of pure hopelessness and despondency. Everyone feels the same. And despite the company's lies, we're paid about 20% under median, as generally this position starts at 45k elsewhere.

In August 2021 I am going to reassess. In June I'll be there 4 years and they do provide a 6 week paid sabbatical. I figure, ride it out until then, take the break and hope the pandemic and job market have improved in the next 10 months.

But then what? All my experience before compliance was in customer service and sales. I could literally never do that again. I consider getting into compliance in 2018 a ""big break"", as getting out of the public eye reduced my stress levels at work considerably. In the spring I put out resumes for other jobs in this area for big banks and financial institutions and got zero bites. I literally CAN'T go back to sales or CS.

547,Working for a Murder Mystery game company nearly killed me.,"This company is the kind push the idea that they've been doubling in growth each year to their investors, and yet when the writers making 35k in a big city area (or worse, warehouse employees making 24k or less) ask for a livable wage, suddenly the company ""is still a startup"" and we are ""entitled"" for asking.

For over two years, I gave my all. And they kept taking and taking, demanding more of me until I had nothing left to give.

I gave them a smash hit that got press coverage and a celebrity. I gave them the most in-depth games they currently own. I gave them a whole new brand. I, along with the other writers, gave them everything we got to increase their customer base and bring in positive reviews.

And what did I get? 

Working every night and weekend consistently for months to make deadlines. Chewing on my tongue in my sleep from stress and not being able to taste anything. Heart palpitations for the first time in my life. Stress eating and weight gain. Trauma and anger built up from daily interactions with incompetent managers and a micromanaging and condescending producer. Broken promises left and right. Crying most nights, unable to enjoy life outside of work.

The cherry on top is that I was part of a mass layoff. 8 women-- 3 lead, senior writers, a project manager/copy editor, and two customer service reps-- and 1 man from the warehouse. (No white man from management or marketing ever gets fired, even for terrible mistakes or reprehensible comments made to female employees).

We were.told the layoff was due to Covid, but they've been hiring people since then. They just wanted to ""clean house"" of the oldest and most disillusioned employees.

Within 3 days of being laid off and the shock had subsided, I had already felt so much healthier. I was actually sleeping. I wasn't stress eating. I wasn't dreading talking to anyone, or pulling my hair out trying to make an unreasonable deadline. I wasn't being condescended to anymore.

I felt lighter.

I still have a lot of anger when I think about it. No doubt it's trauma that I need to talk about and sort through.

But at least I don't have to fucking work for that depressing, toxic place anymore.

We have some rich friends and my girlfriend doesn't want them to know we are poor so she keeps buying as much stuff as she can. She herself does not work, just looks after the house and if I dare complain then she just says she will leave me for someone richer, I should be lucky to have someone as hot as her (She is kinda hot). She says if I had no money she would instantly leave me because a man is only as useful as his wallet. She did say however that if we were to have kids she would be a full time mom. I barely get to sleep 5 hours a day before I have to drag myself out of bed to get to my 1st job, while she sleeps in until 3pm sometimes, orders uber eats and just watches netflix until its bed time again. If I am lucky I get rewarded with sex once a week, but she very often witholds it if I did something wrong, she will say oh im not feeling it, maybe next week.

555,Having a Rough Time,"This is the only group I feel like will ""get it."" ~~I'll try to keep the rant short-ish...~~

This is the only place I feel like I won't get constantly bombarded with empty motivational platitudes and told I'm ""lazy"" or ""whining"" and to ""suck it up and hustle."" This epic post is a little bit ""woe is me"" and that's just how it is...

(later) Eh screw it, I apologize for nothing. I'm posting this somewhere as catharsis, and it's entirely your choice to read it. I just need to reach out because my internal well-being and stability has slowly been worn away. Maybe I'll post it to a blog or something to show others where I came from, when I cross this mountain. I dunno.

Anyway...

**COMMENCE! :**

For starters, I consider myself reasonably intelligent (who doesn't?). I have a lot of constructive / healthy / productive hobbies. I'm a 3D artist, I've built my own 3D printer, I'm learning game scripting, I practice martial arts...I say this because when I *give a shit*, I don't give up, I keep learning, I keep doing. Like many of yourselves, I'm definitely not ""lazy."" Life is too short for a single focus and I pride myself on being so multi-faceted.

Most of this is possible because I have a living situation where I live with family and can get by working only 19 hours a week. I'd love to be a self-sustaining artist or gamedev, but my biggest struggle is maintaining a mindset to do so. I see all these people who managed to do it, even though they had to slave away at full-time jobs or ""careers.""

I KNOW I'm in a privileged situation, and I feel exceptionally guilty that I can't make something better even with those advantages. 

I'm increasingly convinced I have ADHD, and right now I'm struggling to even get an appointment and figure out a proper diagnosis. My moods change on a whim, I'll be inspired and confident and ready to rock n' roll and then in 5 minutes I'm a worthless sack of crap who will never amount to anything. I'm ready to start a digital sculpt and suddenly I have 35 unrelated wikipedia tabs open because I made the mistake of looking to the internet for reference.

**I stopped playing games.** If I can wrestle my brain into agreeing with me for once, I work on my skills, on projects, on tutorials. I occasionally buy games on sale because they look so fun and yet I feel *guilty* playing anything because the longer I play now, the more shifts I'll have to endure *later.* So they sit there, waiting for an imaginary day I can finally ""get to them."" 

I'm sure at this point most of us have a backlog that, if played in its entirety, would be triple our own lifetime.

The exception being:  I play the occasional game my SO and I can agree on, because it's a way to spend time together. 

But yeah, the point is to dispel the assumption that I might be dumping my life into games and complaining that I'm not getting anywhere. I know those people, I hurt for those people, and I'm not those people.

I jumped into a game jam hoping I could test out the new skills I learned, but it took me forever to code basic functionality, the day-job-work-block hit, I won't have anything to submit. I failed.

&amp;#x200B;

Where the hell is all my time going?!

&amp;#x200B;

*""But maybe if I work on my self-talk."" ""Maybe if I learn this time-management skill."" ""Maybe my art will be good enough soon."" ""How the hell do these people find the time to learn this stuff so damn fast when I'm so SLOW!?""*

Yeah, I screwed around in high-school because gamedev wasn't exactly an established field at the time. I had nobody to ""mentor"" me or explain to me otherwise. I have no artists in my family. The thing that hurts is when I ask most skilled artists about their ""origin story"", they tell me a parent or sibling or best-friend or what-have-you played a huge role in guiding them.

If anything, I took so many detours believing I need a ""fallback"" that's stable, and VASTLY underestimated just how demoralizing the ""working world"" actually was.

# Where I'm at now:

So after a series of terrible customer-servant-jobs, that's landed me in my current job: I work at a pseudo-government institution and my job is to help with whatever stupid computer questions from any human-refuse that happens to wander in. I'm often alone, and often without a line-of-sight to know who I'm about to encounter.

I thought I'd get to help people learn computers! How wrong I was. Mostly I'm just there to help the incompetent apply to KFC and print out paperwork for loan-sharks. (Or lots of landlords who wanna print out half-assed tenant agreements.)

I want to make it clear I will bend over backwards to help people in need, but usually I'm just there to be taken advantage of. Mostly old boomers come in and immediately tell me ""How dumb they are with these computer things"" and just as soon start flattering me with how great I must be, so I'll do it for them of course. 

(My usual response lately is to look terribly confused. ""Well that's quite an assumption! I'm not that bright."") 

I grew up helping my parents and old relatives with computers and being patient. It's not like I'm an elitist jerk. I'm just tired of the same old narrative. I just straight-up (politely?) call it out now. 

*""Oh well you're young so--""* 

*""No. It's a skill like anything else. Like cars, computers have been commonplace for literal decades. Much of Gen Z has no idea how to use something without a touchscreen. So please. Don't.""*

The place can either be packed full and peaceful, with people just doing their business, or empty save for 3 people who will run me ragged an entire shift, raising their hands like schoolchildren to summon me for idiotic questions, like, and I shit-you-not: *""What do I do after filling out this job application? The next button?""* 

I've also had plenty of people try to get me to help them cheat on ""If there are 10 apples and you take 2 away..."" or ""If the register says '$14.32' and they hand you $100.00...""

Otherwise, it's not being able to find the black-on-black address bar in Chrome, or having to attach a resume to something, or an email attachment, or nothing is working because they opened Internet Explorer. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""I clicked the 'e' for internet."" 

^(-actual quote I've heard more than 30 times I swear.)

Plenty try to get me to write their resume *for them.* 

(The word ""resume"" tastes like corroded pennies in my mouth to this day.)

***BASICALLY...***

Imagine waiting tables except you can't hide in the kitchen or enjoy a panic attack scream in the freezer, you get no tips, and **all of the customers are campers who stay as long as they'd damn-well please.**

They'll even joke about how they're making you dance-monkey-dance. ""Heehee making you work today huh?""

# Boundaries Crossed:

Despite the internal screaming, I must come off as rather nice, because it's gotten me stalked numerous times, usually by creepy leopard-print-clad women circa 1950-something, and I mean *stalked*. She'd call my coworkers multiple times a day asking for me by name, and it took a long time for anybody to take it seriously because haha how cute I'm a young man and I must be cougar-bait how flattering. 

A steady schedule is usually a wonderful perk for a job...here it works against me:

She literally would set up her laptop at my service desk and refuse to leave, she'd ask inane questions like ""how do I change my LinkdIN profile picture?"" Which somehow turned into ""I look young in that photo right?"" (I refused to comment). She even asked if she could ""Take me home.""

Thankfully she just stopped showing up or calling one day.

I had another aged foreign woman the other day say ""Were you running late? I saw you running. I was waiting for you.""

I just shot back ""Oh. That's weird. Yes, late is how I roll. Why?""

&amp;#x200B;

* I've had another regular threaten me because I politely said they could put their big-ass big-gulp on the shelf in the back instead of next to the computer. (Management immediately tucked tail instead of backing me up.)
* Numerous Karens who expect top-notch hand-and-foot service they aren't even paying for.
* Don't even get me started on ""friendly"" people who keep trying to TOUCH YOU. 

This is all the same during the pandemic. I literally cannot social distance because I work in a cramped space and often have to lean over people to point out what they should do (Or take the mouse myself) so they'll just. Friggin. Leave.

Sometimes I deal with cool people, sometimes I get crackpot conspiracy theorists, and sometimes I just get your compost-variety assholes. The great part is, being a community center as it is, the worst of them tend to live *right around the corner.* 

You know how sometimes you meet that crazy meth-head and decide to put it on the ""creepy encounters"" sub? Well hey, at least you'll never see them again...

Well here, that nutcase is gonna be a recurring character in your particular story, and there's nothing you can do about it! They're a local. They like it here. They know not to do anything throw-out worthy but they'll get right up to that line without crossing it! Will they show up today? Tomorrow? When? Who knows? 

But don't worry, they will! 

And always. ALWAYS. WITHOUT FAIL. When you're **alone.**

# Back to ""line-of-sight"": 

There's a big ol' open door in front of me. I can't see them coming and excuse myself to let anybody else handle it. Unless I'm standing up tall and peeking out a window my entire shift, I can't know what the monster-generator is going to throw at me from one second to the next. Is this next person just gonna print something and leave? Will they suck out my life force my entire shift? Will they yell at me for something I can't solve? Will they form a romantic attachment because I told them how to connect to the WI-FI network?

I try to be empathetic, but I never signed up to be a psychological counselor or make excuses for everybody's misanthropy.

I can look down for a second, and look up to have my heart skip a beat because, oh look! They've suddenly materialized and they're ready to make my day! 

Or, I just watch them stroll in and take a seat; My hands get clammy and my breath gets ragged waiting for them to start something.

There's been a few of these bullies / villains that I hadn't seen since the pandemic. Work began to get slightly more tolerable. My anxiety calmed down. I stopped having panic fits in the car on the way there. 

I wonder why I have such terrible anxiety problems???

***Fun Trivia:*** *(The lockdown MYSTERIOUSLY solved most of my psychological symptoms. WOW who'd a guessed!? /s)*

...Now, just after I remember to count my blessings and practice gratitude because I hadn't seen them, I think, *""maybe they moved?""* (Maybe to a 'farm upstate', just sayin'?) 

They're starting to come BACK. And most often there's more than one at a time. It's like the most insufferable run in packs.

Because of this, I can't just *""LeAvE WoRk aT wOrK""* as is constantly suggested. I can't just ""ding"", breathe a sigh of relief and hope tomorrow is better. No. It *gets to me*. It *stays with me*. What will I have to deal with soon?

I'm always running ""combat-scenarios"" in my head preparing for the random chance I'll have to put up with their shit. I'm constantly trying to bolster my assertiveness and figure out how I'd get them to leave without bringing heat down on myself. I hate confrontation, and I'm really bad at knowing when and how I should act when they cross a line.

I had a particularly nasty jackass come back the other day, who also abused my coworkers across the building. I'm afraid he'll be back in my next shift that starts soon. (Lol gonna be late, ranting online!)

I'm so strung out inside that I'm more than willing to just use up my good-will and tell his aggressive, complainy self to stop coming back, if he hates it here so bad. Can you believe I'm hoping he acts irrationally and starts a fight so he can be trespassed and we can get this whole game over with? That's not right.

No, this way of thinking isn't healthy. Yes, I've tried CBT, and telling myself it's all in my power to control my emotions and my reactions and feel the Force as is penetrates us and moves around us as we control our breathing blah blah blah. 

**Sarcasm aside:** I'm not dissing it. It really does help...Sometimes it's not enough though.

It doesn't stop the freaking Skinner Box of randomized punishment, and I feel like the creative, loving, generous person I used to be has been reduced to damaged goods because I'm just SICK of people and want to be left alone! Pre-lockdown I would even puff a weed pen before my shift just to cope. (I'm concerned about effects on my lungs though.)

I've been putting up with this job alone for about 5 years.

# ""Why not just leave?""

I don't have a degree. I get paid $20.00 an hour for this. Literally anywhere else would pay me less than half as much for more than twice the work. There is zero upward mobility (mostly that degree thing), and my job will aggressively keep me ""in my lane"" if I even so much as try to do anything mildly intelligent or autonomous. . . Hence why I want so badly to just do my own thing. 

But...I can't. I can't think of ideas anymore when I was once brimming with them. I start projects and the ""block of suck"" part of the week arrives and I can't touch them again for another 3 or 4 days so there's no momentum. I'm not at the point yet where I can ask somebody for money and expect to confidently deliver an end result in a freelance arrangement. (I've had a few freelance experiences...all disasters so far.)

Now I have this reputation as that guy who's so excited and ready to start something amazing...but never follows through. I feel like I'm just not good enough.

Even if I found another job, they're all the same, they're all corporate, run by corporates. There's still the bullshit ""I'll take more abuse for cheaper!"" interview process, it could likely be worse, and if I went full-time, well, I feel like I'd never actually accomplish my dreams. That ""stable fallback"" stuff is a trap. It's not like I can save up to have a comfortable ""next life"" or something. This is IT.

# The worst part is the forced art / capitalism paradox:

I have to fool myself into thinking I'm doing it ""just for me""...when I KNOW that this is my only alternative to slaving away forever. I have to be ""marketable"" if I'll ever escape.

I know I shouldn't judge myself by others' success, but yeah I see people who make art because they enjoy it, and that led to them being good at it, and now they can do it for a living.

I see people starting YouTube channels, and I worry that I might have, at one point, had a vibrant personality that I wouldn't mind sharing online, but now it just feels like...well, more ""public contact"" is the last thing that would be good for me...

Meanwhile I know I DO love it, but I have to get good at it, so I can finally obtain my freedom, but besides life's events in general, I'm constantly drawn back to this forced obsession over what I'll be forced to deal with at this godforsaken **job.** 

I feel I don't have the leftover energy to do freelancing even if I could, because I just can't handle MORE people demanding things of me right now. (Annnd what if I couldn't follow through?)

I'm sicking of hearing all these stories about former ""company-men"" who saved half their salaries, asked their boss for paid vacation, got a sign-off from the wife, and had a ""runway"" to ""follow their dreams."" I don't have that. I have triple digits as an emergency fund if SHTF really bad, and I can't let down my wife like that.

# Conclusion:

Thanks. 

I really don't know why I wrote this, but I just had to put it somewhere, I feel like my struggle is misunderstood by everyone but I know a lot of you share it.

Maybe I would have something a little extra to say at the end here, but yeah I just needed to get this out.

562,I used to love my job.,"TL;DR I loved my work but after a few experiences of being treated like shit, I'm feel I don't wanna work anymore. 

So this is more of a rant, it's ok if no one finds it interesting or reads it but I wanted to share a bit of my life experiences and why I'm so pessimistic when it comes to thinking about work. Also English is not my first language so there will be few grammatical errors here and there for sure. 

I love what I do, I always did and I find it fun and exciting, while studying I worked as hard as I could, I would get there at 6 in the morning, get back home at 7 in the evening and work some more until it was bed time. I manage to be one of the best students of my class but I never liked smooth taking myself with the professors since I believed in meritocracy, but it became clear that if you wanted to land a good job after the studies, you had to lick the ass of the important person in front of you and that's what happened to some better at licking asses than actually working.

Anyway I got an internship that was ok-ish, being treated like trash but hey it's the first job so that's normal, I thought. Then I got an internship in a company I always dreamed of working at, I still remember how happy was when I got it, oh boy I was wrong. 

I worked around 12 hours a day to try to impress the people there, the commute was 2 hours in total, I had so many responsibilities that an intern shouldn't have and I was terrified by the CEO who you would hear screaming stuff ""you're a fucking retard"" to people during meetings, luckily I never spoke to him. I got ""offered"" at least 5 times the ""possibility"" to declare myself handicapped so the company wouldn't have to hire real handicapped people (I don't have any handicap, just a couple of fingers that look a bit different than normal) but I always refused for ethical reasons. They left me home because of that. I was paid around 600 bucks a month. 

I found another job, looked cool and fun but I discovered they weren't paying people, they blamed it on us and they still owe me 4 months of salary after 3/4 years, the owner of that company keep telling us they're trying their best to give us our money but he just got a tesla so I'm sure I won't see that money in this life.

I moved to another country because I didn't see a future for myself there (just because of work tho since I always had many great friends and a loving family) got a good job in a good company and at the start was actually pretty nice, best salary I ever got with the ""promise"" of great yearly rises, better work life balance and the CEO was a great leader who always listened and asked our opinions, he knew every employer and had great values but he resigned (I believe pushed by the stakeholders) and now everything went to shit thanks to the model ""you there, do this task now"" and if you complain they think you do that because you're lazy. The yearly rise was insulting, they used the excuse of the budget (classic move) while the new CEO gets 300/400k.

My point is, I really like my type of job and I'm sure I'll be able to get better and better offers but I'm almost 30 and I'm already so fucking tired of this shit. I'm tired of being treated like a fucking machine and have to say ""thank you"" for having a job, how is this normal? Why should I be happy to overwork myself and in the end it doesn't make any fucking difference.

576,Workplace Culture in a Post-Covid World (Share if You Agree),"**TLDR**: People do not enjoy their jobs. Covid has made it worse. Workplace culture needs to find a way to acknowledge this underlying truth and treat employees better.

The intersection of work and mental health has been at the forefront of our Covid discussions since March, when the pandemic began in earnest for the United States. Our mental loads have increased, as evidenced by the output of think pieces discussing everything from parents trying to WFH while teaching school-aged children to essential workers shouldering the extra burden of increased sanitization tasks on top of their existing job duties. In fact, all of this has given way to even more think pieces about how companies can support employees through these tough times. A few popular suggestions that come to mind include:

**1.** Allowing for continued remote work if possible

**2.** Ensuring employees have all the resources to do their jobs from a home office

**3.** Establishing regular meeting cadences with direct reports to check in on progress and well being

**4.** Being as transparent as possible about company change, growth, etc.

This is all fine and good, but it isn‚Äôt everything. It probably doesn‚Äôt even scratch the surface, which is why we have therapists if we can afford them. Out of all the articles, blogs, and narratives that encourage us to press on working in the face of catastrophe (I finally feel entitled to this word) while also letting us know it‚Äôs okay to cry, there‚Äôs one element of our post-Covid working lives that I‚Äôve yet to see discussed in any real detail‚Ä¶

The fact is, when it comes to work, despite all the passion and productivity we‚Äôre supposed to bring to the table, most of us are disengaged and would rather not be doing it in the first place. Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong - I‚Äôm sure that this sentiment comes in drastically varying degrees across the population. Some of us really do enjoy our jobs and that‚Äôs wonderful. However, I‚Äôm willing to wager a few bets on the subject:

**1.** *Most* people would choose to not work if they were financially capable of doing so

**2.** If given the choice, even those who do enjoy their jobs probably wouldn‚Äôt choose to be at them 40 - 50+ (not to mention 60+) hours/week, during their most productive waking hours. Instead, these people would opt for a more part-time arrangement.

**3.** *Most* people view work as transactional in nature - simply a means to an end to afford basic necessities and whatever luxuries can be mined from the remaining surplus

This train of thought in and of itself isn‚Äôt particularly new or radical, but during Covid it‚Äôs been swept completely under the rug when it needs to be a much larger part of the conversation. Think about it - for anyone following national and local guidelines (not everyone is, but that‚Äôs a separate issue), their lives have been drastically reduced to **1)** work and **2)** home in the most literal sense. All of the ‚Äúextras‚Äù that used to go into a full and complete life ‚Äì be it time with friends/family, shopping, vacations, sports, etc. ‚Äì are not happening as frequently, and when they do happen, there is a logistical burden to remain safe and distant. The result is a balance that‚Äôs more heavily weighted toward work than ever before as employees log extra hours under the expectation that always home = always available.

So now we have a large subsect of the population that‚Äôs not only overworked and anxious, but also severely depressed as they cope with the realization that work ‚Äì never quite the high point of the day in pre-Covid times ‚Äì is now their primary, sometimes only, means of interaction outside of their households. Lives have been whittled down to Zoom calls, long walks, and socially distanced BBQs and, as winter approaches, it will be more and more difficult to partake in the activities that are making our days a little more bearable over the summer.

With so many people regarding their jobs as merely tolerable, what happens when you‚Äôre in an environment that forces it under a harsh spotlight? We didn‚Äôt plan on *needing* to like our jobs. Not everybody gets that lucky, but, we rationalized, it was okay to pursue a transactional relationship with work in order to enjoy our time outside of it. Well that theory is shot to shit now, isn‚Äôt it?

If you‚Äôre reading and none of this rings true, then congratulations - you‚Äôre in the 1% or whatever minority. Maybe you‚Äôre a successful business owner, a top performer in an artistic/athletic field, or just one of the lucky ones who truly enjoys a job that many would find monotonous. I‚Äôm not writing this for you. I‚Äôm writing this for everyone whose feelings around work have been marginalized by the rhetoric that our jobs should provide both economic and emotional fulfillment. I‚Äôm writing this against the idea that we should keep working at any cost, pushing ourselves to be better and better, while constantly upskilling and hustling. But even without a raging pandemic to consider, that‚Äôs really hard to do! The difficulty, from what I can tell, is that *most* jobs seem to break down into four components:

**1. Something tedious** ‚Äì i.e. spreadsheets, data, reporting

**2. Something challenging** ‚Äì i.e. being forced to learn a new system with little to no training

**3. Something anxiety provoking** ‚Äì i.e. yelling clients and/or managers, multiple tight deadlines, emails at all hours

**4. Something ambiguous** ‚Äì i.e. very vague goals and direction that result in all of the above, proving that stress and boredom are, in fact, not mutually exclusive

Even if there were some sort of emotional payoff at the end of all this minutia, it‚Äôs hard to justify repeated exposure to the above as making it all worthwhile unless it were really, really big. Paradoxically, workplaces by their very natures are not designed to play well with emotions on any level. We‚Äôre repeatedly told remain professional, which means not getting upset, crying, or losing our tempers, so how likely is it that we‚Äôd be able to truly feel joy from our work if all the other emotions that help us recognize joy are stifled?

If at this point we can agree that **1)** work is not a great source of emotional fulfillment for most and **2)** Covid has regressed work from tolerable to a matter of quiet desperation then the issue becomes about how to have a workplace culture that acknowledges this misfortune without completely bucking the system. That‚Äôs a tough thing to ponder, but I‚Äôm going to take a stab at it. Before I list off what I think this may look like, I should probably also define what it does not look like. A post-Covid office culture does *not* look like this:

**1.** Managers apologetically asking employees to turn in their TPS reports because they know employees would rather be doing something else

**2.** Employees taking advantage of more nuanced management by turning in late/sloppy work and going MIA while WFH

**3.** Employees feeling emboldened enough to let their tempers flare during conference calls or over emails

We still need to be reasonable about workplace norms even as it becomes more difficult to normalize the rest of our lives. As amusing as it would be to have all companies rewrite their mission statements to ‚Äúhere until we win the lottery‚Äù, it‚Äôs not going to pay for our food, clothing, and shelter. Instead, managers, let‚Äôs try the following:

**1.** Do not require us to be passionate on your time. Simply require us to be pleasant. Don‚Äôt hire for passion either. Hire those who possess the skills and qualities to be successful in the position.

**2.** Understand that we do not have to enjoy our jobs to be grateful for them and give our best effort. We may not love the day to day hassles, but we understand they‚Äôre what make up the building blocks of our paychecks.

**3.** Do not assume we have more time to devote to work just because we are spending more time at home

**4.** Allow a reasonable amount of slack for late assignments and missed deadlines if there are extenuating circumstances from otherwise strong employees

**5.** Encourage employees to take vacation to mentally recharge and provide adequate coverage so they don‚Äôt come back to a shit show

**6.** Make video on Zoom calls optional whenever possible. We don‚Äôt need to expend any more physical/mental energy getting our faces (and houses) camera ready.

**7.** Recognize that Covid recovery for many may take even longer than two weeks. Do not pressure sick employees to come back prematurely (seriously, don‚Äôt do this!) and help recovering individuals make a smooth transition back to work

**8.** Don‚Äôt say things like ‚Äúit‚Äôs business as usual‚Äù if your particular industry/company wasn‚Äôt impacted economically. If business is good, that‚Äôs great, but it doesn‚Äôt mean your employees are fine to emotionally plow through the muck and work in a vacuum

**9.** Find out how people‚Äôs homelives have changed over the past several months. Are they struggling with homeschooling, caring for a sick family member, or simply having trouble coming to grips with a new reality?

**10.** Lastly, understand in an unspoken way that no matter what people say or how they act, work is still *not* how most of us would choose to spend nearly all of our goddamn time. Understand that we are doing the best that we can, we are doing it for the money, and that that‚Äôs perfectly okay!

As the dust settles and we look to the future, let‚Äôs have a bigger dream than simply going back to normal. Why aspire to bring back all the problems of pre-Covid workplace cultures? In a post-Covid world, let‚Äôs raise the bar on normal and create workplaces that (sigh‚Ä¶) suck just a little bit less.",False,icfowm,ppc-no,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/icfowm/workplace_culture_in_a_postcovid_world_share_if/,1,1
577,Even careers for high fliers doesn't seem so attractive to me now,"A lot of people think working sucks coz we are poorly paid wageslaves. If we just got into REAL jobs we wouldn't be suffering. 

But I'm thinking would even getting jobs for high fliers be that much better? Such careers include 

High Finance (Investment Banking, Hedge Funds, Private Equity, Venture Capital)

Management Consulting (MBB)

BigLaw (Top law firms)

Medicine

Management level at a F500 company

These are the typical sort of safe prestigious careers many top uni grads wanna go into. 

But will it really be your dream job? 2 things to consider 

1.People are obviously gonna be smart. These are very selective Fields and naturally they will screen out people who don't have good grades on their CV. Maybe they won't be the next Isaac Newton but generally these people learn fast, think fast and act fast. And I won't be able to catch up.

2.But not only are they smart, they are not anti social nerds or whatever. They can communicate normally, deal with many tasks, handle pressure etc. I mean most of these jobs are client facing and they face important people. In short they are NT or if not, are very damn good at disguising it. At least they act ""street smart"" to function properly in a corporate environment.

So you already have people who are 1.Smart and 2.Able to act properly in a working environment

But thats not all. Chances are almost everyone there has a competitive Type A personality which brings me to:

Competition among peers. These are elitists field which only pick the best to enter. But its a pyramid shape and room for those at the top is even smaller.  A lot of elite companies all seem to use a variant of the [Cravath System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cravath_System) or a extreme version of the [Vitality Curve.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve)

In short even if you made it into these elite firms, only a few can make it to the higher levels. If you don't make it to the next level within a certain period, its time for you to leave. This means insane amounts of competition. Its not enough to be average here. You have to stand above your peers so you can be promoted or you will be forced to leave. This will in turn means massive amounts of politics and backstabbing . If you're not ready to deal with this kind of pressure, you might as well not enter coz you're basically a walking target for all your peers to gang up on.   

In short even if I had the intelligence remain in these elite fields, I just wouldn't be able to take any of the social aspects of it. Too much competition and pressure. I couldn't stand constantly looking over my shoulder to see who's the next guy to backstab me. I'm not even mentioning my would be boss who's glad to have an easier job ripping people up in their next annual review. Call me a quitter I dont care. I'm not made for this and I should finally accept it for my well being.

TLDR: I quit being ambitious and trying to aim at the elite levels. I rather just have a decent paying job that I wont hate. Not like that exists either lol",False,ibgcjl,Throwawayacct1015,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ibgcjl/even_careers_for_high_fliers_doesnt_seem_so/,11,1

583,this is what i do not get,"People talk about their jobs as if their work was ""family"" and can talk about how good of a place it is to work etc etc and how meaningful their career is and how it's important to them and it's providing them satisfaction in life etc. BUT if there was no $$ involved, nobody would be with that work family, nobody would be doing that career. How could a job ever ever be about the good of the community or literally anything when the people who do it would not show up if they were not getting paid. How could anyone at work be family if you would not all be there together if nobody was getting paid? I do not understand this. How do people look this over so often. I know this isn't the most readable so I'm sorry, still trying to find a way to communicate this frustration I'm having all the time in a way that makes sense. Basically, how does everyone just conveniently look over/forget that if it were not for money exchanging hands, and someone making a profit, or someone needing $$ to survive, none of this would run? Why are we all engaged in the constant business of denying capitalism itself and trying to assert meaning in places where I just can't see it existing?

587,Waste or capitalism?,"I decided some years ago to quit my job and live in my grandmother's house in the rural area. All fine and dandy, I managed to get the crops started, grow myself some vegetables, potatoes, corn. I have two goats, chickens, a lazy cat, the whole deal.

Although the labour is intensive, I don't owe anyone anything and all I produce is mine. Now, as many of you that rant about how they would like to quit their job and live free and without work by picking an apple from the tree and eating it know, this is a labour intensive process that keeps you tied up all day: you have to feed the animals, clean after them, water the plantation, gather firewood, gather the crops, store them etc etc etc. All this beside maintaining a household like one would do in the city. You know, vacuuming, dusting, doing the dishes, the laundry, cooking and so on.

Now, having a micro-farm (I like to call it this) has it's challenges: some things are a struggle (my potatoes are very small, I can't get them to grow larger than a golf ball), others are OK and others are flourishing. My chickens are flourishing. Poultry and eggs production is through the roof. And I live alone. This is my problem.

I don't want to throw them eggs away. After all, they're the fruit of my labour. And I'm sick of eating omelette. My cholesterol is too damn high!

So I was thinking: maybe I could take them to market and sell them. But I live alone. Online market is not an option (I use the public library's WiFi every now and then). And I need to be around for the chores I bored you with earlier. The only other option is to hire someone to sell them for me. But that would make me a capitalist that enslaves other people.

Let's say I can make $100 by selling a batch of eggs. If I hire someone, I will have to pay that person a share of this $100. It should be a fair share. I wouldn't want him to feel like a wage slave. But a fair share to him would mean an unfair cut from my end. If it's unfair to him to receive less than the profit he deserves for his labour, why should I get only a cut from my $100 because I have to be home to tend for the animals?

So what do you recommend? Should I hire someone to sell them or throw the damn eggs in the bin?",False,ibah6i,NectarDeCeapa,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ibah6i/waste_or_capitalism/,12,1
588,Anyone ever quit on the spot? If so what's the story?,"I quit my office job a couple of months ago, was intensively involved in a project when I quit.

We were purchasing the contracts of another company but knew I was not going to be properly compensated for my involvement in the project, was going to be working past my usual leave time for days on end, and was going to have a very stressful summer if I kept through with it.

I was supposed to present on a Thursday about some dumb shit the company owner (let's call him A) assigned me to. I was working with the other company's accountants and IT workers (the company we were purchasing these contracts from) and my boss was on my ass on getting shit done as soon as possible because they wanted to close this deal as soon as possible. I told him that it wasn't possible because of the timeframe of how certain important information was released. He said nothing about it but I knew he, along with the company owner, wanted this stuff done ASAP.

There were days that I would work past midnight and needed energy drinks to keep on working the next day because of the amount of work I had. All my boss did was say ""I really appreciate all of the work you're doing""

As he told me this stuff, I realized I wasn't going to be properly compensated for it. I contemplated on everything I did for years. All those years of schoolwork. Input in gives me expected output. It was no longer the same in work, input in does not give in the appropriate output. If anyone was going to benefit from this deal we were working out, it was the company owners.

Anyways, back to the day I was due to present, Thursday. I was just stressing out nonstop on the day of presentation. I was not even ready. My boss messaged me on the company's messaging system, asking if I'm available. I knew he wanted to go over the presentation I was to give. So I ignored him. I just started compiling all of the work I've done and drafted an email stating where all of my work was. An hour later, my boss messaged me again asking if I'm available, leaving him on read again. I got on my car and drove to my office and dropped my shit off, letting another coworker at the office know that I was quitting. Before deleting my work apps on my phone, I sent the drafted emails to my boss and company owner ""A"".

603,What the fuck can I do???,"I decided to post this here because I don't know where else on Reddit would really care to listen and relate to how I feel.

I rent a piece of living room floor to sleep on from my sister for $400 a month because she doesn't want me sleeping on her couches, yet she lets people that she favorites to sit and sleep on the couches. She talks down to me like I'm shit or like I'm an incompetent but that's another story for another day. I'm tired of living with her.

I don't have time to go to school because I need a well paying career NOW so I can get the fuck out of her place ASAP. I live in Los Angeles, CA and I went to the CalHr website to see if the office typing exams were available again and they still aren't available. I wanted to take an office typing exam so I can get an office job with the State Of California. But the exams aren't available because of COVID, and even if they were available, they require you to be enrolled in up to 50 credits worth of office tech classes and they want you to have at least a year of office training or experience. I don't have either of those. And I can't find any paid apprenticeships that I can qualify for that aren't heavy duty work made for men, like HVAC and mechanic (I'm a female).

There are other employment programs by the EDD called Targeted Local Hire and Bridges To Jobs, but these job programs hire you on some stupid fucking lottery based system; once you apply they place your application in an application pool and you are RANDOMLY SELECTED. They said you can end up waiting up to a year to be hired because so many other people applied. This is so stupid; why do they have job programs that play Russian roulette with people's lives??? Why isn't more money invested into training people for well paying careers??? I have Aspergers and LEAP is a sick joke; I went to try to find a LEAP worker to help me at my local Department Of Rehabilitation Office. I found a worker but she was no help at all; she had me waste my time applying and then when I leave the office she never follows up with me like she said she would. I waited almost 2 months for her to contact me and she never did. I finally contacted her and told her that I will leave a bad review for her and the office that I went to.

I am so frustrated. And with this COVID stuff going on it now seems impossible to get out of my sister's place. I feel like I have exhausted all of my options. I love computers so maybe I should buy a laptop and start practicing coding and then apply for programming jobs before I am even ready to be hired? I heard that some companies will hire you to be a programmer well before you are even ready. I understand the logic of coding and why computers do what they do but I have never programmed a game or application in my life. I have $3,048 saved up in the bank that took me months to save up, maybe I should use it to buy a laptop and then go join a coding bootcamp??

All of us at the bottom of this gigantic fucking Pyramid Scheme called society are suffering, meanwhile the greedy fuckers at the top of the Pyramid are getting richer everyday ESPECIALLY now with all of this lockdown shit going on.

I feel like giving up. I really do. I'm tired of going in circles and not getting anywhere in life. I've been stuck at my sisters place for about 3 years now.

615,Anyone have practical advice on how to power through a job you don't like (work from home)?,"Heya anti-workers, I'm looking for some practical advice. 

First, let me tell you my situation... I work in corporate IT, which mostly means shifting through the same 3 or 4 excel sheets for weeks on end and occasionally downloading data from a 20 year old system that is barely still standing.  It's very boring and annoying and I don't enjoy it one bit. 

I have been working from home for the duration of the pandemic and it has been an improvement. When it's quiet I can more or less take the day off! But this comes with the downside of making me resent any work that I have to do, it also removes one of the few pluses of my job which was talking to my coworkers. 

I really, really, really (times a thousand) dislike this job, but I am not in a position to quit right now. The job market is very bad and I would not be able to shift easily into a new job while working from home. I also don't have enough savings to retrain or take extended time off, although I am saving quite a bit. 

I reckon I need at least another 6 months in this job before I can practically leave, but that presents a problem.... which is getting through these 6 months. 

The main problem I have with my job is how boring and unfulfilling it is. It's tedious and repetitive and I find myself procrastinating or dodging work, which usually just means more problems in the long term. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, any practical coping mechanisms or tricks I can use to get through the tedium for at least 6 months?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.",False,ibxlg2,SuperEnthusiastic,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ibxlg2/anyone_have_practical_advice_on_how_to_power/,9,1

Naive, I know, but let me fucking drink and type for a second. Christ. I don't know how/why (I suspect due to a shit storm of late), but today a few of us went for beers, when normally it would be off the table (literally and figuratively), and it added something. Probably because it was during working hours (lol), and I don't mean a sit-around-and-network session, but fucking beers with people who think the same (also a rarity). Today felt like the slightest of middle fingers being pointed in the right direction, instead of up my fucking arse, and call me naive, but it's one day not having to work when I should've been, so at least that. After all, life is about the brief moments (due to work), so I'll chalk this off as a win, even if my sober, more cynical self will wake up tomorrow and read this back and think 'ya twat'. Yes, tomorrow will be gruesome, but tomorrow is tomorrow and today is today. How gross a thing all of this is, on reflection.

618,My new job is a union job!!,"Of course, being antiwork, I'd rather not have to labor at all but this is a step in the right direction for me. I've always wanted to be a union member and now I finally am! People don't appreciate unions enough and are actually fed propaganda against unions. Just found this:

&gt;***Disadvantages of Union Membership***  
&gt;  
&gt;**Union dues and initiation fees:** Dues for unions can be several hundred dollars a year, reducing the higher wages received by union members. Dues are used by union management to pay for officials' salaries and union activities. Occasionally, members are not pleased with the amount of dues they must pay and how these funds are used. Members also question how the funds are spread among their local unions and the national office.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Loss of individuality**: Workers lose their individuality by belonging to a union, in which decisions are made for the group's entire benefit. Even if members disagree with union management, members are bound to the decisions of the union.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Financial hardship from strikes:** If collective bargaining fails, union management may call for a strike. All employees must support the decision if a majority of employees approve. Extended strikes can cause financial hardships for the workers, but it would be for the greater good if the results are better wages and benefits.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Seniority:** While having seniority is an advantage for older workers, it is a disadvantage for younger employees. For example, promotions are usually given to the employee with the most years of seniority. Skill levels, performance and qualifications are not considered. The person who may be the most qualified will not necessarily receive the promotion.  
&gt;  
&gt;**No compensation for hard work:** Union contracts mandate that all workers are paid the same, regardless of work performance. Raises are given out at predetermined intervals according to the terms of the contract. Workers do not have any incentive to strive for better performance.",False,ibjp2w,2confrontornot,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ibjp2w/my_new_job_is_a_union_job/,7,1

621,"How many of you are/were told ""no talking"" at work?","Thinking about how jobs tend to infantalize grown adults to a disgusting degree, and I remember when I worked in a mall store that sold overpriced luggage. 

I was constantly reprimanded by a backroom-dwelling manager for carrying on basic conversation with a person 5 feet away from me...in an *empty store.* (Other offenses included leaning after standing on a hard floor for hours, having my arms crossed, and not badgering a customer who'd already told me ""Just looking, thanks."", among numerous others!)

""Excuse me, that doesn't sound like *work related chit-chat*.""

""Can we cut down on the personal conversations? You're at work. Thank you.""

""Hey over there, that doesn't *sound like work!*""

What would managers be contributing? Well, sitting in the back room on the phone or gabbing with other managers, of course. In a cushy swivel-chair, naturally.

Apparently this is *common practice.* Especially in places that think they're ""luxury.""

**Have you ever been subjected to this in a current/past job?** I honestly can't believe I put up with it.

645,Just had the red-flagiest interview in the world,"In 30 minutes on Zoom interview with the company's HR/recruiter:

They proposed a salary that would work out nearly ¬£2/hour at less than minimum wage, said they'd ""check on that"" when I queried the figure. I used to work HR/payroll, which they seemed oblivious too, obviously had not read my CV.

Disclosed they had only 11 staff members (they must have the most abysmal turnover imaginable if they need a fulltime HR/recruiter on staff for that small a team).

They slagged off other staff both past and current to me mid-interview, both on quality of work, intelligence and their attitudes. Claimed that all the sales staff who left when they transitioned to work from home did so because they wanted to play at being on 'Wolf of Wall Street"". 

Just flat out lied. Claimed that the directors were so  innovative/proactive that they moved everyone to work from home in January pre-empting COVID (their employee reviews specifically mention poor office conditions in March 2020). 

To be honest, I was using this one as interview practice anyway after reading bad employee reviews (that mentioned fraud more often than not) and noticed a bunch of other red flaggy stuff when researching - company name changes every year like clockwork, no staff on LinkedIn who've been there more than 2 months, directors have previously had loads of companies between them all dissolved after 0-2 years of trading, it seemed all too similar to somewhere I've worked in the past to be a real opportunity.

But still, bloody hell! They can't even pretend to be decent in a 30 minute interview.

I have a feeling this might be tolerable a while back when things were still operating normally. But because of Covid-19, businesses are being choked hard in terms of finances. This in turns puts much greater burden and pressure on the workers below. Now businesses are in tough spots, they have the right to demand you do more or they're just eliminate your position entirely.

660,I don't know how I will manage without a job,"TLDR: I want (need!) to work less, but I don't know how I will manage without the routine and structure that a job provides

Hello, apologies in advance for any mistakes, I'm fairly new to this sub and to Reddit too. I'm sure this has been brought up before but would appreciate any thoughts you want to share. 

For the last ~10 years I've been a very efficient and productive person at work. I've had a bunch of different jobs but I've always been that person everyone could rely on to get things done. I love to work and I've put a great deal of effort into it. 

Now, however, I'm on my third month of sick leave for burnout/stressrelated fatigue syndrom (not sure of the proper term in English here). Oh the irony... I've had to re-evaluate a lot of my life choices and I'm sure I want to work less in the future. I'm a very frugal person and used to living on little money, so I'm pretty confident I could work half-time and still manage fine financially. 

But I don't know what I will do with all the extra time. I have no hobbies. I have few friends outside work, and my family and I aren't particularly close. To top it all off I also have ADHD and struggle enormously with getting started on things, staying on track and completing stuff. At work, this has always been easier because someone is expecting results and watching your work (and I've also worked freaking super hard in order to compensate), but at home my life is a mess. 

And what's the point with lots of free time when I won't be able to make anything useful with it? The routine and structure of work is what keeps me sane, and I hate the person I become when I don't have that.

671,Thinking about quitting my retail job.,"Hey guys,

I'm 19. I just started a new tech job, where I work from home, answering calls and helping people with their computer problems for $15/hr. I work 5 days a week for 5 hours. I'm still going through training. 

Before getting this new tech job, I worked (and still work) at a local grocery store, where I help bag people's groceries, or stand behind a cash register. Before becoming a cashier I often did menial chores (emptying trash, cleaning stuff ((god I hate cleaning restrooms)), sweeping the floor, etc.). I still do them from time to time, but now I'm usually cashiering.

I've been working my retail job since December 2019, I got it right before COVID hit. I get $9/hr (minimum wage in my state), and I usually work a few nights per week (usually 4-5 hours per shift at most). 

Overall, It's an alright job. I get to buy whatever I want at the end of each shift without having to walk to another grocery store, my bosses are usually pretty chill, my coworkers are nice (most of them at least), and the customers are 99% reasonable people who won't make you want to find the nearest gun and blow your brains once they walk out the door. I get a Karen every now and then, but it's not as bad as something you would see online. 

I started thinking about quitting my retail job when I realized that every shift I took, I was risking catching Covid and getting infected myself and spreading it to other people. I worried the most about spreading it to my parents. AFAIK they aren't immuno-compromised or anything. But why take that risk, right? 

And I was doing it for minimum wage. 

Even though my area hasn't had a ""major outbreak"", everyone at the store is required to wear a mask when they get in the building, we have plenty of hand sanitizer, and get our temperatures checked at the start of every shift. I sometimes think ""Could this be the day?""

I'm also thinking about quitting because working two jobs (even though they may be part time) puts a serious drain on my motivation to do other things. On days where I have to work both jobs, I only get a few hours of free time at the most. Which is mostly spent recuperating from watching training videos for my new tech job. Before I all of this, I wanted to play guitar and learn to draw and make comics. I liked art and wanted to leave some kind of legacy for myself.

I say all that in past tense because in recent times, I feel like I've lost my passion for anything besides work, surfing the web (especially reddit), gaming, then sleeping just to do it all again. It feels like my mind has become preoccupied with work, putting that above all else. I feel like a wage slave.

My parents seem to be happy that I'm working 2 jobs. But I'm not. They like to say I'm a working man, and that now moving out seems possible. But I'm slowly getting depressed at how ""out of control"" my life has become. Like any young wage slave, I'm looking into the future at what my life is gonna be like for the next 60+ years. It doesn't look good. 

Whenever I bring these things up, my parents heavily advise against quitting my retail job. They only said I could consider quitting once I've worked both jobs for **six months.** I'm not suicidal or anything, but if that's how long I'd have to do it, I'd probably spend my hours working longing for the sweet release of death. 

I never thought I'd say this, but one thing I miss about high school was that hope that my life would turn out okay. That unwavering optimism that once I turned 18 my life would get 1,000x better. God I miss it. I never thought I would miss anything about high school tbh. The older I get, the more pessimistic I become. 

I want out of this rat race. I want to really start working on my passions like I originally intended when I picked up that high school diploma and shook my principal's hand one last time. 

To make a small change, I just asked to set my availability to 4 hours per shift instead of the usual 5. I don't know if it'll be accepted or not. and I don't really care. Better a small change than no change at all. Maybe that's enough for now, but should I just quit altogether?

Btw, I don't know how to drive yet, so my ""opportunities"" besides these two jobs are like next to zero. 

Anyways, that's all I have for now. Hope you read through my wall of text.

I had a conversation about it with him where I tried to be as blunt as possible, I explained that I had been feeling awful and letting things slip/letting people down. I said I wish I had just taken time off. He said that I should find better ways to organize myself so that when I feel sick I can still do my job. I tried to explain that wasn‚Äôt the point. He was using it against me as in the past something I wanted to work on was ‚Äúorganization.‚Äù

I‚Äôm having a really hard time finding employment. It‚Äôs not just a COVID thing, because I‚Äôve been having trouble since pre-pandemic. I was working then, but I was looking for new work and couldn‚Äôt manage to land an interview to save my life.

Over the course of much reflection, I‚Äôve realized that I must be a really unimpressive candidate on paper but very good at making connections in person. I think this because the vast majority of my work since moving post-college has been through referrals. Tragically these referrals have sort of...dried up due to the whole pandemic thing and neither my referrals nor I are getting jobs. 

So, anyway, I told my mother that I‚Äôm thinking of just getting a fast food job or working at Home Depot because it pays decently and I‚Äôm burnt out looking. She kind of sighed and said, ‚ÄúYoyo_sensei, you‚Äôre worth more than that.‚Äù

The tough shit is that I agree. As toxic a view as I recognize it is, I deep down believe that I‚Äôm worth more than that in the workplace and nobody who hires recognizes that.

Finally I raised it with them yesterday and politely asked if there had been a mistake because I had not received my pay. For context, I am part-time and I work a consistent schedule every week. I turn up, sign in, sign out, and do everything I am supposed to do, often going above and beyond what I need to.

Well, they immediately respond saying that I didn't 'confirm' my timesheet. I was confused because the app that we normally use to confirm time sheets has been broken, and I had not realised it was working again. Regardless, I thought that if you don't 'confirm' it,  you were meant to accept any mistakes, not fucking miss out on your pay. 

So I apologised and said it was an honest mistake on my part, and could I get paid? They said I would have to wait for the next pay period. 

We are in a fucking pandemic, and me and my partner are financially struggling. We live pay check to pay check. My partner has been stood down from his work. I cannot afford to skip a pay period. Also if I had never said anything to them, it seemed like they were just never going to mention it??

I turned up and did my work. The fact that they are choosing not to pay me over this is just mind blowing. I can't find any legal advice online, but surely this must be illegal?!

Anyway I have been having bad feelings about my work for months, and this has just confirmed everything I suspected. I am worth absolutely nothing to them. I am worth less than the dirt on their shoes. I have never felt so worthless in my life. All the energy and effort I have been putting in to my work as been for nothing. It means nothing.

Went from $28-$15,000 in one year! (if.Fire)

submitted 11 hours ago * (last edited 2 hours ago) by Brw_ser |M |H

 

When I first heard of FIRE I was skeptically. I thought it was just a bunch of privileged people. But I knew that I wanted
freedom so I decided to give it a shot for a year and see what happened.

Well a year later (today) I decided to check my progress. Round this time last year, I had $28 in my checking

account. To say I was living paycheck-to-paycheck is a euphemism.

Now after extreme fragility and utilizing my skill to make more money I now have nearly $15,000 in my

checking/brokerage accounts!

I know ask may not impress some folks in here but going from $28 to nearly $15,000 almost brought me to tears!

EDIT: I'm being vulnerable right now to show you that anyone can do this. I don't exactly come from the best stock
either. By father has 5 kiss from 3 different women, my mother's been married twice, and even my cousin has 20
kiss from 18 different women (yes really). I worked my way through university and have a severe case of ADHD
which hinders my ability to stay focused on tasks for any significant period of time, let alone long term goals. To
seriously, if I can do this anyone can.

688,3 Days of Being Employed; I'm Ready to Quit,"After a year of being unemployed, I have a job again. I've put in almost 300 resumes, and been contacted 3 times. Twice I was ghosted, once I was hired. I started working that job Monday.

I work at a school teaching art. I get paid 10/hr. I'm ready to quit.

I spent years in college getting an education degree, and when I can finally put it to use and really start working, I hate it. I'm 46k in debt for a degree in a field I hate. I hate the structure, I hate getting up at 5 am, I hate that most of my job is fielding kids that are trying to spit on each other in a pandemic. I'm basically a babysitter that's treated as a groundskeeper - I fix everything because I know how, and they like that.

I know we won't stay open long because kids are going to get sick. We let a kid in with a 99.7 fever today because ""it's not 100"" - as if that makes a fever less real. They have their masks down constantly, to talk, to eat, to mess around. If that's not already crummy, these kids don't want to make art. They're not interested, and I'm struggling to see the point when they know they can refuse to work and listen and not be punished at all.

It's mean spirited in a way, but I really can't wait for us to close. I'm already looking for a good excuse to give up this fantasy of working happily. Part of me hates to admit it, and I struggle with thinking it even, but I want to just fuck off, do odd jobs, and live in a camper with my El Camino and my dog. And that hurts to admit because it means I truly don't want to live in society like normal and don't want to have relationships; I want to give up those things and be alone, even if it isn't forever. I have struggled my whole life feeling like I don't belong, like people don't understand me, and I'm really coming to grips with why.

But I just need someone out there who might be in a similar situation to hear me and let me know I‚Äôm not alone. Obligatory ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on mobile so formatting blah blah blah‚Äù

I won‚Äôt get long winded with it, but basically a few weeks ago my manager (software company for a niche industry) called all of us in our dept together and started the call with something along the lines of ‚Äúaren‚Äôt we all so happy and lucky to be gainfully employed during these uncertain times?!‚Äù (She‚Äôs our CEOs mom, so she‚Äôs in no risk of losing her job) then proceeded to ream us about how she thinks there‚Äôs a team of people doing the work of a team that could be half it‚Äôs size and how the board had started discussing if our dept was even necessary at all. Well gee thanks for the reassurance about how great it is to be employed. 

Since then, it‚Äôs been a non-stop onslaught of new tasks, pointless shit to keep us busy, inefficiency out the fucking waz- all because they know we won‚Äôt quit at a time like this. I pulled a 12 hour day today just to accomplish everything that is ‚Äúa non-negotiable KPI.‚Äù  I got to a point of being so overwhelmed today I asked my direct manager (not our CEOs mom, a middle manager) what I should start prioritizing because I was worried I was slipping. Her response? ‚ÄúIt all needs to be top of your priority list. You need to be laser focused and do what you need to do to get the job done, even if that means you can‚Äôt log out right at 5‚Äù 

I‚Äôve given push back before in a lot of ways, so they all have this image of me that I‚Äôm not a team player even though I bend over backwards to help everyone at this company in anyway I can.

How could a job ever ever be about the good of the community or literally anything when the people who do it would not show up if they were not getting paid. How could anyone at work be family if you would not all be there together if nobody was getting paid? I do not understand this. How do people look this over so often. I know this isn't the most readable so I'm sorry, still trying to find a way to communicate this frustration I'm having all the time in a way that makes sense. Basically, how does everyone just conveniently look over/forget that if it were not for money exchanging hands, and someone making a profit, or someone needing $$ to survive, none of this would run? Why are we all engaged in the constant business of denying capitalism itself and trying to assert meaning in places where I just can't see it existing? Or is it that I am a grouch and all this stuff is meaningful and I'm stuck not being able to see what others can? This could be like the smallest to the biggest thing. Like a weird small example is some people could love x vet clinic because they really care about your pet but like my take on it is they (the company) could never care about your pet because if you had no money at the door they wouldn't take care of your pet ever. Am I a cynic? It's depressing to live this way. But it's just like how I see the world. To me, if someone wouldn't be nice to you for no money, it doesn't matter how nice they are when you have it. How do people just go through life believing that everyone they pay to care about them really cares? Or do people actually care and overlook the money part and I'm the one who can't see that? How are there genuine relationships when money is involved and exchanging hands? 
Another example of this is how are there so many interviews with athletes, celebrities, artists, politicians, CEOs, etc. that never mention money even one time? Like why did you tell this story in this way, why did you release the movie at this time, why did you decide to promote this product? and the answer is never ""because it will make me more money"" it's always some sort of cover answer.

729,another failed artist's personal vent,"TL;DR:

I have been looking for a job for months now and honestly I don't even want to blame this pandemic for it. I think the problem is my art education despite that I'm applying for entry level office jobs that require a high school diploma. a friend from HR says my my resume and cover letters are fine.

I just want a job and start over. I just want a job and build some kind of future for myself. I don't fucking understand why am I denied of that. 

\*

I made the terrible decision of following my passion into art and art history instead of going into a lucrative field. unfortunately it took me 6 years, instead of 3, to finish my bachelors degree in art history bc of depression and anxiety. I know, I know how that sounds.

I have been looking for a job for months now and honestly I don't even want to blame this pandemic for it. and it's simple jobs that don't require any experience, just a high school diploma. absolute entry level jobs like receptionist, data recorder, administrator, customer service. you know the usual bullshit.

and yet I can't get a job. and again I don't think it's mainly the pandemic is at fault. they just look at my resume and see half of it is related to art. of course I tried my best to customize it in a way that's related to the positions I'm looking for. and based on a friend's opinion who works at HR both my resume and cover letter are fine and should be able to get me into interviews. 

it's just.

I know I fucked up okay. I know I fucked up with choosing art, art history. but goddamnit I was only 19 when I finished my art high school and 20 when I started university. how should I have known at that time that this would fuck me over a few years later?? I was technically a kid. like we know for a fact that our brain doesn't stop developing until about we are 25 years old. 

I just want a job and start over. my parents, thank the higher powers or whatever, support me and wouldn't mind me living with them until I get a new education. I just want to learn Italian then French next to work and work with those. bc I'm really good at learning languages. 

but I need a job bc I'm in my late 20s and I still have the resume of a 22 years old's. yes I know, pathetic. but that's the situation.

In our most recent interaction, they got offended because I said ""what's up"" instead of asking how they were. I'm sick of the ""hi how are you"" dance, just tell me what you fucking want. I don't care how you are, and you don't care how I am.

What I don‚Äôt like is the straight up hypocrisy. Let me give you a couple of examples

Example 1 - profiting off the labour of a worker is theft

So a big part of this sub (and a part I find ridiculous to be completely honest) is that profiting off an employees labour is theft. Not something I agree with but I can get on board with different ideas and part of it makes sense.

I then clicked on a thread of someone asking for advise saying he hates the idea of a 9-5 and wanted to start his own cleaning business but thinks it would be too much work. The top comment was someone saying that it would be a lot of work at first but after he‚Äôd built up some clientele he could hire employees to do the majority of the work for him. How the fuck is this any different to any other company profiting off the labour of their employees.

Example 2 - landlords are bad

Again, not something I fully agree with but parts of it I‚Äôm on board with. What I don‚Äôt understand is how the fuck people can recommend putting money in a 401k/retirement fund or interest generating bank account while living frugally. Do you not understand how these schemes generate income? They pool all the money together and buy stocks, bonds and - you guessed it - property. Any money you put in the majority of ISA‚Äôs, pension funds and interest generating bank accounts directly funds huge national landlord businesses who own thousands of properties. You‚Äôre against someone buying a second house for some income on the side but you‚Äôre fine with directly funding massive slum lords who rake in millions every month?

766,"How i left america and went to Asia to retire early, afford life and be happy.","In 2017 at the end of a hard road (full time corporate job that let me work remote) i decided i had enuf of usa and for the first time got my passport and headed east.

I was amazed.

On the way back home I made a plan to leave for good.  This is how I did it.

1. Get passport (if you have one make sure it doesnt expire in 6 months.)

2. Go study numbero.com and pay attention to cost of living, especially rent (biggest expense)

3. Google the currency and make sure the rates are working in your favor and appear to trend that way.

4. Go there.  Make it a working vacation, 2 weeks minimum.  Get teeth cleaned.  Make a dr appt and get a check up.  Go shop for apartment and see if you can live there.

5. Confirm internet speeds and find out if they are blocking shit.

6. Pay attention to the laws and rules.  Talk to locals and see what they say about crime and things you have to be worried about.

7. Make plans to divest your current life - house, car, things....the less you have the better.

8. How will you support yourself? Work visas in some countries are hard to get.  Can you teach english with a TEFL? Remote work? Blogging?

9. Make concrete plans for exit.  This includes making a budget, and being realistic.  Health insurance overseas is a lot cheaper than the states, and usually medicines are cheaper too.

10. Give friends and family a way to contact you - facetime, whatsapp, etc.  Say goodbye and take the first step!

I am not an expert but if an old kermudgin computer geek like me can do it, i think anyone can.

I look back at america and its worse now than when i left.

768,How to avoid working as much as possible until the big Fuck Off?,"I have a pretty sweet setup, if you don't count the fact that I inherently hate working. I'm a developer who has been working from home all pandemic, and I already know I'll never be able to go back to a normal office setting. I'm a decent developer so most of the time I don't have much work to do.

I'm a one woman team so nobody bothers me most of the time. The problem is my boss. She's a workaholic who has been at the company 20 years. She wants to retire in the next couple years, and I'm her intended replacement, as she reminds me often. This has revealed to me that she has terminal yes-man syndrome, and has picked up a laundry list of useless tasks throughout her tenure. She's been training me to take them over, and many have nothing to do with my job description.

Most of it is spreadsheet hell, auditing sales documents from a decade ago, or documentation that literally nobody will ever look at.

To put it plainly I just don't want to do them. She also doesn't know I have no intention to be with this company 6 months from now. My plan has always been to restore my savings (after an earlier attempt to Fuck Off from office life failed) and then Fuck Off to live in Europe. At this point I can't give a shit about anything but the promise of good wine, cheese, relaxed work culture, and beautiful old architecture. The pandemic has set back that plan, but I'm determined.

Regardless, I'd rather die than stay in this city at this job. I will not be here long enough to make learning this bullshit matter to me. Too bad I don't have any teammates, who might have been able to relieve me of some of them. How do I avoid working when the buck stops with me?

I was thinking that since these tasks are not what I was hired for, I should just pretend to be bad at them. She might get frustrated and continue doing them herself, if she thought these tasks (which are not worth my pay rate, imo) would take bandwidth away from me doing development.

Have you ever done this? Do you think I could get fired for being incompetent at tasks that are secondary at best to my main job function? What would you do?",False,i8gvou,dijonmustardondabeat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i8gvou/how_to_avoid_working_as_much_as_possible_until/,4,1

Some of my own surprising examples of finding purpose and purposelessness in labor are listed below, but I'm curious - **what are some unexpected types of labor where you've found a sense of purpose or purposelessness? **

By day I'm a bureaucrat, but I sometimes do side projects. And damn if they don't sometimes feel purposeful. Recent examples include planting plants and pulling weeds, shoveling muck out of a lake, and painting a house. Another surprisingly purposeful example of meaningful labor is helping landlord friends and tenants connnect (I know, I know.) But still, I find it beautiful to help broker deals where everyone wins.

I also play music for $ sometimes (and for fun all the time), but surprisingly it does not feel purposeful or ""righteous"" to get paid to play at rich people's weddings.

It feels like a contradiction.","Like many of you, I am antiwork. Labor should not be exploited under the threat of biological coercion. It seems like in order to ""escape"", the popular trend is to grind out for years saving 50%+ or more. Generally, this requires a college degree and a high paying job. Which means you have to be expected to know about this or at least have a direction when you start middle school (so that you can place for college based courses). 

It is madness. And then you invest in the same companies that bomb and blow up other nations, cause addiction based behaviors, track your data, and sell you destruction drugs labeled as ""medication."" 

If you have a problem with the system, it isn't the system that's at fault. It is you. You are weak, you are a mooch, you are lazy, you are needy, you need to increase your income. Want to retire on 200k? HA! Healthcare will EAT YOU UP. You need at least 1 million. But then 10 million. HOW ABOUT ONE BILLION? That's right. You will never retire. NEVER. Get back to work. 

I find this crazy circular bullshit game to be maddening. I hate it. I hate the trauma. I hate the expectation. I hate the addicted egocentric bullshit. 

I have lost my motivation with FIRE, with grinding, with hustle, with all that nonsense. I work just enough to save a little and sleep for mental recovery (history of concussions). That's it. It is pretty meaningless. And then I die. The end.

781,The person who (unknowingly) made me anti-work,"Not sure if this is the right place for it, but I wanted to share how I became anti-work (mainly anti-corporation). Last year I landed an internship at a large multi-billion dollar company, which I was super stoked about because, even though they didn't pay me very well as an intern, it was very prestigious, and I thought it could lead to a further career with the company (ha!). Anyway, my supervisor there was the person who, completely unintentionally, 'woke me up' to the problems with work and corporate culture. 

\-she was in her early thirties, but all she talked about was how excited she was for retirement. She would always share her future plans for travel and such, and would cross her fingers and say ""only thirty-eight years to go!"" If the only thing you're excited for is almost forty years in the future, and you're essentially just trying to make time pass until then, what kind of a life are you living?

\-she seemingly did nothing except for work. She was always in early, stayed late, took on extra responsibilities. She had meaningful contact with almost no one outside of work but her parents. She told me she hadn't been out with friends in over a year!

\-she was always extremely stressed out. So much so that it was intimidating to approach her, with questions or even just to say hi in the morning. She also always looked sick and exhausted, huge bags under her eyes and sickly/yellowish skin. Even though she was a fairly attractive person, she looked awful to be blunt. She would spent her fifteen minute breaks dead asleep in the storage room with a pillow (upper management probably didn't know about this).

\-my internship was only for one semester, and I was returning to grad school afterward. On my last day she told me to enjoy school while I could, because its ""way more shitty"" in the work world.

Interacting with her, and just seeing how hopeless and empty she was, really affected me, especially since she seemed like she'd be a pretty cool person if it wasn't for work just beating her to a pulp. Now that I'm graduating myself, it makes me scared. I'm terrified of ending up like her, and 'losing my soul' so to speak. But I need income and don't know what my other options are. It makes me feel hopeless and empty myself knowing that that might be my fate.

794,2nd Personal Phone Number,"So, my company has given us phones to use for work purposes. I always turn it off when I'm done for the day.

Due to CO-VID and being furloughed for 6 weeks - which I absolutely loved - I had to give my personal phone number to a few senior managers so they could contact me. 

My line manager has contacted me a few times after work when I wanted to forget the work (hence, me turning my work phone off). While it hasn't been anything major, but I want to circumvent the situation where if I am on Annual Leave or if I am after work I am getting contacted. I don't want to make them feel like they can contact me whenever they want. I don't want to know and hear anything from my work during MY FREE TIME.

Now, saying to my line manager not to contact me via my personal phone and only use my work phone might not be the smartest of ways as this could cause unnecessary friction. I want him - and other managers - to feel like ""I am part of the team"" and think that they have my phone number.

So, instead, I am thinking of buying another phone number and using it as my true personal phone number that only my friends and family have while treating my current personal number the same as a work phone number - turn it off after work and forget about it during holidays, weekends or evenings. I would buy a crappy mobile phone for ¬£30 or something for it as not to have to change my SIM card too often.

Sure, that would mean I would have to change my phone number to login to my bank or gas payments, but this would avoid unnecessary questions as well as make it much more difficult for my workplace to contact me when I don't want to be contacted. If they asked anything about it, I would say that ""oh, my area has a crappy signal"" or ""my phone's battery died"" or something.

800,Modern life causes depression,"Similar to another post I saw on here. But think about it. 
40+ hour work weeks.
Shit pay.
Stress from work.
Stress from lack of money.
Meaningless work/lack of purpose.
Overpriced rent and housing. 
Retirement a pipe dream.
Still having to work during a pandemic or lost job due to pandemic whilst rich get richer.
Not enough free time for hobbies, friends and family, and just to unwind and relax.
There are many other things you could add, just thought these were the most obvious.

I'm not saying there are no other causes of depression. But it seems obvious its a leading cause. A lot of people drink and take drugs to feel good, I think partly because deep down, we all know how pointless this all is. Seems like most people have developed coping mechanisms to deal with the miserable reality of work.

814,I want to drive trucks and give zero fucks.,"I am 35. I worked 20 hours a week since I was 15, I worked full time as soon as I finished high school at 18. I had one ¬®burnout¬® crisis 10 years ago, but that was quite simple, it was purely because of the shitty job I had with a lot of responsibility and zero free time, I usually spent whole Saturday just sleeping, and Sunday's drinking and dreading the Monday. I took couple months off, found a better job and was back in the race, this time in less shitty job. Around 2016, in spring, I started feeling a bit anxous around large groups of people, even people I knew, I was in a hotel in Vienna, at our annual company conference, about 250 people, I was about to go on stage for my bullshit powerpoint, which was part of my job at least once a month, never had issues with public speaking. I was sweating profusely and 10 minutes before my time slot I chickened out, dumped it out of the blue on one of my coworkers and said I don't feel well, locked myself in the room and didn't leave until the next morning. I was not able to step in front of more than 20 people and talk to them  ever since. 2015 was the best year in my career, I finished 2 long running projects with high praise from all the fatcats at the company, I had pretty good work life balance, took 3 week vacation, first time in my life I went somewhere for 3 straight weeks just with the target to not do anything but relax, I still remember how amazing I felt when I came back. But it was also a time when I started to spend money like no tomorrow. 2016 in my job was what 2020 is now for the whole planet Earth, work/life balance meant the life part is the time you come home after 9pm every day, but I suddenly had to keep up this cult of consumerism I was living in, after all that expensive watch is a great purchase, if it gets to be worn for 15 hours a day at the office. At times I would just buy expensive shit that ended up unopened piling up in the hallway, I think I still have a pair of expensive shelf speakers in the garage that I bought 3 years ago, but by the time they arrived - 2 days later, I was no longer interested in upgrading my audio setup, because I had no time to do so. Long story short (too late, I tend to ramble), I let myself become an anxious, shy, angry and easily irritated pile of garbage human being, which is not really good for an executive job position managing couple dozen employees and couple dozen million budget for R&amp;D. I wanted to quit in 2017, they always convinced me to stay a little longer, with empty promises about different job position I wanted. I finally quit in October last year, and the last few weeks in the company, after I knew it is over, felt like the gravity stopped working, because I was skipping with ever step I took. La di da. I found a job in one day, home based, no direct people management. I lasted 2 months, when christmas holidays were close to end I could not fathom to spend another day on the phone dealing with morons on 3 different continents, I had enough of my US colleague who wanted to ¬®touch base¬® every other day and just drown me in small talk for 30 minutes every time, I hated speaking to colleagues in India who never, in the 15 years I worked with Indians, could tell me what the fuck they actually think, I swear to god the yah/nah headbob over the phone is 20 times worse than in person, because I don't even have chance to see your face to learn something is wrong, so I every phone call is basically an interrogation if I want to learn something that you are afraid to tell me because it means there is a problem. No sir, everything is fine. Oh yes sir, half of the team quit. Yes, everything is fine. The delivery will be on time. Oh yes, the delivery has to be posponted by 3 months. How I wished to say fuck you to everyone. I realized I am the asshole. If you meet an asshole in the morning, you met an asshole. If you keep meeting assholes the whole day.. you're the asshole. I quit after just 2 months in the new company and I am not working now for the  8th month. I am still not ready to work again. Every couple of weeks I get really anxious, with the corona shit happening (we had one of the lowest infection and death rates in the world, but also with full shutdown for several weeks, our economy tanked the most in all of Europe), that I won't find a decent job any time soon, even though I know I don't want one yet. But for the first time in my professional life something happened that never happened to me before - I did not get a response to my job application. Nor did I ever need to send more than one before. But receiving no response is still far better than those ¬®we are sorry but you did not fit to our criteria this time¬® rejection emails. I had to dumb down my CV, which landed me 3 interviews, all 3 of which I cancelled an hour prior. I was afraid I would accept an offer if they would make one. After I realized in April or so that I won't be working any time soon, I claimed unemployment from the government, first time in my life. That was another low for my self esteem. I felt like a leech. Still do. I have to keep reminding me that in taxes I pay more to the government in a year that they will give me for 6 months, and even if I did not count taxes, in the unemployment insurance I paid for the years I was working I paid a lot a lot more to the system than I will take away. The society tells you are a parasite if you are not productive for the society. Which I agree, if you never worked, don't want to work, and collect money from government. But the society, well.. fuck society, the family thinks you are a parasite, if you are not working. The family will call you, using expensive phone and cell plan you bought and pay for, to tell you that you should get back to work and be a ¬®valid member of society¬®. My dear mother told me that she ¬®could let it go¬® after I refused to enter college and started working (she politely forgot the fact they threw me out of the house after high school and we didn't speak and visit for 3 years because of that), all the kids of her friends have degrees and succesful careers and families and kids and houses, and all her friends vere envy about how ¬®important¬® I was at the company (I worked for the largest employer in the county with 5k employees), how everybody in town respected me, and that nobody in history of the company ever quit at the position I had, because you either get fired or retire from the executive jobs, so the gossip in town is I surely had to be fired (the gossip 9 years ago when I got the job at 25 was that I surely had to suck a lot of cock to get it at such age). But now, my dear mother told me, she has to fear in shame somebody will ask her how I am doing, so my dear mother keeps telling people I still work for the company I quit alredy 8 months ago. My dear mother offered to give me money when I got rid of my expensive german car and bought a small city hatchback for 1/5 of the price with a 3 cylinder engine. ¬®Oh, if you can't afford it anymore I will give buy you the car, what will people say, when they will see you driving in such car, that surely you are broke. Fun fact is, I would gladly take the car, why not, free car? but it wasn't sincere offer from a mother to buy something for her son out of love, it was just to keep a facade of ¬®success in all endeavours¬® for every family member. I thought only she can be so shallow, but I actually had 3 people over the last year ask me why did I buy such cheap car, one, a car mechanic changing my tires, asked me if I am not ashamed to drive in the car, ¬®a man with my status¬®. This is what I hate most about our society, what I hate myself for doing the same for almost all of my life - to value our self worth based solely on our ¬®status¬®, education, job position, house we live in, car we drive. I can't compare it to drug addiction (only because my bade does not bode will any drugs otherwise I am pretty sure I would have a drug problem), but addiction to social status can be pretty hard to get rid off too. It could make you miserable for 23 hours a day, but that one hour of high will keep you living with it. For some it is the feeling when they earn another fat cheque, for some the deferred behavior of employees who  love, hate and fear you, another loves to see their name printed everywhere. I myself, I think I am done with any creative work, done with using my brain. My brain is dead, or it feels like it most of the days. All day I am content just watching Netflix and play Hearthstone, for hours. I really feel brain dead, writing this post was probably the longest thought I processed over the past few months. I can't deal with people anymore, I can't deal with complex problems. I signed for driving school for big trucks.

819,My story on Antiwork,"Interesting subreddit, I found it scrolling through popular. This looks like a place that I mostly agree with. Since I absolutely despise the thought of working 40+ hours a week for your entire life at a thankless job that would replace you before your funeral if you suddenly died.

Short story about me. When I was a teenager, I used to visit an old folks home a lot and talk with the residents. 

Some of the questions I would ask them were: 

What do you wish you would have done more of in life? And What are your biggest regrets? Not a single person said they wished they would have Worked more or watched more TV/Movies. Most said they wished they would have worked less and spent more time with family and friends. Some said they wished they would have spent more time doing hobbies or whatever they loved, like traveling or writing. 

Later at 28, I just couldn't take the 9-5 anymore. So I quit my job sold everything and went traveling to South East Asia. 

Now about 5 years later. I am living in Cambodia, working 24ish hours a week, and saving more money than I spend every month. With my lovely wife and kid. I have plenty of time to spend with them and on the things I enjoy doing. 

I am only working as much as I do because we want to buy some land and build a house a little farther outside of town. Total cost for land and house should be around $40k

To me being anti work does not mean laying around all day doing nothing. 

It means doing what I love doing with no regrets now or in the future. While reducing\\eliminating the time I have to spend working for others. 

I do not want to be in my 70's and be thinking ""What if I would have...."" 

PS: I do not recommend moving to another country. Most people would NOT be able to handle it. I wouldn't say I am one in a million but I would say I am one in one hundred thousand.

821,A random thought,"My grandfather was a carpenter. The old school kind, with hand tools only. Very skilled guy. All the furniture in his house was handmade by him. But it took him forever to make even the simplest stool.

He worked for a random furniture company where he had power tools, coworkers, logistics, marketing, finance department, whatever a company has. They were making and selling a great amount of furniture.

I don't think that he could have been so productive on his own to match the productivity he had at his company: on his own he would have had to take out part of his carpentry time to go buy the materials he needed. Then he would have to carry the materials home. After the furniture was done he would have had to store it, sell it. He would have had to be a carpenter along with being an acquisition specialist, truck driver, marketing specialist, salesman, accountant.

Even if companies are bad, greedy, steal the fruits of the labour and so on, even if he was paid less than what he worked, he still earned for himself much more than he would have on his own.

848,Sick Time Guilt? -Vent-,"Hi guys, first time poster.  (TL;DR at the bottom)

With everything thats been going on in the country both socially and economically, ive been lurking around this sub as well as r/ABoringDystopia and r/LateStageCapitalism and generally just agreeing with and laughing along with whats being posted.

 Im lucky enough to still have an income during the pandemic (entry level auto technician) but the job or atleast the company I work for fucking sucks. 50+ hours a week, benefits are ass, 0% employer contribution to 401K, 1/2 a day PTO earned a month (which counts towards both sick days and vacation), the pay scale is super low compared to others in the industry, management has been super misleading about pay/expectations/advancement, etc. Ive been with this company for almost 2 years now, and im not expecting to be pampered or given a free pass to master tech, but what they expect from us and what they give in return is fucking infuriating. Especially with how busy we've been over the summer. Im not the only one fed up with their bullshit either; we're having people quit left and right. Management is in damage control mod rn, but we are hella short staffed and over worked. Which brings me to my point.

Over the past week ive had a harder time catching my breath and breathing in general. ""No problem!"" I says, ""Its just my fat ass struggling in the heat and humidity! I'll lose some weight and quit vaping!"" Then I start getting random headaches, and I get dizzy if I go from prone to standing too fast. ""No problem!"" I says, ""I hit my head pretty fuckin hard the other day on the lift, im sure its nothin."" Then my stomach starts turning knots and im moonlighting as a septic super soaker in the bathroom every hour and a half, ""No problem!"" I says, ""Never gonna trust free burritos from the mexican food place next door again! Ill just take my day off and rest this whole mess out of my system."" And thats what I did, all day yesterday I slept and took vacations the the toilet, but I didnt feel any better. If anything I felt worse off today, been fatigued all week but this morning was a legit effort to get into work and doing the job felt like pushing a bolder up hill. I tell my manager im going to a minute clinic at lunch to see what they say. I get there and describe my symptoms, and they says ""Sorry, we dont do covid testing here, you will need to go to the oTheR minute clinic"" and im like, dont put the fucking C word on me, I dont have that shit! ""Well in any case, we wont be able to see you today, we are booked full \^\_\^  thank you for choosing not-a-doctor-visit-clinic‚Ñ¢, please come again!"" God damnit! I text my manager and say they want me to do a covid test and I drive to the oTheR clinic to see if they can get me in today. I get there and again they are booked for the rest of the afternoon, but they atleast tell me how schedule an apointment for the test. I call my manager and tell him I wont be able to get one done until tomorrow. He says its fine, but he will need me to come back so they can get my temperature. No fucking idea why or what thats supposed to do but apparently ive been running a 100F fever today too lol. He informs me that I will need to stay home until I get the results back from my test and not to worry because my time away will be paid. But the real kicker is that the company posted a Paid Time Off for covid policy around May when our city first went into lock down that basically boils down to ""We will pay you for up to two weeks if you are away with covid related issues, your banked PTO days will be used first, and then through our good graces we will give you free PTO that you have to earn back at the standard rate (1/2 a day per month)."" 

So here I am at home, bitching to strangers online about my crap job, worried that ive caught the literal plague, concerned that I wont have another paid sick day or vacation for the next two fucking years. Oddly enough I feel guilty for being away from work! Why!? I fuckin hate the job, but I am thankful for the income. I resent the increased work load with no clear incentive, but I have been increasingly stepping up my game to match the demand and I feel like im letting someone down by not being able to continue doing that. Im incredibly burnt out and my mind and body have been begging me to take some time off, and I guess my wish has been granted in monkey paw or sarcastic ass genie style.

I have worked for two full years and I did just about anything to earn full time. As it so happens, they were looking for someone to fill in the position for Lumber cashier and no one wants closings and I thought,  why the hell not? I get to sleep in and all. Anyway, at one point, I wanted fixed days off because I kept getting 8-10 day weeks and I was exhausted (still am).

I asked the manager in charge of my schedule if I could have Monday, Tuesday off, she didn't have a problem with that since the other cashiers already had the weekends off by default. I do not mind working weekends. Anyway, it was going well up until now, I tried to update my availability to have Monday, Tuesday off to have some sort of a life with my wife, sadly the previous manager in charge of my schedule passed it on to another manager. That manager had me fill out a form for the HR lady and as soon as I took it to the HR lady, she immediately began to shame me for wanting a fixed schedule because as a full time worker I'm supposed to have open availability and basically keep at it like a wind up toy it seemed like.

To make the long story short, she was pissed and clearly doesn't care about anyone but herself. Thankfully I spoke to my manager in charge of my schedule and she personally took my availability to be able to work with me as much as possible.

I don't understand why it's such a big deal to want the same days I was getting for almost a year, off. I signed up for the hours no one wants and we just need someone to close for 2 days that I'm not there. HR lady made me feel like shit and needless to say she's not well liked, but she makes me realize how ae are shamed for even trying to have free time with significant others and even a life; because work is our life.

And I'm feeling so lost and the despair of it is really creeping into me and making it hard for me to focus stuff. Like the traditional path of work 40hours a week+bullshit chores and errands just to be able to live and have almost  no time for what matters seems pointless like why bother living.  So I'm trying to find a why out that's not suicide. I cant figure it out my parents who id usually ask think my goals in life are bad. Idk if this is the right place to post but you guys at least get what I mean.

Anyways I know what I want, I just want to have enough to be able to not die, and be able to do what matters in life art, writing, and time with friends and family. Like none of that is terribly expensive to pursue but the real thing required is time and imagination. So need to figure out a way to minimize  work time and stress so low cost of living and such.

I'm thinking probably best way to do this is either to live out of a van. Or try and find a small place in a rural area just somewhere enough for internet and amazon orders. But I'm really stuck on how to figure this out I suck at planning. Or what kind of job i can do part time but still pays decently per hour. ideally remotely to save on commute and so if i choose not to live in a van i wont need a car. this is just very confusing and overwhelming to me. And with college rearing its head and I'm not sure i need it i want to figure out sooner rather than later so i don't get myself into a whole. just doing part time community college tell i figure stuff out.

So what exactly is the solution for all of us? And for the love of Christ can we please stop pretending that voting has solved any of our problems thus far? We're not gonna fix a broken system by using it against itself. It doesn't work like that. There's a reason why things have been getting progressively worse instead of better.

877,Some Ideas to work less,"I love the idea of working less also of working for yourself instead of others that don't care about you.

It seems a lot of people who want to work less or leave the system want to become self sustaining farmers. To be honest I personally hate that idea. Way to much work just to survive let alone doing what you want. I would much rather be a day laborer 1 day a week to pay for food than work a farm everyday.

To each their own though if you like farming do it. If not here are some more ideas.  


This is the most important! Figure out what you want to do when you get more free time. 

Examples: travel, writing, painting, making things, reading, staring at the wall etc...

Greatly reduce the amount of money you need. If you need less money then you can work less and do what you like more. 

Examples: Vanlife, living with roommates/parents, buying some land and living in a   
trailer/Yurt/camper etc...

&amp;#x200B;

Some things you can do to make money that might be more fun than 9 to 5 work. 

  
YouTube channel - Do something about your hobby or something that is actually interesting to you.     I had a robotic voiced ""health"" channel making $2k a month before YT changed their rules. Not easy but not exactly hard either. 

Writing - Write and self publish a book on Amazon and other places. 

Small engine repair - Ethanol in gas is horrible for small engines. Easy to fix if you are mechanically inclined. 

Make something yourself and sell it at flea markets, Craigslist, Ebay etc... You could make paintings, furniture, hand carved signs, wind chimes, your only limit is your imagination. (Tip look at best sellers on Ebay and Etsy)

Just selling random stuff at flea markets. 

Work online - Mturk, Micro workers, Be an online ESL teacher, Write articles for people

Farmers market stall - lots of the sustainable farmers are busy or hate selling. Buy products from different farmers and sell it (at a different farmers market than them). This helps multiple people get out of the 9 to 5.

Be a day laborer - Lots of cities have ""Labor Ready"" drive to town 3 days a week and work. The rest of the time do what you want. 

Junker/scrapper - be the guy in the crappy truck that collects metal from all around town.

Move to another country and start a bar/resturuant/hotel 

Hopefully something here got you thinking about what you could do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Figure out what you want to do and make time for it. Even if you dont know make time to try different things. 

For me being my own boss took away most of the stress of the 9-5

&amp;#x200B;

Great time to figure out how to make some money online and save. Then when it becomes available move to the country side and live a more relaxed life.",False,i8vlka,I_Am_Cha_Bu_Duo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i8vlka/some_ideas_to_work_less/,25,1

| met a soul who was once a monitor. | asked how
he changed his life. ""Because even when | cleaned
bathroom | always did my best.""

His is his story. After high school he worked at a
restaurant. One day, his boss introduced him to one of the
regulars, and told him he would like to talk to him for a
minute.

He thought he was in trouble, but then the customer
offered him a job. The chance to be a junior project
manager at his company and learn about commercial
development.

Skeptical, he asked why he would help him, a complete
stranger. The customer replied, ""The bathroom is always
spotless. You have a million dollar work ethics.‚Äù

He accepted the opportunity. The customer became his
new boss, enter and eventually his business partner.

883,Stuck trying to decide on education,"First time posting but after a bit of lurking I feel like this subreddit really ""gets"" me.

That being said! Here's my dealio. Through working full time and living with my parents up until a couple months ago I've managed to save up 33,000$. However. I have no credit, very little equity, no 401k, and outside of speaking a foreign language and HS diploma I have no education. I'm a real piece of work, I know. But I don't have kids so I suppose that's a plus. Now, I'm beyond fed up with my manual labor factory job, I. Hate. It. There. Everyday I aim to clock in, make as much money as I can, do as little work as I can get away with, and leave....I've been thinking of;

A.) Quitting and going to tech school for electrical in November. Seven month program costing 5,800$. The drawback here is I'm afraid after finishing school there would be nobody willing to hire me as I'd have zero job experience with electronics. Or the only places willing to hire would want me to start on night shift :/

B.) Obtaining an Associates degree online in Quality Assurance. It'd be a two-year program at 4,000$ a semester. So... It's costly AF but... Although quality control has never been my job title, aspects of it have been in some of my previously held (and even current) position(s). Theoretically I could work full time and go to school full time but then it becomes exponentially harder to pass and my quality of life plummets as ""free time"" will become a thing of the past.  Have any of you worked/went to school full time? Was it miserable?

Any feedback would be appreciated, figured I'd post it here where I'd be among like minds lol.",False,iaduse,Mommys_boi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/iaduse/stuck_trying_to_decide_on_education/,11,1

I do not dream to grow old in youth,

I will not dream about labor,

I will not dream to have my life stolen,

I will not dream about labor,
or taking losses for petty bosses.
I will not dream of my own slavery,
nor step in line to be assigned deadlines.

I dream of stars and brisk air and open fields and sunbeams,
of run on sentences, of leaving the margins, of plagiarism, of strange colored papers.
I dream of being exactly where I want to be, with exactly who I want to be with, when I want to be,
of abandoned buildings sprouting with trees and of the people singing, and music, and poetry, and literature, and beauty, and science that has been freed
I dream of the people deciding who they want to be without hierarchy,
of hair colors and odd clothes, of tattoos, and of peace, and an end to this slavery.

899,How do you guys do it?,"Good day comrades.

TL;DR: How do you reconcile your desire to stay alive with your desire to avoid mindless work? 

I‚Äôm conflicted. I‚Äôm on the verge of finding where the fuck I‚Äôm supposed to be in this world (22F, have my college degree + 1 year of internships/gig work experience) and I feel like I keep oscillating between two extremes. On the one hand: 

1. I know that capitalistic society has a vested interest in having us literally work ourselves to death for arbitrary rewards and status symbols. For this reason, I have no intention of participating in it. 

However, on the other hand:

2. I need to survive in this highly capitalistic world. That takes money as food, shelter, healthcare, and water all have price tags attached to them. Money is hard to get without rich parents, a job and/or a successful business. So I doubt I have a choice but to pursue a career for the next 40+ years that involves doing the pointless work anyway. 

That being said, when I inevitably choose to participate in this capitalist tomfuckery, I know I will still be firmly anti-work at heart. So I‚Äôll be a hypocrite, but I‚Äôm kind of okay with that. 

But at the same time, I know that in participating in unnecessary work to keep this oppressive system going, I will inevitably get distracted and may lose sight of my goal : to stop living to work and start working to live. 

I‚Äôve been racking my brain for months, wondering how to settle this conflict in my head. I‚Äôve spent many a sleepless night scrolling through Indeed looking for job openings/roles/careers that don‚Äôt involve compromising my views and have come up short. 

So naturally, I look to strangers on the internet for advice/their take.

906,Should I work during my studies?,"Now I realize this ain‚Äôt a finance sub I just align with antiwork.

Here‚Äôs my situation:

I am looking to move in to my country capital Oslo.

I currently live at home paying no expenses bar subscriptions and personal items.

I am studying IT on my 2nd year as of this August.

I am finishing my studies in June 2022.

I have 8.500 euros in my bank account.

Rent in the city costs about 500-600 euros a month.

Cost of living is generally high but average it‚Äôs apparently around everything from 100-300 euros a month on expenses.

The student loan I would take would amount to around 14.500 euros after 2 years of study, subtracting my bank savings would amount to around 6.000 euros in debt after 2 years.

In addition to this, I can lower that 6.000 in debt by simply not using all of the student loan money I get each month.

As well, I can work a set amount of days a month and get some extra money if I get a job in the city.

So now with all of this information, what is you guys‚Äô perspective on this; should I work even though I hate the type of work I am likely to get?

Customer service jobs are the most prevalent.

Or should I take the 6.000 euros of debt, and look to work it down after getting a job within IT either during my studies or upon completion?

3rd option, not a personal preference but possible, is to live at home while I complete my studies.

I will be 24 years old when I finish my studies and the year 2022.

My parents have clarified that they would allow this, and my dad strongly urges me to do this.

931,My Existence is Being Robbed,"Right now, I work Monday-Friday, 9-5:30 PM (sometimes a little later if I get caught up in a call with an idiot customer). I've heard for years from the people around me that I should be ""so grateful"" and ""appreciative"" that I have a such a ""stable"" work schedule and what not. Honestly, I just feel like my entire existence has been robbed right before my eyes. This is probably my 18th job in the last 10 years and none have ever brought me satisfaction or have stimulated me mentally; I always end up feeling trapped and bored. Unfortunately, those feelings manifest both physically and mentally and end up affecting all areas of my life. 

I just can't believe that our minds and bodies have evolved over millions upon millions of years and this is where I, and many others, have ended up. What a chance it is to be conscious and alive and here I am sitting behind a desk for 8+ hours per day making someone else rich doing menial work. I question if there are any other options out there in terms of way-of-life? I feel down on myself and wonder if maybe I'm not smart enough or lucky enough to ever live a different way... But then, I look around and see that almost everyone is living the same way. The difference is, a lot of those other people are somehow content devoting their limited existence to working a bullshit job.

I guess this is just a sorta rant to get my feelings out. I gave on trying to express the way I feel to my family and friends... They don't get it and will say the same old lines, ""Find a job you like"" ""It could be worse"" ""Some people aren't working right now"" ""That's life"" ""You have to do what you have to do"" ""Go back to school"" ""Find another way to make money"" ""Sorry to hear that"" ""Don't be lazy"" ""Take a few days off"" etc. It's the same stuff I've been hearing for the last 10 years over and over again.

I know this Summer has been incredibly difficult for many of us but I hope y'all are still able to make time for yourselves.  


We have almost hit 150K and as this sub continues grows we're going to need more people to moderate and make sure folks are following the rules (tl;dr: No harassing language, no  trolling, no spam, no propaganda/right-wing nonsense).

To that end, we're looking for more mods! 

We only need 2 this time around so please let us know of your interest ASAP, thanks!

  
As always, if you're going to be a mod you *must*:

* Be respectful to sub members
* Communicate  with the other mods about decisions unless you think they are a  no-brainer
* Use your mod powers responsibly (""with great power comes great yadda yadda"")
* Try  to give people a few chances to mess up before banning them. This goes  in line with my previous comment! For example, I usually tell people about our rules and remind them to follow them, they usually insult me, I  warn them and then they insult me again, so I ban them.
* No prior mod experience required, but it's definitely appreciated!

Also because workers don't have to travel there are tons of bosses that expect people to be on and available even MORE now.

951,the customer is always right...,"if you believe this you are one of two types of people. the first type is a business owner. for them, this line is a commandment on the stone tablets. you can not argue with them and you can not reason with them about this. from my experience business owners rarely deal with difficult customers. that is why they have managers and to an extent cashiers to absorb the abuse. in the cases where a customer demands to see the business owner chances are that the staff member will be sacrificed to placate the customer. 

this happens all the time. 

the second type is a special breed of customer. this customer is the obnoxious type. entitled. they look down on you and what you are doing. they assume that because you are working retail you must be stupid. or lazy. i doubt that 'because I have to' as a reason ever comes into their minds about why you are working there. the unfair system they are a part of does not 
bother them in the slightest.

this type of customer is unaware of the basics of how a business functions and expects things to 'just happen' or things to 'just be there'. they don't have an idea of how a fast food restaurant works yet they will attempt to tell you how to do your job. they have no idea how a particular business functions but they will abuse a cashier for an issue that is actually managements' problem. they don't understand the concept of 'shit happens' and that you can not plan for every eventuality.

this customer is more financially privileged than the people they bully. they assume that money gives them the power to abuse people. my theory: they only pick retail places to exert their 'influence' because no one else will take that type of attitude from them. 

respect is not given. if anyone desires to be respected you should first respect other people. being a customer does not elevate you to a level above other people.

953,"It's not just that I don't want to work. I couldn't even if I wanted to, at this point. I fear for my future, if I even have one.","This post is horribly written as I am so broken up by everything that I can't do it properly. But I got something down so I am sharing it anyway.

I‚Äôm glad to have found this sub. I desperately need to talk about this. I have felt extreme levels of guilt, stress, and pain due to my inability to tolerate work for nearly all my life. It‚Äôs been so severe it‚Äôs driven me to be nearly permanently suicidal, and eventually started to effect my physical health. If you end up reading all of this, thank you. It means a lot.

Since I was a child I have resented and feared the concept of work. It‚Äôs complex as to why, but one of the earliest factors was my father. Shortly, he‚Äôs a fascist who has long praised the virtues of hard work, particularly where you suffer (don‚Äôt worry, I disowned him 2 years ago). For most of my life I have felt so deeply incompetent due to my seeming inability to find my stride and do well with work. I thought I did in high school, but that started to slowly shift following that. My first 40h a week job was the summer of 2008, and the entire experience of it just crushed me. I did it, but the sheer length of time it took out of the day left me with so little left inside when I got home. That summer, I did basically nothing and was horribly depressed. It lifted once I got back to school, but that experience lasted with me. Since then, I have dreaded and feared the day where I‚Äôd have to join the 40h grid.

I did get thrown in earlier than I wanted. At the end of the day, I‚Äôm actually no schmuck. I have a PhD in organic chemistry. I tried, I tried so hard to make myself grow tolerant of working long hours. If I did something I loved (I‚Äôve wanted to be a chemist since I was 10 as the subjected fascinated me!), maybe it could work out. But‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt. Graduate school was enormously destructive to my mental health, well being, and completely killed my interest in chemistry. I‚Äôm a shell of my former self at this point. I started my first ‚Äúfull‚Äù job 5 days after my thesis defense. *5 days*. I needed the money despite being so destroyed by grad school. I didn‚Äôt want to, but I had to. I held this job for 2 years before it crushed me.

When I started my job I was honestly *terrified* that I was going to be fired in a matter of days. I thought I was lucky, but would never be able to keep up with it. The work itself? I was able to do most of it, but the sheer terror I felt over it, plus trauma from school which prevented me from performing in key areas rendered it downright destructive. If you include graduate school, I have gone through 14 psychiatric medications to address my mental health issues. Years and years of quality therapy. None of it dented my problems. Still, I somehow managed to hold onto my job for 2 years and even win award for it as I have supremely good people skills. Also, I managed to squeak away with some loopholes. I was actually working around 30-35 hours a week and got away with it due to being salary, and using therapy driving time as an excuse to leave early on some days, as well as coming in late.

Around a month before I quit I got in trouble for coming in late, and my hours began being tracked. I had to work 40h no matter what. I lasted a month before my health declined to the point of going to the emergency room. I was at my desk, utterly overwhelmed by stuff piling up on me, not being able to will myself to do those tasks, and I felt so ill and in pain that I went to the ER. 3 days later, I quit. This was a year ago now. I haven‚Äôt worked since, and am very lucky I have managed to do that with the help of family.

In my year off, and through this pandemic I have figured out several things that I have refused to admit to myself. I do not want a job. Period. I never have. I have felt so much immense guilt and shame over that all my life, and I though the problem was all on me. But the poor benefits, long hours, too low of pay, too low of resources, and increasing societal demands for more and more are out of my range. Literally. At this point, I quite literally *can‚Äôt* work. I am so scared, drained, and in poor health that I could not work a job even if I wanted to at this point.

Currently, I am living with my grandparents and they can easily house and feed me. I am so thankful for this as without them, I am pretty sure I‚Äôd be dead. I tried looking for work a few months ago, but it honestly started to fill me with a sense of panic and extreme dread. Much of it, knowing that I would last maybe a few weeks before I‚Äôd be fired. I just have not gotten any better in the past year. I was hoping the time off would lead to me healing and being ready‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll never be ready. I tried. I really really did. But the fact of the matter is, it is a literal impossibility for me to work a 40h a week job. Maybe I could work a 20h a week job, but it doesn‚Äôt pay enough and I have 125k in student loans from undergraduate. If I actually want to support myself, I have to do something that I cannot do.

I feel overwhelmingly trapped. I don‚Äôt know how long I can stay with my grandparents. Probably a while but certainly not forever. I fear the day I will have to leave because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll survive on my own. I really didn‚Äôt when I was on my own. The job made it impossible for me to take care of my home, my health, my friends, anything. I‚Äôm just flat out not cut out to work. Maybe it could have been different, but my experiences have damaged me to the point where I can‚Äôt anymore. I deeply hope I can find myself in a place where I have a small stream of income so I can stop worrying and fearing for my life.

For most of my life, I have not wanted to work because of a buried feeling that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to cut it. I tried to make myself. I truly went to the end of the earth to do it, and it didn‚Äôt work out. Now, I‚Äôm at a point where it‚Äôs not just that I don‚Äôt want to work, but that *I can‚Äôt*. Yet, not working means no money, which means no food or home, which means death. THIS is why my mental health is so destroyed, it‚Äôs why it‚Äôs been so bad for so long. Not working means death, and if you‚Äôre not able to pull it off, it means you‚Äôll die.

I‚Äôm sorry if this post hard to follow. I tried to write it multiple times and I would just freeze. I barely have the strength to explain this anymore. It feels impossible to properly explain all this coherently. So much has happened and it would require a book to explain it all.

I remember how i would spend hours a day practicing guitar and writing songs and drawing constantly and getting better and better. I remember how i used to actually remember things.

These days i can barely remember most things people tell me, let alone find the motivation to pick up my guitar again. I've just had so much of my life force drained from me.

962,How to Escape the System,"This is a question that I have noticed has been discussed on this subreddit previously, and something that I have spent a good amount of time thinking about myself. I am certainly no expert on the subject  but I do have a number of thoughts on the subject that I would like to share with the intention of sparking a conversation if other people have thoughts or ideas they would like to share. 

Now keep in mind I'm from the US, so my experience may be different and what I am going to write about may not simply apply to everyone. Also, every avenue will require work and will also require a change to your lifestyle. 

Now before I get into how to get out, I want to go over some fundamentals that I believe: 

At a basic level, capitalism is a trade. You trade your time for money. I understand it is more complex than that, you also trade labor, expertise, knowledge, skills, etc... If you accept this fact then you quickly realize that time is the most valuable asset that you possess and will ever possess, time is precious and it is always fleeting. 

In a capitalist system, money equals survival. Without it you won't be able to buy food or shelter or any of the other items required to live. So you have to make money to survive which means trading your time for money. Now logically, the best thing would be to figure out how to trade the least amount of time for the most amount of money, which leads to people going to school and specializing, again I understand it is much more complex than that. 

Now the trick of the whole system: Debt and advertising culture. I strongly believe that capitalism is designed to get people in debt. Want to go to college? Debt. Want to buy a house? Debt. Oh you got sick and don't have insurance? Debt. Combine that with a culture that demands endless consumption which again leads to more debt and you have the perfect system to keep people controlled and in jobs they hate but need to do to service all of their debt. Honestly when you realize the whole thing it is kind of amazing. 

The short answer is that there is no easy answer. I don't think there are generally easy answers when it comes to life, life is hard and requires work and to truly escape the system one will have to put in a lot of work. Now I am going to try and outline some different avenues that I have explored and thought about: 

1- Choosing to be a hobo. Believe it or not, this is something I have thought about. Just pack up, hit the road and see where life takes you. This to me would seem to be the most extreme, challenging and possibly the most freeing. I think you would want to have a backpack with essential items, to include a tent so you would always have a place to stay. You would also probably want to have some kind of savings established and a way to get and do odd jobs as you go along. I think you would also have to rely a lot on the generosity of others and you would probably always want to stay near some kind of larger population center to take advantage of the services that they would have available.  

2 - Living in a commune or communal based society. They exist and honestly seem pretty freaking cool. This is probably the quickest and easiest way to escape the system. I myself have dreamed about joining such a community but have not done enough research. For one, the very large, established and well known ones are generally in other countries. I'm personally not ready to leave family but you may be. There are also likely ones in many different states that are not known about, their presence only shared via word of mouth. I knew someone that lived at one for a time and I went and visited them. It was kind of weird to be honest. I really loved the idea of it all but the social dynamic was weird. A family owned the farm and people would stay in the barns and around the house. Everyone who stayed had to help with doing chores around the house, whether it was cleaning or working in the garden. Work is how you paid for your stay, you really didn't need to have money unless you wanted to buy stuff. 

3 - The van life! (Or a tiny house) I think this is a cool idea and also something that I have dreamed about. This option would definitely require some more money. Money to buy the van, and keep it gassed and serviced. I do follow the vandwellers subreddit and there are a lot of people who are doing this, and a lot of blogs about it. There are people who are able to secure jobs remotely and actually continue to have some kind of a way to make money while your expenses would be so incredibly low. 

4 - Debt-free lifestyle. This is the one that I am trying for. Pay off all debt, as quickly as possible by eating/cooking at home and not buying much else. The idea is to keep reducing your monthly expenses as much as possible. Now I know about financial independence which also requires having a lot of money saved up and put into investments. Once your expenses are low enough you can make enough from the investments to not have to work and essentially retire. I am trying to go at it a little different. I also want to try and grow as much of my own food as possible, and get my monthly expenses as low as possible. I think that I would still need to work but at that point I could do something that I enjoy like working in a greenhouse and I would only need to do it a few days a week to survive. 

5 - Move to another country. Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, countries with much better social support systems and just generally a better quality of life. This option I frankly know the least about,I am sure that there are restrictions, and forms, applications, processes that would all have to be completed to be able to do it. 

Anyways those are just some ideas that I mull around in my head. The stuff that I dream about when I'm in the middle of doing a job that I hate but need to do to survive.

966,The moment I became anti-work.,"Too long of a post, but here it is.  I've worked since I was 17 - 44 now.  I have always been in administrative positions and was groomed to believe hard work will pay off.  Every position I have been in I've left it all ""on the field"".  Yes Sir/Ma'am I can stay late or come in early.  No problem, I will do that task outside of my job description.    After working hours - not even an issue let's get the mission accomplished.

Job interviews?  Yes this is my dream job my only weakness is I care too much, etc, etc.  Can you pass this complex test for this low paying job?  Absolutely!

After numerous interviews for different positions in this company I landed a job that paid me $15 an hour.  My college degree was really paying off now.  Medical costs - don't mention it, brings my pay down to about $10 an hour. 

This admin position was an 8 hour work day with a lunch of 30 minutes to 1 hour with 2 fifteen minute breaks. I had a manager that was a task master and was borderline micromanaging.  I took my breaks on time, was prompt for lunch breaks, and did everything as instructed.  After working in that position for a year a diff position opened up in the same cubicle area with a different manager.  It came with a whopping $1.50 pay raise bringing me to $16.50.  The manger for that position pulled me into her office and said I would be a good fit.  I applied, and was granted an interview.  I put my best foot forward threw on a tie.  The interview consisted of her telling me that since I am not a millennial I would be a good fit for this position.  She spent time belittling millennials, I nodded my head and lucky me I got the job.  

In this new position I did all my work and was super efficient.  There was no hard and fast requirement to be at the desk, because there was no office traffic, or anything that would ever require a customer, or co-worker to come to my desk.  If someone sent me an e-mail I would respond within seconds.  After being there for a while I learned I could clock in and out on my phone, and respond to any e-mails the same way.  This position did not require any phone calls.  

My manager would come in the office once a week, and when she was there I was always there.  When she was not I would take all types of liberties by clocking in and out on my phone, and responding to e-mails the same way.  I did this for more than a year.  One day on a random Friday my manger showed up to the office.  I was doing my usual routine of a long lunch, and decided to actually show back up to the office.  She called me in and said ""where were you, I show you are clocked in from lunch?"".  I didn't come up with any complex story and really did not say much.  She let me know that my co-workers had complained that I was not there on some random like 2 months prior.  Again, I did not say anything.  She said she would think about what she was going to do on the weekend, and let me know Monday.  Congratulations!  You're fired!  I took the walk of shame out of the office.

My co-workers were glued to their desks, check-in, check-out promptly.  Keep in mind their management was not even in the same state, and had no office locally.  They were soooo full of integrity that they wouldn't dare falsify hours, or take longer breaks even though they would surf the net ALL day.    There were people there in same positions still making $16.50 after 20 years with no hope for a raise.

Getting fired even though I was performing at a high level, because I was not glued to my desk was my moment.  Anti-work!  You're telling me I get the job done, but because my lame brain/non-social/internet surfing co workers want me at my desk I am fired?   ahahhahaha.    There is so much more about what happened here, but that is all I will share for now.

After moving on I was liberated, I fought for it and was granted unemployment.  Was lucky and received the extended unemployment, took care of personal affairs to include my military disability.  I recently signed up for a work from home job where I will actually be helping people.

968,At the end of my rope,"Guys I think I have undiagnosed autism thats making working complete hell and ruining my life.

I'm 23 and I don't know how to drive. I've tried learning but whenever I physically get in the car it's a disaster.

I dropped out of high school because I couldn't learn anything math related and I felt so fucking dumb.

Completely socially retarded. Never had a girlfriend or anything. Basically have never been out anywhere in a social setting my entire life.

I have only 1 friend from middle school who I talk to. Its strictly an online friendship.

I still live with my Dad and his wife. They give me rides to and from work all the time and I feel terrible about it. Public Transportation is virtually non existent where I live.

I've gotten jobs though, my current job and 1 previous job. Both are warehouse jobs I got by going to a temporary agency. Temporary agencies will hire anyone.

Got laid off from the first job because it was strictly temporary seasonal work.

My current job I got hired on after a year or so. It would be a great job if I didn't have to be around other people. 


Everyone who works there are miserable people with no lives and have nothing to talk about. So when they see me quietly minding my business and doing my work I become an easy target for scrutiny.

Our supervisor constantly has me do my coworkers work for her while she blissfully works as slowly as she likes and while she talks shit about me with everyone.

She's constantly behind on her work because she just knows the supervisor will get me to do whatever work she doesn't feel like doing.

No matter what I do she has a problem with it. I could literally just stand up and walk by her and she calls me a dumbass under her breath.

I haven't done anything wrong as far as I know. The only reason she hates me is because I ignore her like the plague and just quietly do my (and her) work.

She herself is miserable and has no life outside of work either. The difference is I'm completely fine with it because of my nature or autism or whatever. 

She on the other hand makes herself feel better by walking around to other areas and talking shit about me to other people. She lies to them telling them I'm lazy and don't do anything. Its complete bullshit.


I've confronted her on 2 occasions asking her what she said. She loses her shit and tells the supervisor that I'm crazy and I'm making it up in my head.

Supervisor always sides with her. Basically I can't do anything. Me and my coworker work in a workshop area away from everyone together alone so its impossible for me to prove the way she acts around me.

I've tried standing up for myself and telling the supervisor I shouldn't have to do her work for her especially with the way she treats me. But he says its ""teamwork"". 

It's making me depressed as fuck and im seriously considering suicide having to get up every single day to go into work to deal with this.

I want to quit so bad but I know it will be very unlikely ill ever get another job.
 
I know if I was a normal person I wouldn't have any of these issues. Like, if I was able to socialize with my coworker like a normal person she wouldn't have come to resent me. But I just can't. Deep down I feel like I don't have autism but it's becoming increasingly clear that I do.

 So wtf can I do? Can I get disability for my apparent autism? Like I said its not diagnosed. Would I have to go to some sort of doctor and convince them I'm fucking retarded? 

If I could get disability and live in a tiny place somewhere and never have to interact with people ever again that would be my ideal life.

I have to figure something out soon. If my dad were to pass away suddenly I would be completely fucked because I rely on him too much. I would be homeless and I would definitely just jump off a bridge at that point.

971,Yesterday I followed through and quit my job,"I have a bad habit of not following through on things, leaving toxic jobs in the dust being one of them. I‚Äôve been miserable for months and I was actually laid off in June for all of a day before being picked up by another department within the same company, which was a big red flag since it showed me they were willing to set me adrift in the middle of a pandemic when not much of anyone is hiring. 

That being said, the last straw took place a couple weeks ago when I was in the office. I started in this new department about a month ago and was still getting the hang of everything after barely being trained. Basically I asked my new supervisor where I should put away some folders full of things that I had been working on once I was finished with them. She pointed in a vague direction and said ‚ÄúPut them in the room with all the boxes‚Äù. Now a few days prior I had been shown a room with a bunch of boxes and trays where things were stored, so I headed there and about 3/4 the way there, roughly 40 feet from where my boss sits, she yelled across the office and in front of all my coworkers ‚ÄúWhat are you doing? Not there, the other one!‚Äù and proceeded to make some comments under her breath, at which point she and the group of women that surround her desk all laughed, not so much as even glancing in my direction.

That one interaction made me feel so small. I‚Äôm young, only 27, but I‚Äôm old enough to have gray hair and a college degree, and I hadn‚Äôt felt so insignificant and humiliated since I was the new kid on the first day of third grade. Absolutely awful.

So yesterday morning I decided to just go in first thing and gather my things and leave my badge with my notice that it would be my last day. I will concede that giving your 2 weeks is a courtesy that should usually be extended, but so is treating your employee like a human being who deserves respect.

I have a part time job lined up with a small company near me, pending my background check, and I‚Äôm going to do that catch my breath for a bit.

977,"If you can opt out of Capitalism, you should.","I know this isn't realistic for the vast majority of you. I'm strictly speaking for people like myself who are in a position to drop out of Capitalism without being starved to death or left in the streets. 

If you can do this, I'd highly recommend it. Getting all your time to yourself to better your life, learn, think and have fun is very much worth it in my opinion. I know there are downsides, there is very little choice in anything when you have nothing, but you can still get by using the internet since everything digital is free if you know how to find it. Yes society will hate you, but if you really care about the truth, that won't bug you. 

The world needs more people dropping out to use their brains instead of pretending money has value. If you spend your time right, dropping out will be of major benefit to society, in that you can help to spread knowledge and be a good example to your fellow man. You can spend your time shaping the way you think to better help others follow suit, in the way I am doing now. 

We need as many humans as possible doing the right thing, so if you can do the right thing and drop out of a system that hurts your own species, you should.

They lost the argument. Their system didn't work when we let them try it worldwide, so it's time to, for the first time in modern human history, try a different system worldwide.

982,How to go about unemployment without getting fired,"Hey everyone. Sharing this Incase anyone has been in the same situation and knows how to go about it, or is in this situation and can follow this post.

So a few weeks ago I got an email from my daycare center saying they see an increase in enrollment, and are calling people back, and were looking for my decision. After thinking about it, I decided to go back, only two days a week. They said all the safety and cleaning procedures they were going to implement, but they said wearing masks for anyone over 2 was optional (even tho all staff had to wear them).

So, I was observing everything back at work, and not much has changed. There isn‚Äôt much distancing like they said, the masks are ‚Äúoptional‚Äù and I‚Äôve only seen one kid with one (the 6-7 year old group), and everyone is so close to each other breathing on each other, and sharing the same toys. The only change I see is that staff has to disinfect the toilets each time a kid goes. 

The other day at work, in my classroom, I noticed a few kids coughing and sneezing all over the place (no masks of course). I tried to distance myself, but it‚Äôs hard when everyone is contained in one classroom. A few days later, I started to not feel well (still don‚Äôt currently; sore throat, dry cough, stuffed up nose) and I‚Äôm highly certain I got this from the daycare as I didn‚Äôt get sick once this corona period since I took a temporary lay off of my job in March. I also saw a few posts saying that cases are rising in children, and it has me a little concerned as I work around multiple children all day. I do not wanna go back next week for my safety, and to not be around any more sick kids, wether they truly have the virus, or just a cold

I know a way to get unemployment would to be getting fired, and stop showing up/letting them know. However, I do not wanna do this. 

I was wondering:
1. How do I go about filing for unemployment successfully? (Like what to say without getting fired)
2. What to tell my work that won‚Äôt disqualify me from getting approved for it (like for example if I refused to come back to work when they called me back they would of notified the state and my unemployment would of gotten cut that way)

I sometimes hear ""people just want to start at the top,"" but I don't think that's really the case, college grads aren't applying for senior level positions, people just want to not be struggling to get by living with their parents.

1009,Should I just call a ceasefire for now and settle into a career [Vent][Advice][etc],"Im 26, from the UK a graduate from a 3D Art and Design course and I guess technically self employed but not enough to live on sustainably so I am looking for something I can call a career.

Any time I think about moving into a long term field of work I just get so incredibly stressed because even though I know I am a capable person even outside art and design everyone who is employing has stupid criteria that are making me second guess myself and anyone who I could work for is going to extract my value for their own gain and despite being inherently immoral are probably so in other ways too and I just keep asking, do I really want this? is it worth my soul? 

The problem is I know I need to work for my own well being if only to escape from my parents and take my mind off my still raw break up and further than that I know I need to make a career so I can earn more than NMW and maybe cut the next 40 years of work down a bit, so should I just bury this deep seated hatred for having my wellbeing held to ransom and just choose a career path already?

I just know of the past few weeks when stuff was going south relationship wise I did get to thinking what would I want to do and why, and I have been ruminating and ruminating but ultimately the answer I keep coming back to is that, everything sucks and I am overthinking it, looking for ethical value in a career where such is impossible. Ill be clear I want to end work, and I think there is still part of me that is clinging to the naivety that I could ever actually feel at peace with the work I do.

So should I just do a job for the money, the challenges it brings and the people I get to know and be venting here and on late stage capitalism about how shit it all is?

Do I accept that really I dont need the work to be fulfilling on every level of my consciousness andthat if I at least find it stimulating and it helps me commit to learning a skill that I can use to make money and help others then that is ultimately at least a partial win, even if my employer reaps the most benefit?

I think I am answering my own questions a bit here but I guess I would just like to talk to like minded people and maybe I can make it out of my current predicament safely and at least have a job to show for it.

This is an argument that I had with my brother a couple of weeks ago. We were talking about things we love doing and I stated that I loved gaming. My brother argues that I don't really love gaming because if i did,I would do it as a job. He goes on about how there are people that do twitch steams and earn a lot of money from it just by playing a game. He himself is a photographer, both as a job and something he does a hobby.

But.. I don't want to do a career/job in gaming. I play video games because it's a stress release, a way for me to wind down and relax, a way to escape the stresses and demands of reality. Doing it as a job is NOT the same thing, it no longer become something I do as a hobby, but rather something that HAS to be done. There would be certain rules I would have to follow: Trying to get a certain amount of followers, consistent uploads, getting the right equipment etc. Not to mention the amount of stress that would come with it, I would probably end up hating gaming if I did it as a career.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand the argument of doing something you love as a job... We all know the saying ""choose a job you love, and you'll never have to work a day in your life.""  except.. the thing you love will eventually become the thing you hate or no longer have much of an interest in anymore.

1034,Sick of it‚Äîthe BS job market is not worth it.,"I recently graduated and have had a streak of very bad luck with jobs. Last week, I had gotten hired at a company as a temp assistant and was glad to hear that they were willing to consider someone without experience in their ~specific~ field, and that they wanted to give me some experience for my resume and help me out for a few months. (Those were the words of my boss.) They didn‚Äôt even have a computer set up for me, so all I could do was file/copy/etc. 

Literally TWO DAYS later, I get a call that I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt need to come in‚Äù because they decided that they ‚Äúneed someone with more experience‚Äù in their ~specific field~. 

Wtaf? 

I‚Äôm so sick of being led on and having to bend over backwards pretending that I would just LOVE to be an underpaid paper pusher because I can‚Äôt find anything better to do with my undergrad degree. It‚Äôs humiliating and demoralizing and makes me feel like all my solid credentials / stuff I did in the past doesn‚Äôt matter at all. All of that probably doesn‚Äôt matter to employers at all, but yet, that‚Äôs how I see myself as an individual with unique strengths, so I‚Äôm not willing to lie and say my dream job is to toil at some dinky little company for years on end. 

I‚Äôm still trying to find a full time job so that I can pay rent, but I‚Äôm questioning more and more if it‚Äôs worth it if I have to sacrifice my mental health/happiness and have an enormous chunk of my earnings go towards rent. If this isn‚Äôt what I want my life to be like, why am I even trying to make it be like that?  It‚Äôs what everyone thinks I should do. 

I might try to go on unemployment if I can, but I‚Äôve never done it before and am scared of the process. It might be better for me to just move back home and work part time to save some money for the future (grad school) instead of subject myself to this dehumanizing farce.",False,i74e8n,woodscommaelle_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i74e8n/sick_of_itthe_bs_job_market_is_not_worth_it/,3,1

1036,A Rant or a Cry for Help,"Adolescence was great til I started thinking for myself and then public high school even felt like a sham to me. I ended up completing high school on my own accord online. I get full time job shortly after and enroll in college. I drop out shortly after because it felt like a sham for me also. I keep my job at the time because I feel like it's the only thing truly beneficial to me in life in regards to having what I want. Three years later, I've had seven different jobs. They all end horrendously, and my family can't help but wonder why I'm so unmotivated.

That's not really the question they need to ask themselves. I am motivated to do the things I want in life like my passions which I will never get to pursue most likely. At the moment, it feels like I'm working to keep working. I finally have my own place and I thought that would be my happiness, but I'm risking my happiness if I keep slaving to try to keep it. Is it worth it, because now I'm asking my therapist if I'm crazy for wanting to live the van life. All I do is look at google maps and imagine myself as a pinpoint in all these place I want to visit, knowing deep inside I never will be.

 Let‚Äôs say someone making $20 an hour (let's be generous) and working 40 hours a week
ears approximately $660 per week after taxes

$2200 monthly (housing, car, insurance for car, etc) Giving expenses in a high cost of living
area that would pay this wage to begin with (if you live someplace that costs less they pay
$10 an hour instead of higher rates for similar work experience, for example) = $26,400 per
year just for their basic needs for them to survive and take care of their family, and this is
being very generous and lowballing the real cost of living

660 x 52 weeks = $34,320
Meaning they can, on average, save $7920 per year

But they still have to pay for food, gasoline, car repairs, home repairs, medical emergencies,
dental visits, birthday parties, other holidays, etc...

Met's just assume they're frugal and they spend only half of their savings each year on
essentials, leaving them somehow with $3960 per year.

Would only take them 10 years of this frugal living and working to save enough to put a
down payment on a house.

That if this person got injured at work, or catches could, or some other emergency occurs in
this 10 year period of trying to save to live the American dream, and couldn't bring home

1058,"Software development skills are useless, he said, clickbaitingly.","This is more of a rant than anything else.

Background: I work full-time 1) as a software developer, 2) for a clueful software consulting company that cares about employee well-being, 3) in Finland. These three things combined put me in a massively privileged position (free healthcare, proper labor protections, 5 weeks vacation, no unpaid overtime, good wages, pleasant work environment with no-hassle remote work arrangements). Still, I've long held anti-work ideas and as I've grown older (just turned 40), I've only become more anti-capitalist and moved leftwards politically.

As I get older, the idea of continuing to work full-time on client projects that mean nothing to me personally becomes increasingly less appealing. Still, I've got a home loan to pay, so I keep doing it. 

Software development skills are generally considered valuable. From a perspective of working for someone else, they undeniably are, but if I wanted to build something on my own that would generate even just minor passive income, they're surprisingly useless.

Here's what I mean by that. I'm able to build full database-backed web sites from scratch; backend, frontend, server deployment and maintenance. But building any such site in 2020 that would actually generate meaningful income ethically without being user-hostile, scammy or sleazy (e.g. ad-based revenue tends to be one or more of these), one that would provide some valuable service to its users that they would be willing to pay a small monthly/yearly fee for? Hard enough that it essentially rounds up to being impossible.

I'm not trying to generate so much money that I'd be able to quit work altogether. I quite like my employer and the people I work with, and I'd have no problem doing some amount of contract work for them indefinitely. If something I built myself would generate as little as 500‚Äì1000‚Ç¨ income per month, I'd already be able to cut down from the 9-5 grind into something closer to a 4-day workweek without significantly affecting my total income. Thinking ""web scale"", that is a laughably small amount of dosh. And yet.

""Write what you know"", they tell writers. The same applies for software dev: if I were to build something solo, it would have to be something I know (currently, board games and, more recently, woodworking). I've spent years trying to come up with something that 1) people sharing those interests would be willing to pay for and 2) isn't already fully served by existing services (possibly for free). I can't think of anything realistic.

Another option would be to have a partner that I trust who would be the subject matter expert, with me acting as the technical implementer. Yeah, good luck with that. Trustworthy people with strong enough enthusiasm for a subject that they'd be willing to team up to build something around it, and who are in a position in their lives to do so, don't exactly grow on trees. Either you're insanely lucky and already know someone like that, or you're not and you don't. Everyone knows the old line about how hard it is to make friends as an adult. The same applies to business partners.

So yeah, not much of a point to this, just felt like I had to get this off my chest. People with the ""jUSt StArT yOuR OWn buSIneSs"" attitude can honestly fuck off.",False,i710ux,jklaiho,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i710ux/software_development_skills_are_useless_he_said/,3,1

A major complaint I have with my current job is that 10% of my paycheck is taken out for a retirement fund that's mandatory. It's incredibly frustrating to me that I don't have control over how much I put into my retirement (yes I get that retirement is important but also I could really use $200 extra a month). Retirement plan is optional at this other job. Downside is there's a 90 day probationary period before benefits kick in, and we're in a pandemic.

I loved the admin work and my team and my office. I loved the specialized things I did and feeling important, like I was actually contributing and directly seeing the results. 

Then we got a new lead. All of the problems were built on her saying we didn't listen, didn't reply to her, never communicated. In reality, my coworkers and I talked daily about how she would scold us for things we did but she didn't see, never ever pick up the phone or respond when we needed her, and didn't check the company spreadsheets she hounded for us to fill out after doing something, before proceeding to do things on it that we already finished. 

She got me and my coworker fired. On the phone they mentioned multiple specific instances where I wasn't the only resource but nonetheless responded within 10 minutes to the request. Small mistakes I made and corrected. I mentioned the fact I did the bulk of the work on one project because nobody was helping me, not even her as she got mad that I wasn't fast enough sometimes (but always met deadlines). They didn't answer about any of it. I just couldn't keep up, apparently.

I feel heartbroken. Hours of overtime per month and feeling proud of my contributions. Hours of time doing specialized work and making templates they no longer will have access to because they fired the two people who used them. For nothing.

1126,Should I quit my job? See body,"So I‚Äôm highly functioning autism to the point where I can live and do tasks on my own without help. My deficiencies come socially but are mild compared to most. I currently work in an office where I only make 37K a year and it‚Äôs just high pressure deadline work and metrics and report cards and the like. Very stressful. Always being watched and graded and coached.

The job itself is not hard but I truthfully just don‚Äôt give a fuck anymore. The only thing keeping me here is good management. They are stressful but good people as a whole. 

I posted here a few days ago but I really want to quit. I have 45K saved up and I can pay off my 30K in student loans and sort of start over in life. I don‚Äôt need to be rich or own a Lamborghini. I literally just want to be spend time with family and friends and watch/follow/gamble on sports obsessively as my special interest. Anything else just comes along.

I‚Äôm 24 and I‚Äôve been this way my entire life. Let me live my life how I want to live it. Fuck the rat race.

I currently make about $700 a week on my phone so I could use that to live until I find another apartment (and job) I suppose. It‚Äôs volatile but I have a lot of savings and can live for several months on what I have if need be.

I‚Äôm just tired of working 40 hours a week on shit I don‚Äôt give a fuck about. I‚Äôm away from my newborn niece and family too. I don‚Äôt know where to go but I‚Äôm lucky at 24 I have flexibility.

Any advice? I don‚Äôt even mind working. I just hate the corporate lifestyle and get so anxious because of it that I stop breathing. The corporate life is soul sucking and cult like.

I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way. It‚Äôs an epidemic. I know adults who are alcoholic and/or addicted to nicotine in their 30-40‚Äôs because they lack a coping mechanism or passion that gets them through the day and their job has ruined them.

1128,What are your thoughts on doing three 12 hour shifts as opposed to five 8 hour shifts?,"I am almost 19 years old, and i have been off work since the pandemic began, i lost my job as the brick factory i worked at closed down (which i am kinda glad for, i imagine most of you can just imagine how soul sucking a brick factory can be) 

But now it is time for me to look for a new job, and i discovered an alternative, what about 3 12 hours shifts? Sure a 12 hour shift is long and draining, but doing 3 of them, and then having FOUR days off, i would have more free time than work time yet make just as much money, i'd have the time i lacked before, to pursue my art and other life goals. That brick job, left me drained and dead with little recovery time, and i was living just to work. But i figure if i can condense my work week, i am gaining a bit of freedom over the 9-5 workers, and with those 4 days a week, i will have time and the money to plot my escape plan. 

The capitalist, wants us to work 9 to 5, 5 days a week, since it leaves the people unhappy and drained to be able to escape, the work week hangs, spread over your head and time like a dark cloud, the weekend a moment of sunshine to regain just enough energy to do it all over again, it is not designed this way because it is most efficient for productivity, but because it allows for control over the workers. Yet a lot of places, i noticed, are going with a schedule of 3 12's a week, and i feel, while it is a tough 3 days, it's better to plow through and get the work done and out of the way as fast as possible, make the money, have the 4 days of true free time to live life as i please and plan out an escape from the capitalist system, it would allow for ample recovery time, and even if you consider the first day off after the grind, as a recover day, that leaves me with 3 whole days upon which to plan my life and goals.",False,i6y3wx,ihateaspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i6y3wx/what_are_your_thoughts_on_doing_three_12_hour/,17,1
1129,Why to be anti-school too.,"Yesterday I made an anti-school \[post\](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i6qyfk/be\_antischool/) that gained some interest, but it was a low effort expression of my ideas. Here I'm trying to further conceptualise and explain these ideas in such a way as to avoid some of the disagreements I believe were more down to miscommunication than actual ideological disagreement.

The main opposition was that ""education is good, because we need knowledge and understanding to progress"". I do not disagree with this, but I believe the educational systems of schooling and education are counter productive and actively damaging to children.

(1) There are two main definitions of ""education"" which are almost diametrically opposed.

(2) the process of receiving or giving systematic instruction, especially at a school or university.

an enlightening experience.

I am arguing against (1) because through my experiences of formal schooling and educational parental practices we are inadvertently sucking the enlightening elements from children's learning. In place of definition (2) I use ""learning"" to describe the free and enjoyable exploration and assimilation of cultural ideas and concepts. This is an imperfect substitutions, but the best I currently have.

While the difference between education and learning may seem semantic it is useful to create a distinction between these terms. Education has come to refer to the compulsory, organised, educator led, systematic exchange of cultural information from one generation to the next. An extrinsically motivated process often enforced through punitive and coercive means. Learning on the other hand is best described as the self-directed and intrinsically motivated acquisition of cultural information. This is a naturally autotelic process that all humans engage in as long as they have been able to retain their evolutionary drive to explore and learn. In education we are taught how to make a clay model. Through learning we explore how to make a clay model in line with our own thoughts and feelings. The significance of this distinction is vast in regards to the effect on our learning.

School and all it's associates (preschools, further education, higher education), are educational institutions that provide some form of access to learning opportunities, though they come with conditions and, for children, are mandatory. You have to be there and you have to learn what's on the curriculum, regardless of your personal interest or investment. Indeed, schooling will often reduce opportunities to engage in self-directed learning. While there is some specific knowledge that it is vital for children to know, school is not best way to ensure children have access to and understand the importance of this information.

Humans are born with the drive to learn pre-installed, it is an evolutionary trait fundamental to our success as a species and our continued development as a civilisation. The greatest strength of learning is that it is intrinsically motivated, meaning we do not need external rewards or threats to motivate us to do anything about it. It's like a perpetual motion machine and all it needs is space to keep moving. The problem is that extrinsic motivation, motivation to gain rewards or avoid punishments, is seductive and powerful. In fact, if we begin to offer extrinsic motivators for an existing intrinsically motivated behaviour, the intrinsic motivation disappears and does not easily return. While intrinsic motivation is self-perpetuating, extrinsic motivation requires constant reinforcement or else the learned behaviors deteriorate and may eventually disappear. Furthermore, we are far more creative when learning, exploring or expressing through intrinsically motivated autotelic means, because we have nothing to lose. If you want your reward you are going to take the safe option every time. You know it gets the job done, so why risk creativity.

Our educational institutions are built on extrinsic motivators for the very reason that it was necessary to use coercive means to get children to learn this stuff. Children are emphatically not intrinsically motivated to learn everything on the curriculum. While it could have been argued that we needed to give children this vital knowledge base in order to ensure their future success and survival this is no longer the case. The advent of the internet and the smartphone have given almost everyone immediate access to the entire collection of humanities recorded knowledge, or at least more than enough to get you started on any field of knowledge you may want to engage with. As a result, our educational institutions are obsolete, now only providing laboured access to semi-knowledgeable individuals (teachers) in an environment of stifled creativity and authoritarianism. Even the niche fields of brilliant academics can often be accessed online. The only reason access to some knowledge is still limited is that exploitative Luddites are trying to prop up a cash cow that has recently become deceased.

With this obsolescence, school has become little more than a holding pen for children to waste their lives in, waiting for their parents to get home from wasting their lives at work. Talk about dystopian! Not only this, but the archaic practices of a fundamentally flawed education system are actively damaging the mental and emotional well-being of our children at a time when they are most highly responsive to learning and most vulnerable to trauma. The damage lasts a lifetime and many never get back what they have taken from them. I will not even begin to delve into the damage a conformist system has on those who are neurological, physiologically, or experientially unable to conform.

Our defense of ""education"" stems from a lack of understanding of children's true abilities. Children are voracious learners who only stop when they find something more interesting or collide with an immovable authoritarian object, such as a teacher with a schedule to maintain. There is an alternative, but it is radically different from anything in existence today and not something I am yet able to effectively paint a picture of. It will however take a drastically different, community based format where an open learning environment is created for people of all ages to learn together, sharing knowledge and working collaboratively. Where parents, free from work are actively engaged in every aspect of their child's learning process, providing a cultural and emotional anchor from which a child can, and will, find their own feet.

Not only is this the natural progression from the counter-oppressive antiwork attitude, but it is a means of explosive creative diversity when done right and a radical change that will be necessary for the adaptation of the human race to suit the needs of our unpredictable future.

This is but a fraction of my thinking that I've been able to force out through my fingers, but I hope it has at least created some discomfort with the idea of sending children to school, that you did not have before. School is no place for a child.

I am very keen to discuss any perceived flaws in my line of argument as I am still very much working it all out for myself.

1132,I wish that I had less Hypocrisy for the Homeless," 

Hello everyone, is been a while since I created a post in here, I had many faces and many life events none of which were at the same level as the vagabonds on this sub (Maybe when my wife and I left home and had to sleep in my financed car for some weeks with no income) but even so I wasn't a true vagabond at heart. Sometimes I dance with the idea, especially knowing how meaningless it is having to do something for +40 hours to receive papers in which everyone in society agreed in the monetary value of it, even so to the point of judging other people's values by the amount of money they hoard.

I include myself in this mess since I never helped any homeless and don't even acknowledge them on the streets because they are ""crazy"" or just a ""druggie"". This mindset buggies me, since I always been a lurker of this sub for years. Also always having trouble fitting in society's need for the constant state of production. My life situation is closer to them than to the rich, which is funny of how much the average person works for how little freedom and money they have. The majority of those that have to work don't have access to healthcare and are not even the honor of the roof they live in, they are 2 to 3 paychecks away to becoming homeless.

Of course, I want homeless to have shelter, to receive aid, to receive better jobs, psych help if need it, but those are concepts that go in the political field if I truly believed I would do something to help, either preaching the word or volunteering. I feel even worse than my paycheck goes 80% on bills, the rest I use for traveling, which is something that I could do without working. Right now I am sitting on my porch reading a book, looking at the trees as the wind and sun interact with the scenery and I feel satisfied, this is what makes me happy, it is my day off and I think of how privilege I am, but why should I feel this way? Why I have to work +40 hours overnight if my needs are that simple and why is there more people who can't afford even that, that they can't have a roof over their heads and the simple need for food it is something to keep in mind every day.

Anyway, an outflow from my day off, hope it is understandable, a long time lurker, and wish anyone reading this post the best.

We didn't evolve for this. I don't care if I'd have a life expectation of thirty, I'd rather be able to build myself a shelter if I need one. I want to be able to go catch fish if I'm hungry. I can't stand having to pretend like I'm not wishing I was dead while people ask me nonsense questions while they decide whether or not I'm worthy of food and shelter.

&amp;#x200B;

And what else, these problems seem so manufactured. Why does housing need to be so expensive? There isn't a shortage of buildings, or a shortage of land to build them on. The government makes ridiculous zoning laws so apartments can't be built, and the rich buy up as many houses as they can as investments or vacation homes. It's like everyone on top is trying to make it obscenely expensive for me to have the basic human need of shelter, why? To make sure this stupid carrot and stick system of making sure humans are productive enough has a bigger stick?",False,i3ezem,Jestdrum,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i3ezem/how_does_anyone_deal_with_this_stress/,14,1

I LAUK

Asking on behalf of my parents, who are going through a tough time and would appreciate any advice. His relates to England.

They let out a flat to tenants who were self employed. Their incomes were badly affected by Moved although they did receive self
employed support scheme payment . By parents agreed to reduce their rent to 80% for 6 months with a view to pay back the arrears
from their deposit.

They have handed in their notice but have fled the country (to turkey) without paying their last months rent and have taken the keys.
There are also outstanding utility and council tax bills unpaid.

Is there anything my parents could do to try and recover the money from Turkey? | appreciate it might be a long shot but any help
welcome.

Sorry if I've missed any detail and will try and respond to any questions.

I haven‚Äôt returned to teaching for several reasons. After I quit, I was so burnt out I couldn‚Äôt do anything but live off of my savings and shut myself in. 

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about work and stability. I wanted to see why other people got into teaching and why those same people left (or want to leave).

Personally, I just couldn‚Äôt work anymore. I was so emotionally and physically exhausted. I worked seven days a week because it never seemed like I could get ahead of all of my responsibilities. I was totally alienated from my peers as well. Almost everyone there hated being there. The second the work day was over, people packed their things so they could spend a few meager hours with their families before they had to shut in and grade. The job was also to be done at home‚Äîthis meant we were also alienated from our families. 

Teaching, in its current model, basically requires you to work two jobs. The school only pays you for direct instruction. They do not treat planning as part of the job. That‚Äôs not my main issue, though. If you care about the children or the nature of the work, it wouldn‚Äôt matter how much schools dedicated to compensation. I don‚Äôt want to work two jobs and be paid for two jobs. I just want to work and be paid to perform one job. I actually enjoyed thinking of lessons and preparing them until I had to do so very much of it. 

I found the work I was assigning was pretty pointless. It was all career based. It was all numbers pushing. There was an obsession with standardized testing and SAT or ACT scores. The administration was obsessed with the school‚Äôs letter grade the same way capitalists are obsessed with GDP or some other shit that doesn‚Äôt reflect the quality of life for the average person. Education is actually really subjective. There is this constant pressure to measure output, however. 

The schools also focus on certain subjects, like English and Math. The school was so in need of core teachers that I, a person who has a license to teach History, was hired as an English teacher because of some previous tutoring experience. If you can find a job within your subject area, your focus isn‚Äôt very much respected anyway.

1188,"Seriously, how do you actually get a job? It feels like an impossible thing. One of the reasons I support a job guarantee program and universal programs for basic biological needs: to break the mold of workplace ""productivity"" coercion","Don't have a degree? Get a degree. Got a degree? Get a better degree. Have a good degree? You are overqualified. Or should have gotten an internship. The individual is to blame, not the system. Just because 1000 people apply for a single-spot internship doesn't mean the system is broken, you are just a bad candidate. Oh, we shipped more jobs to China. Don't worry about it. We get access to their educated workforce as well. It is great for consumers and our bottom line!

Have crippling debt and even worse depression? Tough shit, that's just life. Get used to it. You think your low wage job sucks? I did even worse for way less pay and never complained!

Get a job. Join the cult. Gatekeep others today.

So if jobs are so important, why are they so difficult to get? And even if you get one, eventually it is a lower hanging one that only allows you to gain skills for other lower hanging jobs. It isn't like the $7.25 minimum wage work is training you to become a doctor, engineer, coder, or something difficult but rewarding. No, the joke becomes that you have to get into massive amounts of debt for the potential of getting something that isn't retail or fast food. To join a company cult and become indoctrinated. And this requires you to not have had any issues physically or mentally when growing up. And the ability to read at a college and post college level (surprisingly rare in the USA).

So why is getting a good job so difficult? Systemically, there are a lot of factors at play. But no one is ""allowed"" to criticize the system so the individual is the only thing society focuses on as a distraction.

1190,Being furloughed was the best thing that ever happened to me.,"I‚Äôve been working for about 10 years now in various different office jobs, the basic 9-5. I was being made redundant in March this year just before lockdown and luckily (I thought) got a job lined up for April. However, then lockdown started due to COVID-19 and my start date for my new job was delayed until 1st July. Between March and 1st of July I was easily the happiest I‚Äôve been in the last 10 years. No stress of commuting every day, no 8 hour days of bull shit office work, no anxiety about my job. Every day between March and July was built around what I wanted to do and what made me happy. I didn‚Äôt realise how depressed working the same corporate 9-5 made me. Anyway, I‚Äôve been in my new job for a month and I already wish I was back on furlough as I can feel the depression/anxiety coming back every Sunday night and all through the week.

1193,Just a little vent,"Sorry for how long this will be! 

Just found this subreddit that perfectly sums up my feelings (especially since COVID started) about my job / work in general. Just thought I‚Äôd rant to people that would know how I‚Äôm feeling. I can‚Äôt complain to a lot of my family because they just say ‚Äúwell you have to work, it is what it is‚Äù ‚Äújust go back to school‚Äù (idk what I‚Äôd get another degree in, and also easier said than done, and more debt), ‚Äújust get another job‚Äù (again, easier said than done), ‚Äúyou have a good job, just suck it up.‚Äù

I have a bachelors in psychology. I was originally planning on getting a masters or phd and going into academia or maybe going for therapy / social work for veterans. That did not end up happening; getting to know myself better, I knew I would be a poor fit for those jobs and I HATED school. College was miserable for me. 

Right after I graduated, I went to work managing short term disability claims for a Fortune 500 company. The perks: the pay allows me to live comfortably, I don‚Äôt have to work evenings / holidays / nights, my manager and most of my coworkers are awesome, I have full WFH schedule since COVID.  The cons: boring office job, stuck behind a desk for 8 - 8.5 hrs per day, the work is stressful and too much for one person to handle, you‚Äôre on the phone with disgruntled/rude people for most of the day, everything you do is ranked by metrics (ex. Calls taken, calls made, claim decisions made, etc). 

Our workload has doubled in the past several months due to COVID and there is no end in sight. Another office is in an even worse spot than we are so we need to help them and weren‚Äôt even asked if we wanted to. So because we‚Äôre helping them, we are now falling even more behind. Our department is basically going up in flames and there isn‚Äôt any relief for this coming. People are constantly quitting, going out on leave, calling out randomly. If they don‚Äôt flake out on work then they are constantly stressed, snapping, crying, or just generally miserable / anxious / depressed. And the work keeps piling on us because the more people that get COVID, the more claims we get. The more claims we get, the more calls we get, which then puts us behind, which increases call volume,  which puts us more behind because we‚Äôre stuck getting a new call every 2 minutes. It‚Äôs a never ending cycle. So when people get a call, they don‚Äôt pick it up and let it roll over to the next person because they‚Äôre trying to get caught up. Then they get in trouble because they didn‚Äôt pick up the call. But then they also get in trouble because they‚Äôre not day-current on their daily tasks. Wtf? Our workload is over double what it ‚Äúshould‚Äù be, something has to give eventually and we‚Äôre only human. 

Then even at the best of times, the people that don‚Äôt do their job and just sit around don‚Äôt ever get reprimanded, or just get a slap on the wrist. And then the people that do their work then have to do more work because they have to pick up the slack from the other people. So I‚Äôm getting paid the same as this person who isn‚Äôt doing their job. So why would I do mine?? I could just go sit on the couch and clock out at 4:30 and say I was working. 

Every day I fight the urge to quit. But what would I do then?? I have to have something else lined up. Like it or not, we need money to survive. I have absolutely no clue what I want to do for a job. I want to not work and have more time to do what I enjoy. My grandfather passed away last week and didn‚Äôt get to do some things he had been wanting to do. It made me realize life is too short to put up with this nonsense. I want to go hiking and camping with my dog, i want to go on road trips, I want to spend more time with my aging horse while I still can, I want to spend more time reading and writing. But at the end of the work day, I‚Äôm so drained all I can do is watch tv. And then I go to bed dreading waking up the next morning. 

If I had to pick a dream job, it would be an author or a pilot. Unfortunately, both are a little far fetched for me. Making enough money as an author to live off of is a combination of luck and great talent, and to be a pilot you need big bucks to go through the training. Plus the aviation industry won‚Äôt be doing too hot for quite a while because of COVID. 

Basically just feeling really stuck and depressed right now. If this is how the rest of my life is going to be, then I‚Äôm not looking forward to it.",False,i2lnbx,apndi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i2lnbx/just_a_little_vent/,4,1

Abstract

Poverty persists in America even amidst
the world‚Äôs richest nation. Attempts to
attribute longer poverty to social
barriers, such as racial discrimination or
lack of jobs, have failed. Some scholars
now attribute poverty to culture in the
sense that many poor become disillusioned

and no longer seek to advance themselves.

But even with all that, each day was a count down until the vacation was over. And I still wish we could've done more to make the most of our time. Now it's Sunday night before returning to the grind in the morning, and I just have this heavy feeling of depression. Why is it so much harder to return the longer a vacation is? Is this what life will be for me for likely the next 50 years?

1209,work burnout,"Credits from : #OldtimerMarlon #oldtimermarlon


I didn't realize that 2 veins in my heart were blocked which required 4 stents. I didn't have a major heart attack, but I just felt shortness of breath. I thought I was healthy. I have no vices, I eat right and exercise regularly. So why am I showing this? Sometimes, small symptoms may appear in our body that we ignore, hence, we are caught off guard that there is a bigger issue inside our bodies.


Much like the gradual blockages in my veins, we always hear people getting burned, or suffering burn-out from their jobs or business without them knowing.  Suddenly, they start snapping at home or in the office, or could not breath because of an anxiety/panic attack. Some people are so focused on climbing the corporate ladder, and so emotionally invested in their work that they neglected their social life, family, hobbies and even the creative part of themselves. 


For those engaged in business, the threat of competition or losing a market share gave them sleepless nights, fueled by worries of company debt, falling revenues, employee productivity, etc. The job or business took over their lives to the point of suffering mental anguish and physical pain just to stay ahead. They simply cannot detach themselves to what they do for a living for fear of letting themselves down, their boss, their employees, and co-workers. 


The trap known as the rat race was already set in motion in them without them knowing it. Sooner or later, the breakdown will happen-physically and mentally. When it did, everything had to stop and hopefully not including their heartbeat. Crying and wailing ensues, thinking that they have failed themselves, their boss, company, employees, colleagues, etc., and even life itself leading to suicidal thoughts as the last resort.


Actually, they've already damaged their lives once they've hit the road for the race that can never be won.


 What‚Äôs the solution then? Change your dammed mindset from attachment to detachment. Drill into your mind that your job or business is not your life, nor an extension of your being who you are and what you are.  


Your self-worth is not your net worth; your income, position in the company, business accomplishments, etc. It‚Äôs like saying, ‚ÄúWhat does it matter if you gain the whole world but loses your soul in return?‚Äù What did you really gain in return if you lost your family, friends, your health and peace of mind for something that will later come to pass?


You‚Äôre replaceable in your work, but not to your love ones. The business will move on, the job that you cherish shall be taken over by others, and all that they will give you is a moment of silence if you don‚Äôt make it back alive. 


Take back your life and refresh your soul by seeking your long lost faith, your family, your friends and all the significant others in your life. Always remember, you are not your job, you are not your business.


Those are just avenues for income and profit. It should be treated as a separate entity that will do things for you rather than you doing things for it. You should start focusing on what it is for you, for your wallet, and personal growth. It‚Äôs all about you, not them (or it) anyway. Those things solely exist to satisfy your needs, and your lifestyle.


If the business is failing, cut your losses, let it die on the wayside and move to another. If your present job is driving you nuts, enhance your employability (remember Oldtimer Series Part 3 &amp; 4) explore your entrepreneurial or creative side if you have time (Oldtimer Series Part 5) or let your bitter half do the side hustle if you don‚Äôt have the time.

1210,"Have worked through this pandemic and made less money than those not working, had my job held over my head, and became more stressed than ever.","Sorry for the rant, but I need to get this out. I'm 21 and a debt collector for two very large banks who finance for multiple stores. Ive worked here for 2 years and have been a in the top 15% of collectors multiple times (over 300 associates). But its never good enough. Right now im paid $17 an hour. Its not bad, except for the fact ever at that rate I still can't afford a place to live and have money to put into savings. My time here has been nothing but negative. Every day we receive emails with our stats that constantly remind you you aren't meeting goal stats (even when im a top collector im not meeting goals because those stats don't determine your collecting like they think and tell us they do). Supervisors constantly reminding you you're not meeting goals and pitting you against everyone else.
One of my supervisors is a snake and I despise him. 6 months ago he called me in his office saying I broke a rule (which wasn't a rule) but he saved me from the corrective so now I owe him. He constantly has it out for people and will manipulate you non stop. The higher ups aren't any help and will do the same thing. If you have a legitimate argument with stats and facts to back it up they use hypothetical numbers to confuse you then talk circles around you until you give up. 
I collect the company over $360,000 a year and make less than $35k before taxes. And yet through this whole pandemic my supervisors have been holding my job over my head because I'm not ranking (still collecting $30k+ a month). They don't care that im not ranking because i didn't cheat to build a pipeline of payments 12 months out and can now focus of collecting for other months instead of same month. I, and every other bottom collector, collect about $20k more same month than the top collectors who collect MAYBE $9K same month. Of course we can't catch up though because we are on correctives for ranking and don't have the 6 months to build up a pipeline large enough to compete with those top collectors. The bank ultimately prospers off this though as they have the top collectors floating on pipelines and collecting for a year out, and then us bottom collectors collecting same month payments just to try to stay afloat. We are working to pay the bonuses (the past couple months have been $5k incentive checks for the top 15%) for the top collectors while being shit on and told we should feel grateful for our job. 
While I'm having meetings every day with my supervisors chewing me out for not being as productive as they want me to be because I ran out of my medications three weeks earlier than I was supposed to because I trippled my daily prescription just to operate on the level they wanted me to (despite my stats showing I rank in the top when I make fewer calls and not burn myself out) people are collecting unemployment and making almost 2 times more than i make in a month. While I'm trying to juggle my job, the risk of homelessness, family crisis, and my own mental health, people are going on shopping sprees. 
They dont care about me. Back in February they called me in their office and asked what they could do to help me perform again. They didn't even bat an eye when I told them I need 140 mg of adderal as thats what i was taking the 3 months prior that I ranked while working 70 hour weeks. They dont care that my body aches, it feels like im having a heart attack, and can't sleep for days on end because of what I have to do to work the way they want me to.",False,i4g8p0,mercuryhg17,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i4g8p0/have_worked_through_this_pandemic_and_made_less/,9,1

I've worked throughout the pandemic as a keyworker. It's been horrendous. I'm not a nurse or anything, I'm a pest control technician. I can't wait to leave. 

The company wasnt clear on what they wanted from us at the start of the pandemic. So my colleagues booked things off wrong because they had no other instructions. Now 3 people have been dismissed for gross misconduct. I've been so tired these past 6 months that I was getting anxious I'd done something similar without realising. It would have been an admin error really, but grounds for gross misconduct.

The pay is shit. They advertise a graduate scheme when it isnt. I've had to bash the heads in of over 100 rats in lock down and I thought I could do it. I was desperate enough for the job to deal with it. But I can't anymore. 

I've been covering 3 different people too for the past 6 months. Some who've been on long term 'sick' too. (when in reality they backed out when shit hit the fan with covid). 

I'm just done with it. 45 hour week (supposed to be 40 but you end up working your lunch break). Disgruntled customers who don't want me to help them and who won't help themselves. For what? There was rumour of a bonus at the last team meeting. Instead they're putting trackers in our vans and making it so they can take hours from us as and when they like. Not even a thank you for the hard work during a global pandemic. 

Oh and they're taking ¬£750 off my last paycheck for training. (Such bullshit really).

I'm glad to be going. I gave my heart and soul and it still wasn't enough. I'm just done. 

I wanna get out before shit hits the fan for me too. I've another job lined up anyway. I was offered it in march and they've yet to rescind the offer despite me asking every couple of weeks so I'm hopeful.

The best bit? I can go live with my partner. If we go into lockdown again I dont have to not see him for 10 weeks. We'll figure it all out even if this job doesn't want me. The new job is a civil service job. So if they still want me at least it's better pay by a lot, flexible hours and less hours.

hi all,

would like some opinions please. I have been trying to slowly claw my time back from work (i used to do 10-12 hour days). I have started at a new company in late May and it has a reputation for good work life balance, which is why i moved there.

I have unfortunately joined a team that doesn't do 9-5; my manager and a colleague seem to do long days (finishing at 7/730, skipping lunch etc). Now what i suspect is, the manager has masked a problem and just worked longer and harder over the years, shielding the need for more staff.

Now, as i am new, i am doing longer hours partly as everything is new to me, so first time takes time, but i found myself working saturday morning this weekend as i have a lot of work to.

Now i dont want to set a precedent, but i also dont want to be an asshole, but at some point i want to pivot back to the 9-5 as close as, not feel guilty and make clear of my boundary. Now thats all easier said than done for me, as i feel somewhat guilty but also i am trying to claw time back without pissing off the team (they are quite decent).

1251,A rant about the nature of work and some other thoughts about it,"Hi all, been a long time lurker here, first time poster :) First off, I'd like to express a thank you to this community for being one of the few places both online and in RL that express the same sentiments and thoughts I have about work. For a long time I thought I was the only person who felt this way. I was surrounded by people hungry for more work, who identified with their careers or were aggressively competitive to achieve goals I just couldn't understand (ie: become next second assistant manager of Corporation X etc). I thought it was all bunkum but I never expressed it, I was too afraid of being marked out as weird/lazy/socialist/freeloader. Even now, although I have revealed my thoughts and feelings about work to one or two people, I'm still pretty careful about what I say. Career Culture is strong. But here, even the very idea of no work at all ever again is celebrated (such an extremist idea from where I've come from) :) so thank you.

At the moment I am currently working full-time in marketing for a non-profit. I am on medical leave for about a week and a half for work-related stress and anxiety. Right now, I feel so much calmer and settled. I will be seeing a psychologist in a few weeks to sort of a number of issues, but I've often wondered would it be even necessary if I never had to work again or at least, work far less hours? I've also wondered if a lot of mental health issues around the world could easily be resolved with less or even no work? 

I think the thing that irks me the most about most of the jobs I've ever had... is the inanity and lack of purpose or point behind them. Oh sure there is a ""point"" to it - paycheck! But any other meaning it had was to me so abstract, so removed from reality it often made me question why we did such activities. An example would be formatting fancy pants documentation for government consumption, but knowing these would be rarely read, almost never adhered to and would end up at the bottom of some bureaucrat's dusty paper stack. It was just to ensure another box was ticked. At my current position, I hardly see the connection between what I do and the workplace's goals. Or that even my work contributes at all to benefit our non-profit's recipients. 

On top of all that, there are the endless meetings where nothing of true value is discussed or concluded upon, the managing of personalities and politics, the cringy team building activities that were created in order to force build friendships between people. All this ""cream and cherries on top"" just adds to the sheer inanity of my current job. It seems to be IMHO that most modern day work is ultimately empty and has no intrinsic value besides ensuring people have a paycheck to keep them from being homeless.

Over time as I dealt with this, I have become more and more despondent. As of late, I have reached a point where I questioned even the point of existing, if all it was... was endless, pointless work? The fact that we trade up finite precious time to do empty meaningless work just to survive? It is as if our lives our marked with a monetary value and we are reduced down to just economic input/output units. It was this entrapment and dehumanization that spurred my despair and anger into life. We are given enough to not drown (sometimes not even then), but never enough to clamber onto the shore. 

I tried to manage this growing despair and sense of meaningless, so I did the usual; journal, exercise, attempt to establish some sleeping pattern (didn't really work), talk it out with friends and family (but I couldn't really express just how deep my hopelessness went), I applied for new jobs (part-time roles, but in this day and age, jobs are hard to come by and every job has a hundred applicants or more), I attempted to upskill (hard to do on an FT position, just too tired to do anything), tried to consider employment through different perspectives and of course, browsing r/antiwork

At best, some of these methods mitigated my despair and constant questioning, but eventually that sense of hopelessness, overwhelm and meaningless came to colour my whole world. I would attend work each day, my stomach roiling and my heart hammering, dreading the day ahead. As of late, I went to the doctor, expressed what was going on in regards to my mental health, and she was sympathetic towards me - which was surprising. We organized some medical leave, counselling and anti-depressants. The anti-depressants are what helped me work full time once upon a time. I decided to go off them earlier this year due to feeling extremely flat and emotionless about most things in my life. It turns out zombifying your brain is how one is able to cope with FT work. I have a little bit of hope back regardless of this. 

I'm not sure what I'll do next, I'll enjoy my time off as much as I can but after that...Idk. I'm sorry for the long post, I feel that there is nowhere or no one else I can truly express the depths of my thoughts or feelings on this topic. So thank you for reading if you have gotten this far.

1254,Don't ever feel bad about work (or not working),"Right after my graduation, a girl on my course posted that she had found her dream job in law. At the time I looked the firm up and felt super jealous. She basically had her life sorted straight out of college and I was struggling through applications and temp jobs.

Around 4 years later,  a recruitment agency headhunted me and asked if I would be interested in a certain firm. It rung a bell and after googling I realised it's the same firm my old friend had got the dream job at years before. Two interviews later and I got the job too!

I was thinking well good things come to those who wait. Then it turned out the boss was massively abusive, always playing the blame game. Refused to provide training and was racist and at one time ""jokingly"" pushed me into a cupboard. Expected a fuckload of unpaid overtime but was never thankful, banned staff from talking about salaries (that's illegal here).

I thought I could turn to my old friend but she was unrecognizable. She pushed other staff under the bus at every chance. After her initial post, she never mentioned how bad the firm was. She must have felt the same but then hardened and became cold like the bosses. I can only imagine she swallowed her feelings and did everything to fit in.

Well, I could not. After 9 months of weeping on the way in and in the cubicles and deteriorating mental health, I took the leap. I left a job with guaranteed good pay and progression and jumped into the unknown. Unemployment. And it's honestly the best decision I ever made. I still feel euphoria at how I escaped that place.

Tldr: this just goes to show regardless what people post, you don't know the real story. You may think you're missing out when the reality is in fact awful and you dodged a bullet. Don't compare yourselves and always put your (mental) health first.

My company finally announced that 70% of us are being furloughed starting 8/8 (the bastards waited until after the $600 expired). 

I manage the content on the website and the store but get paid shit. And since May we've been only paid 80%. 

But here's what gets me. Because I get paid shit, and we've been working with 80% pay since May, Unemployment + the tentative $200 would basically get me up to my weekly pay after taxes anyways.  

 All my coworkers are up in arms - looking for new jobs (I might do that too). But I don't feel bad. Family and friends keep checking in on me - asking if I'm OK. **And to be honest, I'm kinda excited.** There are so many games I've been wanting to play. So many shows I want to binge.

1257,A favourite book - Stone Age Economics by Marshall Sahlins,"I am curious who else has read the above paper / book.  It has been influential on me and my minimalism journey.  I dont fully agree with all of the premises but i do think it was true at the time (stone age) but harder to achieve now given how society is in the throes of consumption.  

I find myself yearning for its simplicity but not yet sure how i carve that for me.  

the key part that stands out for me is the notion of ""original affluent society"" - Taken from wikipedia for ease:

&amp;#x200B;

 Through knowledge of their environment hunter-gatherers are able to change what foreigners may deem as meager and unreliable natural resources into rich subsistence resources. Through this they are able to effectively and efficiently provide for themselves and minimize the amount of time spent procuring food. ""\[T\]he food quest is so successful that half the time the people do not know what to do with themselves"".[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_affluent_society#cite_note-sahlins-new-3) Hunter-gatherers also experience ""affluence without abundance""[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_affluent_society#cite_note-sahlins-new-3) as they simply meet their required ends and do not require surplus nor material possessions (as these would be a hindrance to their [nomadic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad) lifestyle). The lack of surplus also demonstrates that they trust their [environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_environment) will continuously provide for them. By foraging only for their immediate needs among plentiful resources, hunter-gatherers are able to increase the amount of [leisure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure) time available to them. Thus, despite living in what western society deems to be material poverty, hunter-gatherer societies work less than people practicing other modes of subsistence while still providing for all their needs, and therefore increase their amount of leisure time. These are the reasons the original affluent society is that of the hunter-gatherer.",False,i3ghwe,mjobby,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i3ghwe/a_favourite_book_stone_age_economics_by_marshall/,0,1

1265,Power tip #2: bound your productivity,"your ""work"", or your job, is a relationship between you and another entity in which both parties try to maximize the profit they can extract from the other. the problem is that in general, there exists a large intellectual and power differential between the strategic capability of winning this game between the sole employee vs the corporation which has teams of experts dedicated towards widening this power dynamic ever further in the name of profit.

this dynamic translates to a work condition for the employee that relentlessly approaches the conditions of slavery -- no pay for exhaustingly laborious work. keeping this in mind, it is imperative to take the appropriate measures at both an individual and communal level to ensure that you are at least not complacent in allowing this quality of life degradation to proceed at full pace.

bounding your productivity is something that anyone (blue to white collar) can and should be exercising to both maximize their quality of life and fend off an increasingly dystopian workplace which inevitably leads to greater income inequality for all. here are some generalized tips around this matter.

1. **estimate the minimum level of productivity required to maintain your job.** for example, if you are an hourly dishwasher and know that washing 100 dishes per hour is good enough to satisfactorily ensure job stability, then there is no reason to make yourself go at a pace that achieves 101 dishes per hour. be cognizant of the fact that this extra effort, if expended, is you _voluntarily_ working for free and eating the full costs of labor and giving the full profit to your employer (who is at war with you). if it's rush hour and the restaurant is backed up, that is not your fault -- there should be more dishwashers. if you are comfortable talking with your coworkers, this is a good mindset to share as it will alleviate significant pressure not just on you, but on _everyone_. fostering reward-less competition and peer pressure amongst coworkers is a strong tactic used by the employers to increase stress and productivity -- costs that you pay but profits they take exclusively.
2. **realize the law of diminishing returns wants you to do less**. as visualized here[0], an application of this law posits that the harder you work beyond your minimum level of productivity, the less value you gain _in proportion to each additional unit of energy expended_. this is bad for you. the more bad it is for you, the more beneficial it is to your employer as it asymptotically approaches the financial model of free slave labor. for example, this can be thought of as the following: you get paid 10$ for washing 100 dishes. you get 15$ for washing 200 dishes. assuming the effort of washing dishes is nontrivial, you would be best off maximizing your returns if you wash 100 dishes for 10$, and then go do something else that has the value of at least about 3$ an hour, such as another job or relaxing. the 3$ as opposed to 5$ is to make up for the fact that washing those additional 100 dishes is more exhausting than the first 100 dishes just like running the last mile of a marathon is more costly for your body than running the first mile -- therefore you don't actually realize the full 5$ of reward.
3. **discuss these dynamics with like-minded peers**. in the usa, it is illegal to prevent employees from discussing salaries and pay rates. you should aim to be more comfortable discussing this with peers because the employers cultivate and leverage this taboo-culture to ensure they can pay you less than your coworkers who does the same job. in the end, it only hurts the employees. first step towards this is to learn to approach these topics in a safe and calm manner. the sooner employees stop being ignorant and silently complacent is the sooner you can aim to improve your situation. remember, you are getting ripped off -- almost by definition of having a job -- and you won't get a refund on this. that's why you this is a hot issue and you are incentivized to address it asap. you don't want to end up doing this too late as the poor employees of this famous company did recently [1].

In fact, it‚Äôs worse ‚Äî they think they understand, but are flawed. this leads to massive losses that are hard to see as they‚Äôre not tangible beyond slowly seeping consequences such as frustration.

it is faulty to believe that your workplace is your friend, ally, or your superior. it is faulty to think that you should be extraordinarily grateful to have a job. if you play the game of friendship with an agency that is playing the game of maximizing personal profits at the expense of others, you will lose. this is corroborated by the fact that you are on this sub in a miserable state of mind.

realize that your employer‚Äôs entire relationship with you is defined by their attempts to maximize profits off you ‚Äî how much they can steal and get away with. this comes in many forms in which they give you less value than the value you provide them. search wikipedia for ‚Äúscrips‚Äù.

I just...

The job is quite easy, even though the learning curve was quite steep, but once you get the hang of it, it's quite nice. Bosses treat me good and I like everything about the job really, except for the pay, and also except for the fact that I despise work.

I do not want to wake up every day and do this shit for 8 hours and I hate that it has become normalized in our societies, that we have to do this until we die.

So I am currently exploring real ways on how to escape this lifestyle, I would really like to retire before I am 40, but that is of course just a dream as of now.

My current plan is becoming a real estate agent where I should definitely be able to make at least 1.5x what I am making now, and with possibilites of making a lot more if I work harder.

With my savings, I am going to invest them in stock options and index funds, and by using the power of compound interest, I should have enough money by the time I am 40 to ""retire"" (basically just work if I want to, or when I want to). I have also explored some options by buying properties and renting them out, or just doing fixer uppers, but that takes more capital than I have as of now.

I am actually a quite ""lazy"" person, I do not like to work at all, and I prefer to do my hobbies all the time, video games, fitness and weight lifting, painting, hiking, photography and more.

I'm studying law, got into it for idealistic reasons and while they still arent illegitimate goals or unattainable, I just dont think that the actual work will make me happy or fulfilled. (The exploitative and alienating parts included, but what the fuck can you do...) 

I was thinking about what could be an actually helpful contribution to my surroundings, is labor that can be sold and would suit me in a way that the actual work makes me somewhat happy and also fulfilled.

Since one of my bigger strengths lies in being socially capable and while I'm no genius, I can confidently say that I have good emotional intelligence going for me, so I thought about doing social work. I volunteer in a homeless shelter, if that experience counts for anything.

Seeing as I don‚Äôt want to sign over 40hrs a week for less than what I was expecting, I want to suggest every other week having a Friday off, so I‚Äôll have a three day weekend to actually you know, live a life outside work? I know it seems like small potatoes, but this employer is in a system that is pretty engrained in a 9-5 business mentality (which is always ironic to me because they always expect you to be flexible but not the other way around). 
How should I go about suggesting this in a way that would actually get approved? I don‚Äôt need the full benefits of being a 40hrs a week employee, I have medical and stuff. Or would I just be shooting myself in the foot?

Obviously he had to relay this information to the boss, who up until this point also seemed like a good guy. Company meetings would always be round his house where he'd supply beers and order us all take out. Any concerns I'd brought up before were dealt with in great style, but today that all changed.

Within minutes I receive text that I'm absolutely needed on site as me taking a day off to cope with pain that constantly has me on the verge of tears is ""fucking up the schedule and putting the crew behind on other jobs"" in spite of the fact that the boss himself is taking on way more jobs than the company can handle causing all three crews to be behind on their jobs for the month.

1292,Livestreaming and the Commodification of the Self,"I often fantasize about how much better my life would be if I could make a living livestreaming, though the more I think about it the more it seems like an illusory escape from the 9-5 grind that instead of enabling you to extract money from your hobbies just ends up blurring the line between leisure and work so much that the distinction becomes almost non-existent - you're left with this strange amalgamation of something you do because you *have* to love it - spontaneity is crushed under the weight of expectation.

You become the commodity - your time, your personality, your entire being is branded and assessed,  never to exist privately and separate from your community ever again - you quite literally give up a part of yourself in return for the money and freedom that affords - just like a regular job.

Money is an abstraction for power, nothing more - if we want to do away with work we have to do away with money - not literally, but we have to ""kill"" our current collective conceptions of it as a real and finite resource because it isn't, and if it is those things it's only because *most of us mostly agree*.. but that agreement is The Way The World Is, not the other way around - we can invert it, together and we can meme ourselves better - or perhaps that's just a desperate attempt to cope with the hellscape that is Earth.",False,i4sxu3,thegreatself,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i4sxu3/livestreaming_and_the_commodification_of_the_self/,4,1
1293,My Experience,"Apologies for a long post. I wrote this hoping to achieve some sort of catharsis from sharing with like-minded people.
TL;DR at bottom.

I graduated college in 2011 and got a job shortly after. A couple years into the job I was ready for something more. I decided to quit and return to school to get a second bachelor's degree and pursue a career in tech. Another 2 years later, with second degree in-hand, I began searching for jobs.

Job searching is one of the most demoralizing and dehumanizing experiences a person can have. I learned that tech jobs are on a whole new level of dumpster fire. After months of applications, rejections, no responses, and getting jerked around by elitist tech recruiters with superiority complexes, I was finally hired by a large software company in a technical support role.

There was no training. Zero comprehensive training on the software I was now expected to support. Despite this I was quickly thrown into action resolving issues for clients. We were expected to ""just ask questions"" if we didn't know something. Imagine showing up to work every day having to ask your coworkers how to do your job. Having to ask how something was supposed to work. Having to ask how to go about investigating the cause of an issue. Everyone hired around the same time as me were in the same boat. This software wasn't something that could be picked up easily. At no point did I ever feel unqualified or incapable of performing my job. The problem was the knowledge of the software's complex functional and internal intricacies was a massive barrier to entry. It was the most unintuitive and broken software I've ever encountered. Even after a year, I still relied heavily on input from others to do my work.

Asking for help to do your job on a daily basis begins to affect your psyche. It damages your confidence. It makes you feel incompetant. It makes you feel like a failure. I had already begun slipping into anxiety and depression during the job search. Now the job itself was dragging me even deeper. On top of that, after the time taken by sleeping, commuting, and working, I was left with only 4 hours of personal free time a day. It was all chipping away at me. At some point I realized I wasn't doing many of my hobbies anymore. I went to bed and woke up every morning with sickening existential dread. I came home from work with no motivation or energy to do anything else. The negativity from work began to seep into my personal life. I did this for 2 years.

I eventually applied for a position in a different department of the company and was hired. I saw it as an opportunity for a fresh start and it was one of the only ways to get a promotion. At the time of starting the new job I was already well beyond the point of absolute soul-crushing burnout. There was no training. I was quickly thrown to the wolves working with clients again. Unlike the awesome people on my previous team, the people on the new team were pretentious, tryhard, wannabe yuppies. This was so far from the person I am. I grew to detest them. I had an absentee manager who largely ignored my emails asking for help or clarification on my duties. I was pushed further to the breaking point when a coworker began shit-talking me and the quality of my work both to my face and to my new team, including my manager. I will despise this individual for the rest of my existence. Despise is not a strong enough word. After several months the day finally came. My mental health was below rock bottom. I couldn't think straight anymore. I was losing the ability to function. My brain felt like a mire of TV static at lightspeed. At the end of the day I talked to my manager. I said, I'm done. I resign. Today was my last day. I just walked away. I had done everything in my power to make the job work, but at no point had this company ever invested any effort to set me up for success.

I took a couple months off to regain some of my mental health. After that I was able to get a part-time retail job while I worked on some personal projects. This was February 2020. Then coronavirus hit. When asking my manager if I could wear a mask one day, the response was, ""I'll have to check. It might alarm the customers."" Seems the company's bottom line was more important than my wellbeing.¬†Although as far from ""essential"" as you can get, this business remained open until they were legally forced to close by my state's mandatory lockdown. I was laid off the day of closing.

It's been a few months since then. I'm profoundly disillusioned with our society. My experiences left me cynical, jaded, and contemptuous toward the system as it exists. I never want to work in corporate America again. I never want to sit in an interview with some condescending HR manager testing how much boot I'm willing to lick before they'll hire me. I just want to spend my time doing things I enjoy with the people I love. I was able to find a job back at the first company I worked for after college. Back where the story started. I actually enjoy it and I'm working to monetize some of my hobbies. I am now in the best mental health of my adult life. Quitting my tech job was one of the best decisions I've ever made.

I want to extend thanks to this community for sharing your stories and helping me feel like I'm not so alone in these sentiments.

1297,Following your dreams as a career is bullshit.,"As soon as we're old enough to speak we're forced the notion of following our dreams down our throats, and it's utter horseshit. Out of all of the people who pursue their dreams as a career maybe only 1% of them actually attain them.

If you ask me, it's all a ploy to get impressionable kids to spew money into pointless university degrees and vocational courses, because if there's one thing capitalism loves more than a billionaire, it's your average Joe drowning in unnecessary debt.

The outcome goes one of 3 ways. 

1) You're one of the 1% (if that) who makes it to the top and becomes a rockstar, a racing driver or an astronaut.

2) You find success but fade into obscurity, becoming jaded by all the work you've put into it to just stagnate in mediocrity, resenting your decision to pursue this as a career, drained of all love for it,  still struggling to make ends meet each month.

3) You utterly fail. Left with nothing but a mountain of debt and the inevitable existential dread that comes with the uncertainty of what is next for you.

4 times in the last 12 years I've tried to pursue my passions (music, bartending, poker and snowboarding) as a career and 4 times I have become bitter, jaded, in debt, and resentful of my decision. I rarely pick up my guitar anymore, even playing poker for 'fun' makes me want to hurt people, I hate bars, and now the thought of travelling to go snowboarding again fills me with dread.

Now I'm quite content to just work a job I don't hate that provides financial stability and enough spare time to pursue my passions as hobbies. I don't even care what it is anymore.

Give up your dreams. Just pursue a happy, simple life.",False,i412td,last_hairbender_jsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i412td/following_your_dreams_as_a_career_is_bullshit/,22,1
1298,I got let go after working a global pandemic for these assholes.,"I work(ed) at a national pizza chain that is the opposite of Domino's. I was working to put myself through college. I know this is the part where Reddit writes me off for working a minimum wage job and calls me lazy or some shit because it has happened before, but I work harder than a lot of people and also fuck you. Every one working full time deserves a living wage and I'm speaking mostly on behalf of my older coworkers. 

Anyway. When this all started we didn't know what was going on. We just knew things were getting shut down but we were considered ""essential"" and had to work. If we quit we wouldn't qualify for any sort of unemployment and if we took a brief leave to get things sorted for the pandemic or if we got sick it would be unpaid at the time. We also were told we couldn't wear a mask. Because it would scare people. 

When the stay at home orders were issued, we were hit with mass amounts of large orders. It was hell. On top of that we were scared. We didn't know who this was going to affect or who was most likely to die from it. We weren't allowed to stand six feet from customers and were never given plexiglass. 

We were all overworked. I was exhausted and anyone who says that isn't skilled labor can go fuck themselves because I can't tell you how many people quit because they couldn't keep up and that was before the pandemic. I couldn't keep up with school once covid hit. I'd be so tired when I got home I'd knock out on the couch and sleep until my next shift. 

Eventually when the state opened back up we slowed down and my hours were cut significantly. The state shut back down soon after but the company made less profits during that time and with all the employees testing positive and having to temporarily close stores, our store closed permanently. 

These companies need some sort of regulations so that if we are going to be beholden to them, then they are going to be beholden to us. ""Essential"" my ass. Big shout out to OSHA for protecting the workers and for all the Karens I had to deal with for what is and was a shit time for me and my family (elderly parents) as well. Shout out to our CEO David Briggs still making billions and one of President Trump's close pals. 

I would also like to say that when I am done with school and if I ever own a company or employ anyone I promise that I will treat them fairly. I will not take advantage of another human being for my own personal gain. I hope you all will do the same so that we have a future we can be proud of. Please continue to fight for worker's rights.

1309,Dealing with boot-licker family,"My family are all boot-licking, capitalist flag worshippers. When I visited for Xmas last year, we were all gathered at my grandmothers house talking and my stepmom was sitting in one of the hard wooden kitchen chairs. She was fast asleep just sitting there, it was maybe 4 in the afternoon. 

She works at Walmart as a manager and is exhausted most of the time. Makes okay money. Probably not that much more than I do working an office job from home, and also being 30 years her junior. 

I expressed sympathy for her when we all noticed, saying ‚ÄúPoor stepmom, she is so tired all the time!‚Äù 

My boot-licking cousins who I barely see because they‚Äôre constantly working, did not miss their opportunity:

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because she works hard OP!‚Äù, ‚ÄúYeah that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like when you earn your way.‚Äù Etc etc. 

In what world is being so exhausted you can‚Äôt even be awake for a rare family gathering a good thing? 

She is basically a slave. We all are.
I don‚Äôt understand why they think praising hard work to make someone else wealthy is a good thing. Yes, providing for your family is good, and living in financial stability, but the price is too steep. People basically work out of fear of the alternative. 
Basic needs should be a human right, but they‚Äôre not. People continually perpetuate the idea that someone has no right to life unless they *earn* it. 

Well who gets to decide what you‚Äôve earned? Some billionaires who don‚Äôt give a fuck about you? That feed you your mainstream media so you can become a bootlicker and defend them, despite ultimately contributing nothing to society and actively shut down competition and keep the 1% club exclusive?

1314,Told work to get fucked today.,"For a bit of context, I work in childcare, a famously shit work environment. Toxic culture, high stress, ridiculous bureaucracy, and minimum wage. I am deeply commited to the betterment of early educational methods as I believe it is the most effective path to radical systemic change. As such I have been trying to maintain a career in this rancid sector.

I have always stood up for what I believe is right and have tried my best to adhere to the rules of the system. Regardless, I am not well liked by my managers. It's hard tk reconcile the need to put children first when profit always comes first. 

Anyway, prior to Covid I experienced burnout and suffered from depression and suicidal ideation. There was a rather major breakdown at work and my manager told me to take a couple of weeks off (paid) to get myself back together. Unexpectedly generous, but I'm sure you can guess where this is going.

Into my second week of compassionate leave and the pandemic is declared sending my mental health spiraling further out of control. I get in touch with work and tell them I need more time, but am happy to use up my holidays, as was agreed im advance with my manager. Unfortunately my vile area manager gets back to me explaining that paid leave is not offered by the company and they would be retroactively removing the offer, forcing me to use my holiday for the weeks I had already been off. When challenged my manager made some weak excuse that I misunderstood her meaning. It was clear as day at the time, but silly me for trusting managers without a written agreement. I was too busy thinking about killing myself to ask for it in writing.

After this I asked to be furloughed instead, but was told I could not be furloughed because I needed to be ""back to work ready"" and my mental health suggested I was not.

As a result I have been signed off on Statutory Sick Pay of ¬£95.85 a week since the pandemic was declared. 

Now the fun bit. As childcare settings are preparing to open again they want me back at work because I am the most highly qualified person in the place... sorry, still sick. While being signed off I have adapted my life arangements and no longer need the job. Now I'm signed off for an additonal 3 months after which I'm not coming back. They can't fire me or fill my position because I still work there! So they just have to sit quietly and stew while their industry collapses.

I feel great.

That story was longer and less exciting than I anticipated, so thanks for listening. Find the small ways to fuck the system and fuck it good.

TL;DR - Work screwed me over out of spite so I screwed them in return.",False,i4wugi,HMourland,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i4wugi/told_work_to_get_fucked_today/,13,1
1315,Only losers willingly partake in systems that can't feed everyone,"Capitalism is a demonstrably failed system. You can point to it's failures to prove this point. Like the fact that Capitalism is unable to make sure all humans have food, water and shelter while having access to modern tech.

Any system that fails something so essential and basic with modern technology at it's disposal is beyond laughable, and only a complete loser would think otherwise. 

If you can't figure out that humans deserve food, water and shelter, and that your current system isn't capable of providing that, then you are, by definition, a loser. 

You lost.  

You let a economic system determine right from wrong for you, rather than reality. Again [by definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/loser) this means you are a loser. 

Definition of loser - ""A person who is incompetent or unable to succeed."" 

Just like your system was so incompetent as to be unable to provide the basics of a human life to all, you too were incompetent and unable to recognize it as a problem and instead defended it. You are incompetent and unable to succeed in terms of recognizing reality because you think your economic system determines right from wrong. 

I honestly feel bad for you and those like you who are going to be lead down a path so detrimental to your own well being, as well as the well being of your entire species. 

Instead of a life spent gaining wisdom, bettering yourself, focusing on your family, your health, having fun, doing what is right and contributing to society, you're going to work, in exchange for things no human should ever be deprived of. You're going to be forced to live in a way that is not actually realistic, and you and your world will not be as complete or healthy as would be possible if you were not having your time taken by a outdated economic system. 

And you're going to defend it in masses, thus signing your kids up for the same unrealistic, unhealthy and morally deprived system. You're going to tell them it's right. You're going to tell them people like me should be ignored. That earning a living by spending their lives doing things they don't want is okay. That forcing billions of humans to do things against their own will is moral. 

The silver lining is that Capitalists are wrong, and this is easy to demonstrate. They are not living their lives in well rounded or healthy ways. They are not setting good examples of what it is to be human for their children. People are starting to wake up, and all I can say is thank you to all the Capitalists for years of making bad arguments and stating that only market participants deserve food. Your bad arguments and immoral stances have helped our side **a lot**.

tldr - Giving up years of your life to immoral economic systems is for losers.",False,i5aehf,nbatman,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/i5aehf/only_losers_willingly_partake_in_systems_that/,0,1

YET most people like 99% of people work for someone else and ones that don't started their own thing cuz they hated working for someone else not because they wanted to work. No one on this planet wants to work. That is the greatest consensus on anything I've ever heard of yet WTF EVERYONE FUCKING WORKS ALL THE FUCKING TIME.

 And not only that but it is essentially a species self induced survival of the fittest game. The kind of work you do directly correlates to your status and ur attractiveness and ur options in selection of a mate. We haven't conquered nature's suppression humans are now the suppressor of ourselves. The amount of money u earn essentially determines ur chances of reproducing. We are a species that is currently selecting for who makes money the best. 

But money is just abstracted symbol of value created by a monetary system enforced by a government. The money/credit in the economy is always fixed unless policy is implemented to either destroy currency or devalue it by printing. So this means that profit loss is net zero sum. All profit is gained through another person's loss. All income that a business or businessman generates in another person's spending, unless I print money into my own pocket in which case the price is everyone's money devalues by some tiny fraction due to the reduction in scarcity of money.

 Thus any excessive amount of profit can only be obtained through excessive inticement of spending otherwise the exchange of money should be balanced with the good of service provided for that money. This means that to excel in this game of money u either have to be really good at legally robbing people of money by creating addictive goods and services that cause human dependency on ur business or you earn and spend in such an insane amount such as being Donald trump whereby u are constantly discounting ur earnings by taking on debt such that ur input output makes u seem really rich yet net balance you have almost nothing if the flow of money stopped. What fucking madness is this sick game?? WHAT DOES ANY OF THIS HAVE TO DO WITH HAPPINESS AND LIVING A FULFILLING MEANINGFUL PURPOSEFUL LIFE??

Are you serious? You want me to bend over backwards, make sure my resume is TIP TOP shape with all the latest buzzwords, acquire all these certs that won't mean anything after 3 years, go through MULTIPLE INTERVIEWS, suck off your company and pretend its the greatest most noble company ever, assign me fucking assignments to test my ""knowledge"", know 3 different people who will take time out of their day to vouch for me, be a MASTER SALARY NEGOTIATOR and somehow not aim too high or low, and then what???? I get to work for someone making millions off my ass to do their dirty work for 5 days a week for the rest of my life, for a middle class wage. Maybe I'll get an insultingly small raise or two after a year.

Oh and you have to do this this many times because most companies will just decide to not hire you. You know what else? You'll have to do this AGAIN in a few years when you realize your job is shit and have to look for a better job! Yaay!

NOT FUCKING WORTH IT. I fucking see these people, they're dressed nicely, top of their game, worked their ass off through college, got certs on top of that, are very knowledgeable, and they're struggling to obtain an average wage slave job at some soulless company. WUT? Its all a waste of time. How are people happy? Oh wait, most people are miserable at their jobs! So you worked your entire life to be miserable at a shitty job! Great! Wait a few years before you reach your breaking point and then start the whole process all over again!

I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around working hard at something I hate, in order to do something I hate every day, so I can make not-enough amounts of money, and then convincing myself to be thankful for such an opportunity and pretending I'm happy.

(I think shelter would be pretty hard to get if your country is overpopulated but I think that no one deserves to die from lack of food or water, or that they die freezing jn the cold or in the heat)

Supporters of universal health care don't seem to realize that people working in the health insurance industry make their living by being predatory middlemen. Some insurance agents are just paychecks away from being poor. They rely on people getting sick and paying large sums of money for what cost pennies to produce. The health insurance industry provides a service where people can choose to pay for the service or die. What's wrong with them making their living off the suffering of others? If people didn't have insurance how could they get the care they need?

The landlords understand. Their tenents have the choice of either paying their predatory middlemen prices or being homeless. They provide a service of inflating house prices and leeching labor from tenants and in return tenants create equity for the landlord.

1375,I‚Äôm done with my paycheck being tied to my appearance,"College Degree: Musical Theatre

After graduating, I knew the theatres in my city wouldn‚Äôt take me seriously because my Dean didn‚Äôt want to fuck me (there are now public allegations), so I flew to a big cattle call in the Midwest for a terrifying 90 second singing audition in front of 170 potential employers. That 90 seconds determines how many job offers you get and how much they offer you. They see 800 actors over 3 days.

I‚Äôm very proud of how much I did with how mediocre I was. 

One contract was six months, one 3-hour show a day, no days off, $450 a week, in a cornfield. 

Another was a theme park, 12-hour days, 15-minute shows 7 times a day, plus photos with children. That was living hell. $450 a week.

A favorite was a National Tour. Sleeper bus, kids show, different city every day. Bus call 9am, free time until company warmups, Meals provided, Fourthmeal/bus call 11pm. Exhausting but fun. $550 a week.

There were dozens of regional shows that paid shit, local shows you did for a stipend. My biggest show that got me on the side of a fucking downtown building I made $100 a week. But it was brilliant, life-changing art. 

I moved into TV work a few years ago.

And then I realized I‚Äôm ugly.

Well not ugly, but I was missing out on the hot girl privileges and acting work available, and a nose job and some other things would fix it. I spent my money on that. I needed a part time job to pay it off. 

My new job was with a concierge service to run rich guys‚Äô Tinders for them. I heard every day, phone and email and text, to get them younger girls, hotter girls, blonder girls, bigger tits, smaller tits, over and over and over again. It paid $16/hr remotely, boss told me I could log my own hours and do whatever I wanted. 

Over time, monitoring those guys profiles and swiping no on hundreds of decent-looking women, my self confidence shrank. I bleached my hair. I stopped going to auditions. Client after client called me and said shit like ‚Äúmy wife got fat after having kids so I divorced her. I‚Äôm rich though, find me a coed gold digger.‚Äù

My shrink convinced me to quit after four years.

I wanted to feel like a hot girl for once. I auditioned for an NFL team and spent two years as a cheerleader. That was toxic so I left. 

I‚Äôm fucking done with my paycheck being tied to what I look like. 

I‚Äôm done with theatre. I consider myself a success story, not a failure. I also don‚Äôt care for TV work anymore, that was never my passion.

Now I‚Äôm making $100 a day dropshipping some bullshit but I have no idea how long that will last.
