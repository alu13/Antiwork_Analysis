2,Am I wrong?,am i wrong for wanting a more fair worklife balance am i wrong for wanting to contribute to society only if i get treated fairly in the process and get paid enough money to pay my bills am i wrong for not wanting to live in stress my whole goddamn life working my bones to the grave while not enjoying my life because its all consumed by work am i wrong for fearing that my entire life will be revolved around trying to compete in this rat race just to literally have basic human needs such as shelter food water etc   am i wrong for thinking that jobs need to be kinder and more empathetic to employees who work minimum wage am i wrong for wanting people to live stressfree and happy am i wrong for thinking that people deserve to get paid enough to pay their bills  why the actual fuck does any of this need to be a debate no wonder why depression and suicide rates are going up people telling me that i am wrong for questioning the system that were dealt i am willing to work i am willing to contribute to society as long as were all treated equally and fairly  the thing is id be willing to meet halfway with the people who disagree with me this world does need workers but jesus christ stop twisting everything i say out of context its okay to work as long as the work isnt the only thing we have to literally survive on the planet   lets say that someone loses their job or your business fails leaving you bankrupt and homeless so now you have no shelter food or water so what the fuck you did everything right but now you have nothing and could possibly starve to death   or lets say someone with mental illness is struggling and cant keep a job so now that person has the stress of needing to keep a job and maintain a positive mindset through it or else theyd lose it which leads them to instability   this is what im talking about  i just want some changes to the work system we shouldnt have to work to live anything else would literally be society saying oh youre not doing this ok you die then but no people always twist what i say and be like youre entitled and lazy or some crap i even try to be respectful but some people on here just insult me or call me a baby or something i am done i just needed to say this,n1hoap

14,"For each soldier deployed to an illegal offensive war (Afghanistan, Vietnam, Iraq) we need to deploy the son of a family that earns 200k+ a year to fight boots on the ground",it seems to me that the military industrial complex has for far too long taken advantage of the fact that they can lure poor kids for a meager salary and the hope of a college tuition and send them to die in some unforgiving desert for financial incentive it seems to me that its more than reasonable that for each soldier sent the other must be the son of a rich person who goes to war boots on the ground eventually thatll start affecting the elites that run the cartel that has perpetrated these inhumanities,n165w7

29,Working part time only? Is it feasible?,obviously its going to depend on budgeting and stuff for the short term but im talking long term ive heard ppl suggest fire to me but to be honest im not really interested in working super hard full time or taking my chances on the stock market i come from a lower class upbringing so i dont have any parents seed money or any sort of trust or inheritance coming my way is paying into the 401k and working worth it basically just looking for the pros and cons of part time vs full time rn im still insured until my dad but when the time comes ill just not have insurance or something idk thats why im here bc i feel so drained and miserable working full time no matter what i do im really reaching the end of my rope 40 hours is too much 2030 would be preferable,n1y0ku
30,I don't consider non-workers to be fundamentally driven by laziness in the modern era,its true that work is great if it has purpose and contributes to society the problem is that these days the workers are exploited whilst billionaires siphon up the funds and people are obliged to take menial jobs that are basically useless other than to funnel money up to these exploitative billionaires even jobs that are valid and honourable like being a doctor or carpenter are cheapened by how many people make money off of bullshit   additionally if somebody is miserable or suffering from something you can call them lazy for not working if you wish but the truth is in many instances theyre borderline suicidal and not necessarily thinking about whether or not they contribute to society which would be an undue demand upon an already vulnerable mind i saw a picture of a young guy who had hung himself because he was unable to find a job its pretty sick to imagine people calling him a dosser prior to his death but thats the mentality some people seem to roll with   i can understand the validity of honest work but i can also understand alienation to the point where honest work seems unfairly futile the system is fucked  work isnt the problem work is fantastic and lifeaffirming when its worthwhile but the jobs themselves definitely are not i am more sympathetic to people who are on benefits because of this but i think they should all aim to find a genuine fulfilling job and do their best to try to find it   people will call this leftwing and maybe it technically is but to me it just seems like basic common sense and an understanding and respect of human psychology if everybody could find work that seemed to genuinely make the world and the lives of others better without making physiologically destructive demands whilst paying a fair and healthy salary this sub wouldnt exist,n15fd4

34,Everyone's Career Should Mimic Athletes,i personally feel like everyone should have the same type of career as an athlete  in school you learn the minimum to get by and spend most of your time outside of school working on your one sport  you become the best you can at that sport by having people encourage you and help you along the way  through high school and college you continue to take basic classes while practicing your sport and busting your butt to do the best you can  outside of college you perform and train to be the best you can for about 1015 years  and then in your early to mid 30s you are able to retire  i absolutely hate its just considered normal now to go to school for 16ish years then work for 40 years  work steals the best years of your life and also the best hours of those years  im sick of doing all the right things to only see youtubers and athletes make millions and be able to quit whenever they want,n1a0px

40,I need to get into the mentality that it's okay to leave my job,ive been at the job for nearly three years however two of those years were broken due to working on a masters degree since finishing ive been working with the company for a year straight now   the company has changed a lot since i started plus in the last year im working for a different department with a completely different management i dont have a lot of experience in the field outside of this company so i wasnt sure about general pay and work etc i get 15 per hour in a junior civil engineer consultant role with a masters degree the pay is also salary so no ot is paid   in the last year ive notice more and more of my coworkers hand in their notice its getting to the stage where im almost getting weekly emails about someone leaving a project manager that i got along with rang me a while back saying theyre going to leave soon and said that a few others are too he told me he called to properly say goodbye and didnt want to do that through an email since we always got along but it did feel like they were warning me that things might get rough since more were leaving   the reason why i initially started looking elsewhere was simply down to the fact i didnt enjoy the work at all during the search i realised that i wasnt being paid very well for my job even as a junior and could do better elsewhere too another issue ive been having is that since the workload has grown exponentially ive been given work completely out of my depth with no help at all ive been told by coworkers that the work i have is senior level and its also not in the same field of work as my educational background   when i asked for any help or advice i was told to look up the legal standards and read previous projects to get an idea everything was foreign to me so i struggled but somehow i am managing to get through the work my mental health took a toll with the amount of work i needed to keep up with and everytime i asked for help from my supervisor my messages were either ignored or i was told to ask someone else usually i was told to ask a coworker who is still learning english and struggles to explain things simply for help   after a short search a few companies reached out to me offering to talk about where i want to go with my career one place is even offering me a 30 wage rise and a good few other perks im very close to taking on an offer but now im sitting here feeling bad for me team theyre struggling to meet deadlines and things are getting worse as others are leaving i dont want to screw over my team anymore and cause them extra stress many of us are already pulling weekends to make deadlines,n1eo55

50,"The Rich's ""lifestyle"" portion of wealth accumulation is a red herring.",yesterday i made a comment about my boss who is on the lowest lowest end of what can be called the rich which for me is around a net worth of about 10m i shared that the working class thinks that life is more like what they know payday loans renttoowns vape shops and people spinning signs on the corner  i shared about my bosss and his wife 18000 sq ft home with the theater room basketball court home gym theater room and other amenities youd expect with such a home his four nice to luxury vehicles no super carshis expensive and nice coach motorhome and one of the nicest freshwater boats you can buy cost more than my house  and remember hes just barely at the stage you can call the rich hes in the low double digit millions rich  none of that is new information to you  heres the new perspective  the houses only get so big and at that point you can no longer see the abundance you need to imagine an imaginary column of wealth that is accumulating with zero material representation  your community looks around and says  the rich houses arent growing theyre just there and there are so many more regular folks we cant go after the rich we have to find a way to fend for ourselves  after all their homes in these fancy areas are big but they arent expanding  well yeah because theres only so much milk the rich can drink and so ridiculous a house can be  after they have the nice house  all the rest of the wealth you never see  you just see one rich house and many many many apartments and homes and theres only so much flaunting  the wealth is invisible to the communities  so when i made a comment about how many boss has such nice stuff  its not the nice stuff that i should really be pointing out to you  its that from this point forward his accumulation of wealth will be beyond your ability to perceive forever it will now just be an abstract number to you and you will not see it as real  the absolute insane amount of wealth in this country is not visible to you not from even from a spy satellite  its in investments and ownership and bank accounts and youre not going to get triggered against it because we focus so much on what our eyes can see  every future dollar my boss earns will not have to go to any of the luxuries because hes got them all  and now well see how the lifestyle of the rich is actually just a starting place  and that the real wealth comes after those expenses are done  now the real accumulation of wealth begins,n22ghw

61,“required to return to office” rant,ive been working remotely for over a year now due to the pandemic everything has been going completely smoothly i work in a really specific but low level position where all i need is my laptop and the ability to message my team ive always been the type to work better independently so when i was cleared to work from home for the foreseeable future i was so happy i cant stand being in an open concept office with windows that dont open seeing how miserable everyone else is just clicking sitting in silence its been so great to be able to sit at my own desk with my cat on my lap crossing movies off my list that i watch as i work i truly despise my job and the environment that comes with it but ive found so much solace in at least tolerating it in my own home now my company is insisting we restore normalcy by bringing everyone back in the office this is especially disheartening since my earliest shifts end at 11pm and the latest at 3am walking home from the bus stop that late is scary despite my explanation that i would prefer to work remote permanently they told me they could maybe swing it for a few more weeks but im inevitably forced to return to the office doesnt seem exactly covid safe to me so yeah the rumors are true your employer really does not care about you cant help fanaticizing about taking a train far away to live off the land  with my cat never to return again  too much stress over 15hr,n1nssa

71,Quitting Via 8'x2' Banner: What Should It Say??,this is a long story started my job in 2018 as an accounting manager for an organization that does 200 mil in revenue but only has an accounting team of 6 because the benefits and pay were amazing i was younger than the children of the people i manage which made for an awkwardhard time to start because the group i was walking in to had all been working with each other for decades and they do not like change everything was fine usual manageable office politics  then my husband lost his job  then the pandemic hit  then my husband suddenly lost the ability to walk ms attack was put on chemolike treatments that wipe his immune system and cost 200kyear  i was sent home for wearing a mask into the office and involuntarily put on leave that ate up all my sick and vacation time i had saved up while they decided what to do with me because the governor of my state started to shut things down including offices  they decided the hr and accounting teams were essential workers we are not and can do 99 of our jobs from home besides mail scanning and check printing so after my leave was over they said come back into the office or quit  had no other option needed the health insurance   when i returned everyone suddenly hated me ignored me despite being their boss were mean snide comments and low key insults galore  my boss had used that time to scape goat me into the bad guy so everyone wouldnt be mad at her for making them continue to come into the office still sans masks  one of my employees travels for christmas his wife tests positive for covid19 upon return which has a 20 chance of killing my husband the hr manager takes his premature negative test the day they returned and says that he is clear to come back into the office monday thankfully he wakes up with a sniffle and gets another test this time positive i find out this happened the following wednesday and they wouldnt have told me of the risk had he actually come in  showed up worked overtime unpaid im salaried really tried to turn things around and play politics and be super nice and helpful to everyone  get payroll to review 7 months later guess who got bonuses everyone in the department except for me guess who got raises everyone in the department besides me  spend 5 months finding a better job now i am starting a business with a former professor and will be able to work from home  now comes the good part   i had to wait until this next monday to quit to not have a gap in insurance coverage so i did not give my two weeks because i wasnt willing to risk them firing me on the spot atwill employment state   i have always wanted an epic quitting story i have landed on having an 8 foot by 2 foot banner made which is less than a hundred bucks and i have a change jar for only stupidfun shit that will cover the cost   what should it say i wanted it to serve as my resignation letter and im not going to need a reference from this place that bridge had been burned months ago  tldr treated like crap covid19 office outbreak could have killed my husband what should i put on the 8 foot banner i plan to have made to announce me quitting  thanks reddit,n18rdd
72,A Personal Story: The 30 Year Crisis,ampx200b  the average human being lives to be 79 years old in the united states of america i am a 30yearold male the average male human being lives to be 76 years old in the united states and the average female gets an extra five years at 81 years old i do not want to work a job for thirty years and retire at the ripe age of 60 i want to retire by the time i am 40 years old and live on the rest of my life doing what makes me happy   after i completed my research essay on the future of cryptocurrency i asked myself why i was so interested in this subject the answer came down to my mortality i know i have a limited amount of time on earth and i do not want to waste a second of it i constantly remind myself of my own pending death as a way of motivation i have friends that ignore their mortality and ignore the statistics on health and disease their approach reminds me of an ignorance is bliss approach   i have a tattoo scheduled next week to get the words memento mori on my chest memento mori is latin for remember you must die the phrase memento mori the usage of this phrase was traced back to the ancient rome time period where slaves would whisper this phrase to one another to uplift spirits due to the back living conditions and the continual reign of the current generals enslaving them   i want to make every hour of everyday count for something because i do not have an unlimited supply of life hours i did some deep reflection into my life path and have concluded that i do not want to work until i am 65 years old to retire if i stay at my current employer i can cut that figure from 65 to possibly 57 years old i do not want to retire at 57 there are several issues with retiring at 57 years old the number one issue is i will be fiftyseven years old at 57 who is to know the condition of my health mobility and current risks of disease and cancer at that age i do not want to take that risk to begin living in retirement at that age the second issue is that the average lifespan after retirement from the stressridden job that i am at now is 6 months of life after retirement this is sad because many correction officers work their whole life looking towards retirement however they forget to take care of their health and stress levels along this journey hypertension is a silent killer because an individual can look and feel completely normal and never know they have a ticking bomb inside of their chest that is fueled by stress working in a prison where you are constantly monitoring human beings that have committed felonious crimes can be stressful especially considering these human beings tend to not be the best at following rules or getting along with one another   i have worked as a city police officer a deputy a correction officer waiter home improvement sales and more i have concluded that all jobs get boring to me this is an opinion of course however i have identified that working a typical job does not make me happy my personal identified meaning of life has always been stay as happy as long and as often as possible to achieve this i want to retire by the age of 40 years old let me rephrase that sentence to be more accurate i want to be done working full time by the time i am 40 years old i want to achieve a mass of wealth which i have calculated to be 9 million dollars so i can do this if this comes to be not possible by the 40yearold date then i will have created a few streams of passive income by this date and work part time the goal is to do what makes me happy what makes me happy is running exercising doing new things meeting new people competing and traveling   the reason i am so attracted to the new york stock exchange and the cryptocurrency market is for the possibilities of one dollar becoming ten dollars i understand the more you invest is the more you can make or lose i am now thirty years old and i am facing the barrel of thirty more years of work if i think like a typical american i do not have children nor a mortgage i have flexibility in the way i can live my life and manage my meager income i will never accumulate 9 million dollars by working in a prison setting or any other typical job by the time i am 40 years old the key to an early retirement is to invest my money into smart investments i have a buddy named robert who has made 165000 in the last four months by investing some of the money he makes at 2500 an hour into the cryptocurrency market it would have taken me 3 years of working full time in the same job as robert to accumulate those funds that means 3 years of working and not spending a penny robert did not work overtime and sacrifice his freetime and every waking moment by trading 60minute intervals of his life into united states dollars the most valuable thing i have is time i do not want to continue to trade my time for paper money there are too many things on this earth that i want to see and that i want to do every minute counts   the cryptocurrency market is an investment that comes with risk just like any other investment this paper served as an insight into how i think about my life and why i am attracted to investing my money into the cryptocurrency market and stock market this paper is not intended as investment advice rather it serves as a person sharing their strategy on squeezing as much juice out of life as possible thank you for reading this narrative    i have included one picture of me posing as my fear  i have included another picture of me serving my identified meaning of life being happy,n185al

148,PSA: You don't have to be anti-capitalist to be anti-work,we all know that capitalism is leading to more automation this is good because it means humanity will one day be free from work when this happens we will have achieved postscarcity we all agree this is where were heading  but when everything is automated and no one has jobs how will people buy things this is where we start disagreeing  theres various schools of thought but id like to explain how capitalists view post scarcity  when adjusted for inflation the cost of almost everything is decreasing over time thanks to market competition and more automation as the cost to produce a good or service approaches 0 so does the price and when the price of a product is 0 you wont need money to buy it that product will then be postscarce at this point does it matter if the factory that produced this good for free is privately owned postscarcitycapitalists argue that if capitalism can achieve postscarcity capitalism can maintain post scarcity  thats the essence of postscarcity capitalism theres a lot more to it than that to cover the various edges cases such as how property taxes prevent a good or service from reach a 0 cost of production but this is just a summary,n0lbik

196,Am I wrong for wanting an alternative?,i am halfway through my yearly internship for a public office i have no holidays or sick days and i have never missed a day so far because i would have to work an extra day to get those hours back my paycheck is 400 bucks per month but i get paid only once every 3 months so technically its 1200 bucks and they technically still havent payed me one extra month of work i did my job is boring and stupid i have been asked to do pointless stuff such as cleaning up my boss desk or reorganizing all of his cables but most of the time im revising useless files on excel or organizing zoom meetings i am not allowed to complain about how much i hate this because my family keeps yelling at me i should be thankful for the opportunity or better yet be happy i get payed to do nothing   what i want to do with my life is be a freelance illustrator like my ex art academy friends are doing making a living as independent individuals and pursuing their passion it works for them but not for me because according to my family i cannot do as i please they treat me as if i was a kid or something not a man in his late 20s  the funny thing is i dont want to straight up quit working i just want to do it at my own rules i ask you am i being spoiled and ungrateful for wanting this or really the few out there who make it are an exception and most of us cannot escape this rat race,n0ainc

198,Cut’s Fired Video,the video  httpsyoutubeu9ompl6urqq   this video made me sick for the fact that some people said theyre hard workers and just never deserve to be fired theyre probably right but just to see how much people put into a job that wont do much for them is sad then older people say theyve been at their company for 18 years or more and got fired in a heartbeat another person being denied a loa for their dying mom jobs and employers dont care about you they really need you and then act like they dont its disgusting how our system works sometimes   after being in this subreddit ive been more aware of why i had this constant feeling of never being a good member of society because i felt like i never wanted to work work has caused me years of anxiety in all different careers and i felt like i constantly put my sanity and care into my jobs instead of into me   also cut did nothing wrong in this video it was just disappointing to see the work system,n0mid1
199,The perpetual discomfort zone,how did entire generations of people get indoctrinated with the idea that when they feel comfortable something is wrong and that only when they are making a proactive choice to be uncomfortable is everything ok  i mean i know its a rhetorical question but its also a question i feel like screaming from the rooftops  feeling comfortable is the best thing in the world robbing people of one of lifes few pleasures by telling them they should be fearful if they dare to enjoy a moment of nonpain is gaslighting on an unprecedented scale oh but if you rest for a moment little johnny next door might get ahead goes the message because obviously everyone is in perpetual competition there is no one you can trust not to stab you in the back and solidarity is not only a thing of the past but the loser in the battle against capitalist success at any cost and history has already been rewritten to pretend it never existed  what are we doing what will it take for us to realize that when we get out there and grind ourselves into early retirement due to sickness in our 40s to turn little johnnys unwise decision to have rest and recreation into our own career victory we are simultaneously doing the exact same thing to ourselves  because when we do it he starts doing it when he starts doing it we do it harder when were both doing it the idea catches on and soon the world is doing it and no nobody can rest even if they want to  were doing it to ourselves  stop  who moved my cheesestyle you shouldnt expect shit to stay the samecumyou shouldnt expect a company not to try and fuck with a deal youve already agreedcumwhen shit doesnt stay the same its on you to tap your own resources to adapt to it is the training departments remember those way of externalizing the costs of marketplace agility onto its own employees the same way unpaid internships are about externalizing the costs of training new hires and young apprentice intake rather than investing in staff because that way you can ax them when they start to get a bit old and start to break after the years youve overworked them without losing the investment you now didnt make in the first place  and if any of them are bold enough to leave because of your inferior working conditions your investment doesnt walk out the door with them because you conned them into funding the education they needed to do the skilled work you depend on all by themselves congratulations you have now eliminated the business costs and consequences of overworking staff with zero regard for health and safety and of treating them like shit along the way  its a fucking scam  and its not going to stop by itself,n0ddlc

206,Being a good employee sucks,you end up doing more work because you inevitably pick up the slack for other lazy employees theres nothing more frustrating than working with people who dont care and leave you to do the heavy lifting   and as a good employee your held to a higher standard because you go above and beyond the call of duty your essentially in a lead position but without any added pay the moment you slack off everyone notices because youve been carrying a large chunk of the workload all along   so dont be a good employee work for yourself if you must provide excellent value if you cant start a business then be mediocre like everyone else dont you dare rise to the occasion and let your boss see your setting yourself up to be exploited to the maxx,mzyc8i

210,How do you work under a completely insecure and incompetent supervisor?,  i recently got a relevant gig to my studies and field its a public sector job and its riddled with bureaucracy chain of command regulations and incompetence so many workers here have barely any clue what the job actually entails and are just trying to get to another day collect a paycheck  pension and stay low in the trenches        so here i am a bright shiny new hire thats not even a full month in just doing my work and already the shenanigans are starting to come my way a little background i was never a overachiever by any standards but in regards to my work im really tightwaddy and i always try to put forth my best professional work apparently im learning the insandouts of the system too fast as my instructor  a different one is assigned to every new hire was saying im outperforming all the other new hires in the beginning praise was heaped upon me  wow youre done already it took me a month to figure out that form etc to getting chewed out for missing even a period or comma on my reports understandably it might just be rising expectations for me but i honestly dont think its as simple as that   as we all grow up and work we learn to not take things too personally in a office setting so i just acknowledge the mistake correct it and try to move on however the supervisor above my instructor wasnt having it theyd drill on the tiny mistake and make a mountain out of it putting pressure on both me and the instructor eventually even the instructor is now distancing from me as if i was radioactive since apparently i bring out the supervisors ire i dont exactly blame him but i see the writing on the wall already if i throttle back my performance it would give the higherups the ammo theyd need to discipline me but if i continue on ill be stepping on more toes i dont want to have to quit a job that took me so long to find especially during these times but itd be a lie to say i wasnt gunning for a promotion or a higher position i know i could outperform most of my peers and superiors but im not a showoff about it and mostly keep to myself how fucked am i,n0kutr

231,I made a list of Antiwork Tips &amp; Tricks based on my most miserable days of work. Hope it helps make your days better :),long post but i appreciate those who read   core belief  you are always expendable in a job as soon as you inconvenience the smoothness of the capitalist money machine youll be replaced always remember this when making any decision regarding work and consider the worth of the choice   golden rule  this has been mentioned a lot but ill still repeat it do the bare minimum for the longest amount of time that is acceptable to keep you earning your paychecks while trying not to screw over your coworkers dont push it to the point youre fired but dont be afraid to try it out to make your workdays more bearable after all a job is just a middle man between your work and your reward a middle man that screws you over you never see the true fruits of your labor because it all goes to the rich and they throw the apple cores banana peels etc back to you  tips amp tricks  these are just things that ive noticed throughout some of my working days that have helped me survive mentally its not to make you like work its made to help relieve the soul crushing stress of it what has worked for me may not work for you and vice versa this is intended to help get you through your working days until youre ready to start living off grid or whatever ways you intend on living as far away from the system as possible  1 always stimulate your mind before work or even during the first 30 minutes of your shift if you have a job where you dont get screamed at for pulling out your phone this means skipping out on that 510 minute morning stress fap try not to do the same exact things during your morning routine instead try spending 510 minutes learning about something new basically introduce yourself to something that you can think about for the rest of the day this could be literally anything learn about investing learn about subjects you were always interested in as a kid it could even be related to video games think about strategies you can use to beat that boss youre still stuck on because it keeps dealing 1000 damage to you near the end of the battle  2 this coincides with 1 never focus fully on the work at your job this is something ive been doing even back when i worked at fast food i would always be focusing on personal things how am i going to beat yukikos boss fight later tonight what should be the next special thing i do for my girlfriend i wonder how much extra money i should save for the modifications on our camper van always keep positive thought provoking ideas running through your head at every point possible especially during the brain dead rush hours it keeps my brain more focused on the good things outside of my job even though i have severe depression and have been through some of the worst shit imaginable as a kid child abuse molested bullying for years etc theres things ive learned to see positively outside of work i know firsthand its possible to be negative your whole life hating the planet and everything on it and still learn to see the positives and mature mentally   3 always prioritize personal things while at work at any point possible in a manner that doesnt put you at risk of being fired you know where this post youre reading is being made a car wash im clocked in prioritizing writing this list over my work while listening to persona music i have 4 cars waiting outside i dont care unless theyre customer cars in which case i work a little faster because i dont want to inconvenience them you know what else ive done spent 30 whole minutes doing research on things i was thinking of investing in while clocked in ate my lunch while clocked in made most of my antiwork posts while clocked in fuck i played skyrim so long on my switch one day that i went from level 10 to level 17 uninterrupted while clocked in played smash bros with some childhood friends while clocked in fuck ill even admit i masturbated in the bathroom cleaned up of course while clocked in one day because i finished my book and was bored  4 say no more often hey jim can you come in today no but thanks for offering the second part is obviously fake but if you have an off day just say no you dont have to explain yourself you were scheduled for an off day fuck them enjoy your humanity and your free time   5 try to make your call ins before or after an off day and do it when you can afford it if you did it every time you simply wanted to youd be doing it every week and get fired having multiple days off back to back is fucking euphoric in the case of people like me youd be getting 3 off days back to back the best excuse ive been able to find for calling in so far has been bad diarrhea example hey im not going to be able to make it in today i woke up with really bad diarrhea and ive been stuck on the toilet for 30 minutes this morning you might also want to add that youre feeling feverish   6 for every minute you spend actually using the bathroom spend an additional minute using your phone if someone comes into the bathroom and actually needs to use it if you have limited stalls of course be polite and get out but otherwise enjoy the extra few moments of taking back your time   7 this is specifically for fast food jobs and its limited to the devices you have in most of them they typically force you to use headsets mandatory for the drive through cashiers and its like 5050 mandatory for the food workers if youre a food worker what i personally did at my fast food jobs is go to the bathroom shortly after putting on a headset hang it around my neck as im walking to the bathroom and then slipping in an airpod before i go back to work and turning on shuffle music with the headset at low volume and covering the airpod its risky depending on your location and the behavior of the management there so this is one that im not telling you to start doing its an idea im offering and its up to you to decide if the risk would be worth it and if you want to do it or not an earbud obviously wouldnt work  the wire would give it away so youd need any kind of wireless earbud   8 take antiwork breaks come to this reddit and just vent about things and rant about your job for me it helps me a lot mentally and improves my mood the rest of the day i do it all the time while clocked in literally earning money while shit talking your job  9 this is for outside of work your free time as they call it even though you dont get much of it it can get really hard to actually enjoy your literal human existence when youre slaving away 40 hours a week and can even make you anhedonic anhedonia was another factor that lead to my first suicide attempt and i suffered from it for a long time but i eventually started learning how to combat it after recovering  a sounds cliche but try new things and find new hobbies this is coming from a person who was starting to believe the whole world was meaningless there really is something out there for everyone for me i started finding a huge interest in learning how to cook trying new recipes and trying new food or new variations on old foods almost all the time also reading  b if the things youre doing are starting to seem boring or you feel yourself losing interest move to something new sometimes ill be at my house playing a game and find myself thinking that im only playing it to pass the time when this happens i save and close it and move to another game i do this to try to find the right game for my current mood where i can get invested in the story atmosphere character development etc and am fully enjoying it rather than to just fill the void sometimes i cant find the right game or none of my games sound good at the moment what i do then is turn off my consolepc and go for a bike ride or drive around and relax listening to music if i have extra gas money then come home and cook something   aaaaand thats it for now if i think of more ill add it in the comments thanks for reading remember think of the future think of the returns on your investments think of the days youll be ready to go offgrid for those that dont want to resort to offgrid think of the days ahead when enough of us wake up and revolt worldwide for better conditions and compensation for workers we are the lifeblood of these companies after all,n0ime7

255,Performance Review Knocked Some Sense Into Me,ive been browsing this sub for a while and always agreed with the general sentiment admittedly i was thinking all this while still saying i love my job well after my most recent performance review at work i realized its all a fuckin scam    had a normal performance review with hr honestly i am doing excellent in this position i am literally the only person in my role i am highly educated experienced and have glowing reviews from upper management this is also a well established ngo with good income so ofc i want to get a raise to match my output   during the meeting management straight up said there is no monetary raise for this position when i asked about career progression keep in mind we live in a high col area and im already making below the current minimum average for my city in my particular field too   i was then also told this role is one of the only full time positions in the company and so many other part time employees would kill to have a full time role like yours  to be clear in my country full time positions are legally mandated in which the company must pay an employees healthcare pension and unemployment it is also a bit difficult to fire a full time person part time workers must enroll in national healthcarepension and pay out of pocket however full time positions are the norm even in ngos   then to make it super obvious that i am valued when i asked about hr providing me goals to better commit to the company they said we would like you to create brand guidelines for the entire company to make us more cohesive this was then quickly followed by for example if someone were to step into your role how would they get started  so essentially im lucky to have a full time position because if they legally could they wouldnt give a fuck about me and easily replace me with a starving part time worker  ever since that review ive been putting in the same amount of effort that they pay me for fuck all yall,n0nxim
256,Can bosses and coworkers gaslight you?,not a rhetorical question i genuinely dont know i worked for a local restaurant during the pandemic and at first it seemed great they projected that the staff was a family and since we only had seven workers it seemed cool especially because my boss would work along side me during my shifts   but as things went on the staff got bigger and somehow no work was getting done i was a cook but i was also a server and bagger and a dish washer and deep cleaner the worst was that i would come in three hours early just to get a head start on my prep i either had to come in early or leave late because my boss complained that i wasnt doing my job they said i had an attitude problem and my boss cut an entire work day out of my schedule cutting my already minimum wage pay in half because i would miss the day i worked the most hours  my last there i had a 1 on 1 with my boss and he said that my assistant manger who also was a cookb and a friend from high school could do all this easily and that he didnt understand my problem he said he cut my hours for my mental health and that i seemed different from when i joined the team a coworker said similar things when i tried discussing it with him during closing and he said that i was just imagining the issues   i am nothing familiar with the term gaslighting or any form of manipulation intentional or not but i know when i put my two weeks in for this job i felt terrible i would wake up dreading my day to come think terrible thoughts all shift long and fight the urge to cry on the way home but i still felt like i let down my coworkers and boss because i thought we were all friends i put my two weeks in on the first day of my shift and was told i may lose a day or two in the coming weeks to train another person but after that week i was removed from schedule   i just found this thread and it validated the thought that is haunting me right now is it supposed to be this hard am just a lazy arrogant,n0qd4z

259,I consistently feel guilty about leaving at 5pm with WFH,i feel like i have an issue where i genuinely care too much about my job despite being provided with evidence that i am highly replaceable this doesnt necessarily mean that im out here busting my ass at work but does make me feel some level of anxiety for not working as hard as i possibly can   ive always been work from home at this job got hired during pandemic and they havent mentioned going back for my team yet when i was hired i was told that i work like 85 theres an hour lunch in there which i typically send stressing if someone is trying to reach me now i work from home so i really havent talked to many of my coworkers extensively the main person ive talked to is an older woman jan jans worked here for 20 years and worked from home before pandemic because of family illness shes also the only other hourly employee that im aware of at my level now she takes naps on her lunch and then just worked until shes tired and im starting to feel like the same is expected of me no one ourwordly says it but i kind of always feel like more can be done and my employer wont be satisfied until everything is done which is unachievable goal for multiple reasons    really not sure how to sit with this because i dont want to be working until 7 or 8 every night but also i want to not feel useless at work because i feel like long term that will lead to more fulfillment than doing the minimum it feels like there is no compassion no one wants to hear if im having a rough time recently they just want more work done ive thought about just shifting my mindset to completely on the grind during the week and not even attempt to enjoy myself but that really doesnt feel like a way i want to live although possible,n0naqz

273,Being abused at work,tw antisemitism neonazis abuse let me know if theres anything else i missed  i dont even know where to start   im 26 and a public librarian i have a masters in library and information science with a concentration in archives i graduated from my master program in december and was hired fulltime with benefits as a library assistant a paraprofessional role which doesnt even requite a masters degree in early march its a 30 mile commute on a busy interstate 60 miles in aggregate every day this job pays poverty wages but im lucky that i got this job at all especially a fulltime one with benefits  my manager is functionally illiterate and is a neonazi she sobbed and threw a hissy fit when i was hired because she didnt want to work with a lesbian jew she had a literal tantrum in the library sobbing hysterically and rolling on the floor still despite this the supervisors still put me under her from the first moment i started this fucking job this woman has been peddling her altright ideals trying to force me to read mein kampf not once but twice because im jewish and will understand she has also told me how she wants a turning point usa chapter in the library and how george floyd died of a meth overdose this was all in my first hour of employment by the way  then the abuse got worse  she would trap me and continue pushing her altright beliefs down my fucking throat trying to force me to comply she told me how she wants to take down our branch manager a black woman she used me as her therapist and told me every single triggering detail about her life like i asked her a week after i started work how her weekend was and her response was to tell me about this duper triggering thing which happened to her no provocation whatsoever when my jaw fell open she continued and gave me explicit details as to this event  this all culminated in her forcing me at work to read this batshit fucking diarynovel shes been writing about how jesus and the archangels love her and all want to fuck her and she is gds special child and has been put on this earth to root out demons aka anyone who disagrees with her its also all about her divorce and how she abused her husband and how his mental illness is demonic she stands over me as i am forced to read this at work or else shell give me a bad review  i am at my wits end  finally with support from a coworkerfriend i reported what was happening to admin they said that theyve wanted my manager gone for a long time since she is terrible at her job and cannot spell or writeand shes the head of the childrens department they told me that they wanted me to become manager flat out  anyway  since were county employees this had to go to hr they tried to rework the schedule so i wouldnt be near this white supremacist but before i submitted my report i had to be on our last day together she tried to force me to look up christian lit for this man who refused to wear a mask in the library she also refuses to wear a mask even though the desk where i was working does not do reference at all she wants to convert me  anyway hr refused to fire her since of course this womans family has millions and their own private jet though this woman can barely fucking write at all she had her sister a lawyer write her rebuttal for her for hr and because this is a conservative as fuck county they were sympathetic to my manager we had a fucking lgbtq bulletin up in the library and one person complained so the county commissioner threatened to fire the entire library unless we took it down but this woman trapping a jew in her office and demanding that she reads mein kampf thats fine  my manager was demoted and moved to another library in the county but shes still there and ill still have to see her  the branch manager now loves me and tells me that she still wants me to be manager but it the optics dont look good and my former manager may fucking lose it if she finds out   ive only been at this job a month btw   anyway my local county suddenly has 34 vacancies in its library due to bad management but it pays double what im making right now and i need to get out of here id be going from one abusive shituation to another though but i cant leave because then i forfeit health insurance and my income i wish i could be unemployed right now and just take time before a new job but i cant i cant i also may still become the manager i have no fucking idea  oh and the best part the library is about to open full time again even though the only people who come in are antimaskers for the most part the county just doesnt want us to stay home and be safe  my mental health is so shot this has been literally a traumatizing experience for me i was already antiwork but i felt so lucky to have found a job in my field and i do love my job and my coworkers so so much genuinely but i cant even leave for my own mental health i have to maybe find another job to get out of here and the only viable jobs right now are ones that also have horrendous management  i just want out i want to feel safe even with my former manager no longer at our library having her still in the system makes me frightened beyond measure im an out lesbian too and i live with my partner of many years who is masculine im very petite and feminine im frightened for my girlfriends safety too this is so intense that i even had to take my address off of official work documents so my manager wouldnt find them and sic some sort of alt right group on us  i hate this i just want out but leaving means no health insurance during a pandemic leaving means no income fuck,mzreur

308,Book that fosters a one-world system built on a mutualized law and tax discrimination based on natal astrological factors. The lazy don't have to work if their Mars position warrants it., in the book ares le mandat every human is relegated to the influence of the planet mars mars is said to influence low grey matter volume distribution in the brain this influence manifests differently amongst the human population mars influences some to be antagonistic to different groups others to be antagonistic to different individuals itinfluences some to be antagonistic to change and others to stagnancy its all laid out in 6 different categories and allows for a wider perspective of the human condition thus opening the door to understanding and improvisation this construct allows the individual to navigate through life accordingly adjusting his own behavior to the situation he faces catering to the human archetypes in his space according to the mars number they wear the construct is called mars 360  mars 360 is a formulated and hypothesized global social accord ideally operable under the same principle as the paris climate accord which attempts to integrate all nations into a common cause without undermining national sovereignty the mars effect on human behavior inclines each individual toward certain predispositions that lend itself to fundamental outlooks which carries with it a high degree of inflexibility this inflexibility plays itself out in various political and social stances like socialism pacifism capitalism liberalism conservatism libertarianism etc but is actually the result of marss permanent influence on the human brain this gives rise to the idea that while certain stances are different in external display they are at the same time fundamentally backed by the same sourceto varying degrees of coursewhich is mars  because of this discrimination based on mars factors can be applied to law and taxes in such a way that no one would object those born under a mars position that affects the person to display more capitalist tendencies would be given more leniency on taxes those born under a mars position that causes restlessness tendencies would be given less restriction on travel those born under a mars position that causes some laziness tendencies would be less required to work etc etc leniency is tailormade to the person freedom of speech would only apply to those whose mars position would warrant it  this system unites the world essentially by building connections based on a number under mars 360 a person is eitherbecause of marss influence in their astrological natal chart  1 a mars1 which describes someone who is poor in face to face communication and charityconservative 2 a mars2 which describes someone who is poor in mood listening relationships etcconservativeleftist 3 a mars3 which describes someone who is poor in bodily maintenance and being stilllibertarianleftist 4 a mars4 which describes someone who is poor in indirect speech and disciplineconservative nationalist 5 a mars5 which describes someone who is poor in work habitslifestyledealing with authoritycommunist 6 a mars6 which describes someone who is poor in maintaining personal appearance and facial regulationliberal  lets say a person in china wears 3 signifying a mars3 and a person in australia also wears a 3 then those two are connected via personal characteristic regardless of the other factors which separate them like race nationality religion etc this keeps the archetypes in the same framework an example of why this is necessary can be found by simply looking at the political situation in the us you have instances where the archetypes of different racialnationalityethniccreed but same mars influence are inadvertently working against each other instead of together mars 360 fixes this conundrum  the author uses an ancient method to claim credibility for this outlook of mars influence since the author of the book ares le mandat lacks credentials or pedigree as a nonfiction writer he is able to solidify his mars hypothesis by being able to successfully detect the escalation of rocket fire from gaza into israel relative to the rest of the year this is done in chapter 52 which contains the prediction results and stats for the year 2020 as it was done in real time it also contains the future dates of expected rocket fire escalation from gaza into israel the escalation was tied to the position of the planet mars in relation to the lunar node since mars is described throughout the book as having an influence on human life on earth the author is able to gain credibility the ancient wayprophecy and by demonstrating in real time how observing mars can forecast escalation events in israel at the moment rockets are being fired into israel under the same astrological configuration used to to predict the 2020 rocket fire escalation periodthat is mars being within 30 degrees of the lunar node  the book is available on amazonuse the free look inside feature to see the authors note about the essential chapters to

309,Workers on the Pyramids,sometimes i think of the egyptian pyramid building or the great wall building and how all those slaves and workers became cogs and ants  all the people who could have made music or written philosophy or enjoyed life became just people who lifted heavy objects and worked to build something in which they had no stake and i think of what i know now  these ways to create ppt presentations or work computer software or know to press x to get y how i can work steadily for 5 hours but the remaining 3 are often there because were supposed to work 8 hours and then breathe at the end of the day and maybe have enough time to come back to myself and what i am and dreamed  trying to remember that time when i used to write poetry or create fiction all this time wasted on work that doesnt need all of this time or practically any of me and i wonder what those ancient workers thought of as they continued to lift those heavy blocks and set them down again over and over,mz3tld

313,We live in an era of absurd ambitions,ive been reading a job to love to figure out what im going to do with my life no answers but the book does make an excellent point that stuck with meour modern expectations of success are historically weirdly inaccurate  to quote  modernity never ceases to emphasize that success could somehow one day be ours yet there is unwitting exhausting cruelty in this narrativethe data is clear that only a very few of us will succeed and yet despite all the evidencemodernity has made the ideal the norm and internalized the burdens of failure  those who work in predictions have a rule for guessing outcomes  the first step is to get a baseline range of results based on similar cases the baseline for estimating the likelihood of success for most of us comes from media that only shows us success stories as opposed to as the book points out greek tragedies from eras past  for more sanity we should recalibrate remember most people in the world are just as frustrated as we are savor small wins much more and of course work much less,mztzk6

316,What If I Don’t Want To Be A Boss?,i love how successful career paths are framed towards you moving up a ladder which always implies stepping over and on people as somebody who has worked for companies where ive trained people and directly managed them being a boss isnt necessarily hard but it feels wrong ordering people around even if its just to perform x business task  the extra money that comes with a supervisory position isnt given out because of more work although in some cases it is but as an implicit bribe to keep you nuzzling up to the next level manager at the cost of all other workers below you so for those of us who dont like lording over others which even in capitalist societies i think is a lot how do we get paid adequately  societys answer to that question is a resounding middle finger on decent wages and calling us bums for not wanting to rule over the majority of peoples days only thing thats going to fix this is more coops and more unions to try to democratize workplaces it seems like,mzbjr7

344,The story of John Henry has become capitalist propaganda and kind of racist but we can save it,now i know the origins of this story comes from the actual workers on the rail road and it has been used as communist propaganda to glorify the time before industrialization i get that i did my research before posting but now in the modern context the classical story of john henry has some serious problems with it in the end its the story of a big strong black man who is really good at manual labor and wants to do a dangerous back breaking work for white people and died fighting to keep performing this godawful job once a safer and more efficient way to do this job was invented again i understand that when it was first created it was essentially a protest against these terrible working conditions and how once the workers were no longer needed they were tossed aside but now it has been fully consumed by the capitalist system and remade to fit their needs  however i dont think john henry should just be abandoned but it needs to be reworked as it have multiple times in the past in order to fit the needs of the present instead of being proud of his work henry should hate it and resent that he and his fellow workers have to do it often under threats of violence so in response henry designs the steam drill in order to reduce the amount of work people have to do but he realizes that he cant just give the company he works for this invention because they will just abandonee his fellow workers to poverty but while henry tries to figure out a plan to make sure his invention actually improves the lives of workers a class traitor steals his design and sells it to the company with no strings attached seeing this and hoping to save the lively hoods of his fellow workers henry challenges the class traitor to the famous contest only this time henry deliberately causes a cavein in order to destroy his drill   so what do you think do i have point or am i full of shit should the story of john henry be changed and if so how do you think it should be changed,mz6mif

366,FastFood/Restaurants fail to retain workers...Boomers most affected/“Biden to Blame” (Rant),    tldr at the end  so most people here may be aware that fast food places and restaurants are failing to hire and keep workersits so bad businesses have been temporarily shutting down and the local panda express we just got can not open because no one wants to work for them loli saw this coming and me and my inner circle have been talking about this happening for months before news broke how did we know about this months ahead simple i work in the gig industry so im always browsing subs from fast food places and restaurants where i deliver food from and you can really see how employees have felt about their work places during covidalso help wanted signs everywhere at this point      so whats going on recently many news outlets have been reporting on this issue and lets just say many older folks have gave their input on this situation now tell me how do you tell me youre american without saying you are oh i know go on a facebook rant about how you cant get your big mac and fries now because millennials dont want to work fast food anymore no seriously hundreds of facebook comments ive been reading from boomers calling us entitled lazy no good generation all because we dont want to work fast food and as i was telling my friend months ago look bro society needs us lower class workers you know they cant survive without fast food groceries food delivery etc remember the garbage men protests of yesteryear and now we are seeing fed up boomers who are mad because we dont want these jobs anymore because they cant get their whopper while yelling at the employees for taking too long      so whos to blame ive had the answer to this for months as i saw this coming but apparently folks biden is to blame oh yeah you heard me right im not even a guy thats into politics and i can tell you how bullshit this is from a galaxy away all of these comments ive seen blaming biden for extending unemployment which is why people dont want to work fast food anymore i dont doubt that people are misusing unemployment but the rise of people quitting fast food jobs has been rapidly rising over the pandemic so this was inevitable and to come and restaurants were having issues to keep workers months ago even before biden oh yes blame it on politics for the reason why people dont want to work fast food anymore           heres whats really going on ive gone through sub reddit after sub reddit of retail stores and restaurants over the past couple of months due to the gig work i do i always like to see the employee side of things when it comes to the businesses i deliver from to see how i can understand them better and to make my job easier with themand ive come to a conclusionyou all know the answer to fuck it corporations are to blame yeah we all saw this coming but surely it cant be that bad right well reading employee stories over the pandemic have made me realize something that employees have been treated like garbage beings over the pandemic and ill explain      the pandemic was the catalyst in the relationship between corporations and workers we all know that before the pandemic these places treated their workers like shit here in america but the corporations under the pandemic made people get treated like the scum of the earth and opened the eyes for many many people      it all started at the beginning of the pandemic fast food sales doubled and tripled as many people were now ordering online due to the pandemic what happens when sales double and triple that must mean that work load doubles and triples too with all of this new found pressure being put onto fast food workers while they are understaffed workers were given too much work with not enough workersmany of whom had to deal with managers yelling at them for not being able to complete impossible rates and customers being angry too do you really expect 3 chipotle workers to make 100 items in less than 10 minutes not even a joke rchipotle subreddit confirms     next came the covid pay fiasco many restaurants at first refused to up pay on employees making 725 during the pandemic even when profits soared through to the moon  as a worker hearing that you got to work in a business thats thriving due to a pandemic and making you do mandatory overtime and not making more youre gonna feel like shit bro not only as a worker do you have to deal with a pandemic and transmission of the virus due to contact in drive thru with thousands of customers but your job calls you a essential hero but wont pay you like oneplus too much mandatory overtime for 725 hell no when these places finally upped pay it still wasnt enough     after the covid pay issue managers had gone to the next level of bullshittery suddenly covid was striking many fast food employees across the countryone by one by oneso what are you supposed to do about this considering your whole kitchen crew are potentially infected force your workers to come inyes you heard me many and i mean many managers verbally threatened their employees if they didnt come in if they had covid their reasoning was unless you feel sick or show symptoms you gotta come in cause were understaffed thats how you know youre really american lol oh your mother you live with got covid too bad your manager told you that if you quarantine youre fired go ahead and search reddit and see how many stories you come across like this     workers by this point are fed up but it cant get worse can it oh yea we can the next issue is regarding essential employee or as i call it the most americanest lie established imagine you work at a ice cream shop at the beginning of the pandemic and you dont close downapparently youre an essential worker ice cream tho ice cream isnt essential for survival and apparently many places of business like gamestop came up with bullshit reasons for why they are essential dont get me started on the fact that the mattress job i used to work at during the pandemic forged a tennessee official signature just to lie to the government about being essential so they wouldnt close down and they got caught and have been fined but ironically the mattress job has a policy on its wall about being loyal to god and the bible so you sell video games during the pandemicessential heard you sell boba teessential we all are essential      finally on our list we have the essential hero lie that was sold by corporate america to the american people brought to you by the same people who make children pay for their lunch because food brands control kids lunch and need to make a buck off of elementary kids not even a lie its damn true anyways over the pandemic to really keep employees corporations ran ads calling their workers heroes to increase workplace morale and to make workers feel like they belong however with the multiple other events happening in the paragraphs above that unfortunately did not work to keep workersinstead this backfired shocking videos and stories came out about the horrible treatment of so called heroes because people treated fast food workers even worse during the pandemichell the whole essential hero thing goes way further than you think when americans think about the term hero they think about someone who will put up with all bullshit and never give upso when americans especially older ones who grew up on comic book superman hear about fast food employees uh i mean heroes giving up and quitting their jobs those american people began to view these former workers as scum of the earthbecause in the time they grew up if a hero were to give up that hero was suddenly a horrible no good person to which they associate these essential heroes with so now  you a former fast food employee who quit their job during the pandemic because they mistreated you like scum are now seen as scum by older generations for quitting  and ironically these same older generations say fast food isnt a real job well if it isnt a real job why call millennials lazy for not wanting to work fast food theyre lazy for not wanting to work non real jobs huh arent you guys the same people who said well if you dont like it find a better paying job which millennials did take your advice and now you guys are mad about it lol   tldr corporations sold the american people lies about employees being essential heroes but not wanting to pay anything more than minimum same fast food places were forcing workers to come in if they had covid while treating them even worse during the pandemic fast food places nearly tripled in orders but did not have enough staff which caused extreme pressure and workers working nearly 14 hours in many cases and greatly increased stress many americans in turn assaulted and harassed workers because food was taking too long when they expect 100 chipotle items to be done in 10 minutes not exaggerating managers treated employees worse and fast food workers were being treated to inhumane levels fast food workers toon the boomers advice on finding better paying jobs and now boomers are mad because no one will make their big mac anymore,mzn2cu

370,Rant - empathetic people get the shaft in the workforce,in my personal experience and through observations of other  empathetic people ive become very disheartened ive spent almost 15 years in management and other leadership roles and in every case ive seen myself and other empathetic people shuffled to the side because our focus was on our people more than the shortterm company gains  more broadly if you do a google search for best careers for empaths the lists you get back are full of service jobs teaching school counselor etc all of which are pretty low paying especially if youre talking about someone looking to exit the corporate sector  rarely you can find highly empathetic senior leaders and company leaders often because they helped build the company in the first place but in my experience most people welcomed into upper leadership put the shortterm bottom line before their employees  the thing is outsiders to this sub will read that and think i have no idea how business works except i do i just reject the idea that it has to work that way dan price is a great example of a highly empathetic leader who puts his employees first but he built that company and maintained his leadership i cant imagine that any company ive ever worked for would hire someone like dan into senior leadership much less as ceo  sorry for the rant im so tired having maybe a couple hours where im not eaten up by stress wake up and immediate anxiety knowing i have go do something i hate and currently cant find something i enjoy that can pay the bills anxious all day finally after dinner it starts to subside but then a couple hours before bed time knowing i have to do it all again kicks things back into gear  i like working i dont mind working for someone else but i want to be valued as a person and for the strengths i bring to the team not whether or not i can make the company the most amount of money possible,mzspb0

379,I’m so frustrated and burnt out and I don’t know what to do.,so i started a new job about 2 months ago after walking out of my job where i was verbally abused daily  i really liked this job when i first started it was normal a desk job which is fine with me i would just put my headphones in and do my work i was getting praise constantly i felt validated after everything that happened at my last job  then one person quit because they were not comfortable with the covid rules here and another was fired for performance issues  now my boss has asked me to take over both of their tasks which i dont even mind the thing is ive had no training on their work so i am making small mistakes here and there  however my boss calls me out on them in snarky ways and its just frustrating to me because im trying to help them out and be flexible etc etc  im no longer getting praise but only getting told about when i do something wrong even though i was never shown how to do the task and when i do have questions i ask and then do whatever they tell me to do so if thats wrong then im not really sure how im supposed to know that obviously im asking how to do it because i dont know how to do it so how is that my fault if they tell me to do it wrong i feel like im talking in circles  anyway i feel like ive got myself in a hole just because i was trying to make a good impression and seem willing to help when they asked if i could take on the other tasks   im just so tired of this cycle i was so happy getting this job and now this past week has just felt like the same shit i left my last job for,mzwtaw
380,I live in a country where I get 1300€/mth for doing nothing.

393,"u/KatnissXcis says, ""You're not a great individualist if you rely on the exploitation of others, you're a leech.""",this may be surprising but this is how i understand individualism to me youre not a great individualist if you rely on the exploitation of others youre a leech who most likely lacks the necessary skills to provide for yourself and if your slaves were to become individualists youd most likely   die  if you are a capitalist supporter youre probably not a true individualist by action of exploitation,mzgsao
394,I hate businesses operating with little to no regard for covid while my industry is still in shambles,prior to the pandemic i was a freelance musician in austin tx i moved there after the ringling brothers circus closed in 2017 i had been touring with them in the band prior to moving there was on an insane grind for two years getting established in the scene in austin by april 2019 i finally had enough teaching and playing work to leave my pt job amp freelance full time working insanely hard both in jobs amp practicing was what got me to that point   by the end of 2019 i was living the life more gigs than i could handle i was actually having to pass some along to other players life was great   when the pandemic hit i couldnt get through unemployment couldnt afford to stay in austin with no gigs so i left now im in the midwest making 16hr as an assistant manager at a trampoline park and hate it   16hr isnt shit after taxes it comes to just under 2kmo that literally leaves me nothing after i pay bills and buy groceries the owners are booking around 20 birthday parties every saturday wont let us enforce masks capacity limits are a joke and it kills me   it kills me places like this can operate with virtually no restrictions yet my entire industry is still in shambles im so pissed the life i had worked so hard to build for myself has been stripped due to things completely out my control for the second time the first being the circus closing i was planning on doing that gig until retirement   my boss at the park asked me if i enjoyed my fat check the other day because the owners were in hawaii on vacation amp didnt get my direct deposit info on time so i had to wait another two weeks to get paid i laughed in their face and told them i used to make that in a week   i hate everything about this country its disgusting how little people are expected to get by on im not antiwork im anti bullshit wages forget 15 minimum wage that doesnt let you get ahead at all anyone who thinks thats enough should foad   i cant transition to a heavy online presence because that requires gear that requires money and at my current rate i literally never have enough left over to get what i need to get started   my only silver lining is that i have opportunities to audition for doctoral programs for fall 22 but even then unless i get a tuition waiver and teaching assistantship i wont be able to afford to attend im trying desperately to save money but at my current pay its literally impossible to do   i feel trapped betrayed hopeless desperate and broken my main reason for wanting to get a doctorate is so i can get hired as a professor in a developed nation that actually takes care of its people i hate this country,mz2bri

396,I'm tired of the DEI theater,possibly uscentric but not sure dei diversity equity and inclusion is a crucial concept that has become a meaningless buzzword i work at two different nonprofits and they are both constantly talking about promoting dei yet they abuse their workers which includes bipoc were asked to set personal dei related goals when we have no power over company policy dealing with this constant hypocrisy tires me out id prefer it if the people in management just admitted that they were depraved individuals who dont give a shit,mzc83c
397,always a double standard to be had.,i work a bullshit job which deals with very deadlinedriven deliverables ever since i started here ive been told by my boss and senior team member to work around other peoples time constraints for example this persons going on vacation make sure to get their required information before they leave this persons traveling all day make sure to only call them after theyve arrived at their destination this person wont be able to get you what you need until the end of the work day make sure to work all night on your own time to get their stuff ready for the next morning  meanwhile i bought a flight out of town several weeks ago which my team already knows about a project just came up today its deadline is smack in the middle of my flight i told them id like to get this project done a couple hours early so that it will already be submitted by the time i leave for the airport which i didnt think would be a problem instead of replying oh well make sure to work around your constraints and finish our portion of the project early to accommodate you they gave me looks of disgust and confusion and said why cant you just reschedule your flight  fuck this place lol,mzs7og

402,How do I stop getting everyone's work when people retire?,let me preface this by im stuck here  as much as i hate it here there really isnt anything better given my age and place in life  i manage a super busy small office of 12 its pure chaos and i can barely support myself on what i make  my boss makes 75k and they created my position to do 90 of his job  no i do not want his job  ever  its bad enough at my level but its worse at his  at least i can go home at 5pm he gets calls at all hours from people above him  hes one of those kiss ass charming bullies so he gets away with everything  i am not like that  id rather be poor than be him  there is another manager here and because im stupid i know more about her job than i should  in a year my boss and the other manager are going to retire  tag im it  if i dont come up with a game plan now my life is going to get a whole lot worse  ive been here 2 years and i took on additional work and today i gave it all back  that is step one  how do i start setting up my life so im not stuck doing their jobs because i stupidly showed them that im good at what i do,mz4u03

405,Overworked and underpaid. Story of our lives.,i work in the public sector and have witnessed some horrendous behaviour and treatment from my employer im flabbergasted by self absorbed egomaniacs who become managers and leaders its truly disheartening to see people get treated like shit and i need to vent i apologize for this lengthy post   our boss is a self absorbed racist thinks they are woke but really not and treats their employees with utter disrespect weve had high turnover in our department ever since our boss started unusual in our field since most employees stay for a long time   the quickest someone has left was 2 weeks after they joined the job weve had people whove worked there for years transfer to other positions or departments just to avoid our insane boss my boss has their favorites but talks shit about everyone behind their back every conversation you have with them is negative bullshit about work their employees or some drama between other higher ups or even their family members its honestly mentally tiring to have a conversation with them when they are talking shit about their own employees to you when i am also their employee   my boss brings their pet employee  a part timer very young lower level employee with them to their house to run personal errands which i personally believe is a huge breach of ethics due to the age and power imbalance boss makes this pet employee  mow their lawn build furniture help them move takes them to run personal errands  one time which made that pet employee late to work because they were both running a personal errand together my boss has been grooming this pet employee since its their first real job and has basically been manipulating them into  becoming their lackey now this pet employee sees boss toxic behaviour as normal workplace behaviour she excuses my bosses toxic behaviour as them having a bad day or saying they just have a lot on their plate i have bad days too but i dont treat people like shit its frustrating because boss had treated me like shit some days and this pet employee excuses their behaviour when directly witnessing this shit boss also tells this pet employee about all the interoffice bs  workplace problems and personal confidential info so this pet employee tells me this shit before anyone else even knows  ie like when a employee is leaving a job huge breach of company regulations  its crazy how much bullshit my boss gets away with funny thing is that boss was mad at pet employee one time and started talking shit about her to me if she only knew   employees have complained but my boss was bragging to me one day about how hr sided with them how is that something to brag about its honestly infuriating how people can get away with treating people like this boss has said racist shit to me about other races and has made offhanded comments about my race and culture im poc ive brushed it off as ignorance but my boss is seriously a racist prick after i witnessed them making blatant racist and ageist remarks about white women hypocritical bc they are white and middle aged my boss is a loud braggadocios blobfish who doesnt think before they speak and says the most ignorant comments well apparently higher ups noticed and my boss started to complain about how they have to take more sensitivity training the most infuriating thing is seeing them treat others like shit i wish i can stand up and say what they are doing is wrong but at the end of the day its easier to replace a lower level employee  ive stayed and witnessed the most insane bullshit from this birdpecked brainturd im also overqualified and severely underpaid  but due to covid job hunting has been hard i accepted this job since it was my first real job and i liked that i was helping otherd i love my job but this toxic work culture has made me hate what i do my boss toxic behaviour has also affected my confidence and mental health ive started having anxiety attacks which ive never experienced before starting this job i dread going into work everyday the customers i see every day make up for that,mymav2
406,Need advice on being talked to for comments,warning wall of text  i was called into a meeting today regarding 2 comments i said during lunch time that the higher ups deemed unacceptable one of my comments were i was telling my coworkers how i was asking one of managers what i needed to know which task to prioritize but i guess how i worded it when i was telling my coworkers the story was unacceptable i even clarified with the high ups what i meant and what i actually said to the manager they still said what i commented was unacceptable   the other comment was i said i not gonna plan to work overtime after busy season we already been pulling ot for several months now their response was them giving me a lecture as to why certain task were assigned to me and even the other department and the reason why everyone is working all this overtime is so no one needs need to work till 78pm to pick up the slack i already knew this i dont need to be reminded however the whole reason why we are in this position is because they didnt hire enough ppl and we have had crazy turn over   but they were saying my comments will create a negative work environment but in reality its already happened im just opinions as senior who has been for many years now   i left the meeting just saying i understand but i also didnt apologize to them however this conversation made my blood boil after thinking it over because it felt like what commented was twisted in the way i looked bad and even though i tried to clarify what i meant they still deemed it unacceptable   do you guys think i should escalate this incident to the owner of the company thoughts are appreciated,mys7qd

411,What should I do?,sorry if it doesnt relate to this subreddit but i kinda feel it does  im currently 23 years old and i work as an electrical engineer which i dont like and wanna do something about it i wanna accomplish something by my 25th birthday so i wont have to wake up everyday and feeling like shit and sad that i didnt die in my sleep because now i have to go to work   im very good at playing video games fps to be specific and i always wanted to upload videos on youtube and make living out of it my friends always used to tell me that i should try record my gameplay and upload it on youtube since i can get some clips etc honestly to me its sounds like a dream where you do something you enjoy and also get paid for it  at the same time i also got some programming knowledge so thats another thing i can do but i dont really have any passion for it its just something that i at least can tolerate doing   so the point is i dont really know what to chose and  spend 12 years to master and and make living out of it i really wanna try the youtube thing but i believe its very hard to succeed at it even if you got something to show a lot of people also do this as well at the same time programming is gonna be easier since i got engineering degree and junior level of knowledge but im still gonna end up like a typical wage slave that have to work from 9 to 5 i cant do both since i only got 5 hours of free time after work and because of that i wont be able to master both things  thank you in advance for your help,mz4sbd

416,Maybe we should just accept that life for 99 percent is endless work,and buy energy drinks in bulk to shotgun every morning so were almost as juiced up as our boss who can afford cocaine   embrace capitalism and soak up every second of our days off as we stroll round the mall and tell ourselves that this is what freedom is   the american dream is not dead were living it we just need a healthy dose of caffeine to see it,mzgnjh

418,Louder for the people in the back!, dam west  200 he adamcbest  capitalism has told us that the american dream is becoming a megamillionaire or even millionaire the american dream should be collectively building a society where nobody starve or goes homeless and everybody is treated equally fully insured and paid a living wage ,myo5o7
419,How do you think capitalism has remained this long without the majority of people killing themselves,it doesnt make sense at all,mzt1of
420,I don't want to go back...,this is going to be super long so just a heads up there lol   i appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this but i mainly just want to get it off my chest and get it out in the world     im coming around to the big picture of that i have to go back into the work force again sometime soon i have been unemployed for almost a year and unlike a lot of people i have lost my benefits and have been going without pay since october my savings is slowly going down and im realizing the time is coming that i need to do something about it and its killing me i understand i have to work im not lazy or anything like that either because when i worked i busted my ass and made life changing sacrifices for nothing my life consisted of work work work and it has gotten me literally nothing  but i have been in the comfort of my own home and doing things that i love for almost a year and its killing me knowing i have to give it up and become a slave again i dont want to leave my fianc and animals i love being with them all the time and doing whatever i want i dont have the pressure of meeting these stupid standards for the workforce or pretending i care about bullshit surveys i also dont have to worry about my life vanishing before my eyes because im working 40 hours a week to have a whole measly two days off  but as of right now my life is great and i see no fight to go back to working i want to stay inside all day no problem i want to write all day go right ahead i want to go on a road trip lets pack up i dont want to go back to some bullshit ass place and have someone dictate my life i dont want my life to be surrounded by work again and making sure im right on time and make the good old boss happy   i dont want anyone to ever have power over me again whether it be customers or managers i dont want to get abused by these people ever again im not a doormat im human   i guess i should talk about it i dont really talk about it that much and if i do i just call him a fucking asshole but this is where my main issues with work have scarred me  okay quick backstory i started working at a grocery store right after high school it was fine i was young amp trying to go to community college but it didnt work out because i picked income over school then i moved to the midwest to be closer to my family but work took over and i was working so much i didnt have time for family then i moved back home tried college again but i realized i wasnt a school person and worked retail and also a mobile clinic i liked the clinic even though the hours were long but it was only on the weekends then i got a certification for hr amp after that was completed i quickly found a job and the job that completely fucked me up  i dont know why i even accepted the job oct 2017 let alone stayed as long as i did 910 months left junejuly 2018 my family was so proud of me because i found a big girl job and the work was easy enough but the place was horrible   it was for an adult day care and i was the administrative assistant the interview was insane to me i remember my future boss was making these mocking faces at me and using pressure and anger to try and throw me off guard i walked out of the interview thinking that guy is an asshole and theres no way i got that job because it seemed like he really didnt like me a couple days go by and i get the call that i got the job i was shocked because i literally didnt think i was going to get it and everyone told me to take it and maybe the boss was just being a bad cop to find the right person it paid 1465 an hour and i never made that much money before at the time   my duties were checking clients in from 7am11am i loved these clients and i feel so bad they are stuck in this shithole calling potential hires doing reference checks and monthly charting of course some other things here and there but it was easy but it was never enough for this douche bag if the potential hire went ghost on me it was my fault if the reference checks didnt match up to his standers or didnt give answers that he wanted it was my fault if the reference checks never answered it was my fault everything was my fault i was in charge of the food delivers and if the meal didnt come out how it was supposed to he would expect me to scream at them and get angry with them when i am not an angry person and i dont see a reason to be so hateful when two people can calmly talk about an issue but if i didnt yell he would look at me with his squinted up eyes and scream at me for being weak   he would abuse me to pieces where i would cry going to work at work and coming home to work i couldnt handle the pressure of everything being my fault again and again i never received any training for anything so i figured it all on my own yet i never was enough compared to the woman who was here 14 years prior if i had a question about my work i answered with a sigh amp how could you not know this i remember i asked the nurse a question about the client charts to make sure i was doing it right and she went to him and complained that i asked her about it and he yelled at me for being so embarrassing okay i guess i should just fuck up the charts and when you guys get audited you guys can explain why theyre wrong   he abused the social worker at the place too he would scream at her as loud as he would scream at me one time before i got hired there he threw the phone at her because he was so mad at her how can your employee make you that angry i tried everything i could to report him but he was best friends with the owner of the place and also ran the compliance program that if you had to report an issue with the place he would be in charge of it i had an issue on my first week of the job where one of the drivers was being very flirty with me he would make these comments about how i looked and would bring me coffee in the morning i was 21 at the time and he was 50 i told the boss how uncomfortable i was with his actions and he laughed at me and told me to stop being stuck up for someone being nice   a few months of being hired there i found out my mom had cancer ugh i hate talking about this he saw i was down and abused me even more he wouldnt allow me to leave early and be with her because i had the weekend to do that and when the cancer became terminal eight months of being here i had to write a report asking to take half days for her final weeks once she passed he gave me three days off to grieve and that was it if i just lost my mom at 22 my best friend and i couldnt even spend that much time with her because i had to suck it up and do this stupid fucking job i regret it so much i feel so stupid that i did this and regret it more than anyone could knowunderstand  the plan was to spread her ashes in florida in an environmentally friendly way i asked him if i could do this was planning to do it no matter what and i gave him three weeks notice he gives me this very smug look and goes you dont have vacation time until youre here for a year im dont think so my mouth dropped to the floor and the tears started right away i had to excuse myself and ten minutes later my phone rings and he goes you know i had to make a couple calls and i guess you can go charlie is going to have to do all your work for you and hes a real busy guy but he said he didnt mind like youre such a piece of fucking shit im not going to kiss your feet because you broke your back to let me spread my moms fucking ashes  after i came back i remember i had this one reference check that wouldnt answer and i faxed this woman i emailed her and called her daily yet i get the call from him screaming to come to his office to sit down and talk he had the other program director there and he was screaming at me telling me how much of a horrible worker i am and i cant do anything right and how hes disgusted that i cant get this reference to respond i just lost my momand youre yelling at me over a reference check i take the abuse theres a half hour left in the day and write out all the abuse i have taken and what i witnessed with the other employees i woke up early the next day and got to the office before anyone showed up and left my keys and the letter on my desk i emailed the other hr people that were at the other location my letter and that was it  i escaped and to this day hes still there i hate that i put myself through that and i wish i was smart enough to leave or not even accept the job   a few weeks later i was hired as a manager at a retail company the customers sucked as always its retail but my manager was very nice but i spent so much time working there and the abuse from a manager was replaced with abuse from customers i left when covid happened because they werent taking any precautions and i was exhausted from the customers that were upset over a twodollar coupon here take it ill make it five dollars off if you just fuck off   my mom was an amazing woman but she worked all her life she worked two jobs to make ends meet and i appreciate her sacrifice but the year she was supposed to start her retirement she found out she had cancer and died she spent her whole life working and not living and i dont ever want to be that way i dont want to work so much for a retirement that i might not even see one day because no one is guaranteed their life at 60 shit people arent even guaranteed their life the day they wake up and start their day   i just want to live    thank you for your time,mz5pix

425,Do people want to achieve the dream.... or do they want to complain about it?,hey guys so there are a few ways to achieve the dream of not going into work i have almost done it myself but when i share how i did it here i get alot of hate when i show other people the path i took i get alot of dislike and nobody follows i took the cryptocurrency route to breaking out of the debt slave cycle   but here is something to think about how do you break the cycle of work how do you personally see yourself breaking out of the rat race if you simply post here on reddit and foment and complain and post memes that will not change the fact that your boss has dollars and you dont it will not change the fact that your bosses boss paid dollars to get free government loans for employing you and took a nice healthy helping for himself before he gave you those dollars it does not change the fact that those dollars are also worth less than they were just two months ago and all the supermarket prices went up because the dollars that the gov gave to your bosses boss were printed out of thin air   the united states government is robbing you your boss is robbing you your bosses boss is robbing you and of course nobody will ever tax the likes of jeff bezos cause jeff has his fingers in the government pockets yay  so here is the thing unless you change your actions you are doomed to grow poorer and poorer at just a slow enough rate that instead of getting mad and fighting back you slip further and further into despair you will never have enough spare money to date buy a house raise children or do anything else a biological organism was meant to do you will die young poor alone impoverished and your boss will make bank   so the next point you will inevitably ask how can i fight back you cannot fight back through the legislature you know why your boss paid more money to the representatives of both parties than your entire neighborhood makes your elected representatives listen to the people who pays the bills your bosses you cannot fight back with weapons the police will shoot to kill and will outgun you entirely   there is however one way you can fight back you can change the narrative about what has value do intricate pieces of paper art that are mass printed have any inherent value no that 100 sign magically confers that the piece of paper is worth more than the 1 when you need to buy food never mind the fact that the fed prints both for free and gives them away to your bosses via the bonds market the moment people stop believing that the us dollar has any value is the moment when the entire edifice of work and the society that has been built as a prison around us comes crashing down   this is why cryptocurrency is important if the haves suddenly see all their net worth evaporate and the have nots suddenly see these magical tokens they hold on ledgers suddenly have value then wealth is redistributed to the masses   so is cryptocurrency a big ponzi scheme maybe but if its a ponzi scheme is a scheme with a goal in mind burn down the bigger ponzi scheme that is reckless federal printing and giving of free money to the 1 we need a major wealth redistribution and the only way that is going to happen is if all cryptocurrencies take off in value cryptos are something that the everyday person can hold onto and obtain value from you are a slave to the system and you need to break free,mxqrj8

428,How I view everything,the government had black slaves that were taken away from them for humane justices so they needed legal slaves black slaves did all the hard labor work and i mean all of it and when this was taken away there were no slaves left to work freely   so the government needed to devise a way to get people to work for them still they created minimum wage and its called this because its what the minimal amount of moneys needed to keep the worker slave coming back for more money  never satisfied only hungered since a wealthy man is seen more than   as population grew the number of labor jobs grew as well as the overall segregation began to collapse white people began to take black peoples jobs not by choice but because there was nothing left since what was rightfully just became fruition and black people started obtaining nonslave labor jobs   and because of all of this nothing ever changed so the government created colleges to educate people so they wouldnt have to have labor jobs aka slave jobs but the lack of access to college for a mass majority of americans has created a system of failures   and now in 2021 you have jobs paying not enough money to afford a no bedroom studio apartment everyone is either living with their parents leeching a relationship or homeless a bunch of kids taught to work to live is the only answer trickled along by a 15 a hour on a rope hanging over their head blinded by the thought that it should be 44 a hour   the government spends trillions of dollars to fight an imaginary war a government who allows billionaires to milk the poor a government who cares more about its own image than its own citizens who spends less money on us than any other country who for the past 5 years has destroyed democracy a government who has created a uncertain future for 80 of its people a government who only cares about the wealthy a government who denies mentally ill people disability income a government of just absolute shit   until the government stops legal slave ownership i refuse to work i am anti work because i refuse to bust my ass for 40 hours a week to make 600 before taxes in a world where apple charges 660 for a headset it doesnt add up  i rather be poor than work and be poor we all die and take nothing with us theres no point,mxz1ps

448,Seasonal work may be an alternative for those who hate traditional work.,i stumbled across this sub and have been lurking for awhile the system sucks and it really does feel like torture if you dislike your jobworking in general   look into seasonal work if you work a shitty minimum wage job and want out many companies have employee housing and either cover the cost of your housing or charge a small fee for rent 100200 the company i work for charges 120month for housingutilities and pays for 3 meals a day you also get to travel to beautiful places national parks overseas etc youre still working a 95 that maymay not suck but it does relieve a lot of stress about making rent having money for other necessities and you can travel every 36 months if you choose to move around to different seasonal locations seasonal locations typically need a lot of workers and will take anyone they can get too so theres less of a barrier to entry when you apply if youre going to be forced into a shitty 95 for a company you hate might as well travel and pay little or no rent it would free up a lot of money for debt payoff saving and investing as well   i know this post doesnt necessarily fit into antiwork but i hope someone finds this helpful or looks into this as another route in life until you can get to the point of not working if this doesnt apply to you im sorry for wasting your time amp have a great day im sorry so many of you are unhappy and struggling in regards to workfinances and best of luck to you,myd3qn

455,What are we working towards,hello everyone ive been a long time lurker and a now a first time poster i wanted to make this post because most of the sub is memes and not substantive discussion which is problematic for a lot of reasons of course not that the memes are bad or unfunny but i think without some other kind of content its easy to fall into a kind of capitalist trap more on that later  today i wanted to write a little bit about the concept of hope and why its important to not only be critical of the landscape we are currently inhabiting but also to develop an imagination for a future that could be in fact it is deadly important as failure to create a vision of a postwork society will only allow the wheels of capitalist oppression to keep turning in its quest to crush all of humanity     desire and feelings    we know that the labor landscape we inhabit is bad because it makes us feel bad we come home from work tired and angry unable to do any of the things that actually gives us rest or makes us happy because those activities that give us true satisfaction are difficult and work in themselves it is work to maintain close relationships with your family friends significant other it is work to improve yourself as a human being it is work to do whatever hobby it is that you love we are expected to sell all of our energy and leave none for ourselves and for our communities family friends significant others  work itself is necessary even when humanity was just gaining consciousness millions of years ago it took some amount of work to gather tools and food and shelter but we only gathered what we needed and then we stopped   yet now were in a cult of devoting all of our energy towards the accumulation of stuff or worse towards the accumulation of our basic needs for survival in the 21st century nobody is free from the cult of work whether you are rich or poor both classes feel the tyranny of consumption though with different stakes in the outcome  we all know this if we didnt we wouldnt be on this sub i say this because its important to recognize that if we know our current landscape is bad because it makes us feel depressed and suicidal we should be actively pursuing a landscape that makes us feel good and satisfied we have desires just most of the time were too tired to even consider what they might be  recently ive taken up a new practice well see how long it lasts im not a terribly disciplined person and i dont care to be the practice is this get up at six in the morning two hours before i go to work and just reflect on how i feel it has to be before i go to work if its after ill feel too tired to do it properly i expend this mental energy before i go to work because it doesnt matter to me if i go to work with all of my mental energy i want some for myself  this has been an incredible exercise it gives me time to think about how i feel what i want and how i want to get that if i was smarter id probably also try to think of ways to change the landscape of my community as well but im not that smart and worrying about myself is enough for now  its crazy to me how much having time to think can change things     cynicism and memes    critique is good full stop memes actually are a weirdly good format for passive critique an observation followed by a quick interpretation that is easy to digest but if thats where the antiwork discourse begins and ends then all were doing is pacifying ourselves by complaining and getting the easy dopamine hit of upvotes for it  my broad critique of left internet spaces on twitter and reddit and youtube is that theyre overwhelmingly critical with no call to action this in fact seems to be exactly what the capitalist wants  for all the consciousness that has been produced by the internet theres so little action that follows not only that the critique has the effect of a drug a little hit of satisfaction at being correct while pacifying us to the need to act   or worse i was talking to a friend on discord the other day who being awakened to the tyranny of work since graduating college has decided to spend all of his free money investing in order to retire early what  thats the opposite of what were trying to do in order to escape the capitalist machine hes perpetuating the system that exploits him  he has been awakened to the capitalist machine that exploits him but without an imagination for a future without capitalism his only hope for escape is to become a capitalist and exploit others     tying it all together    my thought process is a little scattered but here it is in its basic form people are being awakened to their own exploitation on the daily it seems that kids my age im twentytwo and younger have a consciousness we are rapidly being disillusioned with the cult of work yet there is no hope for something better the escape that i see people pursuing is becoming an exploiter instead of being an exploited  we must create a vision for something beyond capitalism something that can exist in the real world and then we must communicate that vision but in order to have a vision we have to know what makes us happy we have to know how we feel  critique lets us know that the world we inhabit isnt good but we also need to know what is good in order to go after it theres a brilliant movie called burnhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvan7ownw6we by italian director gillo pontecorvohttpsenwikipediaorgwikigillopontecorvo about a colonized island in the carribean that is trying to liberate itself in the middle of the film the revolutionary leader jos dolores is speaking to english provocateur sir william walker about the nature of liberation he says  gtit is better to know where youre going but not know how to get there than it is to know how to get there but not know where you are going  meaning this liberation requires imagination it requires imagining a world that you would be happy to live in  thats all i got i apologize if this is too scattered or hard to follow  tldr read the thing part of the process is slowing down to read,myd6y3

480,"Graduating in two weeks, not excited at all to enter the work force",i am an engineering student who graduates in two weeks i have a good job lined up with a good salary and benefits but i am not excited for it at all  in fact as i think more and more about my future i am feeling sadder and sadder i have only have two internships in college which was my main perspective into the work world but those were both very depressing they were both 85 corporate engineering jobs where i went into an office for 89 hours a day to do 24 hours of work  i cannot escape that i was lied to by everyone i my life that graduating and getting a good job would make me feel happy and fulfilled but i am now realizing that i do not think work will make me happy or fulfilled and rather it is simply a means of acquiring the money i need to live i just felt so sad having so much of my time taken up by work and having almost no time to do the things i actually enjoy also i hate that everyone else seems to just have accepted these poor conditions especially when so much time is wasted at the office anyways  i do not consider myself lazy as i graduated with honors from both my high school and college but i really hate the idea of having to work a corporate job for the next 40 years of my life just to support a family with kids   at this point im really not sure i even want kids if it means i have to work a job i hate to support them and i lose all my free time and freedom why make those sacrifices just for kids  anyways i am feeling very sad about graduating even though i didnt have the best time in college because i dealt with a lot of anxiety and depression and i had to work hard because of engineering and im not sure what to do i am thinking about joining e peace corp but my current partner doesnt seem like they would support that  i honestly wish i had done an easier degree and partied and had fun through out college if i knew i was going to have leave college and work a depressing job regardless of what i majored in i also know some people with easier degrees who seem to have the same level of jobs  anyone have any advice on how to overcome these feelings or patches other than general corporate work,mxabma

482,our society is mechanistic and doesn't allow for emotions,one of the worst parts about work culture is that it demotes our humanity in more ways than one  at the workplace the only feeling that is allowed is surface positivity  and the way work is set up in its mechanics and logistical aspects your mood and your current place in life is irrelevant to the job you just broke up with someone or was sexually harassed at a bar during the weekend or your cousin just died it doesnt matter youre supposed to be at work  it doesnt matter if im feeling sad and need to isolate myself from other humans for a while it doesnt matter if i need to focus on grieving the fact that ive been ill for months at my own pace i need to be at work because its a weekday for fuck sake  were not people with our own lives moods and feelings  were just tools beasts of burden  for some reason we are to treat our coworkers as beasts of burden but also as family members at the same time  lets do some customer service lets get those sales guys lets not deal with our shitty attitudes towards each other and focus on getting those sweet lifeaffirming stats   society does need mechanized aspects in order to function well for a huge amount of people but we humans have allowed ourselves to mechanize our own minds our entire lives in order to devote ourselves to neverending production and neverending optimization of efficiency but we are not machines we are feeling animals,mxnx8i

And I hate it.,i work in a call center some weeks ago i got a promotion as a supervisor   now i had my fair share on this industry from technical support to video game support but this is the first time i get to be something else other than an agent the gist of it is that i see some of my colleagues that do not work they have cases in their inboxes and calls keep coming of course they know that i am not an asshole and i will not call them out for it but if the upper management gives me shit about low productivity all the time i will get fired   so i went to each and every colleague and talked to them and they feel like how i feel slaves to the grind and demotivated the company i work for is not the best but it is far from worse but if you worked in a call center before you already know the turnover rate   i am in place right now that i have to take actions for some colleagues of mine but i dont want to because i understand them i am not power tripping just because i became supervisor the thing is that if i dont show signs of improvement i will get fired and i get fired i wont have income until i find another job which is hard in my country greece and i dont want to fall in the bullshit of toxic positivity   i have extreme anxiety over this and i threw up today my colleagues are not the enemy the upper management is with all their reporting and their kpis they base their evaluation of the people in fucking numbers fuck this industry but regrettably its the only thing i know,mx2zqc

552,"""jUsT gEt A bEtTeR jOb!""",for starters what the fuck counts as a better job  lets pretend for sake of argument that your rent is 800 per month your utilities including electric water trash a phone plan and internet are 250 per month your food cost is 250 per month your car payment is 250 per month your car insurance is 100 per month and you pay 0 for health insurance and student loans that is 19800 per year if we double that to 39600 and add 400 for a year of clothes and shoes we come to 40000  of course while we may have 50 discretionary income that does not include income taxes personal care and hygiene products sudden expenses car repair and maintenance retirement plan contributions etc   20 per hour 40 hours a week comes out to 41600 annually this is what i would consider to be middle class although just the very bottom layer of it especially when many places like gas stations and department stores are hiring for 15hr here and honestly 15hr should be the standard to survive   this is the latest data from the bls may of 2020  httpswwwblsgovoes2020maydistributionhtmhttpswwwblsgovoes2020maydistributionhtm  lots of math below ill separate it to make it easier   gtwe get 488 of all workers making 1874hr or less the next range is 1875 to 2399 dollars an hour which is a range of 524 at 141 percent lt  gtthis leaves us with 12 needed to state that half of all workers make 20 or less per hour i can comfortably say since the percent of distribution is 141 percent that 12 needed to gap 126hr would be true lt  gtat the start of the pandemic before things went to shit there was a record number of 1646 million people working meaning of those 823 million were earning 20 an hour or less lt  gtso what does all this mean lt  gtto get a better job would create two problems the first being the need to create or modify 823 million jobs that would pay 20 or more an hour lt  gtthe second problem would be needing to find people that would want to work at 20 per less an hour lt  gthow many of those 823 million jobs would want to increase their hourly pay to 20 or more per hour lt  gtif we look at our dataset again 346 percent of the workforce currently earns between 1175 and 1874 per hour i highly doubt that of the lower two ranges which account for 142 of the workforce would want to make an increase from 1174 to 20 per hour if we pitch in the next highest range which brings us to a max of 1474 an hour or 329 percent of the work force i doubt those would be willing either so if we take the next range 1475 to 1874 accounting for 159 percent of jobs and say 3 percent of the next range peaking at 20 per hour we have 189 percent of all jobs of a range from 1474 per hour to 20 per hour what percent in reality would be willing to increase wages to 20 per hour my guess is around 10 percent this gives us 311 million jobs willing to increase pay to 20 per hour 189 percent range of total workforce making 147520 per hour is 311 million jobslt  gtso we have 311 million jobs willing to increase pay leaving us with 792 million jobs needed to be created to pay at least 20 per hour lt  gtwhich is almost half the workforcelt  even if 5 of those people got lucky and found a higher paying job we would still need 396 million new jobs remember 311 million of those 311 million were willing to increase pay  meaning we would either need to create 4 million new jobs or take 4 million jobs away from other people making 20 or more neither are realistic   to put this in perspective amazon currently employs about 900k in the us walmart employees 16 million and mcdonalds employs about 400k totaling 29 million   this means to elevate just five percent of the total workforce to a job that pays 20 or more an hour we would need to create the equivalent of  all mcdonalds in the us  all walmart stores in the us  all amazon distribution centers corporate offices etc  plus another million jobs    or demand about 15 million jobs that currently pay between 14751999 an hour increase their pay to 20 an hour but remember that only helps 5 of the workforce too     so the next time someone says to get a better job remind them we would need to create almost 4 million new jobs out of thin air or demand a wage increase on 15 million jobs just to give 5 of people a better paying job,mvsva1

554,Choosing between crippling anxiety or functional depression while working,ive never been this depressed in my adult life  2 years ago i left a high stress job in the dental field where id work 3 occasionally 4 long 1012 hour days plus one half day a week and almost always a 3 day weekend i had benefits while not very good ones but did get a decent amount of vacation and sick time the office i worked at would close for a week at a time probably 9 months out of the year some months like december would have 2 weeks off in a row during those i could use vacation time and i had the option to work on projects as neededdesired for hours  this job gave me crippling anxiety and worsened my preexisting but then undiagnosed chronic pain and illness i would work myself into the ground every single shift i was constantly sick and by the end of my 6 years there was having anxiety attacks nearly every day i was there i developed chronic back pain spasms issues that i still deal with constantly   eventually i had to quit someone i know offered me a job at a small local business shorter hours but more days a week easy office job no benefits but at least i wouldnt be so stressed all the time  fast forward two years i have been ignoring my chronic pain issues because i dont have insurance i quit physical therapy because i no longer have a day off during the week to take care of that type of thing i still get horrible back pain and spasms and sitting in an office all day makes it much worse im currently dealing with a pinched nerve in my neck and back pain and am exhausted   over the 2 years ive been here ive had one paid week off 2 unpaid weeks off and during covid we did not fully shut down but my hours were drastically reduced and i basically came into work to do what needed to be done which took maybe 23 hours twice a week i am here 325 hours a week 30 on the clock sitting in this goddamn uncomfortable chair in pain   since things have been reopening our work has become busier and busier i work in the office of a constructionhome remodel type company i am constantly berated by people who are impatient rude and have too much money i have no authority here i literally do office work answer the phone pay bills make appointments i am not involved in the rest of the things that go on here   i am exhausted i am drained the phone rings constantly people hang up on me or yell at me if i have to schedule an appointment for them they dont want to wait for they dont care that this is a very small business less than 10 employees they dont care we have probably one hundred jobs lined up currently and they are not special they have to wait like everyone else i am the first contact the front line the last contact i am the only woman who works here sometimes men wont even give me the time of day when i try to get information from them or answer questions they will only talk to my boss a man   i am paid more than minimum wage but am still low income not low enough for state insurance or any benefits low enough that i cant afford it myself low enough that if i was single i couldnt afford to live in my house anymore   i am so depressed ive never worked this much in my life and while its not that much its still 5 days a week and 35 hours of my week spent driving or at work away from home   when i was doing very limited hours during the height of covid i was painting practicing guitar walking my dog and seeing my family nearly every day now im lucky to get in a dog walk i havent painted since i came back to work full time i havent picked up my guitar since then either i see my family much less my so works about 60 hours a week and i dont see him much either there are days i go home and by the time he gets home around dinner time i havent had a single pleasant interaction with another human being and because he has worked a 12 hour day he barely has the energy to talk to me and eat dinner before falling asleep watching tv   how is this living i am miserable i want to die nearly every day but could never do that to my sister or my so or my dogs the best thing thats happened since going back to work with covid was getting another dog i cant think of much else that has made me happy over these last 10 months   i am at work crying and why am i even here im literally doing nothing i am in a lot of physical pain i am not mentally well i was yelled at by a customer for a delay i am not involved in but i am the messenger i am exhausted    if you read this all thanks im not really sure what to do i cant leave this job for reasons i dont want to share on here and i live in a rural area where not much is available anyway i hate zoom therapy and havent had an in person appointment since last february its just nice to feel like im not the only one struggling with this,mwbf5y

565,I really want the people who make job searches awful to be named and shamed,this is going to read like a rant because it is hiring processes are all so fucking bloated and i fucking hate it but people arent helping   i heard from several boomers that a store is taking walk in interviews for 15 dollars an hour ive been pretty hard up so i followed that lead knowing it was a boomerism of course each and every sign that even smelled like a job offer had apply online plastered all over it sometimes in bigger text than the walkin interview part i guess the boomers didnt like that part so they ignored it they will continue to feel validated that they proved all jobs are processed online to be a lie until they leave this earth oh and it wasnt anywhere close to 15   so after a wasted trip to jump on the chance to skip the online process i went home and filled out their shitty fucking personality quiz their insanely inefficient data entry and hit apply i had to give my address to make the account i had to give my address again to pick what store i wanted to work at i had to give my address again to apply for the specific position there were three and all of them had a separate nonsense jobtitle and the same description and i had to fill out my entire fucking address at least two more times on other paper work adjacent to the job like confirming that i can work in the us and something else that all took me about 30 minutes  i did the walk in thing the next day they asked me some stupid fucking open ended questions about my experience side eyed my patchy work history for a fucking seasonal position like how the ever living fuck are you going to say anything about an inconsistent work history if you literally offer inconsistent work eat shit and choke on it you fucking inbred excuse for a person   they told me i pretty much have the job this was 3 days ago they sent me home with instructions to come back an hour and a half later for the drug test this store was a 20 minute drive the fucker told me to my face that he did that because he wanted his lunch break   so they stick a fucking swab in my mouth to make sure they dont let anyone who participates in the devils cabbage doesnt have the privledge of dealing with slackjaw customers 8 hours a day and send me home i spent twice as long driving as i did getting drug tested if the entire fucking lab fell into a sinkhole id mark it on my calendar people told me to get a real job when i was trying to write for a living but most people actively make life worse for everyone and i fucking hate them   im now waiting for them to fucking email me a consent form so they can do a background check ive not received one but i have gotten an email telling me that ill get another email that i need to click a link on i dont know if their knotted bloated automated system shit the bed or if he was just wasting my time incase someone else didnt show up for work   every single step of this process is a direct intentional actionable act of pure malice by multiple possibly dozens of people why shouldnt i view these people with the same amount of hate and disgust they treat me with why do they get to hide behind anonymity if you cant even vote on a union without people bending over backwards to make sure the voting booth is in plain sight of the bosses    we just need to start over its rotten to the core im tired of pretending these people are human,mwm464

572,does anyone have advice about quitting an extremely understaffed job with overemotional coworkers?,since covid the company i work at has been laying people off  everywhere causing every single person at the company to carry pretty much double or triple the workload they were once responsible for i wont get into it more than that but the environment of the company now has led me to the decision that im ready to go however the company has forced everyone including me at times to feel as if you owe something to it and your coworkers constantly using the were a family and we are here for each other language and most insidiously imo occasionally using hr people to hang our benefits packages over our head reminding us that we have healthcare and all this shit only because we work there i know in my conscious brain these are obviously tactics to keep you too guilty to set boundaries or quit but i do feel as though sometimes i cant go through with my plan to leave in a few months because i owe it to them for letting me work right out of college and through the pandemic healthcare etc  i also am terrified of even having that conversation with my boss because she is extremely emotional and selfinvested to the point where i hate telling her the truth because it just never comes across correctly to her   i want to give two weeks but some people say give up to a months notice if you work in an understaffed environment i mean really i want to just leave the day i tell them im quitting but i dont think thats totally an option if i ever want to work again   sorry for the rant basically tldr just want to know if anyones had experience quitting a super understaffed office job where everyone is very emotionally invested in the family faade of the company and you know people would take your leaving personally,mw9pu1
573,Just packed up and walked out...,please dont follow my example unless you have money saved up  today ends 2 years of torment at an abomination of a company   story time  2 years ago i was hired by this company to come in and manage their engineering projects i came in with all kinds of processes and tools ready to wrangle everything up within 2 weeks it was glaringly clear that they were understaffed ok i can work with that i will use my expertise and put together some tools to demonstrate we are understaffed and present it   done boss says we cannot get headcount youll have to make due i respond that its not possible deaf ears 13 active development projects and production support with one engineer   3 months later i am the scapegoat for everything being late and i sat in fear for months my job was in jeopardy worked to the bone and every week it was a 1 on 1 about how i need to improve etc etc   new year rolls around i was able to close out 8 of the 13 projects in 9 months to the tune of 5mil in replacement and new incremental business no raise no bonus no thank you i was rewarded with a demotion from management to engineering because  its your background and we need engineering help it will only be 3 months   pay stayed the same i guess thats fine holy crap was i wrong they quickly piled on new business and overwhelmed me and the other day engineer he put in his notice they move another employee like me to engineering from a different role the 2 of us survived all the covid layoffs while they kept adding projects   well another year passed and out of nowhere they sell our division to a competitor who is smaller and mom and pop not corporate we lose a majority of our benefits all of our bonuses and vacation we had no control and accepted the new roles to stay employed   i kept my title and pay but was told still do engineering figured id give them a try while i job hunt   they add more and more work they switch databases and tell me and the 1 other engineer to do the data entry ill spare the details but roughly 800 hours of data entry to go along with the 24 24 development projects for 2 engineers we work 50 hours a week and get called part timers when we leave at the end of the day because its just so funny   well today i hit my limit when my retard of a boss promised a full development project that usually takes 12 weeks to be done in 1 week which means its all on me he proceeds to leave early after dropping that bomb   so i apologized to my fellow engineer who is also my friend irl and packed my things and walked out   i have a few months salary but last time i was unemployed it took 6 months  i still need to sell my time so i am accepting good luck in my job search until i can leave the rat race   thank you all for reading typing this out helps in a way,mwg528

583,My experience at Walmart,i used to work for walmart as a cart pusher and i wanted to talk about my garbage experience i need some answers to some questions that genuinely confuse me  i started workin at walmart as a cart pusher in november of 2016  i immediately hated the job it was hard i always stunk cause of sweat and you were expected to work in the elements unless its a tornado or flood   i somehow stuck with it for a year and by then i figured out some tips that made the job way easier  we had a cart pushing machine that did a lot of the pushing we just directed them to the left or right  the grocery side was harder and more busy so us cart pushers organized and split the work evenly the hard side had three or two people and the easy side had one or two but dont feel bad for them that side is so easy i offered to take it by myself and have the other 4 people work on the hard side   they were friends and i wanted to be able alone and finish work stress free so it all worked out btw we moved around daily so its fair  ok to the point we got so good with this setup to the point where we were able to get all the carts in 20 minutes or less and then half would be gone by 30 minutes half is not much theyre not enough to jam to cart corrals  we turned a hard shit job that no one wanted and no one could fill for more than a few weeks into a sweet setup  instead of having workers come from inside the store to help us we sometimes went in to help our friends we liked all while doing our jobs to the fullest and more we found enough time to clean and when all that was done we would sit for 10 minutes to 30 behind the carts to relax and get off our feet after that half the carts would be gone wed go get them in 15 minutes or less then rinse and repeat  this worked out for a year until a bitch customer service manager who does nothing but get on her phone and micromanage people got on us   the store manager didnt care at first and pretended to discipline us but soon he started taking her side after she bitched for long enough   she tried to micromanage us she caused a bunch of people to quit and ruined our flow everytime we recovered she did the same thing  my question is why the fuck would you shoot yourself in the foot like that  you couldnt find anyone to fill this position before and now you found some people who can do it and go beyond and find time for themselves and to relax why would you fuck with that you literally lose more money and productivity goes down when you get on us for just relaxing a bit  my jobs duties are cleaning the front of the store area and getting in carts i did more than that why micromanage me when you dont do shit then soon all the managers got on to us for that  y,mwjp57
584,The only time you have power in a job,if you feel like quitting your job youve just achieved the point of power in your job being able to say f you and walk away is exactly what your employer doesnt want they want quiet accepters people who will take any crap that is thrown at them  its easier to be in this position if you have some sense of stability richsupportive family savings new job offer and therein lies one of the secrets of being born to privilege you never have to suffer a crappy job and can always have confidence to complain and make your job better for everyone else we suffer anything until we can get one of the other two sources of financial stability a new job or savings  having the confidence to throw the job away at a whim and be able to tell your superiors about your intention often results in being offered a raise or a better worklife balance or blah blah things they could have given you but didnt until they felt threatened i wonder what solutions there are to achieving this level of confidence when you have no financial stability ive deluded myself to that point in the past and it worked well for me but in the end the job wasnt worth the extra benefits   i went through a phase of a capitalistic mindset doubled my income over 3 years constantly moving from one job to the next but there was no real satisfaction the job was actually mindnumbing and was never given any respect accounting working with idiots who talk down to you all the time is not worth the mediocre salaries you can make in accounting not including executive positions you can potentially achieve in that industry  theres no point to this post other than a rant so cya,mwgldw

594,The real reason why there is a big lack of automation.,you cant exploit a robot  a 24x7 mcdonalds spending 10 an hour on a fry cook would spend over 87000 in one years time and 870000 in ten years time assuming wages did not change  in contrast you can buy a machine that makes pizzas from dough prep and bake for around 50000 a fully automatic pizza machine   so how much would it cost to make a robot that could fry fries probably a little more or less  the point being the cost would be less than a year of paying a worker at mcdonalds the technology to do it has been around over 1015 years too   so why arent these places automating especially when they are having more trouble finding work now than ever before  because automating all these jobs would make a large number of people unemployed and then of course the next logical step would be universal basic income or ubi  the ruling class does not want ubi either   so i dont see fully automated mcdonalds being a thing for quite some time,mwpnl5

601,It's all a lie!,i need to be honest i drank the juice and i paid for it   i was a manager of an average office job i championed the mission of the organization to my team i worked late at night and even early in the mornings i stood up for the nonexistent integrity of the organization to my team members even when the company was clearly in the wrong i did it all and i was fired   i believed the narrative they tell this is a mission that is worth investing in and committing to the problem is that they never invest in you but boy of boy theyll tell you they do   when i first began at the job during the interview i explicit told them that i have high expectations to be trained well except their version of training was sink or swim i quickly sinked and almost 4 or 5 months into me starting my boss took over all of my leadership responsibilities weekly oneonone meetings with team members thats my bosses job now leading larger team gatherings thats my bosses job now quarterly reviews of my team thats my bosses job now the only thing i had to just me was my weekly team meetings and the worse part is this was announced when i was on vacation i took a week off and came back to this new system i was told that i wasnt providing enough direction and they needed someone there to do that was i perfect at my job no did i wish that instead of replacing me they trained me yes did they do that no they blind sighted me and my authority in the company dropped drastically  once covid hit my team began to meet online for our weekly meetings like i said the only part of the job that i kept as the manager was the team meetings my boss who was running the show almost entirely at this point wanted to drop in and listen in on the meeting usually the atmosphere is casual people are relaxed but everything stiffened up during this meeting the next day i was told that i dont have a team anymore i was given a different job that previously wasnt held by a someone with a management title was i perfect at running meetings no but should they have put a deeper look into things than to just drop in on one meeting  all throughout this process i had tried to advocate that i needed more training but nothing changed i kept on being told we dont have the resources to train you right now and my favourite line of all time were in a spot where we can only afford bandaid solutions not longterm solutions i was finally able to convince my boss that i needed training and we got registered into some online program that you can pay for classes on specific areas of growth for managers did we ever use it no did we pay for the subscription for 8 months straight yes  and it actually feels like a betrayal that this whole time no matter how much it felt like they didnt train me no matter how many times they didnt stand up for me i was still advocating for them i was still working the 60 hour weeks i was still giving them the best i had to offer the ceo of the company had only met with me 2 or 3 times up until this point but he was always very supportive at least i thought he was he always said things along the lines of i see a great future for you and you have so much potential and i remember being a lot like you blah blah blah 1 week before he fired me he told me that he sees himself as a mentor in my life thanks mentor  just 2 more facts to help solidify the crap that is this company firstly in 1 years time 11 of the 13 employees in my cluster of departments had quit when i had talked to some of the higher ups about this all they had to say was oh that just happens every 23 years here ummmm why maybe if this wasnt such a crappy place to work that wouldnt happen i tried writing them a letter as to why i think this is the case and how i think we could make changes to fix this no response second of the last 5 people to have my position none of them lasted longer than 1 year 4 were fired and 1 changed jobs when i asked about this i was told i dont want to confuse stories their story is not your story  anyways i was fired the whole time i kept thinking about how i wanted to be remembered and celebrated here but in the end i never was i was let go and no one was told about it until after my last day they told me after a few months theyd reach out and celebrate me then but its been 4 and nothing at all   im pleading with you please dont believe the crap they tell you about growing you you mean nothing to these people they dont care about you and all they want is production you are only a means to an end nothing more     rant is over,mvsicl

623,They want me to risk my hands because I don't hit my production quota,i work as a temp in a shitty factory only reason i stay there for now is the pay 160 dkk or 25 my manager told me yesterday day i need to step up my game and work faster because i am not producing enough so i told him i would try my best and left it at that   today i asked my coworker how he hits the seemingly impossible number of units per hour and he straight up told me he doesnt follow the rules in the factory   for context the machine is a hydraulic press they use to deburr forged steel pipes and you are supposed to put the pipes into the machine with pliers however in order to meet the requirements most workers just put them in with their hands risking them getting crushed   so i guess my choice is getting fired or risking my hands all so they can make a better profit,mw3qqc

640,We are generation fucked.,i try to remain optimistic but its really hard to when the future does not look good  currently a large amount of our political body on both a state and federal level is composed of old boomers who have little to no clue about things like the internet or the state of the economy for people age 35 and under   over 31 of all single family homes are owned by landlords and that number climbs daily because homes bought by landlords rarely get sold to nonlandlord buyers we are seeing an increase in the number of large corporations including blackrock buying up massive amounts of real estate  those wanting to find a starter or fixer upper home are left in the dust because of how popular it is for flipping houses they buy a house for 100k spent 30k on it and somehow can add another 30k in value because of the 30k in improvements so the 100k house becomes a 160k house with only 30k in improvements these flippers often have massive capital and can buy in cash wish is pretty much a death blow to anyone needing to purchase with a mortgage   not only is college expensive as hell with the rates continuing to constantly outpace inflation it is said the total cost of a masters degree including loan interest room and board etc is about 400000  the median wage of a masters holder is 68000 according to the bls and the median of someone who went only to high school is about 38000 a 30000 difference per year  this means it would currently take a little over 13 years to make up the difference of just having went to high school and that is only if you find a job 41 of recent graduates are currently working in a job that does not require a college degree at all youll find them sobbing in the break rooms of mcdonalds and walmart stores nationwide because their high school teachers told them on a daily basis they would be a garbage truck driver the rest of their life unless they went to college i always wonder if high school teachers got some sort of kickback for this propaganda   this means on a 30 year career a masters holder will have earned about 16 million including the education costs while someone who went to high school will have earned about 11 million thats a lot of extra work to not even double your money  dont forget at that salary you will also need to pay for health insurance a lot of high school graduates are on state plans and i didnt factor that in either   regarding earning adjusted for inflation people who have a college degree are earning less than the ones who graduated in 1990   speaking of college it costs next to nothing to attend public school from k12 maybe 100200 per year for registration calculator notebook paper binder supplies etc but somehow people lose their shit when we should be able to go to college for free   in 1990 the price of a new car was about 15k or 30400 today however the average new price of a car is now 40000 i know newer cars have more safety features but i highly doubt they have nearly 10 grand in safety features   in 1990 the median home value was 79100 or 160k today today the median home price is about 230000 a 69000 increase nice  we are truly fucked i dont see this changing soon either we are getting paid less and being charged more and both figures go up housing  education and down wages every year    i didnt even touch on the elephant in the room climate change,mwhv9y

It's just not in the budget :(""",i would rather deliver this criticism directly to leadership at my company but they have made it abundantly clear that they will have none of that so im sharing with you all  earlier this year in february or so the ceo of my company made an announcement to us all that due to financial hardships related to the covid19 pandemic no one would be receiving meritbased raises to be honest i saw it coming it struck me as something every company would do regardless of how much the pandemic really affected them that didnt make the announcement any less disappointing but whatever we moved on  shortly after that announcement the ceo also announced that the company was closing on an acquisition of another company naturally this rubbed people the wrong way a few reached out to leadership and pointed out the suspicious and tonedeaf timing between the company stating we cant afford to give you raises and we just spent who knows how much money to potentially acquire more business  leadership responded but their response was of course lacking someone stated that the company has two budgets one for meritbased pay increases and other incentives and a second for basically everything else that was the best explanation we were given as to why we got nothing and we were discouraged to probe further im sure many others saw as i did that they just found a polite way to say we had the money but didnt think you deserved it  fast forward to this week our supervisors schedule everyone specifically to watch a video the video was of an awards and recognition ceremony  essentially a glorified meeting where some members of the company receive a shoutout from leadership each of these ceremonies has a theme and my supervisor in particular was very giddy to announce that this ceremonys theme would be based on the office she said there would be a special surprise related to the theme  i wish i could say this as a joke folks but i must say i was absolutely surprised to discover that the company paid for brian baumgartner and oscar nunez the actors for kevin and oscar respectively from the office to make a couple of statements specifically for this reward ceremony  as i listened to the actors statements i was filled once again with a deepseated rage towards the financial irresponsibility of our company im sure others were too but leadership must have anticipated such criticism because comments for the video were disabled once again they made it abundantly clear that criticism would not be tolerated  i just cant imagine anyone being happy about this who gives a fuck about a prerecorded statement from two actors our company decided to fork money over to literal multimillionaires instead of giving their workers a goddamn cent and they even did this after fucking their employees over the first time by nabbing a subsidiary instead of rewarding them for the work they did  and the best i can do in terms of rebellion is typing this up while i should be working instead  which i absolutely did im so furious but theres basically nothing i can do but share my frustrations with people on the internet i fucking hate this company,mwd9ld

656,It must be nice ....,let me start  yeah i am white sorry but i didnt get a choice  i grew up poor af  my dad was alcoholic  i had to wear my sisters clothes to school because my dad prioritized drinking over making sure his son wasnt the laughing stock of the school yeah i got beat on  laughed at  but that gave me the strength to want to be something better than my dad no one feels bad for me  they say its my privilege speaking when i say i am offended that people assume i have a decent car because i am white everyone wants to take me down because i had it too easy in life because i am white i am a gen x fintech worker   years ago i worked in a video store  cool job  got to talk to a lot of people and was around movies all the time which certainly beat packing grocery store shelves   packing grocery store shelves is a horrible job it paid 7 bucks an hour i was demeaned by my ahole boss that cared about quotas more than me and i injured my back  i maybe made 2000 the entire time i worked there but at the time it was hard to get a job times are obviously different now and we should be thankful for that   anyway i ended up beating out literally 100 other people to get a job working at the local video store  it also paid 8 bucks an hour  but i wasnt going to injure my back this was the early 90s again  way more willing workers than jobs  at least where i lived   a tow truck driver used to come in when i was working nights and say it must be nice  suggesting that i didnt work as hard as him and that somehow i am less of a person or i am contributing less i learned at that time that  if you look at someone else and say it must be nice  then you should become them  not bitch about them the reality is this douche didnt want my job because he made 5 times as much driving his tow truck   as someone who didnt get any time off during the pandemic i would say to myself it must be nice to be running out of stuff to watch on netflix while i went to soulsucking meetings on zoom at a job i hated but i forget  that i probably got paid more than those people  and i could just quit or get myself fired and id be in their position   my friend runs a small finance company and is loaded  he pays his workers ok but he makes 10 times what they do  must be nice he has a ton of new stuff all the time  takes time off during the day vacations a lot what i didnt see is him doing stuff i would never do risking his house to start a business  suffering for ten years and nearly losing his wife now hes made it but he recently attempted to take his own life because he is so damned miserable while i sit and say it must be nice for him having that sweet new tesla model s i realize that i am an ignorant a for judging him  its not nice  he took a hard path he actually succeeded  and hes still miserable   i fing hate working ceos make way too much money compared to their employess college is way too expensive and locks so many people out of getting ahead i ruined my 20s studying when i could have been drinking and banging for that i make more money but i hate working  it sucks my soul  and i am trapped people look at me and say it must be nice having that sweet house   the truth is though  its all a choice  except for our genetics our parents our school teachers  lal of which we cant choose the rest of that is your choice if you think it would be nice to be a ceo  be one  a stoner  be one if you think you should be able to be a stoner and still have the ceos house  then you are a fool   i realize i am on my way to a million downvotes  my point is that you cant look at other people and assume things are unfair  you dont know sht  it just makes you weak and privileged i want a better way too  i dream for a 4day work week  my life has been ruined by being a corporate slave  but i have been around enough to know that the government isnt going to fix it  nike is not going to fix it  only i can fix it    good luck in this crazy world ,mwdowz
657,Working for the man has been my biggest mistake,its so mentally draining sometimes i wanna go to bed as late as possible because i dont wanna wake up ive been at my current job for over a year in that year ive visited a therapist multiple times because of how exhausted and stressed i am but guess what according to everyone thats how it is out there you will always be stressed no matter the job i guess thats adulthood,mw7oco
658,I'm tired of being expected to solve tasks without resources to actually solve them,i got hired nearly 5 months ago and at this point im really doubting that im even mentally capable to do this job i went to a 4 year school got a computer engineering degree and found my first job from day 1 its been a struggle boss forgot my first day shit wasnt ready had no real plans for me and thats pretty much sums up the majority of my time here during this time i thought things would work out if i just kept my head up and tried to learn as much as possible now i dont even know eveytime i get a new task it feels like the world is falling apart i know how to do a couple things but there is almost always some issue   while it sucks sometimes i have coworkers that i can reach out to for guidance but anytime i have to do anything for my direct boss is sucks literally no guidance hes in meetings 8 hours a day and its really a miserable time today one of the presidents of the company called me because my boss has me running a report for him well he wants changes and hes saying things make no sense but i cant understand why even a little bit i really just want to quit there are some good days but the bad ideas make me feeling like pure shit im probably going to log off today and just go directly to bed i need to find something new but i know most it positions are going to have some amount of stuff like this just makes me feel hopeless,mwahpm

660,Why do people think having a job will improve someone's self esteem??,why do people think having a job will make them feel good about themselves or give them a sense or purpose every job ive ever had has made me feel like complete garbage i havent even had the kinds of jobs that would traditionally be looked down on by people  the dirty jobs the food service jobs whatever it is that assholes think shouldnt pay more than minimum wage but working every day still makes me feel like a loser i make okay money  enough to pay the bills i guess and i have a far more comfortable working situation than most but i know what im spending every day doing is completely useless and that just makes me feel shitty about myself while working i tend to ruminate about all the mistakes and poor decisions ive made that let me to this point right now it doesnt help that no employer has ever appreciated me or given me a bonus or even a good job on anything ive done ive worked in a lot of different places and the message is always the sameyou are nothing and you need to keep your head down do your job and act grateful for it or at least thats what i hear and after hearing it day in and day out for over 20 years ive really internalized it as much as i tried not to i feel worthless and useless and i dont understand how having a job especially a job that doesnt add any value to society makes people feel any other way,mwy3wh

662,HR didn't even sugar-coat why I didn't get an internal job,ive recently applied for an internal position  lateral move but more money at a different less miserable department two rounds of interviews went super well had great feedback i was pretty sure i had it in the bag  i was one of 2 candidates in the running by the end but they chose the other one because they are from within said department my experience and skills didnt mean a thing   hr flat out told me they picked the other candidate because they had connections i didnt  what i dont get is im 100 sure this was decided before they even advertised the job so why take me for a ride  i feel like that clown meme,mwvsa9
663,It's so infuriating when poor people defend the elite class,i have to deal with this mindset in my city since its texas and we have a lot of trumpers still these people who make lower middle wages think theyre so much better than entry level wage earners and they mock people on unemployment not realizing were all in the same boat these arent people making 200k these are just normal blue collar types that are so proud of being exploited and treated like shit by the lord class we will never have progress in this country because of them,mwcrzs
664,Should he work while he's injured?,to give you a bit of a background my husband and i got married three months ago he started working in a rail yard where he drives a truck that moves the boxes he also climbs up on train cars and locks the cars in place even though thats not a part of his job description he is required to work at least 68 hours a week  he is 21 years old and already struggles with his knees he has to wear knee braces everyday and often times i push him to ice his knees after work yesterday he slammed his worst knee into a metal wall and definitely sprained it there is no swelling or bruising but he limps when he walks and is in so much pain that he cant sleep when he bends his knee it makes a scratching noise and you can feel something rubbing on something else   he works 12hour shifts and at the speed that he is bringing in money we could have our student debt a house and savings paid for in less than 4 years the only way we could do this is if he got a promotion in 6 months normally this promotion would take two years to get but theyre really low on people so his manager promised him that he would get it in six months if he never took a day off and worked really hard we are worried that if he takes off a day to care for his leg the manager will go back on his word and he will have to work this strenuous job for even longer   if he continues to work and put so much pressure on his legs the adventures that we are saving up for in the next couple of years hikinh the appalachian trail visiting israel etc he wont even be able to do because of his joints we cant decide if he should take a day off or continue working and hope that his knee heals despite all of the pressure being put on it he talked to a supervisor today and asked that he not be put on the trains today the supervisor agreed not to but as soon as his shift ended the next supervisor forced him to get onto the trains   he is planning on filling out a incident report and asking them about workers comp but since the agreement between the manager and him about the promotion in 6 months wasnt in writing were concerned that hell go back on his word were 21 years old and we dont know what to do or if this is really what the whole workforce is like what do you suggest we do,mvtnio

667,Just wanted to sleep an extra hour,so i got my 2nd vaccine on wednesday i felt like garbage yesterday and i did mention it to my bossthe owner its a very small business winery he said oh yeah my wife has been in bed all day like must be nice as i stand around an empty tasting room miserable while he watches old westerns in the office so i still feel awful this morning and texted asking if i could come in at 1030 instead of 9 to get some extra sleep we open at 11 and it only takes me like 15 minutes to open but he absolutely wont let me be here less than 40 hours a week so i basically do nothing for hours every morning but i digress as expected he just never responds if i ever need anything from him he just never responds to the texts funny cuz he always has his iphone and expects me to respond instantly and if its a positive thing i send him he responds right away  anyway so im here angry and sick and at 1030 hes just like im taking the day off again to go golfing i may make it back before close but probably not he knew he was going to take another day off to golf this is weekly at least leave me alone on a weekend so i guess no eating or restroom breaks for me and he couldnt even give me the extra time this morning to sleep fuck this asshole,mwxfhf

670,This system genuinely makes me depressed and feeling suicidal.,hi yall  ive been part of the community for a while mostly just as a lurker and relating to you all right now im in a tough place and just wanted to talk about it since i know you all can relate  let me start by saying this system is bullshit  i am currently in usa in my early 30s and work 2 jobs one is full time and the other is part time the full time job is a set 40 hour week monday to friday job it provides me with my health insurance which is a requirement since i was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2019 i have no visible symptoms but i have cognitive fog which especially gets bad under stress and depression so i apologize for any grammatical errors and such moving forward its been really hard to focus and think clearly lately  despite having health insurance i still have to pay hundreds of dollars for mris and i got my last bill for my infusion my drug modifying therapy which is supposed to prevent new lesions from forming on my brain and spinal cord which was about 1000 dollars the full price 100000 dollars my mouth dropped when i saw that price i was appalled and mostly disgusted at our pharmaceutical industry for how they take advantage of people who just dont want to get sicker i now fear not being without health insurance and employer provided insurance is my best option the marketplace plans are hundreds a dollars a month with high deductibles that wouldnt even cover me until after 1000 of my own money  i got diagnosed with ms in grad school actually studying for the career i currently have by the time i graduated i was working 60 hour weeks between my full time job and doing an unpaid internship a lot of my classmates were surprised i was doing this but i didnt have a choice i needed to pay rent bills and desired health insurance which then i was diagnosed with ms so then became needed i tried to ask my job at the start of my fieldwork to lower my hours from 40 to 30 still full time so i could still have benefits but they didnt budge they couldnt work around it they said my company even had a internship program for the exact field i was studying for but company policy stated you couldnt work for them and be in the program which made no sense since i already was familiar with everything and the particular clientele hence i struggled to find a fieldwork site initially because places wanted hours while i worked most of peers who were either young 20s and so still on their parents health insurance and financially supported by them or older by supported by a spouse were either working part time jobs or not at all and so could focus 100 on school and dedicate time to fieldwork at places of their choosing  you know i got advice to just take out more loans and leave my job how does that make sense  while there is not hard set proof there are links between stress and autoimmune disorders so i keep wondering if the stress i was going through at the time didnt trigger it i blame myself even though i tried what i could to resolve the situation i even tried looking for different jobs but they usually paid less and i couldnt afford the pay hit  after my diagnosis i sat with my supervisors at my job at the time and i told them that there may be times i have to leave mid work for an appointment for anyone who has had to schedule with a specialist before you understand theyre booked months in advance i tried to be helpful and schedule my appointments around work hours or if necessary at the end or beginning of my shifts but if my neurologist was only available at a 12 oclock this particular day for the next 3 months well i needed to go  one of my bosses looked me in the eyes and said customer care comes first this company pays for your insurance  you can imagine my reaction i was fighting back tears at that point i cried later on and thats when i realized all the times i had busted my ass for that program and company meant nothing prior till then i was under the illusion that they cant risk to lose me i work too hard ive held this program down it wouldnt exist without me when i started working in that program there was 3 of us working it one was let go and the other was frequently gone as she was older and dealing with her own abundance of health issues many times i was the only one working that program due to her frequent call outs doctors appointments and medical procedures i held it down even when i was told they wouldnt hire a temp worker to help me while my coworker was on leave for 3 months due to fmla i did it  then boom this diagnosis happened you never think itll happen to you until it does one day i was at work super stressed and the next day i wake up and cant see out of one eye optic neuritis which is usually the onset of ms my vision was fixed with steroids thankfully   since then i havent trust a company to take care of me to genuinely care about me i did go to hr with what my boss said and they sided with them because they did apologize to me in an email sent after i was off the clock hr also put words in my mouth and i realized hr wasnt meant to protect me either they were meant to protect the company the upper managment me they could give less a fuck about me  so i ended up moving to a state with lower cost of living after graduate school because loans amirite   i live in a questionable area of my city and while i can afford the rent and bills on my salary this apartment is terrible walls are paper thin you hear sex people yelling at children dogs barking even just heavy walking ive been woken up several times because of it my packages have been stolen from the front of my door and now i stop ordering things   as i mentioned before i work 2 jobs my current job pays me less with a masters requirement then my previous one which was only bachelors level though the cost of living was higher where i held my previous job so that might have been why but to offset that i got a part time job  i want to move into a nice apartment start building up my savings again spend money for fun without feeling guilty i was expecting to make 50k with a masters and that seems like a joke  but my my part job is more flexible i can do my schedule however i want take leave whenever i want i enjoy it only cons are is that its not hourly its by client interaction so if a client doesnt show up to their meeting i make less if anything at all than if they do show up so income isnt stable also their healthcare plan is terrible their best plan has a 2000 deductible and eligibility for benefits doesnt start until you meet so many client hours in a 3 months period if you fail to meet those requirements during a quarter youre at risk of losing your insurance so thats why im hesitant to make that job a full time one  but my mental health has spiraled badly since the end of last year with my full time job when i started with this particular company last year i signed up for a position that while wasnt 100 what i was looking for id be working with customers that i preferred so i jumped on plus i was grateful just to find a job during a pandemic but when i started i quickly realized i wasnt going to be doing what i signed up for at all in fact they had me working a lot in a different program with a different client population and not doing at all what i expected i began to dread clocking in every time my phone went off my anxiety spiked also my shift was less than ideal and i had no set break so sometimes i just went an entire shift without eating or taking a break in general  i wanted to get out and get closer to what i wanted to do and so when the opportunity arose i applied for a different internal position and switched  and since then my health has continued to plummet   i was poorly trained and now receive upwards to 10 emails daily of my fuckups asking why i did this or that and asking me to redo documents and reports i literally have closed outlook on my work laptop because just hearing or seeing the notification of a new email gives me an anxiety reaction one of the work things is the productivity the numbers game i have to have so many meetings a week to meet productivity but some things are out of my control sometimes customers dont answer the phone sometimes they dont want to talk to me i keep getting told im not meeting productivity my supervisor asks me why are my meetings so short the amount of time she asks for keeps getting longer and longer like the emails  oh the emails  shell state sharply in an email something i did wrong or ask why i did something and throw out well talk about in supervision then we never have it or its like 2 minutes literally this week she went on my calendar and scheduled over it  and since my ms diagnosis my memory sucks now i cant keep track of stuff she needs to talk to me about and i feel like i shouldnt have to i mean if you want to talk to me about something make a note and actually have supervision with me  i can no longer keep up with the emails or the reports im literally up all night working averaging 2 hours of sleep a night part of it is due to my concentration its really hard to focus and the stress and depression ive been feeling has only had it worse ill start a report lose focus for like 10 minutes and repeat this cycle i frustrate myself for long long it takes things to get done i used to be able to multitask but i dont think i can anymore and the amount of stuff my supervisor puts on me without explanation or support is driving me insane shes even began to say we have to modify our personal time for work if it comes down to it which i am not okay with i have my schedule and i wont budge it  im starting to cry before clocking into work now when its sunday i start to shut down emotionally and mentally i lack sleep whether its because im working or due to anxiety about work passive suicidal ideation which was gone is now creeping back depression that was gone is now back in full force and has sucker punched me in the face and as of recently my full time job is affecting my part time job i am getting behind on reports there because im so busy doing shit for my full time job or i happen to pass out due to sleep exhaustion or crying whatever it may be  i havent told my current company about my ms diagnosis because honestly i felt like it wasnt their business after how the last company treated me i dont trust to be protected and because i havent been with them a full year i cant apply for fmla yet which the fact that it has to be a year is bullshit  up until the current job things were fine so i really think the stress and my mood has impacted my cognitive fog to where it impacts my work everyday i fear new lesions possibly forming or having another flare up due to the stress i know itll only get worse if i stay  ive tried doing this the safe way ive applied to other jobs and have all the education and experience theyre asking for but ive been facing rejections  i think to myself fuck man if only i was married to a spouse who could financially support me for the time being and give me their health insurance id be out like yesterday   my other option is just make the job and make my part time job my full time job i enjoy it more there are no productivity standards its actually the type of work i want to do and the flexibility is amazing i can probably set my schedule to have a 3 day weekend which i do miss having also depending on how many customers i see i could make more at that job than what i currently do now  seems like a no brainer right but im scared of that unstable income since its not hourly and am stuck on that health insurance id have to get a marketplace plan and i checked today and the best one still with the same company because i dont want to switch doctors was like 330 dollars with a tax credit   but this system sucks  you do the work get higher education because its what to youre told to do in my case i had to to do what i wanted to do  and then when you have a chronic illness its a whole other ball game because you need health insurance for your medicine or treatment but may be locked into a terrible company because the usa thinks socialized healthcare is fucking evil for whatever reason   so you continue to work while your condition gets worse in the case with autoimmune disorders stress can make it worse so you only get worse and yet you cant quit because the anxiety of medical debt paralyzes you  i believe the system triggered my ms and its just making it worse   i dont want to work myself into a wheelchair,mvts4m

682,The Most Damning Evidence Against Work Culture,i think the best proof we have that work culture is toxic is old people who work dont get me wrong this isnt to say old people shouldnt be working god knows nobody should be working really but why do older people work past retirement   ive seen so many tragic posts in this thread about loved ones and others making it to retirement age only to spend a month or two really enjoying their ultimate reward after a life of servitude because of an untimely death or being stricken with an illness   there is also a huge amount of people who are forcibly retired after suffering from a mental illness like dimentia or alzheimers if we find this to be the case more often than not why would so many people choose to work after they have reached their supposed golden years   unfortunately the answers to this question are all too common and continously coincide with a great deal of what we deal with when we are forcibly thrusted into this evil contract these people are either still trying to make money to live because of a failed social security system they are trying to give themselves a sense of purpose because they never had time to find out who they were when they were being overworked or they have been tricked into thinking that they must contribute to society in some way to earn their right to be here the fact that most  of the elderly go through this is sick and infuriating   this is all the proof needed to understand why  especially in america this whole job thing is broken and a scam that needs to be reimagined and restructured  i just needed to scream into the pillow that is reddit,mvornn

692,Prolonging the inevitable (my life story),this is gonna sound crazy but i wanted to fail my senior year of high school why you might ask   i transferred from another school my junior year and no one in my classes would talk to me so i made friends younger than me during lunch who were in a similar situation being freshmen and all naturally i was their leader which was a power trip in and of itself we would cut classes and hangout near the campus and at kids homes when the parents were at work fast forward to senior year and not much changed except i fell in love with a girl a grade lower at this point a couple months away from graduation im almost certain im not gonna graduate since i failed every junior class i was oddly ok with that   the school is located in a somewhat impoverished suburb it was not unusual for kids to have failed a grade previously and so there was a lot of 19 year old seniors i was willing to purposely fail my senior year to stick around with my tightknit group of friends and to have a chance at my first relationship with the girl i had fallen in love with but on the literal last week of school they sat me down at a computer lab and force fed me the answers to tests in a credit recovery program and pretty much made me to graduate their reasoning was that i was literate and had scored highly on the state exams they looked me in the eye and said in so many words we know youre playing dumb i was bewildered because i had spent the whole certain that i was gonna fail and repeat i walked out the door on the last day of school knowing i was now an adult who had to start doing something   i ended up doing nothing for 6 months still in shock i finally enrolled in the spring semester at my community college but i must admit i would frequent my high school campus to hangout with my friends when my classes were over it was different because i had a car and we would drive around the city doing dumb stuff we did this the next year too until i dropped out of community college to join the army i had four months to prepare so i planned on just spending it messing around with my friends who were still in school we had fun all the way till spring break when covid hit my basic training got delayed 2 weeks and we renegotiated my contract till july before i ultimately decided not to go under the circumstances of a pandemic   ive been working almost a year for the first time in my life i just got in to student housing at the four year university when i look back at the last three years i can now see that all my fears were true becoming an adult truly does suck the expectations are for you to work 4749 years till retirement except even then theres still a bunch of coworkers ive had in their 70s claiming they cant afford to retire i tell you i used to feel ashamed of thinking like peter pan but now i see it as the only rational response when faced with corporate serfdom i now plan on staying in college for as long as possible as well this time no one can force me to graduate and i get to prolong the inevitable entering of the workforce to many this may seem very immature but i would posit that getting a good paying job along with higher tax burdens and financial responsibilities is consumerist and that consumerism is much more childish than delaying adulthood   i dont want to drive a mercedesbenz if it means i have to sacrifice my free time i dont want to live in a safer neighborhood if it means i have to work more hell i dont think i even want to have children im so disillusioned that my personal strategy is to just lay low and frankly underachieve the capitalists will say that im lazy but i see it as a defensive mechanism much in the same manner as how poor apartment residents leave trash outside to keep rent prices low as a means of self survival   for now i will keep selling my plasma to the vampires to afford food and i will pay rent by working 20 hours a week around my own apartment complex ill take one or two classes per semester and ill keep hanging out with my friends who face the same problems,muwtlm

The past few weeks I've been frantically researching extra hard, and I truly believe that it takes a 1 in a million stroke of luck to be self-employed.",i dont even need to make a lot of money id be happy to make even less than i would wageslaving just to have my own little business  but its just not as possible as people make it seem   ive been reading books scouring the internet browsing every community related to business and entrepreneurship its mostly just smoke and mirrors very real substance even when it comes to books written by respected people who really are rich theres just nothing there thats real advice applicable to normal people  but theres a lot of options people could point to to make you look lazy like go be a plumber or an electrician yeah go and wreck your body luckily im not healthy enough to even consider those options those would turn your body into a mess in just a few years  of course a lot of people are desperate to find their own niche so theres a lot of advice out there and theres good advice too but its just so  tonedeaf find a burning needproblem people have and provide solutions yeah that obviously makes sense thats the basis of business pal but when you ask how exactly would you do that the answers are lacking and even if you can do that guess what any need that a small business could fulfill was already fulfilled anything left simply isnt possible for small businesses it takes the efforts and capital of enormous corporations   so the options that are really left are more like  gambling things that are one in a million same as hoping that you strike gold with a business idea like writing a novel that becomes popular a youtube channel that becomes popular streaming drawing etc things millions of people do for years without getting more than 2 viewers and yet everybody thinks theyll make it they point to the ones that did make it as examples that these are indeed options   or alternatively theyll tell you to invest or crypto daytrading etc ideas not really worth discussing or learn to code i could make a whole other post about this but its just such stupid advice theres so many people who actually studied this for years got degrees and cant find jobs and yet just go learn coding bro thatll work out  its all so exhausting i spent so much time researching to find just something anything at all and yet im left even more pessimistic than before nothing left to do but resign myself to my fate of wageslavery and try to become numb wish i at least had the option to save up and retire early but not in this god forsaken country with its piss low wages,mun56f

737,Feeling like a rant about a past job,pretty sure my covid is transitioning in pneumonia and im in a fairly shitty mood mostly because i cant stop coughing and its giving me a pounding headache so to occupy myself i wanted to give my thoughts on a job that just totally shat on me a few years ago i will be using genderneutral pronouns and keeping it as vague as possible because who the fuck knows who lurks this sub so sorry for any confusion  ampx200b  so this was in 2018 i applied through a temp agency and got placed in a warehouse pickpack position normally i am completely averse to warehouse work but this was a very small setting and is owned by the family of an extremely famous musician who youve heard of the direct supervisor and supervisor of the warehouse were both great to work for i started as a packer then they transitioned me to being a picker where i excelled to the point that eventually i was doing pretty much anything they needed me to do i didnt mind because again i liked working for the people it wasnt a hard job and it was mondayfriday with no mandatory overtime for a warehouse that is fucking unheard of the commute was only about 20 minutes as well which was nice  anyway for about three months i was probably the most trusted employee there as far as the regular employees went there were a lot of shitty workers and by that i mean workers who would come in talk and fuck around on their phones then get mad when they were reprimanded for it and start talking shit about the bosses one of the people who worked there was a close friend of the boss and we became really good friends as well a lot of these people would talk shit about this person too or even straight up bully them to their face which pissed me off i ended up basically becoming the warehouse supervisors eyes and ears they wanted me to report shit like that because it creates a toxic workplace and they didnt want people like that working there i agreed with it and was totally fine with doing it i respected the supervisor the person they were friends with was my friend now too and i cant fucking stand being around workplace bullies either  about five months in shit completely changed and i still to this day have no idea what it was the direct supervisor started coldshouldering me the warehouse supervisor was suddenly distant as hell that probably sounds weird but before this they would often come into the break lounge on my lunch breaks and wed shoot the shit for a while im an aspiring novelist and id usually bring in my laptop to work on my writing it turned out they used to live right down the road from one of my favorite authors again youve heard of this person and the supervisor showed me the pictures of their house they had on their phone theyd ask me about shit out of work ask how my novel was coming what it was about etc same thing with my direct supervisor just not as often because they werent as available for obvious reasons  shit kept getting worse to the point where if i made one little mistake it was the end of the fucking world i was reported for giving pushback to my supervisor no idea what the fuck they were on about because i never did anything but what they asked me to the best of my ability at one point the supervisor just straight blew up on me because i mistakenly grabbed a box of product from one of the trucks that we didnt need yet there was an unopened box on the floor on a fucking shelf behind another box that i guess i was just supposed to magically know about this was on friday at the end of the shift they sort of apologized and we seemed cool again and the warehouse supervisor came out to talk to me about random shit again near the end of the day i figured maybe theyd just been having bad days or something  went home that day two hours later got an email telling me not to come back monday no explanation or anything just do not return to work on monday with the subject line assignment ended still to this day dont know what the fuck i did that was the last time i ever put serious effort into a job i did a shitload of extra work for these people because i actually respected them there was one day i skipped my lunch break because a bunch of people called out and the supervisors needed help with a specific project i volunteered for it just because i wanted to help out my thanks was being shitcanned without any notice whatsoever  ampx200b  the moral of this long tale is never fucking go above and beyond for these shit jobs because you can literally break your back for these people and theyll just use that as an excuse to fire you never bother with a two week notice because they will let you go at the end of your shift without an explanation or anything resembling advance notice i guarantee you they had decided to fire me but waited until the end of my shift so they could get one more day of labor out of me  never do above the bare minimum for these people especially without being told never they do not give a fuck about you to them you are human labor human capital you are sentient time anything but human basically  rant,mvg1ud

743,"The ""Do what you love"" tax is really depressing",my paycheck just came in and after my 177 car payment my parents recommended that i get a car with this type of payment because my two previous cars were total lemons i have 100 left over for the next two weeks  im not even talking like 100 of fun money im talking 100 of regular money just to not starve i pay 50 a week in groceries so im now in the red im going to have to beg my parents to help me with rent again  the sad part is that i work two jobs one of which was supposed to be full time keyword supposed to be my main gig is as a field service computer technician i work for a company that works nationwide and in fact im the only tech in my city i live in a hippie mountain town about 2 hours away from the nearest big city ive never even met my supervisor in person my job is just me and the clients i just show up install the part and leave and for the most part its awesome the pay even ranges from meh to pretty good  the thing is though the company didnt do any field research before they hired me so i was effectively lied to in the interview in the interview they said that i would be getting between 3 and 8 calls per day and that it roughly equals a full time position for reference after working here 3 calls is about a 45 hour day and 8 calls is probably a 10 hour day but since like i said nobody else from the company actually lives here i dont get the advertised number of calls the most ive ever seen is 4 most days range from 13 and obviously im paid per call so if im not fixing a machine im not getting paid  the other thing i do is teach violin its great i love going into work the pay is good the time flies by i feel like im helping people and i feel confident and professional at what i do but again the caveat is that i only get paid when i am teaching a student so between two days of teaching im working for under 8 hours  once everything is added up my hours come out to part time at best and literally nothing at worse but at the same time i work just enough teaching violin to make getting a full time it job probably not an option and teaching violin is what ive always wanted to do anyway  i had a nice little path laid out last year when i got a job doing help desk at a major company the schedule was great the pay was okay there was the possibility for upward mobility healthcare 401k matching whatever that means all the good stuff but the environment just totally destroyed me i was considering drastic things just two weeks into the job so i quit  it just makes me feel even worse because i have all these eyes on my paycheck im constantly begging for money from my mom so she knows that im making very little and i live with my girlfriend so obviously she expects to be paid on time for rent and groceries and stuff and she knows that ive quit more secure jobs to do what i have now and i just feel like i dont have much time left before she starts seriously questioning my choices  its frustrating because i love what i do i would totally do it for 10 hour days it wouldnt bother me theres just not enough work to make that happen,musm01
744,How do you protect your energy in a toxic and drama-filled workplace (that you can't leave)?,i work in mental health which means im often surrounded by clients with negative emotions and im there to bring some positivity into their lives and help them through their issues as best i can but my coworkers are often talking about other coworkers behind each others backs and theres a big lack of communication that often results in bigger problems and dramas this has been going on since the beginning of the year when we became so understaffed and management couldnt sort their shit and the employees are all trying to figure out what to do on their own without any direction from management which just creates more drama and negativity  i struggle with protecting my energy often when someone near me is in a bad mood that is irrelevant to me i will adopt a bad mood as well then when theyre upset about something that is relevant to me i also adopt a bad mood instead of trying to sort through it in a problemsolving approach or even just laughing it off and not taking it so seriously like with the drama and gossiping stuff it makes going to work and also not taking it home with me difficult but i cant quit right now and so i have to find a way to protect my energy and not succumb to the negativity constantly surrounding me at work  how do you guys do it i have tried brushing it off and using logic even to understand why i shouldnt let it get to me but i still fall into the trap of sensitivity and i am in need of advice on what to do,mv3x8q

775,"I had a vision of the future, it was not pleasant.",i fell asleep last night and woke up in the year 2051 just a mere 30 years   but in those 30 years hell became real   i did not wake up in my body but rather having  simultaneous view of the entire united states its people their homes their places of work etc i could hear every voice of every person speaking and yet understand every word   the workplace was in a word decimated nearly 35 to 40 percent of all jobs were replaced by automation stores such as walmart and target retrofitted their stores for automated stocking and inventory equipment cart returns food disposal even asset protection was automated   an observer or basically an inspector but not a manager or paid well watched over the store daily for any malfunctions in equipment or other problems the latest version of automation could even repair other machines a nonworking part could be installed by another machine the parts would arrive on a normal shipment of goods the trucks were self driving and could reverse to loading doors by themselves and were unloaded by automated equipment   the only thing that would prompt human intervention would be damage to the units such as a heavy item falling onto it or a software issue causing it to shut down before hitting product or another shopper   every restaurant and fast food establishment was automated except for a few that catered to the real human experience of cooking food this was initially sold as being cheaper for the consumer and it was for a few years as humanheld jobs were gotten rid of but then prices became that of human work levels solely to enrich the executives and owners   uber and other rideshare services were all automated janitorial services were automated teaching except that for anything requiring great skill or hands on experience became automated bank tellers shelf stockers fry cooks floor sweepers hotel workers front desk workers receptionists etc all became automated a lot of surgical procedures became automated automated home construction was in its testing phase   of course universal basic income did not arrive either unemployment was the highest it had ever been amazon penned many contracts to built automated equipment and once the processes became more efficient the people who made the machines were replaced with machines themselves almost all of amazons operations were now automated jeff bezos now 87 years old became the worlds first trillionaire in 2028   home ownership became almost completely eliminated reserved for the rich few as baby boomers died off some 40 million of them homes were quickly bought up by massive and often national property management firms they owned the apartments the duplexes the town homes and the single family homes as well as many businesses they often paid above market rates to snatch them away from prospective home buyers and paid in cash to entice sellers to sell and not have to go through the conventional sale process that took much longer homes were often sold in as little as 2 days   the rate of home ownership was under 15 as many as 8 to 10 people lived in a single 2 bedroom home privacy no longer existed it was sold to people as a cheaper way of living as the 11000 average monthly rent for a 2 bedroom home could be split between as many as 10 people   entire cities had their homes and apartments owned by the same firm amazon was a large player in the rental market making bezos a quadrillionaire sometime around 2045 rent increases could not be opposed and renters had no choice but to accept substandard apartments as every home and apartment and town was owned by the same company   most of those who still had jobs went to college college was insanely expensive and paid for by a lifetime garnishment of your wages that was tied into social security deductions it was called the cwga or college wage garnishment act   this was not the same as tuition free college because the cost was astronomical and paid for by paycheck deduction and not taxes even if you did not graduate or land a job requiring the use of a college degree your paychecks were still deducted for the rest of your life even death would not satisfy this if you died before the set amount of tuition was paid in full it was taken out of your childrens inheritance if you died penniless the garnishment would be tacked onto their garnishment as well ensuring a lifetime of what would be similar to indentured servitude   rent was also a part of garnishment ensuring these massive and often nationwide property management firms never had late or deadbeat renters if you did not have a job for whatever reason it would be racked up as a debt and then added to future wage garnishment while this might sound nice in practice and you might think it solved homelessness you were wrong as people who did not find work after one year were sent to the camp  the camps were these large military style barracks were setup on large areas of land in the country and each state had multiple zones of these camps   the camps were officially called the unemployed disabled and disobedient worker housing projects  no one could protest what little employment there was for starters with unemployment being extremely high companies had the pick of the litter and if you disrupted the workplace in any way such as striking protesting or attempting to unionize you were barred from employment for a period of one year and sent to the camp   those who racked up a year of rent would work a year in the camp doing hard and manual labor to pay back half of the back rent once you were released the other half was added to future garnishments if you did this a total of 5 times you were assigned to the camp forever   those sent for being disobedient worked a year for no wages  those with mental and physical disabilities were lifetime residents of these camps   now you might think what if someone doesnt find work for five years welp too bad this was done on purpose to pad unemployment numbers initially and then to make private home ownership harder and then impossible you are also probably thinking this made a lot of single mothers and fathers and you would be right the goal was to eradicate private home ownership and to take care of the vast amount of idlers created by skyrocketing unemployment   the camps had little to no privacy terrible food and less than ideal living conditions they cost the government little to nothing as they were built out of high strength cement and rebar and would last over 200 years automated equipment handled many tasks so once the equipment was purchased there was no wage to pay or benefits either those who did have to work in manual labor were mainly back renters   you might think this would never happen bet less than 60 years ago we had segregation of blacks and whites less than 80 years ago we found it acceptable to turn over 120000 japanese citizens into ash and charred remains  less than 160 years ago we owned slaves   we were given many many many chances to revolutionize protest unionize etc in those 30 years but we became to docile and placated and this is what we ended up with   you think its bad now just wait,muz4e9

777,The old-school mentality of management is why we'll learn nothing from this pandemic.,one of my colleagues is off for his paternity leave due to the pandemic his leave will sort of be extended as required when you or someone close to you stays in a hospital when the cause for your stay is noncovid related  during one of the regular watercooler discussions one of the project managers  mid60s complained that when his daughter was born his boss expected him to be back on the job the day after her birth but he didnt complain that he received such short paternity leave he complained that my coworker receives such long leave  and then he regaled us with something an old boss told him years ago you know you made it as a boss if you workers think of you first thing in the morning even before they think of their wives  and this is the mentality keeping us on a 9 to 5 5 day work week for a minimum of 40 years of your life these people believe if you dont suffer the same shit they suffered during their earlier years you dont deserve to complain about anything ,mv8uzk

785,Conflict Theory,conflict theory   conflict theorists focus on how advantaged and disadvantaged groups are bolstered or broken by the competition for necessary resources these theorists seek to understand howwhy some groups of society have attained the power to facilitate resources to other groups of society that they have deemed inferior    the conflict perspective seems to especially resonate with my view of the world it encourages you to take a closer look at the tremendous gap among different classesraces and their accessibility to material wealth quality education clean water affordable health care equal and fair treatment by police and wellpaying jobs these issues are at the forefront of society today in 2021 and the consequences of these issues really seem to have adverse effects on people of color of poverty and those with disabilities this disparity amongst different classesraces is in direct correlation to rich white men camouflaging the real motives of their greed   a few questions i have asked myself over the years are why do most of my friends and family live paycheck to paycheck why do most of the black people in my community live below the hill in a 20 block span away from the interstates and downtown why is that in the nicer areas of my city there are whole foods movie theatres and pharmacies yet in the lower income areas there are save a lots pay day loan services and abandoned buildings   a conflict theorist would approach these questions with the notion that these groups of peoples foundations and futures have been undermined by the insatiable desire for power and wealth that the people already in power possess they would focus on the idea that a position of power usually comes with a desire to protect that position of power and that those higher up on the social hierarchy would damage the prospects of a better future for the disadvantaged even further if given the opportunity to advance their own,muvqa2

834,6 weeks of work a year?,the american writer from the 1800s henry david thoreau reportedly worked only 6 weeks a year he would take odd jobs here and there to cover his necessary  expenses and beyond that he would take care of his garden during growing seasons the rest of his time he spent studying life  reading writing observing nature and people in civilized towns      when i think of what the goal of antiwork should be for me this is it owning a cabin where i work minimally to cover my basic needs then doing real meaningful work like taking care of a garden taking care of a garden is meaningful work because you own it and it too is necessary for your survival,mu3mfd
835,When you can't run away,some people say that if you hate your job you should just quit it but for many people that just isnt possible if id choose permanent unemployment id so poor that the quality of my life would drop poverty isnt a funny thing it isnt just about getting by with less or buying cheaper products its about living in too small apartment not being able to travel anywhere not being able to socialize since that often happens in restaurantsbars wearing only wornout clothes not having money for entertainment you can only live in most unpleasant parts of town your neighbors can often be junkies or lowlevel criminals   i hate it when poverty is romanticized and i hate it when people often those who are wealthy tell us that we can just quit our jobs and live the dream the media and culture feeds us the same bullshit if you just follow your dreams and do what you want you can get it that is a lie and its promoted because it makes people feel less oppressed and it makes us believe in more in current system because it claims that in it you can actually make your dreams come true   im disgusted because soon im being forced to take almost any job with any pay i have a university degree but i still end up being a warehouse worker cleaner or shop assistant i cant run away i cant choose what i do with my life the modern society is a prison and that is the case in almost anywhere only small minority has any chances of doing what they actually want to do rest of us are just doomed to waste our lives in deadend jobs or end up poor and hopeless and there is nothing we can do about it   the best you can get is a job that is not extremely uncomfortable if you are lucky youll work with other decent people who probably also hate what theyre doing but freedom is not something that is meant for average citizen in any country,mtbu8p

847,Getting real tired of the corporate nonsense,i feel like i post here all too often but find it to be strangely therapeutic i work for a very large healthcare system worth billions of dollars in my area there are a number of similarly sized organizations that are highly competitive but the organization i work for is notoriously cheap because us healthcare is more of a business rather than a service we push our providers and offices to work through all conditions and expect us to be grateful for getting paid this has meant cutting staff to skeleton crews to pad our bottom line and getting mad at not being able to retain staff now we find ourselves in a worst case scenario where we are forced to adjust office hours because we dont have anyone to run the front desks or screen patients then senior management gets more mad because we arent producing enough   one measure to combat this is most organizations raised their minimum wage to 15 which made a big difference but after my organization evaluated the market they determined it wasnt worth it and adjusted pay scales in a manner that made it look like a raise for a few but didnt affect 90 of the workers   so what are we to do now well we decided to pay a contracting agency to supply us with staff and we are paying them a more significant hourly over 15hr which is still not that great but comparatively so now the minimal staff we could get are costing us so much we need to work everyone even harder to overcome the cost of course there is a savings in benefits i guess but i find the whole thing is gross  not to worry though all senior leadership received most of if not all of their annual bonuses while our frontline managers didnt receive a bonus because they didnt hit their financial goals because you know covid   i took a position in leadership with the hopes that i could make a difference but i find myself disappointed in myself for the lies i have to keep just feel foolish and a failure now i find myself job hunting again after only 6 mos and hopefully away from healthcare if i can help it,mto7zo

850,The Recent Surge of Anti Stimulus Propaganda Was Predicted By A 1940s Economics Paper Which Provides A Blueprint To The Likely Reaction Of Capitalists To A UBI Measure.,i keep seeing anti stimulus propaganda being perpetuated in the press several articles of which have been shared here and rightly shit on for the propaganda that they are this insider articlehttpswwwbusinessinsidercommcdonaldssubwaystruggletofindworkersforcingchanges20214 is fairly indicative of what im going to discuss namely that small time capitalists are railing against stimulus measures causing a labor shortage and an increase in the price of labor even though the investment banking analyst lol at the dead eyed ib analyst coming off as the sane one noted that the industry has struggled for years for employees these little barons whining about the stimulus becomes even more strange of a complaint when you think about how the stimulus checks increased restaurant demandhttpswwwrestaurantbusinessonlinecomfinancingrestaurantsalescontinuesurge why are they railing against something that helped increase demand and kept their restaurants open   it turns out this was explained by a little known economist at least in the states michal kaleckihttpsenwikipediaorgwikimichac582kalecki the paper came out in 1943 and is titled political aspects of full employmenthttpgesdfreefrkalecki43pdf despite the name it is relevant to discussions of a ubi and in my opinion that is the quickest way to less work at least in the states as the paper is more about the apparent paradox of the capitalist being against government spending despite the increase in demand from that spending ending up in their pockets you could consider full employment policies as anything that subsidizes consumption and increases worker power this obviously includes a ubi  kalecki outlines three reasons why business leaders would be against full employment i dislike of government interference in the problem of employment ii dislike of the direction of government spending public investment and subsiding consumption iii dislike of the social and political changes resulting from the maintenance of full employment i will summarize each of these points below though the paper itself is very short and not very technical  i letting the government spend money to keep up demand eliminates the undue influence capital can impose on the political process by unlinking employment from how capitalists feel about the future of the market as kalecki puts it  the current system gives the capitalist a powerful indirect control over government policy everything which may shake the state of confidence must be carefully avoided because it would cause an economic crisis  ii capitalists do not want the government to spend on public infrastructure as it may pave the way for nationalization however they are even more opposed to subsidizing mass consumption a ubi because as he puts it a ubi would put at stake a moral issue of the highest importance to the capitalist that one must earn your bread in sweat  unless you happen to have private means basically why would you work for mcdonalds if the alternative was anything less than starvation now were getting closer to direct parallels to present day  iii this argument is more about how even if these objections by the capitalists are temporarily overcome such as our boost in unemployment spending and our stimulus checks the capitalists will if anything oppose the measures harder kalecki sums it up nicely indeed under a regime of permanent full employment the sack would cease to play its role as a disciplinary measure the social position of the boss would be undermined and the selfassurance and classconsciousness of the working class would grow this is why these little capitalists are all reacting in the same way today theyre seeing how people respond when termination of employment is not a recipe for destitution and they do not like what they see one bit  point iii i think nicely summarizes why you will continue to see these articles about the problems caused by government assistance and spending its upending the social order on which we are dependent on our bosses for survival and even though this would likely increase their profits they are willing to take a loss on their overall profitability to see you under their bootheel if we ever get a ubi these articles will continue at a feverish pitch and we will have to be constantly on guard for capitalists acting to increase their power even at the expense of profits  if youve read this far thanks i hope the information is useful even if you think the paper is just pointing out the obvious i find the more thorough rigor applied to it than my thought processes alone a great help i have always found it a good framework to use when discussing the power of a ubi with skeptics from all walks of life but especially fellow workers   tldr discipline in the factories and political stability no demands by workers for something better are more appreciated than profits by business leaders and that is why they oppose even the smallest of reforms even when it helps them increase their profits they will fight us every step of the way as we search for a better world and even in a better world we will need to reform our institutions to keep our gains good luck out there,mth956

888,Speculation on how to get a bwetter working world please discuss,right am i deluded im my thinking  is it our social responsibilty to not work and claim off the state benefits until a genuine working wage is achieved   follow my logic   the reason many dont work is because after child care commuting and other things they are worse off than signing on and have no incentive to get off benefits where they have a better standard of living   by putting a strain on the goverments benefit systems the goverments themselves might start asking the big important questions such as   why are the multiple big companies given tax breaks using those tax benifits to create private profit that does not trickle down to society as a whole   why has modern capitalism created a system where a wage is so below average in hours per week or wages per hour and where a worker has zero hour contracts and absolutly no rights that the goverment then has to step in and give those workers tax credit or other help why not just force these companies to inflate there wages and make it worth working   of course there will be those that say it will cause big business to abandon our countries but who cares   am i being naive please discuss and tell me if im missing a valid important economic point to this simple solution   thank you,mtzmob

933,Stuck in a rock and a hard place,so i work for an assembly plant and ive been thinking of leaving for a long time now   i initially started there 3 years ago as a parttime summer student during my last year at uni after i finished i decided to stay there because the pay was good and i good make some money to pay off student loans save for postgrad etc the past year or so was honestly pretty good especially for a pandemic my boss at the time was ok the hours were steady and i was able to ask for days off when needed   fast forward to january and things suddenly changed my hours were sporadic af the culture started becoming more hostile which is saying a lot for an automotive plant but worse was management supervisors became more toxic and demanding my current supervisor does not give me guaranteed hours at all instead im expected to wait by my phone until they call me to come in its been like this for the past 3 months some weeks on the morning shift id have to wake up as early as 4 am just to get ready and wait for my boss to call me in and if i cant come to work regardless of my reason theyll beg me like a dog pleading for me to show up they dont take no for an answer its honestly disgusting its taking a serious toll on my mental health as im starting to have no worklife balance and its just making my anxiety and depression even worse  i even planned on working here full time but whenever i ask hr or management about that they give the excuse that its still being processed or some other bs but at this point i wouldnt even wanna stay there as a fulltime employee   initially my plan was to ride it out until the summer when i go back to college full time but now im at a breaking point where i just wanna leave right now any thoughts,mtk6u1

947,"“I want change so much, why doesn’t it seem like it’ll come?”",title is not roasting this sub i love this sub its just a comment i read that really got me thinking   im only 21 years old ive already attempted suicide due to capitalism im completely burnt out on this life and i refuse to live in this system for the rest of my life ive been doing a lot of thinking these past few days ive tried doing everything i can to make my work life bearable recently but it seems like every time i do the higher ups do something to make it even more unbearable   you pay peanuts you get monkeys   do the bare minimum for the longest acceptable time possible  ive been doing my own strategies to make my job bearable like looping every piece of bullshit they throw at me right back to them x wasnt good enough quality okay so now i make it perfect but take at least 20 minutes on each task  backwards thinking for backwards wages   you legitimately wholeheartedly do not deserve my overthetop work ethic for the bullshit pay bullshit conditions and bullshit treatment   i personally am working a position meant for 3 people as one person mandatory overtime every week which obviously isnt helping with money considering im one of the nowmany who are voicing their frustrations about this broken system   so now the post title its something ive heard others say and its something i myself was always saying up until recently its because there really are so many of us we arent the few and far between anymore we are the fucking many and yet we dont know how to make the change we want to see we think we dont have the power to make change were afraid of consequences against us we think eh almost 8 billion on the planet someone else will do it  that someone else has to be you it has to be me it has to be that guy down the street who just lost his house it has to be that guy being escorted by ambulance because he just tried to kill himself to escape this hopeless capitalist lifestyle we are the last defense before this country becomes a completely hopeless case if we dont take action in our generations lifetime we will never get a chance again   this system is flawed every single possible act of your literal human existence is being profited off of you are not allowed to live a happy life under capitalism because its designed to brainwash you and keep you under their foot and prevent you from enjoying your own humanity and you know what you can follow their directions by the book get good grades go to college get a degree and still get fucked over in this system your wife has cancer well i dont care that you have insurance gimme 20 years of your life savings  we cant wait around for all these corrupt officials to do it themselves because the truth is if we continue on this course were headed towards a fascist country assuming we werent already in one in the first place with all the social media shutting down people that say this stuff and how most workplaces are essentially fascist challenge your managers authority in any way and you get absolutely shit on   my view is still very very undeveloped and underinformed ill completely admit that i only recently in the last few years have woken up to these issues and just barely recently have i gotten so fed up that i want to start trying to fight these issues theres a lot of things i need to learn about but all the same i believe wholeheartedly that we dont need socialism we dont need capitalism we need to form a brand new system we may not be able to make a perfect world but we can make it a damn fair world  we dont have to bend over and accept the oppression living the rest of our lives in constant misery barely able to live paycheck to paycheck barely able to find jobs even with a degree going into potentially lifelong debt just to go to college i dont want handouts man i dont want stimulus checks   you know what i want in life a place to live and time with my girlfriend thats it i dont want any yachts i dont want a high rise i dont want all these goddamn luxurious bullshit that shouldnt even fucking exist when you have people out there legitimately starving to death in our own goddamn fucking country fuck luxury and the idea of it until everyone has fair circumstances  there is no goddamn reason that lets say for example even at the least busy xx burger joint restaurant we still make 3000000 great job team oh wait im getting a call oh justin died he said he couldnt feed his family on 16000 a year hmmm replace him with simon  we need livable wages we are the only reasons your precious baby fucking companies run if we all went on strike you would absolutely be fucked we honestly should fuck your system run it yourself anyway back to the point   we need to stop letting the system brainwash us into accepting the fact that life isnt fair yes in a grand sense life truly isnt fair but we can make it as fair as possible by giving people a fair chance at their own fucking lives   if enough of us wake up and realize that this system is not humane we can make a change somehow somewhere until we make a government that is truthfully wholeheartedly beyond a shadow of a doubt by the people for the people   we need to fight all the corruption everywhere whether satan is on earth spreading his influence or it truly is just the insanity of human greed we need to fight it were not going to have some magical reset we have to do it ourselves because these corrupt people in power will never come back to their humanity,ms2r7n

973,I Just Quit My Job as an Amazon Warehouse Picker,tldr amazon managers want me to play games i dont  it was the summer of 2020 recently graduated college and i was on the hunt for product design jobs granted covid really hampered that so after 3 months of searching i needed more money for food gas etc prospects were not looking good so i bit the bullet and sold my soul to amazon fulfilment that 15hour for menial labor was what drew me in its not worth it  that soul i sold has now been crushed  there are a lot of bad things about working at amazon all the horror stories you hear are true my experience was picking the most common job entry level associates  get heres what the job entails   picking is how products go from inbound to outbound whenever a customer on amazon places their order pickers are the ones who take the product from a podthe tall yellow shelves of product that the robot brings to your picking station and place it in those fucking yellow totes when a tote has enough things in it you push it forward and the machines and conveyor belts send that tote to the other end of the warehouse where outbound packers will get it ready to ship your entire 10 hour shift is spent standing in an area the size of a dinner table and constantly picking and i mean constantly you cannot stop picking or else operations managers will come breath down your neck everything is monitored by cameras and amazons algorithm micromanaging as much as possible youve probably heard terms like time off task yeah fuck that bs managers want you picking at a breakneck 400 units per hour   the tipping point for me was their fucking games  you see the machines you pick from arsaw have two touchscreens at each pick station the main screen is all that matters as it tells you what item to pick and which tote to place it in it also tells you how many items youve picked your rate how fast you swap a full tote with an empty and the time inbetween each scanned product nothing wrong there its simply how you interact with your job now the second screenfuck the second screen its for games everytime you sign in at your station the second screen boots up games for you to play while picking except theyre more like stat trackers than games because you barely even interact with them you have a game that pits your floor against another floor in the warehouse theres one where you raise a tomagotchi like animal with food and excercise theres one where you are in a spaceship and race other ships keep this game in mind itll pop back up later but the thing is all these games are the fucking same because your game score is your pick rate which is already shown on the first screen these games are said to be extra motivators on your pick rate but dressing it up as a game is pathetic its distracting serves no purpose and makes us feel like a child so i naturally just turn the second screen off as most do and just focus on picking however recently managers have been wanting all pickers to log into the games while picking and by wanting i mean forcing they keep pushing space race like its hot shit saying it helps them keep track of workers except they have always been able to track us without these stupid games  so to the actual part that made me quit i wasnt even 30 minutes into my fucking shift before an ops manager walks up to me manager is your game screen working me id rather not play the games and focus on my work manager what me i dont like playing the games i want to pick manager well its actually required i continue picking ignoring her like i didnt hear anything and this bitch just stands there and watches me pick for a solid 10 seconds before manager can you please turn on your game screen me reluctantly turns on game screen manager go ahead and select me i know i know space race at 350 units per hour manager ok ill be coming back around later to check on you me immediately turns off second screen once her back is too me because i know she wont be coming back around and the games are asanine anyways  you know what amazon should be doing instead of trying to push space race well how about making sure arsaws arent constantly malfunctioning piles of shit giving employees more break time to physically move our bodies around this massive facility barely anytime for bathroom breaks so some have to piss in bottles paying us more than a paltry 15hour stop infantilizing workers and trust them remove all the fucking cameras at pick stations  amazon has been bar none the worst working experience i have ever had the only and i mean the only solace is the camaraderie between pickersstonerscountersthe ar techs fuck ops managers because we all are working in that hellscape everyone hates working there but we never release that anger towards coworkers because we know how tough it is and we revel in that empathy we share for each others jobs its hopeful solidarity of the masses screaming we will get through this together  i had been working there for 6 months and i didnt know how much darker the tunnel would become the physical toll is one thing but the mental toll is beyond comprehension every time i saw that damn fucking smile on the facade of the warehouse it wiped my smile clean off my face    once i hit that resign button on the a to z app i felt like genie at the end of aladdin i now have to bust my finding a good design job that matches my degree because im not against work just against that type of work  i know this is rambling but i just had to tell you guys i have been a part of rantiwork for about as long as i worked there at amazon and i knew you all would understand the most,msy79q

982,"If your business idea needs governmental (financial) backing, you should just get a better business idea",this is my philosophy now been working on my own projects for a couple years but always been a hardcore proletarian in the process therefore im thinking of ideas that eliminate the idea of manual labor minimum wage as an important business model and lax taxation  of course i havent made any progress yet but i thought id share this title with you guys because i see so many people complaining about socialist policy taking their money progressive reforms and revolutionaries being utopian and similar which is why its important to criticize people like me or even your local small business owner just as much as you need to criticize your bill gates and bezos  if wealthy businesspeople are voting for less taxes and proclaim that the taxes are ruining their business their business model is terrible   how often dont we hear that poor people just need to spend their money better or that they need to drop their coffee buy used stuff and practice minimalism of course this should also apply for businesses and businesspeople  theres a disgusting amount of businesses now being made that attempt to tackle the symptoms of capitalism not the core we create jobs by making ubereats uber amazon deliveries and whatnot but these jobs are at best minimum wage they are at best manual labor and they are at best including any sort of security net as part of their contract  were effectively running out of jobs that provide value beyond the value it gives to the business model of the business owner   however there are also businesses being made that hire no one at all these are the businesses im looking for this is what im trying to achieve   i believe society needs an abundance of sole proprietorships like these we need people to go to school university and beyond specialize in their fields and innovate something of value ideally with a majority of sole proprietorships we could generate value to the governments without extracting proletarian life energy create a social security safety net in the form of guaranteed income or guaranteed essentials  housing   remaining jobs would be essential jobs see c19 jobs that arent automatable people deciding to work these jobs would and should be the richest in society this would be a way more efficient way of working business and society in general and radically improve life quality in the process,msnb7x

1068,"Has anyone written at length about getting over our obsession with ""status""?",i see a lot of posts around here disdaining the craving for status i agree completely but it feels like something deeply ingrained in humans to the point that i wonder if we can ever fully break away from it  i imagine there was an evolutionary reason were like this but also imagine we can get past in the same way weve sort of gotten over some of our other primal instincts  has anyone ever seriously looked into this     it seems like a lot of religious traditions touch on status as a basic problem of human happiness  i was wondering if there were any secular takes on it,mnmaey

1088,"I understand the negativity, but here's another perspective",full disclosure im new to this sub so i dont know its history or the full context so i might misunderstand the point a little  i hate work i hate capitalism i hate being a wage slave i hate the anxiety of losing work and losing independence or what society considers your only metric of value it sucks  second i should recognize my privilege i live in canada so i have free healthcareat least the basics my family has always been lowmid income but made it in a low costofliving area and saved me a good education fund which covers maybe 13 of the cost of my degree im using this to study computer science at an average university here and i should graduate in about a year i have a bunch of student loans but im optimistic about paying them off im extremely grateful for what i have and i acknowledge that a lot of people will have fewer opportunities and that really sucks  now that thats out of the way id like to offer a different perspective this sub is a bit pessimistic the system sucks we all know it so try to beat it take some risks  have you heard of rfinancialindependence  its essentially this sub but with a solution its super encouraging to see people escape the grind on low incomes the reality is that under capitalism if you play your cards right and invest properly you can escape from the working class quicker than you think  did you do okay in highschool go get some student loans and study something please an education is the best investment you can make i know student loans are scary but please dont give up on your goals because of them  from there save all you can and invest it in a lowcost index fund these can average 9 a year if you can get a degree and get a decent wage and save even 10k a year itll grow exponentially after 26 years youll be a millionaire if you can save 20k itll be 19 years  with a million dollars you can essentially live off the interest that might require moving to a low costoflivinv area and cutting expenses but its very doable  i know that im generalizing and i know that this will be impossible for some people but if theres a small possibility that this could work for you please try take some risk worst case is you go back to being a wage slave again  i also know that im essentially encouraging you to participate in capitalism and become part of the ownership class that you hate so much i get it but realistically its your only escape and you will have earned it youre not the billionaire capitalist or the trustfund kid you fought your way into never working again its entirely different  thanks for your attention please disagree and discuss in the comments,mqv071
1089,Advice for unemployed regarding forced work searches,if youre unemployed then most likely your state is forcing you to search for work in order to continue receiving benefits but there might just not be enough jobs out there because of the pandemic or the jobs could be not suitable or safe  also of you apply for a job that is not safe or that pays a poverty salary and you get a job offer you have to accept it otherwise you lose eligibility  what many dont know is that you are required to do job search activities which is not necessarily limited to applying for jobs there are many other activities that count as job searching such as creating a resume creating a profile on linkedin attending virtual job fairs etc one program id recommend is the virtual career workshopshttpstwittercomunemploymentpuastatus1380783920980008965 program that lets you take online workshops that count as work search activities and also increase your job searching skills so that you can get a better job when there finally are openings  anyway hope this helps,mql5m0

1111,What it is about money that makes us okay with dysfunctional relationships?,im genuinely curious about this think about the typical manageremployee relationship now instead of those two people being coworkers imagine they were married but their behavior stays the same   if a husband told his wife that she had to wake up at the same time every day to work on and maintain the house with meals prepped at the same timesall under the threat of losing her home and livelihoodwed get pissed off and probably want the cops involved but if that same woman gets a job shell put up with that exact same personality type from her boss and the customers and everyone thinks its normal  in terms of the question in the title my thinking is that the supply of workers who will do anything to keep their job is higher than the demand for jobs that support their workers you cant compete with people who roll over because they are available when we tell our boss not to treat us like shit and the boss knows it so to keep getting paid we have to keep putting up with bullshit its similar to the folks you hear called scabs in union picket lines but on a wider scale  this is why i hate obtuse arguments like thats just life the people who say that seem to think dignity is worthless because desperate people are the ones who set dignitys price  but i feel like theres more to it what do you think,mri6lw

1116,Reading group for Ernest Mandel's Introduction to Marxist Economic Theory,hello comrades i was wondering if anyone wanted to be part of the initiation of a new reading group where well read ernest mandels introduction to marxist economic theory  we can set goals per week and discuss our progress ask questions and discuss deeper meanings and implications of the text covered in the week  what we will need  1 people whove already read the text so they can mediate the discussion sessions 2 someone who is familiar with the text to lay out the reading plan across weeks 3 people who would be interested in reading with the group   plan  i have panned out the following plan for us to go through kindly see if youd like to provide more suggestions well use discord as a medium of weekly meetings here are some details   for the purposes of discussions citations and reference we will use the page numbers from a specific pdf that can be found herehttpsbook4youorgbook5616545614510 some comrades already have a hard copy printed by various publishers they can of course continue with reading the hard copy but for citing page numbers etc kindly use the page numbers in the pdf only this will help us in maintaining uniformity and create a repository for readers in the future to easily find and navigate the discussions from the text  for comrades who are reading the text in languages other than english kindly share your text also for other comrades to read the text in the same language     kindly report your availability and feasibility of the plan     some advice from someone on facebook  1 you need a leader not just to moderate but to pick out the most important passages ask questions that generate discussion lay out the meaning of the concepts marx is discussing most people are incapable of discussion spontaneously and need to be led by the hand the illusion of horizontal learning is actually just the tyranny of structurelessness and being fettered to the stupidest or merely most obnoxious member at all times even then the structure of discord is working against you given everything is disconnected and anonymous you need to identify people who actually participate every week and give them a reason to care about educating a bunch of random people you may want to rotate leadership between these people if they exist given the amount of work it requires   2 99 of people who say they are interested will either drop out entirely or stop reading no matter what you do you will have to put in a lot of work to keep anything going no one else will do this for you and the community will not generate it basically every leftist internet community many much larger than ours has attempted a reading of various marxist books as far as i know everyone has failed thats because the op refused to put in the effort to become a teacher and waited for some angel to save the group im not gonna do it and if you are doing this because you want to learn instead of teaching it is doomed sorry you can still learn and it may in fact be better since you can follow their argument as it develops with fresh eyes but you need to take extensive notes plan ahead of time what youre going to say and force people to reference specific passages in the text that is the minimum to succeed where others have failed,mnpa0e

1139,This subreddit has changed my work life,ive been a long time lurker on this sub and only in the past couple months have i started to implement antiwork philosophies into my career i feel like a stronger person now  i just turned 19 moved out of my toxic parents house a year ago and have been bouncing through jobs ever since i currently work at a daycare as the lead infant teacher while doing schooling to get my cda child development associates when i applied for the job the owners promised me that they regularly give out raises and make sure every employee gets 40 hours by the end of the week i could never be happier except ive found out that they are the sleeziest owners in the world   cue my use of antiwork philosophies   i quickly discovered that my supervisor is required to make sure none of the employees get overtime any minute over and the owner well call him andy gets infuriated with her i got confused though because some of the employees from my daycare would travel to another center and work an extra 45 hours a day after their normal shift one of my coworkers who does this consistently told me she was tired i said at least you make good overtime well apparently she doesnt andy runs both centers as two seperate companies so he can get away without paying time and a half after hearing this i was offered to work overtime at the other center i found the guts to say no if you dont pay me time and a half im not interested they quickly moved on to someone else   another situation occurred when my coworkers and i started to discuss our salaries it wasnt until this subreddit that i realised how messed up it is that this is considered taboo through having these conversations we learned that me and a couple other new hires were making a whole dollar more an hour than our coworker who had been there 2 years longer than us and already had a level 3 cda we can call her tammy i later encouraged tammy to ask for a raise she was shy but eventually did it this was met with a series of demands such as transfer to this center and continue working extra hours and well see at this point she got so fed up that she threatened to leave if they did not pay her what she was worth tammy got a raise shortly after that   there are so many other examples i can use about my job but i just wanted to say thank you honestly if i had not been browsing this subreddit i would probably be in the same position as tammy down the line hopefully my story can help encourage you guys to stand up for yourselves too,mquori

1160,My mom doesn’t get it.,just had a frustrating conversation with my mom about my new job which has been pretty bad so far some background my mom is in her mid 60sfairly liberal and always has been but prides herself in her work ethic and having a hustler spirit im 26 and just accepted a wfh job after about 8 months of being unemployed due to covid i was venting to her about my new job situation no training getting blamed for things i didnt do low pay expected to work after hours everyday etc she basically laughed in my face and called me lazy without saying the exact word she thinks im entitled because i dont want to work my life away to be clear i dont mind working although i would love to not workmy goal however is to work for myself someday and to not work 40 hours a week i told her how i think its bizarre and sad that my coworkers some of which who have husbandswiveskids etc are always working late into the night and even waking up way before work to do more work i told her how i refuse to do that unless i absolutely had to sometimes we have to work lateearly i dont mind it being an occasional thing and she called me entitled and said are you special im hurt but more so annoyed that my mom who i always thought was down and cool is more of a bootlicker than i thought she kept saying that i have to put in the grind to get to my end goal but what even is the end goal to end up like my managers and coworkers who are doing work every night until midnight i told her that there is no end goal or reward for me but she just doesnt get it anyone else have parents who dont get it my mom is from a very different generation she was literally born in the 50s and i was born in the mid 90s lol so i get that but still frustrating nonetheless grateful though that i found this community because yall understand ,mr757j

1164,I feel like I am just pissing away my time,this is a bit of a rant but i have been with a company for 9 yrs  i am currently at an impasse because no matter how many interviews they give me i never get selected for any of the jobs to be fair i have gotten some promotions but not that many i work in the gov sector so to get raises you have to go to diff depts to actually make any money  i am so fucking frustrated there have been jobs that i know that i qualify for but the company will give them to people outside of the company and on top of that start them at a much higher pay rate    i go to my job do what is necessary dont slack but sure as hell dont burn the midnight oil   i also have boundaries although i am professional  at this point it seems like applying for anything else is just a fucking joke  what would you do in my situation i am obviously looking for another job outside but what can i do to make my time less miserable  the most recent job was one in my current division  yet there is a jackass who they hired for a 6 figure job who was trying to get advice on how to write a resume because he has never done one before      the only reason i have hung on this long is because of the benefits and stability because they pay is not good,mqtpyf

1177,"Revolution ideas: cancel all labor in luxury goods and non essentials, everyone work less hours, and have workers collectively make decisions",our current level of automation has made there way more than enough people than is needed to keep society functioning we could easily give every working class individual reduced work hours or allow seniors to stop working completely and we wouldnt have to sacrifice our standards of living  instead all our excess laborers must create luxury goods or provide nonessential services whether they want to or not  currently all people who dont own land or natural resources outright are effectively slaves to the land owning class and the luxury goods market  it is true that the working class buys luxury goods as well but if we took a vote im guessing most people would prefer to get more time back in their days  however the costs of owning land and other natural resources and high rates of existing debt make it impossible for this to happen without basically having a revolution so im proposing that maybe our revolution should aim for the cancellation or strict regulation of all jobs creating luxury goods amp services  who decides what is essential or luxury we decide democratically via vote by the working class people could still own a business and get rich from their inventions however the working class must collectively agree to make the specific product and also must approve the real job duties and descriptions to ensure it doesnt require backbreaking or unethical work  think about all the random useless novelty and other crap that currently gets produced by laborers in sweatshopsthis could be prevented  people would get more time to spend either with their children studying or taking care of their homecommunity mental health would improve drastically  i think this structure would integrate ubi and it could help pave the way to completely abolishing exploitative labor  these thoughts popped into my head this morning so i accept all your thoughts or comments on fatal flaws or other things that i didnt account for i dont even know where to start on planning a revolution itself on a national or global scale so i will leave that up to someone else lol,mnli7e

1229,Working from home has been excellent.,when i started working from home i was really stressed out because i thought i was being monitored constantly but the longer it went on the more i realized they just said that bullshit to scare us its now been over a year and ive taken lots of naps on the clock have gone for long drives take my breaks whenever i please and most importantly get by on the minimum amount of work required if i get criticized i just take an extra long break to forget about it if something big happens and they need extra help i just dont look at my screen until its over then tell them i had to take a bathroom break if they ask i make great money but my mental health has been ground into much and thrown in the mud from my previous jb im happy to have found something else that requires even less effort and time spent watching a screen it is a thankless industry and its stresses are not worth the time spent troubleshooting im happy to be collecting a check for minimal effort for once i feel like im able to take some time to myself without thinking about work after im off,mmsldf
1230,i WFH for an internship that’s kind of easy but i despise it anyway,so i just graduated college and have an internship that i work from home and make pretty solid money as a 22 year old but still im pretty fucking miserable and i know when i move back into an office ill want to shoot myself im fundamentally opposed to the idea of labor i dont feel like im actually accomplishing anything about 90 of the time ive pretty much done nothing this week because im so extremely unmotivated and want to find another job   you wanna hear some bullshit tho i took this internship in october and was told i would transition to a permanent role on march 31st guess what didnt happen im still an intern doing the same shit but i got contracted for another 6 months there is no career for me at my job i tried virtual networking with people in the finance department and one lady said i could do extra tasks for her if im interested why the fuck would i do more work for the same pay i dont really do anything substantial and i have no desire to keep working for a company that barely gives a fuck about me  the only thing i enjoy about this job is working from home and the occasional time im allowed to work in excel instead of doing pointless tasks i dont do shit for about 5 hours out of the day and im tired of feeling guilty about it my boss has the emotional capacity of a tree nut and i cant connect with him in any way i dont know any of my coworkers because everything is virtual not that i have any desire to i just want to look for another job so bad but i feel like i owe it to my company to stay for another 6 months or i wont get a good reference which i need to stay alive by getting another job down the road,mmrhiu
1231,The world is changing too fast to get a proper job when all requires years of experience,i grown up in a small town of a small middle eastern country in the 90s back than noone new what was going in the world and none of the people around me me included had an idea what i should be doing my parents mostly thought i get some low wage work like them and live by somehow in school we never learned anything usefull i remember i picked it specialisation which meant word and excelone guy i knew already started learning coding but to me it was weird and didnt know it will be needed in the future later after several failures i went to a small college hoping it will help me get a proper job it was a very bad school and the only one i could afford it had media and film related classes but in the end all it ever taught me is the basics of the basics because i really needed a job i started working in retail for years now i lost my job and i dont want to go back to retail i started looking for job that i can do with my college degree turns out everything needed today like social media and stuff was never on the schools radar when i was there so i have no experience and starting to really worry about my future  the point i wanted to make is that the world changing so fast that nothing i ever learned is usefull learning something new cost money and time i wish there would be some kind of funds for reeducation or something,mmrv9r

1236,Who’s going to perform high skill jobs in the ideal society?,ive read a lot of interesting things on this sub a lot of things that have made me stop and think a lot of things i agree with im 19 ive never had any strong political opinions but as i delve into the subject ive started to hate capitalism but its still hard for me to grasp the concept of anti worki read the side bar but a question that ive been unable to get an answer to is who will perform jobs that require a high degree of education and commitment consume a lot of time require immense effort and concentration and are quite frankly completely oppose the ideas here case in point being stem fields now im no stemlord im a business student but i know for a fact that doctorsnursessurgeons have extremely hectic and tight schedules that almost never result in a good work life balance scientists who stay up day and night to conduct researches that advance the human civilisation in terms of technology emergency services such as law enforcement and firefighters just to state a few all these require either years and years of extremely gruelling education or extreme fearlessness and dedication these jobs are also essential to the functioning of a society who and why would anyone do these jobs in an ideal society and even if lets say the ideal society was created in the us the economy is still global companies will just shift their operations to other countries with minimal effort creating an even worse living standard fyi im from asia the jobs i stated above are essentials what about the jobs that arent but still require a high degree of education like creating video games entertainment services and many others these only exist because there is a market for them whos gonna fund these projects considering aaa games cost upwards of hundreds of millions of dollars to create these days,mnb27z
1237,Today I witnessed the biggest case of Stockholm syndrome I've ever seen.,a couple weeks ago i saw something not really worthy of a post but now two events have occurred today being the largest   two weeks ago i saw someone saying that since they were only working x amount of hours they dont have to work their break if they dont want to thats right this moron actually volunteered to give up their break they were not even short staffed but the employee felt guilty for having a break when only working i think it was 5 hours boss was more than willing to let them take one but they felt too guilty to do so   today took the cake i was at sams renewing my membership when a manager came up and said they were having bad chest pains after lifting a box probably a pulled muscle but they were also short of breath and other symptoms related to a minor heart attack  the three other managers were literally begging her to leave and go to the er but i shit you not she was more concerned about who would cover for her while she was in the hospital  what the actual fuck these people actually exist i can guarantee you if the shoe was on the other foot the employer would not go out of their way for you at all and would probably have a replacement in under a week if you died  i cant get over just how unholy and overly loyal these two employees two different stores btw were  you can always find another job you cant find another body you only get one,mn0p5s

1263,Safety culture is at war with productivity,begin rant  canadian railway worker here i work on a 10 man crew that fixes rail defects i would like to think this is productive work that should be encouraged we kinda play a major part in keeping north americas supply chain operating by keeping the train wheels facing in a downward direction down is good  i operate heavy equipment that requires constant maintenance to function properly this involves crawling under machines and wiggling into tight spaces on greasy equipment   today is my first day back to work for a 9 day shift as we have some new crew members we have two extra safety officers on site today to make sure everybody is being safe  0600  i drive to fuel pumps to fill my truck decide to change a wiper while filling fuel tanks safety dipshit sees me changing the wiper and asks what i am doing i say changing a wiper he asks oh youre changing a wiper  great start  0700  i arrive at work location and begin inspecting a machine that i will be operating today safety dipshit tells me to get out of the machine so he can show me pictures of an audit he performed on another crew how is this relevant to me nobody knows maybe he wants to show off his new iphone  0725  i am warming up the machine and functioning the hydraulics checking for leaks and whatnot safety dipshit tells me to stop moving as there is a train passing by 100 feet away from my machine super helpful thanks probably saved my life  0730  safety dipshit begins taking pictures of two other contractors from another company that we work with they are a separate company with their own safety program and their own liability insurance other contractors are confused and understandably a little pissed off  0735  i am familiarizing myself with the new machine and going through my checklists safety dipshit interrupts me to point out that the inspection tag on the fire extinguisher needs to be metal i nod and go back to what i was doing safety dipshit interrupts me again to tell me he is going to order some metal tags fantastic good to know safety dipshit tells me how to put a mark or a dent on the monthly inspection tag for the fire extinguisher he instructs me on how to use a nail to make a dent on the metal tag fascinating   0810  i decide to grease a boom truck that i will also be operating this week i shut off my truck and put wheel chocks under the tires even though the brakes are set and i am on level ground   safety dipshit walks past my tires with wheel chocks under them he is standing next to a greasy rag and empty grease tube i have a grease gun in my hand he leans down and asks me what i am doing i resist the urge to say kundalini yoga or baking a birthday cake and simply reply greasing my truck safety dipshit feels the urge to ask are you okay between gritted teeth i reply yes im fine safety dipshit asks is your truck going to move omfg  0817  i crawl out from under my truck and safety dipshit races over to talk to me before i get a chance to put my chin diaper on as i am wearing greasy nitrile gloves he then proceeds to tell me about how i need to wear a mask if i am within 6 feet of another worker this really happened  0825  i find out that safety dipshit 2 went into my truck while i was under it and began moving around my personal belongings to see if i had completed all my checklists and paperwork i was literally completing items from that checklist while he was going through my truck he didnt bother mentioning that he rummaged through my personal belongings  0835   i am inspecting my truck the nearest person is 75 feet away safety dipshit 2 sees that i am not wearing a mask and races over to tell me the exact same thing that safety dipshit  just told me i need to wear a mask when i am within 6 feet of somebody thank you for racing over to give me shit for being compliant until you snuggled up next to me and made me noncompliant  0910  i have two hard hats one is orange and has ear muffs and a face shield the other is white and has nothing on it i use the white one when the bulky orange one is a nuisance safety dipshit 2 reminds me that i cant wear a white one as it is for supervisors   1015  i have given up i have tried taking the initiative i have tried being proactive i am now drinking coffee and playing on my phone the safety dipshits have stopped all movement on site productivity for today is zero   this kind of bullshit is why production has left canada crippling compliance overreaching safety and overthetop environmental regulations have made it unprofitable to invest in canada commodities used to be the backbone of canada now its banking the working class has been eviscerated  we are held hostage by safety officers and our excessively litigious society workers live under constant threats of punishment for not knowing every nuance of the labour code every moron who does something stupid and likely lies about it ends up adding another rules for everybody to follow   in order to do my job i need to be compliant with federal and provincial transportation rules hours of service requirements covid rules my companys procedures and requirements the railways rules the municipalitys rules labour code all while being courteous to landowners and other drivers i also had to sign antiharassment and bullying forms if i actually dedicated myself to being 100 compliant i couldnt actually legally work   for instance wearing a companysupplied mask blows humid air onto my safety glasses and eliminates my ability to see exercising my right to refuse unsafe work under these conditions is technically possible but i will likely be seen as a problem worker and will suddenly stop getting called to work which is not actually the same thing as getting fired   days like today make me want to go live in the woods i am tired of this work culture i am tired of canada i am tired of subjugation and compliance to useless safety dipshits who couldnt hack doing real work i am tired of selfserving bureaucrats whose only function is to ensure their own job security  those who cant do teach those who cant do or teach become safety officers  no wonder china is eating our lunch  end rant,mmay6u
1264,I fucked up. Feeling suicidal right now.,i had a very good job that was in my field music not too dystopian an environment public library and things were starting to look up after months of hellish experiences well at least until my dumbass autistic self ruined everything  so one day i had to attend an event where i had to play a game online with the teenagers in the game a question along the likes of get over it would be a ridiculous response to overwhelmed with the stress of making sure that i would be engaged i was given a sheet that would have measured my communication abilities not easy thanks to my disability and under stress of a timer i ended up hastily saying something along the lines of getting raped   i answered the question honestly with no illwill but thanks to my autistic natural lack of filter i cant properly apply social filters under pressure what i ended up saying was not appropriate for teen spaces and as a result i was fired after just three weeks and i was so happy about my life finally getting better now its back to indeed hell for me even if i managed to get another job not easy since my condition makes interviews very difficult im certain ill never get another opportunity like the one i had someone please tell me why i shouldnt just jump off a bridge there are a lot around where i live,mmbueg

1268,Life is a game,within this interactive game is a number of games you can play the 9 to 5er the entrepreneur the entertainer to name a few all these games require time and energy and some a level of skill and currency   to win the game is to not have to play games for survival this requires a certain amount of in game currency that for most players is out of reach so they are forced to play until social security kicks in and subsidises their remaining game play   there are other games one may opt to play such as relationships and creating mini character versions of themselves these games require a significant investment of time energy and currency   since time and energy is limited it may be wise to limit the amount of games one chooses to play collecting shiny objects may be tempting but these require time and energy to polish and maintain and can cut into your downtime as well as your currency reserves  it may be wise to limit these objects and reduce the number of games you opt to play as the typical 9 to 5 is very time costly  save your 9 to 5 currency as every weeks worth saved is a week you dont have to play  you may be able to buy yourself enough time to switch from one game to another   in the mean time try to enjoy your game play and keep the stakes low as possible to reduce stress also refrain from abusing your console   play the lottery weekly for a chance to win a cheat code if you werent randomly handed one at the start menu good luck and happy gaming,mmfu0r

1277,I am seriously debating quitting but need advice and support.,i need to provide some pretext but i will make this as brief as possible   ive been selfemployed since i was 16 years old primarily selling on ebay  ive worked retail and other jobs off and on since i moved to iowa in 2017   i took a job march of last year because the pandemic fucked everything up there was a two month period i had no income because everything came to a halt all the thrift stores closed due to the pandemic and not being essential a lot of local auction companies never sold online and had to learn and invest in selling online  so now its april and i have 13 months at this place under my belt but i ask myself every single day is it worth it  why because im on day 7 of a 10 day vacation unpaid of course   i literally feel like ive been released from prison i have so much less stress now its unbelievable  i have a lot of health conditions that has always made working for someone else absolutely suck none of which are either severe enough or do not qualify for disability but who wants that anyways it does not pay jack shit   imagine sleeping 10 hours one night but feeling like you got either an hour of sleep or no sleep at all thats pretty much 34 days out of every week for me  ive had every test imaginable full mri thyroid levels thyroid ultrasound all kinds of blood and urine tests nothing indicates why im always so tired and lacking energy i do have sleep apnea and use a machine but it only helps a little i can literally drink an energy drink and fall asleep   so working a set schedule sucks ass ive literally blanked out for a couple seconds while driving due to lack of sleep of course i get massive shit if i come to work tired even though i literally talk on a phone and dont sound tired in my voice so it comes down to either driving to work exhausted and showing up or not showing up and getting fired   but im not lazy or one of those neet people ive literally been making money since legally able to i just cant handle working for others  its not just having shitty health i despise coworkers they all have this fake buddy buddy persona and when you need to talk to them about something important but nonwork related they dont care they are also very superficial and will run to the boss to narc if you say one tiny bad thing about your boss or company ive never seen so many people walk on eggshells like i do with coworkers of any place ive worked   i also despise management too im always super polite and friendly with my supervisors or bosses but i dont kiss ass im not one of those chummy sweet talk the boss types i view my boss as another person and give them as much respect as they give me i dont fucking worship them or put them on a pedestal but guess who never gets compliments or gets in trouble for shit that other coworkers never get talked or reprimanded for thats right me   but i have a few issues if i quit for starters i feel like im letting down my parents i know that sounds stupid but i am close and have a strong relationship with my parents and telling them news like that is never easy now my parents are very understanding and wont do anything stupid like cut me off or quit talking to me for telling them i quit but i still feel like they will be a bit disappointed in me  but i live with my wife and pay the bills my parents do not i have to go to work my parents do not what i do with my life is my choice but i still feel bad ya know  the other issue is qualifying for a mortgage credit unions and banks tend to laugh at self employed people which is quite stupid i can get fired or laid off at anytime but other than the two month freeze during the pandemic i can make money no matter what   lastly is retirement my job chips in 30 cents of every dollar i put in retirement you dont get that advantage when working for yourself   otherwise i figure if i devote more time to my self employment i can make up for what i would make working maybe 100200 less per month but not be maybe if i fall asleep this time i wont wake back up and not have to go to work  sorry for the wall of text i am really torn on this and would like advice,mn05m5

1293,Sick days.,i work at a bakery i bake stuff and sell it disguised and paid as a cashier i am responsible for an entire shop on some days wouldnt that make me a manager no because otherwise they would have to pay me more also i am not allowed to eat anything without paying and have to throw 200600 worth of food in the trash by the end of each day but thats another topic  currently we are understaffed because the bakery chain is slowly vanishing and stopped hiring new people i wonder what could have led to this throw 200600 worth of food in the trash by the end of each day the branch manager a cashier like us just a slightly higher position like a supervisor went on a one week vacation on the first day of her vacation she calls in sick for the entire next week no info nothing just that shes sick thats fine  after calling the higher district manager about this to see if we can find someone from another shop to help us out he starts crying about how he is already helping out in other bakeries despite it not being his job poor soul had to serve people for a few days what a pity   few days later turns out he moved his vacation closer so now hes gone too  after working 1012h shifts to keep this bs bakery running knowing that in october this year we will all be laid off anyway the district manager comes back and has the audacity to thank us for our great work and that this company needs people like us i dont want a thank you i want a check that says here have 100 for putting in so much effort but instead i get to correct the time stamp paper because for someone reason on some days some working hours just disappear like we are open until 2000 but the clock checked me out at 1922 sure i left and a ghost took over and finished the shift huh not like i always work overtime until 2015 because we cant take out the cash register to start counting before 2000 thats multiple hours you legaly dont get paid if you dont watch out  ampx200b  so today i called in sick my nose is running like crazy and i am for sure not going to work with food in this condition last thing we need is the health department giving us a visit closing down the entire bakery and after all its my responsibility to not risk the health of our customers  i had a digital appointment with my doctor and she told me to stay at home and minimize all contacts till monday if it doesnt get better i should do a quick covid test  so i call the district manager and he actually tried to talk me out of calling in sick so you really want to call in sick because of a runny nose it wouldnt be very collegial towards the others like excuse me didnt you desert us while understaffed like a few weeks ago and arent you supposed to make sure proper hygiene is carried out in all the shops thats straight up inconsiderate i also had to inform the branch manager and she just send me a message saying i should do the covid test now so if it turns out negative i could still come in for todays late shift besides the irony of do as i say not as i do this is just f up a covid test is not going to change the fact that i went through an entire toilet paper roll in one day just for my nose  after ignoring that message for four minutes she is trying to call me nah i aint picking up ill just say i was taking a nap because guess what im sick  sick and tired of how you should feel bad for being sick   sick and tired of how hard work has become during covid   sick and tired of hearing thank yous dont thank me pay me   i just want to survive,mng1k7

1306,"If somebody doesn't want to work because they're ""lazy"" then that's their business.",people tend to be very judgemental if you ever criticize the whole idea of having to trade your freedom for money one word that gets thrown around a lot is lazy because apparently if you dont want to work a soul crushing job purely for the money then you are lazy i personally dont think im lazy i just would prefer to make a living making musichttpsopenspotifycomtrack1jqyqgiicelheboeypl2tpsi64795106e4614e9f so thats what i spend my time doing but that doesnt pay at least not yet so in the eyes of society im lazy and pretty much useless however i also think that if someone doesnt want to work because they are lazy then they should have the freedom to do so its their life so they should be free to be lazy if they want especially considering the fact that the didnt ask to be born in the first place with all that said though i really dont understand people who are antiwork but also want to have children because the chances are if they have children those children are going to have to work a shitty job just like them for most of their of their lives too,mmtw5q

1313,Punchable,a work friend of mine gave his notice today the president of the company asked him why now normally this is when the person leaving offers platitudes about seeking other opportunities and other such bullshit so as not to burn the bridge just in case not this guy though he took a flamethrower to that bitch to paraphrase why am i leaving because people around here think its ok to act like assholes they are completely disrespectful to their coworkers and they get a pass because its the owners cousin or the guy dating the owners daughter or they do a good job so just about any amount of shitty behavior is tolerated so im leaving on my own terms before i tell someone to go fuck himself and have to leave involuntarily   it got me thinking it really is amazing how being within the four walls of the office makes some people feel entitled to speak and act in a way that would absolutely get themselves knocked the fuck out if they tried it out in the real world i am not encouraging violence by any means but i think one positive side effect of a news story like that boss berates employee employee clocks that mouthy twatwaffle everyone cheers is that maybe some of these lippy shitheads will think twice about how they speak to and treat their fellow drones,mmg0ti

1340,Going from working part-time to full-time (advice needed),so ive been working three days a week 2530 hours for the past monthandahalf after being largely out of work for around ten months so far its going pretty well and i generally enjoy my job accounting and the people i work with it was initially on an interim basis for tax season and i agreed to work three days citing personal reasons and wanting to study for the cpa exam  however today after telling me how much they like my work they offered me a fulltime position with more money and benefits when im ready even without seeing the terms it seems like a nobrainer to accept as im currently just paid hourly  my problem is that i do not do well personally when i work fulltime and five days a week yes professionally i can hack it but im miserable im not the most efficient with my personal time unfortunately moderate ocd and i generally require a decent amount of alone time i also do a very poor job of getting enough sleep at night when im working a lot since i have so many interests and goals im going for that keep me up  even working just three days a week im only able to average around 45 hours of sleep on work nights i catch up the other days ive also unfortunately gained about 810 pounds and though im not overweight im not in the best of shape at this point obviously a lack of sleep and consuming caffeine has contributed to this  i guess in a nutshell im asking for advice on handling this i do enjoy my job and those i work with and i want to stay but going in five days a week just isnt going to work well for me longterm ive done this in the past at other jobs i mentioned when they hired me initially that i could work more if i was able to do so remotely but they shot me down the current situation is manageable even if the early hours dont work well for me but anything more and im going to struggle  so what do you think how should i play this,mlsmc6

1352,How did you accomplish a work-free/work-lite lifestyle?,i see a lot of comiserating on this subreddit but very few productive conversations in how to accomplish an antiwork life while im not work free i have a very healthy worklife balance and live a decently comfortable life im a temp i started off doing nonskilled labor did some work with electricians currently in school for welding to become a welding temp the temp life has its fair share of bullshit but its best quality is that due to its nature i dont ever have the same boss for more than a few months and that there are breaks in between jobs i tend to work 23 months at a time and take a month or two to live off my savings and unemployment before going back to work to re up on money how i plan to move closer to being totally workfree is to trade cryptocurrencies and stocks untill i eventually have enough money to be able to take longer and longer breaks and so far after some trial and error ive ve found a system that works for me to make steady profits on crypto and that i can scale up with time,ml4mg5

1355,Being an essential worker broke me,im tired just so tired  why why am i still doing this why do i still drag myself out the door for a company that doesnt care if i live or die  i work for a popular grocery store chain one with a reputation for standing by its workers before the shit storm that started with this pandemic i wouldve agreed we have pretty damn good health insurance decent pay and flexible hours the people i work with are fun and i consider many of them to be my friends i gained a lot of confidence since starting there and i considered it a positive influence in my life  but i cant anymore they abandoned us  it started small first we werent allowed gloves on the register cant have the customer thinking  we see them as dirty or that were scared ive seen coworkers sent home without pay after arguing with managers over this then the panic buying started people reached over our heads demanded more mere inches from our faces screaming all of us customers and employees crammed in a small store with little space between we were offered overtime instead of protection  we werent allowed masks until several weeks passed anyone who wore one into work was expected to take it off before starting a shift one of my coworkers wouldve been fired for wearing one all through their shifts if a state mandate hadnt been implemented they started cutting hours and sending people home if we werent busy any time we missed had to be covered by our ar or we werent paid for it  then came the issue of health insurance its one of the biggest draws of working at this place at first things were okay the company grandfathered in everyone into their insurance for the springsummer measurement period it was a huge relief for everyone if we missed a few days due to cuts it didnt count against us at the time they didnt carry it through to the second half of the year fall was a scramble for hours i saw full timers whove been with the company 10 lose their health insurance in the middle of a pandemic it was soul crushing this happened while hours were still being cut  they tired to give us a bonus instead of putting money into our 401ks the opted everyone into it and encouraged us to take the money if you really need it tantalizing their already struggling work force with money that if we take it will harm our prospects of retirement in the long run while saving themselves millions if you wanted that money to go into your 401k you had to manually opt out of it  theres more more personal stuff the daily berating of customers who are sick of wearing masks sick of having to wait in a line outside the store sick of all the cleaning getting in the way of their shopping experience sick of us just trying to stay safe too many people think its okay to touch me on the job to pull down their masks to talk to me yell at me for waiting outside just to find out their favorite product is out of stock or bringing their whole family just to get out of the house   i can tolerate a lot if the company had chosen to help us get vaccinated i could forgive a lot  but they didnt  were on our own for appointments id say at my store less than half have had their first shots weve been eligible since february but its an absolute struggle to get an appointment  they abandoned us  but everyday i have to hear people around me talk about how great the company is how wonderful it feels like gaslighting ive given up on talking to management about my concerns they dont care about us or the customer all they care about is the bottom line human life is secondary,ml0eoj

1370,Why do people think not wanting to work a job you hate means that you should agree with socialism?,thats pretty much the question im entirely for the pursuit of money if a person is following their passions in life if they truly enjoy doing what they do i see no problem in people trying to capitalize off of what they do   being against menial tasks and meaningless jobs doesnt mean youre entirely against the idea of accumulating money and following what you love doing im against the idea that people should be forced to work jobs they hate im not against the idea of people doing what they love and making money from it though,mljret

1410,"Nostalgia, escapism, geek culture",im sure most of you have noticed a rise in a certain kind of consumer culture the reenacting of the old and the promise of awe and excitement of entering a different world of purpose this symptom of our times should not be treated as a mere extension of childhood in a condescending manner or vilified as simple capitalist consumerism it is an anthropological crisis developing in front of us every day people have lost hope in changing the world apathy is on the rise life has become atomized selfindulging coping going through the motions to get to the weekend  so whenever a different world is shown to us we are drawn to it the stories the fauna the characters the civilizations the technology or lack thereof it all fascinates us collectively we nucleate as fans of certain shows movies games books etc as at the same time our striving for something different and also our individualistic lifestyles escapism is so widespread because it tries to fill our yearning for purpose and shows us a world where our existential problems would vanish mainly a sense of disconnection of uselessness of submitting to the worthless ratrace it gives us an adventure that we cannot live today without risking all that we have emotions and experiences  this happened to me with several media novels documentaries of course theres always a romantic idealism but maybe criticizing escapism as naive is even more naive than that you cant expect us subjects of capitalism to have an objective sense of what our human existence could be like or how much could it be improved in the spiritual sense in our quest for purpose and belonging if anything we have to give more power to these visions as they could tell us so much about our own oppression and the disenchantment of the modern capitalist world,mm3o1j

1462,"The relief I felt seeing how many people are subbed to something like this, wow. Hello my people!!!",antiwork is something i have been preaching for years but have only recently been able to embrace i come from a very low low middle class family meaning i would not overall say i grew up poor but had periods where we were poor and some where we were doing pretty well i have very young parents for my age and have watched them struggle work their ass off to save up enough to both start a business and buy a house then get destroyed by the real estate bubble pop and by awful small town politics affecting their business and ability to get permits my whole life all i have wanted for them is to able to rest and enjoy themselves my father especially not that mom worked less she was the homemaker everyones dad is the most hardworking dad but this manwow he needs a break   then theres me who went off to college at a time when my parents were really hurting financially i had to work 40 hours a week on top of an engineering curriculum to not just pay my own bills and rent but at times help with my parents and my terminally ill grandfather long story short i burned out by 2nd semester junior year all that work for no degree ill get it someday but ive made my peace with that one   i spent the next 4 years doing anything i could for money shit jobs like security being a subject for clinical trials hell i was even an escort for a short stint before it just became too depressing point is my whole life i have never known financial security all i have ever known is work no time for individuality and pursuing my dreams but always had this burning feeling that this cant be the only path in life   recently i learned a ton about investing and got lucky with a couple moves yes one of them was gamestop also blackberry and some weed stocks unfortunately i didnt walk away with as much as i could have but enough to coast on for a good few years and have no major worries about income and it has completely changed my outlook on life on my self my loved ones are all wondering what big thing ill do next meanwhile i just want to live alone in the woods and be at peace with that said i am not out of the woods yet and know i have to make moves and investments to preserve this way of life in the long run but ive made massive strides and am so relieved about it i can finally invest in myself my interests and the ways i want to make this world a better place by the time i exit  i dont have much of a point to leave you with and sorry for the length i just wanted to express my joy in finding a community that knows exactly how i feel and i dont have to feel ashamed or lazy for not wanting to keep oiling this fucking stupid machine we all keep running  obviously most of us need to work to get to a good jumpoff point but hell even that sentiment has problems way of the world i guess   any way thanks for reading if you made it this far i dont have many real life connections left so i mean it thanks i wish you all luck on your journeys to stop working til you die and start living your life,ml1upi

1492,New to sub but Anti(useless)work most of my life.,hi everyone i just found this subreddit today and am happy to find a community of people who share my thoughts about how crazy the modern work world is and how valuable our time on this earth is i thought id share my experiences and difficulties and hope they help someone  i am 34 living in the usa when i was in elementary school i only learned english from school while my parents spoke to me in two nonenglish languages i was consistently getting below average scores on standardized tests and my teacher thought i was retarded as anyone would be if they only had us public school to teach them one day i decided to get a kids novel i could hardly read work through it myself for a few weeks and by the time i was done i was finally able to read most english books with good fluency it also taught me a lifelong lesson of teaching myself from books  since i was 13 i didnt want to do meaningless work that didnt actually help people in the early 2000s i read books from the 1950s warning of politicians leading the usa into its current economic situation and i couldnt deny that was the direction we were going i was aware of the transfer of industry from the usa to asian countries and that automation would obsolete jobs  during high school i was tired of the public education propaganda and i was already learning the things i needed from books at local libraries i would skip classes go to the library or outside school and went through more of the textbooks than i would sitting in class i wanted to homeschool but my parents wouldnt let me so i had to wait until i was 16 the legal age to decide for myself to homeschool in the state i lived in this caused a lot problems in my asian family some were neutral or supportive some said that i was no longer family  while homeschooling i still worked hard to go through the textbooks i needed to read but it gave me the freedom to learn when and where i wanted to whether library outside or at home and i had a lot more time to learn new things and pursue my hobbies i really appreciated how i was in control of my own time and my time didnt get wasted on things like going to and from school pointless class activities waiting on classes to start or end lunch or physical education  i did well on my ged and sat tests and got into a good engineering school anyone thinking about homeschooling but are hesitant to because you think it may hinder getting into a good college please know that many homeschoolers do get into good colleges what matters to them is whether you can demonstrate adequate proficiency and are prepared  college was less retarded than public school and good for the people who can put up with it and find their dream jobs i dropped out after working at a commercial solar pv installation company i learned to design pv installation layouts and install solar panels on the job site i eventually worked full time but we have an understanding that i can come and go as i like right now i am taking a long break from my day job and working for an open source project and learning programming because i would like to contribute code to the open source ecosystem in the hopes that someday we can have a humane ubi system based on open source software  i live frugally and have taken long periods of time off from work to just spend time on my hobbies learn new things and try different work that interests me i am not rich but i take care of my health and am time rich i dont waste my money on materialistic goods and i find my time wellspent working on things i care about at the age of 34 looking back i may not have gotten on the career path to make millions like some people around me but i feel like i have been semiretired since 16 only doing work that i find enriching taking plenty of time to explore the things that interest me and most importantly pursuing the things my heart tells me to,mkc3vx

1507,Some anti-work musings/complaining,i love my job i am very fortunate to be a knowledge worker and not pushed to burnout specifically im a therapist and i love using my position to help people cope with the capitalist hellscape in america however i decided to take a few days off to slow down a little and im sad not because i want to be at work but because i dont know how to be anything other than an employee i think of how much time i spent gaining new skills in high school and really had a rich and meaningful life aside from school i was working as a prep cook for a local nursing home and making time to write music and young adult fiction i look back on how things were then and they were generally pretty great   so here i am now im good at what i do for work i dont hate it and i can pay my bills but when im not doing that i find doing anything else to be difficult sitting down at the piano is a chore i havent written any fiction in years and though my kitchen life is still pretty healthy i have dozens of projects on my todo list that are continuing to pile up   im antiwork not only because i oppose the exploitation of others but also because of the way it hampers our ability to be more than a worker i wish our culture and infrastructure better served people in pursuit of activities for purposes other than financial gain,mjehru

1516,After reading a disturbing story about Toronto poverty I'm now completely convinced the government is trying to murder its poor,the story is on the ocap website an anti poverty organization i have stayed up all night in horror after reading this worried about my options i knew there has been years of austerity but ive never read of anything like this before this is truly a new age weve entered in the step the governments take to kill off their citizens   anyway what they were saying is just how the toronto city officials had fought back on the idea of 24 hour warming shelters for homeless women and children women and children are being pushed out on the street to die there are no shelter spots left they gave the true stats not the fake ones there was more discussion on the true level of unemployment and how the government provincial and federal through ontario and canada has given false statistics about just how dire the unemployment crisis truly is and this was pre covid   there is literally no way to survive this if youre working class you can go to school collect debt and never be guaranteed a job despite your best efforts the little survival jobs are now impossible to get and wont pay the exorbitant cost of rent in most canadian cities and towns you can try to get a room but youd be surprised how much that costs as high as 1600 in someones basement in toronto if you go to a shelter its 100 full even if youre a woman with a child which used to be priority years back  most homeless out on the street were single males   in a country like canada its more than easy enough to succumb to the elements extreme cold this goes beyond austerity this is all by design and its at the point of murder now a decade back it was more of a neglect on the pat of the government and you could still get by with extreme budgeting and long hours at work on your own   what ive more recently is like nothing ive ever witnessed before what the hell is going on with these governments in canada us uk its much of the same thing,mjwpm0

1545,New to sub but Anti(useless)work most of my life., hi everyone i just found this subreddit today and am happy to find a community of people who share my thoughts about how crazy the modern work world is and how valuable our time on this earth is i thought id share my experiences and difficulties and hope they help someone  i am 34 living in the usa when i was in elementary school i only learned english from school while my parents spoke to me in two nonenglish languages i was consistently getting below average scores on standardized tests and my teacher thought i had mental problems as anyone would be if they only had us public school to teach them one day i decided to get a kids novel i could hardly read work through it myself for a few weeks and by the time i was done i was finally able to read most english books with good fluency it also taught me a lifelong lesson of teaching myself from books  since i was 13 i didnt want to do meaningless work that didnt actually help people in the early 2000s i read books from the 1950s warning of politicians leading the usa into its current economic situation and i couldnt deny that was the direction we were going i was aware of the transfer of industry from the usa to asian countries and that automation would obsolete jobs  during high school i was tired of the public education propaganda and i was already learning the things i needed from books at local libraries i would skip classes go to the library or outside school and went through more of the textbooks than i would sitting in class i wanted to homeschool but my parents wouldnt let me so i had to wait until i was 16 the legal age to decide for myself to homeschool in the state i lived in this caused a lot problems in my asian family some were neutral or supportive some said that i was no longer family  while homeschooling i still worked hard to go through the textbooks i needed to read but it gave me the freedom to learn when and where i wanted to whether library outside or at home and i had a lot more time to learn new things and pursue my hobbies i really appreciated how i was in control of my own time and my time didnt get wasted on things like going to and from school pointless class activities waiting on classes to start or end lunch or physical education  i did well on my ged and sat tests and got into a good engineering school anyone thinking about homeschooling but are hesitant to because you think it may hinder getting into a good college please know that many homeschoolers do get into good colleges what matters to them is whether you can demonstrate adequate proficiency and are prepared  college was more tolerable than public school and good for the people who can put up with it and find their dream jobs i dropped out after working at a commercial solar pv installation company i learned to design pv installation layouts and install solar panels on the job site i eventually worked full time but we have an understanding that i can come and go as i like right now i am taking a long break from my day job and working for an open source project and learning programming because i would like to contribute code to the open source ecosystem in the hopes that someday we can have a humane ubi system based on open source software  i live frugally and have taken long periods of time off from work to just spend time on my hobbies learn new things and try different work that interests me i am not rich but i take care of my health and am time rich i dont waste my money on materialistic goods and i find my time wellspent working on things i care about at the age of 34 looking back i may not have gotten on the career path to make millions like some people around me but i feel like i have been semiretired since 16 only doing work that i find enriching taking plenty of time to explore the things that interest me and most importantly pursuing the things my heart tells me to,mkcgf3

1551,The Black Hole Of Material Consumption,you know when i look around a lot of reddit posts and threads i notice a similar theme where most people feel they are winning at life simply by accumulating more material wealth  a lot of the discussion is around how to invest better have more money have nicer things etc  i realize it is this very topic that makes me very unhappy and miserable  i simply want to make the point that life isnt just about accumulating material things some of us are not materialistic people and so we do not have the same greed of others when it comes to maximizing wealth  for me i have the material stuff i wanted i sit here thinking about what i can buy to make myself happier and realize it doesnt work like that there really isnt stuff that would change my mental state anymore  im the type of person who can drive a cheap car and live in a small studio or one bedroom apartment and it is enough what is annoying about this world to me is the constant pressure for people to do better than that or attain more  i think for the people that can buy happiness by owning tesla cars and 5 bedroom homes great go for it and spend decades to get there for me i realize i could care less about these things i dont have many friends and im not trying to impress others since i know i will always lose in that game  i guess what i am trying to say is  i encourage others to not feel bad about their own situation because the culture we live in tries to force you to feel inadequate no matter what you have if you are like me  and you dont get your happiness from owning expensive things  dont let the toxic culture make you feel inadequate and unworthy for not wanting what you dont need,mk2gcx

1598,Our tax structure is the biggest middle finger to the working class.,there are many subtle more egregious signs that the us doesnt care about its working class but the most obvious is the tax structure  the best part is that its largely not talked about    ampx200b  when politicians ramble on about taxing the rich they always talk about people earning 400k a year  this actually refers to a specific group of high income people doctors lawyers engineers and other high salary professionals  interestingly enough the overlap between the truly wealthy and the highly paid professional class is not nearly as large as most people think and yet these professionals usually pay the highest effective tax rate out of anyone       the truly wealthy are typically asset holders people with property stock bonds or businesses and their earned income usually doesnt exceed 150k yet they are the ones making millions  year in capital gains income    ampx200b  for perspective the top marginal tax rate on earned income is 37 compared to the capital gains top rate of only 20 a rate surpassed by your average factory worker  this doesnt even account for the fact that wage earners pay for medicare social security and a host of other payroll taxes that capital gains related income is shielded from  this points to the government wanting to help the capital class while punishing the working class  this is what we should be upset about and this is why the wealthy dont really pay their fair share  my view is that if anything earned income should be taxed more favorably on the basis that someone is literally trading their life for money whereas an investor is only trading the risk of financial loss for money,mklwcs

1653,Thoughts on shared housing,isnt it strange how if you have a mental or physical disorder and is exempt from working you will likely be placed in your own apartment or house via social housing help at least this is the case many places in europe thus it must somehow be considered a human right to have your own private home  yet the people who actually work hard are forced into the private housing sector most cant even afford to rent a private apartment but have to share with x number of flatmates alternatively if youre lucky enough to be able to afford your own place you will likely be paying half your salary or more to a greedy landlord  dont get me wrong i am all in favour for social housing i have friends that have their own private apartment without working a day in their life because they have genuine issues thats all great but where is the housing help for us workers in fact you are punished for having a relatively good job you earn too much to get any housing help from the state  yet the housing market is so disgustingly overpriced that many cant even get a mortgage and rents are going up and up im fed up with the lack of regulations in the private housing market decently priced private housing should be a human right for everyone not just the rich and the sick,mhubyw

1667,I just got terminated by my new job that I just started 2 months ago and found this group,hello people   first of all i thorouhgly read faq and understood the ethos of this group  although most people dont question modern slavery it is refreshing to encounter  thinkers with thought provoking ideas  i worked so hard to keep this customer service agent role at swedish on line casino company under urkranian female boss who said they would train me and it was ok to not have any prior experience as customer service or game industry  i performed under stress of handling muptiple chats as a newbie i never took small breaks except for my lunch break   i was glued to my laptop 7 hours to show dilligence  and did everything or more than i could possibly do to learn new gig  all my efforts was all in vain  i was informed yesterday with vague reason how i dont seem to fit into this role  so they decided not to extend my contract as a permanent employee  there are endless supply of people who is willing to take this kind of role that pays under 40k and i understand that they want someone who can learn and be perfect in 1 month but i guess i didnt meet their unrealistic expectation  i feel that most jobs just pay you enough to live not to thrive but most of us have to take that option just to survive  thankfully i have a partner who is in top earning bracket so i dont have to worry about the basic necessities of life but i really wanted to make my own income so can spend on my hobbies which fulfill my life i am not that type to just live in complacency because you have a successful husband but at the same time i am tired of going in and out of revolving door of shitty jobs with ruthless bosses during the last several years  to elaborate i am an immigrant from asia i was earning 100 k in 2006 in a coporate world and i saved up money to come to study  ever since then i never recovered career wise even after completeting useless degree lol    additionally i dont seem to pass interviews on certain roles because of my accent  speculative but very plausible  a question  can you suggest what i should do with my life with all the time i have   i obviously will now have a lot of free time because i will be unemployed with monthly passive income of  800 i get from my property in asia i am childfree and 48   many would suggest  to  get some coding license etc but i dont know if that is one solution fits for all career path either  i thought of doing air b amp b with my own room once pandemic ends but that idea seems not the best with all the crime going on right now  thanks for listening to my aimless rant but i am just happy to have found this group,mij7vh

1669,what should i do?,tldr i dont want to work but if i have to i want to work stress free and for max 3 days a week what shouldcould i do  hi im probably not the first person to ask this here but i feel like this is the place where people understand what im going through i dont want to work but in order to have a house and eat i in a capitalist society i kinda have to and i mean im okay with working though for max 3 days a week but i cant seem to find something im okay with doing  so a little about me im in my midtwenties and i live in the eu so im sorry if i make some spelling errors i like making art and music sometimes i do a little photoshopping or video editing im not particularly specialized or highly skilled in anything and i dont have any carreer ambition and im pretty lazy which more people should openly be able to be imo but im a creative person who just likes to make or do whatever i want whenever i want  ive been unemployed for the past year which was really boring because of the pandemic and i had to move back to my parents i have a bachelors degree in media but i wasnt really a good student so im not really an academic i worked at a broadcasting station for a couple of months before the pandemic but the stressiness of the whole thing made me realize i dont want to do that lol so after a year of unemployment i finally got hired somewhere i knew it wouldnt nessessarily make me happy or anything but at least its something new so now i manage the social media for a nonprofit organization its not where my heart is or anything but at least its something i can do and where people actually wanted to hire me but now after some weeks working there i realized oh right i dont like work i dont like stress i dont like responsibilities i dont like dealing with people all the time i dont like working in an office although most of the time i work from home which im actually quite okay with and i definitely dont like working 5 days a week and i most definitely dont like being on all the time cause social media go on 247 if this is what the next 50 years of my life are going to look like im not sure if i can handle that  ive been dealing with depression and anxiety now and then but i find my stress levels shooting up when having to deal with work related responsibilities even in my dreams im anxious about my todos and dealing with people im not comfortable with lately im thinking of moving to another country like thats going to help but i feel like i could do better and try to be happy in one way or another  now i know how priviliged i am growing up in one of the worlds richest countries not really having to struggle through life but i kinda feel like i deserve to live stress free i also feel like i dont owe this society which i dont like anything sure ill work a couple of days a week to make money but the rest of my time i dont wanna think about work i wanna do my own little projects or read or watch series or get a dog and go on hikes with them or do nothing at all as long as its my choice  so my question basically is how can i make money in an ethical way stress free responsibility free not more than 3 days a week some place that doesnt hurt other people or animals is this a reachable goal within a capitalist society i just wanna exist in peace is that too much to ask  im sorry for the long text if you made it this far thanks for reading my concerns,mih1hi

1676,Removing pro work people from your life,i find that by removing all pro work people from my life i remove the pressure to constantly improve myself to get a better job in the future they are your average careerists that claim that capitalism is working just as intended i absolutely detest these people and even more so especially when they tell me to get a better job or climb the career ladder capitalism rewards hard work they say  like it is that simple it is an employers market and the game is rigged there is no 100 guarantee that i can even get a better job or even get a promotion there are so many other factors that determine a raise or promotion factors like being an introvert can literally diminish your chances at a promotion so why bother you are literally playing into the hands of the capitalist class if capitalism does indeed reward hard work the workers at places like amazon would be paid a livable wage,mihb63
1677,Work is for chumps,it takes up too mich time doesnt pay enough its not worth the effort or mental anguish if anyone asks me if its worth working the answer is no not ever i have been thoroughly convinced by our society that being homeless is preferable good job i have been utterly convinced that there is no difference between society and anarchy because what society is supposed to do it does not if it wants us all to work to live they have to give us jobs if they dont then its not voluntary and since working doesnt even guarantee comfort or even survival its not worth the time and effort   the results are the same so im not going to sell my labor anymore i can work and die or i can just die easy choice,mhre1s

1679,In absolute disbelief. Was I tricked?!,got laid off and lucky to find another job within two weeks started the new job on monday the new job was in my same field but a different sub field of what i normally do that i wasnt familiar with and they knew this from my first day something felt off my old office wasnt perfect but seemed amazing compared to this place the computers were practically falling apart on windows server 2008 and the software was probably 20 years old and made tasks that were simple at my old job nearly impossible to the point of frustration and anxiety my boss was training me and some things i totally understood but other things not so much i wasnt doing very well with her because i felt like she expected me to know everything despite it being my first week  i trained with my coworker yesterday and we did pretty good and she was very nice so i felt like we were getting somewhere my boss was pretty critical and never really gave any positive reinforcement whereas my coworker would when i did something right my boss was strange in the way that sometimes she was really nice and other times she was cold and not understanding today it got worse because she let me work on my own which i was starting to feel great and confident with and we were going to go over the accounts i worked i did some correctly but others incorrectly and i noticed i didnt get bad anxiety unless i was training with my boss it almost felt like i was being gaslit because no one except my coworker gave positive reinforcement to the point i started doubting my abilities and if i even knew my career to begin with it was that bad  today came to a head when she told me she can see im struggling and stressed out and said theres another job in the same department that would be much better for me which made me feel hopeful we tried training again but at that point i was so anxious i couldnt focus or retain anything and ended up in tears we sat in her office and talked and she was super kind and empathetic and told me she got it and if i wanted the other job i should go for it so i said yes which made me think she really liked me and believed in me because if she didnt she would have just let me go the other job was in a different department so she had to speak with the manager there   she comes out of her office sighing later i think oh maybe shes just stressed she says lets go talk to the other manager i get excited say ok cool we walk in and i get a weird feeling the other manager says i think youd be better fit for this type of position blah blah so me being naive i say oh you mean the position my boss told me about no youre fired but boss told me there was this job that would be great for me and that we would be able to do that well we already interviewed two candidates and theres an internal one were going to hire and they get preference shrug  at this point im basically shaking in tears grabbing my things to leave and absolutely stunned im having trouble figuring what happened my boss basically made it sound like i had the new job was this some kind of sick trick between the two of them or did my boss try to genuinely convince the other boss of my abilities and the other boss was just a bitch i was shocked because i was showing effort and trying really hard and it was my fourth day im not sure if their expectations were unrealistic but ive never ever had a job that i was fired for over this let alone fired at all im very angry and still having trouble making sense of the situation and what exactly happened because it appears i was fired for absolutely no reason if i showed up drunk to work id get it but i was on time every day and generally a good worker and got along with everyonesorry if this is a novel i just really felt like i would be heard here and wanted your guys perspectives,midgzf

1720,"15 minute breaks ""isn't fair"" according my management.",at my job there are 410 shifts and 58 shifts  i used to do the 58 but my team was forced to move to 410 because people werent coming into work and thought this shift would get more people to come in  i was annoyed because i had the opening shift and would get off at 130pm which gave me the entire afternoon to have a life and work on my hobbies  not only that but they gave us less than a week notice of the shift change so screw you if you had a second job or had a kid to pick up after work i guess  yes getting an extra day off is nice but i used to be able to work out cook healthy meals spend time on my hobbies and play video games with my friends all in one day and didnt have to deal with the rush hour traffic going home  i feel like my free time has been significantly cut because im too exhausted after the long shifts and theres less time to do anything    but thats not the worst of it  on the 58 shifts wed get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch  it used to be a 45 minute lunch but the trade off is we got to leave 15 minutes earlier so i was fine with it  when we moved to 410 we got three 10 minute breaks  the idea is both shifts should only get 30 minute of break time each day but 10 minutes is barely enough time to do anything and when youre doing a 10 hour shift of customer service at a call center you really need time to recharge  not only that but since both shifts are working 40 hours a week total and each day is only 30 minutes of break the 58 shift people are getting an extra 30 minutes of break per 40 hour work week that we arent  i figured getting two 15 minute breaks and a 10 minute break for the last one would be a reasonable compromise so i brought it up to management  she was surprisingly receptive and agreed that 10 minutes was too short for a break but then asked me if in exchange for the 15 minute breaks if wed be willing to stay an additional 10 minutes  um excuse me    apparently the reason for her question was to be fair to the people working 58s that only get 30 minutes of break during the day  despite our much longer shift getting more break time wouldnt be fair  i brought up that they get an extra 30 minutes of break per week that we dont and she said shed think about it  what is there to think about  you know and agree that 10 minute breaks isnt long enough  its an easy enough problem to fix  just fix it  when i was working 58s i just assumed people on the 410 shifts got three 15 minute breaks and i didnt feel like that was unfair  when i worked at other places that did 410s id get three 15 minutes  my friends who do 410s get 15 minute breaks but no apparently its not fair where i work,mhtktb
