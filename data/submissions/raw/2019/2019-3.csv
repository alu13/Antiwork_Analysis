0,Thoughts on Laziness,"It seems that most people think of laziness as a quality to be ashamed of, but I actually admire laziness quite a bit.  Here are my thoughts on the topic:

Laziness is fundamentally a person fully understanding and realizing their own desires, independent of how others attempt to shape or manipulate those desires (consciously or otherwise).  The lazy person gives priority to their own satisfaction, rather than the satisfaction of others – especially since the other's satisfaction is often only an illusion of satisfaction that forms around what is really just the realization of mutual suffering.  When you realize that your work doesn't actually make other people happy in any positive sense; that it only staves off disappointment or resentment in a negative sense; and that it is rooted in a joyless network of social exchanges in which anything that resembles generosity or freedom is appropriated and transmuted into something ugly and soulless: this is when laziness starts to kick in.

A lazy person constantly attempts to grasp the moment, rather than endlessly deferring the moment for a future that never actually arrives.  This is what work is, essentially: the positing of the present moment as a means to future ends. This is fine, except that we have let work stop being a means to an end.  These future ends ultimately exceed what is strictly necessary for life or well-being. The purpose of work becomes not the means to the end of subjectivity, but an endlessly recurring objectification of one's own life.  That first step of thinking of the future product of the labor of the present disconnects us from an immanent experience of life, an immanent connection with our very being, and turns us into a tool that exists *for* a life that never gets lived.  This is how civilizations fall into the trap of luxury; even after work fulfills the basic needs of life, we continue to work as if the essential way to experience life is through its objectification, through the endless production of objects that actually objectify *us* rather than satisfy us.  Laziness often comes with the realization that one's needs are in reality quite simple, and that the rewards of luxury are, at least to some degree, an illusion.  At a certain point luxury is no longer a means of present satisfaction, a means of *play*, but instead becomes a horizon that can never be reached, an end that requires the constant sacrifice of the moment. 

In some sense, the people who are the *best* at being lazy are the people who always see things in terms of the *ultimate* end, which is always *death*.  These people recognize the absurdity of meaning when that meaning is confronted by the truth (the non-meaning) of our mortality.  It is possible for us to grasp our own mortality and to *live*, moment to moment, in recognition of this truth.  This recognition leads us to reject the ultimate principles that people try to substitute for death.  All other principles, i.e. the principles which others pretend will anchor all of life's meaning, are in fact illusory.  They are myths that developed in order to subjugate people to a utility which itself is ultimately *arbitrary*.  When you die, it isn't going to matter that you worked hard and acquired property; nor is it going to matter that your life was *wasted* on laziness.  Death is an end to all such meanings, and this fact itself gives us a meaning of life as something of *immediate* value.  Life is best lived in constant confrontation with death, because death is what reveals life's true immediacy to us!  And it is in this immediacy that we find dissatisfaction with work.

Laziness can also be courageous, because it requires constant confrontation with feelings of guilt and shame that are imposed upon you.  It requires a profound *commitment* if one is to be happy with their laziness, and not get bogged down in anguish and regret.  Everything in our society is structured in such a way that nothing can be freely offered or accepted, and everything must be *exchanged*.  There is no real way to opt-out of this massive system of social exchange, as even one's refusal to participate wholeheartedly is interpreted as an offering and returned to you as spite, resentment, disappointment, pity, even jealousy.  When people notice that you are trying to act freely and independently, they immediately saddle you with all of their psychosocial baggage. Even if this is not the case, our very sense of *being* is rooted in this system from the moment we are born, and we can easily begin to chastise *ourselves* for our laziness.  It takes an admirable amount of courage, determination, self-confidence and presence of mind to truly be lazy without also feeling like shit (something I have yet to figure out, on my end – but I certainly aspire to it!).

Finally, laziness is not selfish, but actually opens up the possibility for the only genuine form of generosity.  When a lazy person *does* truly choose to act, without duress or manipulation, it is an action that can only be *freely given* to another, a sacrifice made with *full consciousness* of what is actually being sacrificed – the preciousness of the moment.  And in that chosen act, there is always an invitation to *share* that moment; not exchange it for some other form of social or cultural capital, not defer it for some future product, but to share it *immanently* and without any expectation of *return*.  And the most admirable lazy person, when they do happen to have other forms of capital at their disposal, they tend to *waste it*, generously and gloriously.  They do not exchange it for recognition, they do not hoard it for the sake of future utility, but instead they expend it with the sole purpose of forming *moments* of joy and play that can be *immanently shared*.

Bottom-line: don't be ashamed of your laziness.  Be proud, be free, find what matters to you, be generous and *grasp the moment*!       ",False,b6c5f1,DrinkyDrank,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/b6c5f1/thoughts_on_laziness/,13,90

5,New manager asking me to stay late already🙄,"So I’m under a new manager who, I stayed late to help out last week. This week, she’s asking me to stay late and help her do her job AGAIN. Normally I wouldn’t be this annoyed by it... but I had fucking plans today.
I’m supposed to be going to pick up my new bed and mattress set today which I was super excited for because my current mattress is on the floor (bed frame broke) and it’s caving in in the middle. It’s old. So was excited to get my bed as soon as I got off today. I was also planning on going to pick up a new sectional couch (I’m moving soon hence all the new furniture) because we got a really good deal on it. 

I lied and said I have a furniture delivery scheduled at 6:30 so I have to leave by 5;45-6:00 MAX. I wish I could say I feel bad for lying.. but I don’t. I already don’t even want to stay an extra 45 minutes to an hour late. If I didn’t make up that lie she would’ve asked me to stay past 7 most likely. I get here at 7 am btw. Plus, I have a blunt prerolled waiting in my car for when I get off. 

So annoying I busted my ass to get so much shit done today, and I planned to leave at 5, smoke my blunt, and go pick up my new furniture. But instead now I have to stay an hour late and probably won’t even get the couch today.

6,My rant about life and the current state of the work culture in this society,"When I was 4-5 for what I could remember, I didn´t know what school **ever** was, I stayed up all day watching Care Bears, Spiderman and biblical cartoons in my house all day and night, sometimes I would watch Cartoon Network and Later on, Adventure Time (Yes I watched AT when I was a little kid) and (un)suprisinly enough, when I was first going to school, my mother lied to me telling me that it was gonna be a candyland filled with chocolate streets and bubblegum trees (I´m not even joking) Guess what? I felt bam-fucking-boozled I actually cried. I´m not joking. Seriously, what the hell was in my mother´s head when she told me that? 

By then, I felt used to it. Going to school every day, and every day my mother fed me words; telling me to enjoy it, because when I was an adult, it would be worse. I tought it was bullshit, of course. Adult age ** M U S T** be better than this... I was wrong. Since I was 12, I know life in society sucked more than anything. So I decided to rant about my frustration fed by my anxiety and depression disorder, it must be me,  catastrophizing, about the world.


But I was wrong.


Why did I have to be born really? I realized that when I my brain concluded that there *was* something wrong with this. I wanted something, fantastical out of life, exciting, but no! We just work, study, and do that again everyday. Sure; there´s a saying in Brazil (probably invented by idiots that control the system) saying that a kid should only work and study. You know why? Because they want to fed us to the circle, workers that do nothing but produce profit to them, and I damn hate that. I am only 14, but as an escapism to this I want a different job; a game designer of ideas. I already have contact with a guy named Focusbit, helping me, so I hope it helps. 

I hope I do something more than sit in a desk in this life. Also fuck you Brazil for being obsessed with this ass-system!

7,I’m fucking tired of staying late,"Last week Monday and Tuesday I had to stay late. This week Monday and Tuesday.. I have to stay late. I’m fucking sick of this.

8,Coworker was fired based on her appearance,"Hi again everyone! I made a post a while back about my work at a high-end hair salon. 

Several ridiculous things have happened at my workplace since this post, including my boss asking me several times to ""come out of my shell"" and ""show more personality"", and to ""be more deferential to the clients"". I'm already very meek and polite towards the stylists and clients, which I assume is why he asked me to come out of my shell at work. I've tried to chat with the stylists and clients a few times, but they are usually dismissive or annoyed because I am a lowly peon that is there to clean up after their dogs and fetch them more iced tea. 

Today a receptionist was fired from the salon for ""not looking presentable enough"". There's only one receptionist working per shift, so I've only seen her a few times, but she is a clean-cut and pretty Asian girl and has worn jeans and a nice shirt every time I've seen her, which is the same thing I wear to work every day. She'd been working there six months. When I first heard that someone got fired, I assumed they didn't show up to work or had been stealing from the store or something like that. Nope, turns out lack of eyeliner or thrift store clothes can get you sacked just as quickly. I'm pretty sure I was only hired because I'm Adderall-skinny and look like a deer in headlights all the time because these people terrify me.

11,Thank you antiwork. I put in my 30 day notice to my employer....,"I guess perhaps I am antiwork lite. Instead of a big dramatic on the spot 'I quit!' or a standard 2 week notice, I gave a 30 day. I had told my boss that my life goal was not here in Louisville KY, I will be relocating, and to please not include me in long term goals. He asked that, (because of the time to place and train a replacement) I give a 30 day notice. I have been a salaried manager for a few years, I am frugal and have saved for 2 years to move to live a simpler life. My biggest hang up was the whole concept of ""no health insurance"" and "" not having a job already lined up"" before you quit the present one.

12,Time is money.,"That small sentence has been nagging at my brain since earlier today. Im some way its a sentence I understand but I dont understand all at the same time. This sentence has caused person to rush when they are running late, to worry, to measure their worth. Right now my time is literally worth $4US/hr. Does that mean that is all I am worth?

Shouldn't my time be worth more? It should be worth experiences, laughs, tears or something else that money cannot buy. If you water it all down I have to buy gas for my car with approximately 18 hours of my time.

This just reminds me of that movie In Time. When your time is done so is your money and so is your worth. Is this all we've become?

To think further, I was discussing the future of having AI and androids doing our work (not specifically mine because it's customer service) with some colleagues and their theory was that they would not have anything to do. In my eyes a future like that would eliminate this dread im presently feeling with regards to this time being money scenario.

13,Should I not extend my job ?,"Im 21, my job is ending this week and I work as a car maintanance guy/fixer-upper/electrician/you name it for old classic cars from 1920s Chevrolets to 1980's mercedes. Yes Its a good job sometimes and the money is really good - I get paid well and the boss sometimes gives me like half my paycheck on hand, has given me money plenty of times. Some would say im blessed to have this job, I could now extand for another 6 months like I have worked now and would even get a raise and pay would be very good. I am gratefull for the opportunity to work on these old cars but hey I've gone through it now, it know what it's like.

&amp;#x200B;

The downside is im miserable every single day, I somehow dred waking up every single day. Sunday's are the fucking worst. Sure im doing well off financialy but theres nothing left of my individuality, im depressed all the time and my mental health has gone down dramatically since I took this job. But to people who say I may be blessed to have this job should take his son for example, he also does the same line of work and we work together, but I can tell this job really  brings him down, he also mentioned leaving it all and fucking off several times in the past 6 months. The boss is just too annoying.  Yells for dumb reasons, for dumb shit all the fucking time and wants us to fix dumb shit on his cars all the time. Like installing led bulbs in a 1932 chevrolet to make the lights brighter. 

&amp;#x200B;

The boss is just too tough to deal with, and I hate dealing with him everyday. Look fixing these cars is cool and all but I know he can walk into the shop any single time he wants to either see what im doing or yell about something not being right even though it isn't my fault and can't do 50 things at once. 

&amp;#x200B;

pros: I saved about 3500 euros now and I bought a car im restoring for myself and maybe it would be nice to have all day to restore the car for myself, since the weather is nice and all and the rent to my parents is 100 euros a month I could last pretty long (even tho they would support me not working).

&amp;#x200B;

cons: My savings are decreasing and will take longer to save up like 15k to buy some land for myself in the countryside and start something of my own which is my goal.

18,Stoicism and Capitalism,"Now I'm actually a pretty big fan of stoicism, but I recently came across an article that discusses the potential downsides of stoicism. I thought the following passage to be particularly interesting.

&gt; It’s taken for granted these days that stoic values are simply superior: competitions are just pissing contests for the insecure; being anxiously engaged in proving yourself makes you a “try hard”; caring about what others think, being thin-skinned, is the mark of an inferior man who lacks real confidence. Is it possibly too convenient, though, that the values which are put down, which were once considered the heroic, warrior values in ancient times, happen to be the ones which make men dangerous and unsuited to the modern capitalist economy?

“In contemporary American culture, the ‘honorable’ person is ‘honest and true,’ someone who is above all consistent. He . . . is conscientious, predictable, stable, solid, four-square, a rock, a brick.” We need bricks to stolidly build society. We need men willing to keep their head down, accept their role, be completely unruffled by the ding-dong in the cubicle next to them. We need men who will choose to retreat into their inner citadel, who, rather than becoming completely unhinged by the banality of modern life, will constantly repeat incantations that the meaninglessness of modern work, the irritation of a daily commute, the loneliness of an empty apartment cannot ultimately harm them.

23,Writing an antiwork fiction novel.,"I'm not sure if anyone has ever done this before, but I feel it's about time someone tries.

&amp;#x200B;

(Summary incoming):  
The novel is called *Karōshi*. Baxton Keller, an English salesman, embarks on a business trip to Tokyo, Japan in an attempt to purchase a share of a popular grocery outlet. There, he meets Kieri Satō, a retail worker from the Ginza district. Because she was raised by wealthy American immigrants, the language barrier is a non-issue as Satō is incredibly fluent in English and has an international journalism degree. Problems *do* arise, however, when Keller develops feelings for the retail laborer, herself fully employed at a popular grocery outlet nearly 70 hours each week--where she's constantly harassed by her tyrannical boss--and forced to look after her sickly mother every Sunday (the one day she's available.) When Keller finally manages to get Satō available, she reveals the Japanese overwork pandemic (known as Karōshi) that's literally driving people to death. After Keller convinces Satō to quit her job, the two jumpstart an antiwork campaign that gains massive publicity and ultimately changes the way people work forever.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know much about economics, marketing, or anything politically related, but the novel is essentially a criticism of work (toil, specifically), capitalism, the 40 hour work week, the ""suffer-to-gain"" mentality, corporatism, and the ""no pain, no gain"" mentality while promoting healthy work habits and working to live rather than living to work. I'll keep you guys posted with short excerpts periodically.

24,"My job is making me fat, sick, and crazy","I started a desk job recently. The pay is really good. I shouldn't complain. But I'm going to. 

I have to spend most of my day at the office. I'm there from at least 9AM until usually 7PM every night. I have to keep track of my time. I have to stare at a screen with too many tabs open and too much information being thrown at me all the time. It's clouding my ability to think clearly. 

We have work-issued smart phones. This means that we need to be on-call 24/7. We can get an email on early Saturday and we've gotta be on it. I feel like I'm always on call. It's hurting me psychologically. 

I don't have time to exercise or the care to watch my diet anymore. I used to be in really good shape. I watched what I ate, I was lean, and I was pretty close to having a six-pack. Now I'm a fat piece of shit and I eat crap food that makes me feel bad all the time. I haven't sniffed a gym in months.

30,New manager.. yes.. the bitch from my screenshot that I posted yesterday.,"I posted here yesterday about how I was helping another region with their work and how the manager was being bitchy and passive aggressive because I didn’t stay extra late and do MORE work for them. Original screenshot:

And today the VP tells me they are merging the 2 regions and that lady (who is the lead of the other region) will now be who I report to. Guys. One of the saving graces about this job was my awesome manager. She is amazing. Super laid back, understanding, actually cares about us. She assured my region during lay offs that we would be safe, and we were. Meanwhile, 3 people in the other ladies region were laid off. 

I mentioned in my other post that I was helping them because they lost a temp who was filling in for someone who is on maternity leave. What I didn’t mention was that the temp who is leaving is the 2nd temp they’ve lost since the one girl went on maternity leave. So in a timespan of less than 2 months, they have gone through 3 temp employees under that ladies leadership. And no one is questioning it. The lady is controlling, and has too much alliance to this company for my comfort. I don’t really know what to do about it. 

The VP assured me that my job would stay the same, but I’m afraid the lady will try to dump her region on me and take mine for herself because it is less workload. I handle my region by myself, 3-4 people handle her region. The VP said if I have any issues to go to him. So I’m hoping if the lady tries any slick shit, he will back me up. I was very happy with how he handled it. It was his decision, he brought me in his office and talked to me about it before scheduling a meeting and telling everyone else, which I thought was nice. He also assured me and everyone else that he is not planning on downsizing and is looking to grow instead. So I’m not mad at that. He’s doing what he thinks is best for the company. Just sucks I got stuck under the controlling workaholic manager.

33,Just gave my boss my resignation notice.,"It feels like the end of an era for me, and I’m considering this post the final chapter in my personal r/antiwork trilogy. 

The first chapter, posted a couple months ago, saw me venting and breaking down the pay cut that my position had received at the beginning of the year.  Corporate had decided that my position was worth $8500-$9000 less than what they were previously paying me annually...  this was truly the inciting incident - Frodo cursed with bearing the One Ring to Rivendell with the wraiths in pursuit.

The second chapter, posted a couple days ago, was a meme that I created with the purpose to send to my boss... a snarky reply to the corporate demands that we work mandatory Saturdays back-to-back to make up for their “lost revenue”.  This was merely the latest brutal reminder that I was nothing but a cog in a cold uncaring machine.  My branch manager and I might have been on good, personable terms...but higher up the corporate tower was the all-seeing eye of Sauron...pure evil incarnate (*cough* capitalism).  The meme was my resistance, and it was followed up by a real life conversation between my branch manager and I.  I was able to tell him exactly how I felt - something I know not very many workers ever get the luxury of doing with their supervisors/bosses without fear of punishment.  Nothing else was really achieved except that I was “off the hook” for one of the mandated Saturdays this month as long as I was a team player this Saturday.

Which brings us to the final chapter. Today I got off the phone with my manager after letting him know that April 30th will be my last day.  I wish I could have had the conversation in person, but I left early for my route today well before he was even there and wouldn’t get back in time before he left.  But I finally did it.  After months of inner struggle, of shaky promises of a “promotion” and a massive pay cut, I finally did what I said to myself I would do for a long time - Within the fiery pits of Mount Doom, Frodo cast the One Ring from whence it came.  

I’m quitting and pursuing my teaching credentials.  Once I become a teacher, I will look into joining the teachers union, one of the last examples of where unionization is still going strong.

37,Had an argument with another supervisor because of someones name.,"I work in a call center as a quality analyst so im basically a supervisor and I just had a mini argument with another supervisor (lets call her Penny) regarding an agent. Apparently this agent (lets call her Kadi) was on a call and the member asked for her name and she told them but the customer wanted her full name, which she refused to provide. The customer got disgruntled and requested to speak with a supervisor. So Kadi goes up to Penny and tells her about the situation. 

Penny tells Kadi that shes not taking that call because its a stupid reason and that Kadi should just give up her last name. Kadi has a fairly unusual name that could be easily searched and she states that she is not comfortable doing so because she doesn't know who shes speaking to or what they would do. 

Me being the type of person I am goes to the defense of Kadi stating that we dont force members to give up their full names so why should she be forced to do the same. Penny then starts to argue with me saying that giving up her full name is nothing and that I shouldn't say that outloud because then the agents will start to feel that they can just do whatever and I wont mark them down. 

Why is it that the safety and comfort of employees does not matter to some? The customer is not always right. I know this seems like a small issue but to me there is a lot in a name and if im not willing to give that information to you a business shouldn't force me or anyone to. 

I dont think I can be a supervisor because of the type of person I am. ",False,b3hkum,bzrker94,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/b3hkum/had_an_argument_with_another_supervisor_because/,9,48
38,"A few times when I said “fuck this shit, I’m out.”","I thought it’d be fun to share a few of the times when I no call no showed or straight up walked out mid-shift. I know people in other subs would shit on me for this, but I know all of you completely understand how liberating it is to walk out on a job for the good of your mental health. I’d love to hear your stories down below! 

We’ll start with what I’ll call Taco Hell. I went back to this job at a different location a year after I first worked there because I wanted more income and couldn’t find a full time position anywhere. So I was working 2 jobs at the time. I’m going to be completely honest about the fact that I most definitely was trying to finagle my schedules to get the most convenient schedule I possibly could. Who wouldn’t? Morning retail shifts would guarantee I never had to be at work before 11 am, never had to close the store, and got to leave when it got the busiest. Afternoon fast food shifts meant I never had to open the store, or close because the drive thru was 24 hours. So anyways, I told taco hell that I was switching my retail job to mornings (which meant 11 am because that’s when they opened) and that I would be available for afternoon/dinner shifts at taco hell. They kept scheduling me for 6 am every morning. The manager also treated other employees better than me. He made me keep my phone locked in the office during my shift like a 5 year old while the other employees ran around with their phones out all day. He made me take my lip piercing out (and yes, it promptly closed right the fuck up during my shift. I tried putting it back in but it was too late). And on top of all this the customers were absolute shit heads. Someone got mad and walked out the door because I asked him if his order was dine in or carry about “before he was ready”... like? Anyways so I was spending the night at my friends apartment on a Friday night. I was scheduled for 6 am the next day. I brought all my clothes, fully intending to go, but when my alarm went off at 4 am, I changed my mind. Why was I getting up and being tired as hell for a fast food job making $8/hr? So I blocked the managers number and went the fuck back to sleep. Enjoyed the day with my friend instead. 

The second place, I’ll call Gods Chicken. I literally only applied at this place because my dad sent me the application. They were the only place that called me back. And I needed to pay my car note, so I took it. It was a brand new location that was opening. It was ok at first. I never liked the yuppie uniforms they made us wear. It felt dehumanizing. The store opened at 6 am, which means morning shifts were scheduled at 5 am. And guess what time they kept scheduling me? You already know. 5 am. I made up some bullshit excuse about my Crohn’s disease and asked them to start scheduling me in the afternoons. Instead they chose to cut mine and a few other employees hours. The people they promoted to shift leaders were nut jobs. The managers became condescending. And as usual, difficult customers. I had one person come up to the window and complain about me being rude and “misgendering” them because I couldn’t hear what they were saying. Evidently he was saying “it’s SIR” and I was hearing “it’s SARAH” lol. I was asking their name and said “ok ma’am” because I heard him say “it’s Sarah” and they took huge offense. My last straw was the day a manager instructed a shift leader to “just tell her to do it” when she noticed a bucket was left out and needed to be cleaned. It wasn’t mine. Like, if she noticed it, and it bothered her that much, clean it your fucking self? Then the manager condescendingly instructed me on how to rinse a bucket, then dismissed me by saying “you can go now” and kept talking to the shift leader about how “you have to tell them over and over”. After I heard that, I grabbed all my stuff, went to my car, wrote a note, which I’ll attach [***here***](https://imgur.com/gallery/qMCiALa) and stuck it to the front door with black lash glue. The shift leader tried coming up to my car when I was about to leave. I waited till she got to my window, and drove off. Managers were blowing up my phone while I was driving home. Never felt so good. Oh, and did I mention I walked out right during lunch rush, and i was the only food runner🤣 lmaooo sorry not sorry bitches.

Medical expenses? Phone bill? ANY semblance of ""leisure""? Guess I have to give all that up, too. Going to the doctor... what a wasteful luxury.

if their boss need them to do something, they do it immediately ( or almost immediately )

if their children need them to provide healthy food or their friends need their holiday cards, they don't do it or don't do it immediately.

They have a set of a value system in their mind that: the person who can give them wage is most important and they are very lack of caring and sympathy to other people.

One time they got fired, they want people to take care of themselves.

51,If I had everything to do over again...,"I'm just about to turn 30. I'm working in a job that I really don't think I have much of a future in.

The hours are also brutal and I'm on call 24/7, which is damaging my psychology. On top of that, I'm gaining weight rapidly and the stress has made me sick. 

I went to an elite grad school to get this job. Before that, I went to a respected liberal arts college and got extremely good grades. I was always so worried about grades that I didn't take time to enjoy myself. I felt bad all the time. I was incredibly nervous about pleasing authority figures all the time. It filled me with deep, deep anxiety that persists to this day. Now, I have a job (well-compensated) that makes me really anxious. 

If I had everything to do over again, I probably would have become a plumber or a carpenter. I would have picked a decent, honest job that would have left me more time to focus on friends, relationships, and family. I would have picked a job where I could look at my work-product and understood concretely that I was making someone's life a little better and fixing their problem. No one likes an overflowing sink or a running toilet! I think it would make me happy to get a nice ""thank you"" from an appreciative customer. And on top of that, I would have spent less time on work and had more autonomy and independence in my job. 

In this society we're living in, we've got messed up priorities. Honest work isn't valued. And working a lot is valued even though we live in a time of incredible abidance and we should be working 15 hour weeks.

I wanted to find an external factor. I changed jobs and was happy for a while but the old feeling again crept in. I stopped porn and drinking  for a while but these didn't help for long either. After a few more years of slogging against my will, I quit. Had to make sure that the problem was me and nothing else. Now I've sorted it all out - i now work only for money and anything I think I am passionate about I pursue part time. I think I still have a few interests.

80,It's been a rough week.," Last week, my boss called me into her office. The conversation began with, essentially, an accusation. She told me that she suspected that I had become disgruntled and dissatisfied and that I was intentionally underperforming.

Her reasoning was that over the last six months or so, she's removed some responsibilities for, basically, noncritical background processes off of my plate, and last week and the week before that, I had trouble getting some little ""other duties as assigned"" stuff complete on time, basically filing paperwork. At no point were any complaints about the quality of the actual work that I do mentioned.

A year ago in April, one of my colleagues got fired and I inherited her workload. I had a lot of responsibilities to a lot of people, who relied on me to get their work done. And over the last year, even as a few things have been taken off of my plate, the complexity and volume and expectations about how quickly I will complete my work have continually increased. 

I got a promotion and a raise, but the amount was disappointing and definitely not commensurate with the new and increasing expectations of me, so I went the office manager (who has really no way of appreciating what I do or how difficult it is) to discuss my compensation, and they told me that there's nothing they can do. I'm supporting more people, being forced to learn new systems and change the way I work, increase my value to the firm, etc., but this is just the baseline expectation. ""Stepping up"" (how one of the partners describes the ideal level of engagement from us in order to meet the goal of increasing revenue by 60 percent in four years) is the minimum acceptable level of effort.

So, all of this. Then my boss has the fucking nerve to, when she sees me burning out, put me in a position of defending myself, of basically fucking apologizing for being exhausted and stressed out?

""Oh, but you used to be so fun and talkative, now you just sit there with your headphones on and do your work."" Yeah, no shit. For starters, I can't be distracted because I have too much to do. Second of all, I'm sorry I don't strut around the office cawing about or how busy I am but actually sit down and do something about it. Also, I don't want to fucking listen to these consultants. They're a bunch of fat babies. A bunch of fucking 20-somethings right out of college, who spend most of their time talking about their exorbitant condos and vacations and cars, until it's time for their leisurely stroll out to buy lunch and bring it back and eat it in the breakroom.

I bring one fucking turkey sandwich every day. I've even decided to cut out chips and a drink to save money. And I eat at my desk, so I can get more work done. So, no, I don't want to be constantly reminded that people who don't work half as hard as me make so much more money than I do, that I am breaking my body and my mind to make their lives easier.

And my boss says ""oh, yeah, things are rough. I go home practically in tears every day."" Okay, so you are allowed to have a hard time for the last couple of months, but I'm not allowed to be overworked for a year and feel the effects of it? Fuck you. I used to respect this person and trust her, and now I don't. In one ten minute conversation, that was all completely obliterated.

The ultimate outcome of the conversation was that it's my problem, I need to find a way to fix this situation. With no support, no concessions, just grin and bear it some more, again. Fuck that.",False,b308sp,paraouji,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/b308sp/its_been_a_rough_week/,6,30

You use our products every day. Possibly even right now, as you read this post. They're famous for offering very, very generous benefits to their staff. I worked hard to get here, thinking it'd make my life better. I was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone around me seem brainwashed to absolutely love it. It feels like I joined a cult. They're super proud to having passed the company's rigorous interview process, they're happy to travel the world to visit other offices, they're absolutely delighted to recite the company's values on every coffee break etc.

**But what hurts most is having to pretend and put up a smiley-face for 40 hours a week.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I still find it excruciating to get out of bed every morning. I'm tired and depressed just from the thought of having to do my meaningless, bureaucratic, irrational duties, which relate to a product that brings no real benefit to the world. All this, for an evil corporation, that encourage us to consume more and more, by shoving ads in our faces - ads which tell us we're not good enough, unless we purchase &lt;insert product name&gt;.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a huge work load, not at all - on the contrary. But the silly bullshit tasks I get to do take me forever, because I'm so unmotivated and tired all the time. I procrastinate indefinitely. I get to my desk in the morning, and just space out. I space out during the infinite amount of meetings we have (somewhere between 2-5 meetings a day. No kidding). I replay entire movies in my head during team meetings.

&amp;#x200B;

I think quite a few of my coworkers aren't doing anything of significance at work either. I spoke to a colleague the other day about ""[Bullshit Jobs](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-bullshit-jobs)"" by David Graeber. That was the first time that a coworker dared to break the code of silence and admit to me: ""if I don't come to the office tomorrow, the next day and the year after that, nothing would happen and nobody would be affected"".

I'm 36 now, which means I've another 30 years of this bullshit ahead of me.

I don't think there's such thing as a job that would make me happy. At this point, **I just want to be left alone**, to listen to audiobooks, make art, read fanfic and play online games with friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

Someone left a positive comment on something I wrote online recently, and as soon as I read their compliments (while still at the office) - the fatigue of work disappeared altogether. It was so weird to suddenly realize that tiredness is not physiological at all. I produced something under my hands, and someone else enjoyed it! I had a tiny impact on this world! 

&amp;#x200B;

Isn't that what work is supposed to be about? What are we wasting our lives for in offices exactly? It's unclear to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of quitting and finding a part-time job, to reduce the amount of soul-crushing hours I burn under the fluorescent lights of an office. Alternatively, I saved up enough money to take some time off work and live frugally on my savings for at least 8-12 months. Both of these options are financially dangerous ones.

88,Stigma and discrimination regarding part-time work,"Why is there still so much social and cultural stigma around part-time work?

So many people 'complain' (but really they're bragging) about how busy they are, how they're over-worked, how stressed they feel.

Yet, when someone chooses to work part time (and we're free to choose, right?), that person is derided as lazy, a slacker. When all that person has done, is chosen to work less hours, and correspondingly get paid less. They're not slacking (since often, part-time workers work harder in the hours they're actually there). They're not getting paid more. They're not taking work away from someone else.  

Logically there is nothing unjust about such an arrangement. Yet part-time workers get so much hate and derision from colleagues and society as a whole. So they're paying less tax, but I've never heard anyone mention that. It's just ""uhh, lazy""

The only people who get a free pass in this regard are mothers of very young children (and only mothers, fathers get jack shit), and people with obvious, visible health issues. Or people working multiple part time jobs that add up to full time hours.

I'm a big fan of Bertrand Russel's ""In Praise of Idleness"". And, based on the current level of labour saving technology and automation, 25 hour working weeks should really be the standard, not the exception.

Personally, I can afford to be a part-timer; I'm a child-free, minimalist, anti-consumer. And my long-term life plan involves developing skills that would allow me to work 20 hours a week whilst still having plenty of money to stash away for the future.

But dealing with the stigma cannot be understated. I already deal with enough of that shit with my mental health. 

Being despised and derided by most of society is exhausting. There reaches a point when you just stop justifying, defending or explaining yourself to people anymore. It's easier to just close off and isolate. 

Modern work is destroying our health and relationships. Choosing to go part-time, if you can, is revolutionary in a small way.

106,Does anyone struggle with the 9-5/lateness?,"...Honestly it's ruined my life. And even typing it I feel like a fucking disgusting lowlife and a child. 

I got a fucking hernia repair surgery mistakenly thinking it would help just get through the morning routine - wake up, drink caffeine, take a dump, pee a million times (sorry) - it made things worse. It destroyed already bad stamina. 

That single thing - just, like, being able to pee in my own apartment and not put myself in a situation where I am trapped on a subway needing to pee like a racehorse (or something else) - has ruined my life. 

I'm three months post op and I sit in horror and disbelief with a fucking block of wood (sutures) in my guts, an internal cavity that feels like the inside of a grapefruit (so much for breathing normally - I wake up groggy, in pain, and semi-suffocating), amazed I have made another horrible, *horrible* life decision - like a fucking body-destroying decision, making things I struggled with *so much worse* -  for one reason, and one reason only - the lifelong failure to be a morning person. (I'm sorry to be gross, but - welp, it's the truth.)

I set my alarm clock for...6:35. Might only be conscious at 7. Drink coffee. Shovel food in. Floss, while lying down, trying to enjoy the middle ground when I can still do my routine without standing. 

I know how long it takes to jog to the each subway station.

But those one or two activities - basically trying to avoid a situation where I find myself needing to pee like a racehorse on a subway (or worse) and covering acne/squeezing my meat husk into work clothes and shoes - 

And the longer I am in a job - the more horrible it is. The more fucking impossible it seems to make 9am. (Not 9:05; God forbid, 9:10. 9:10 unless someone is dying gets fired.) 

Ideally in your desk, computer on, by...8:58. 

Can't do it. Amazed I was ever able to make 8:30am in the morning for *school*. It's enough to make me understand women that sit on the subway putting on mascara, risking poking their own eyeballs out.

 Because with each day of 9-10 hour days in a shitty office chair or in pain, it's so easy. It's so easy to fuck up and be late and physically be unable to get up and stay up, when you wake up in the morning with lower back pain, shoulder pain, and simply not wanting to get out of bed. Head throbbing, feet throbbing, lower back throbbing, limbs falling asleep. I find myself sitting out of breath and wanting to stretch out in bed again, the last stretch before I stuff myself into clothes. 

Sometimes, I'll admit it, I curl up back in a ball under the blankets putting on my bra and find myself browsing the internet again, because that's my hobby - lying down, and surfing the internet. This is when I have five to ten minutes of wiggle room - so I think. I squander them. I think to myself, I am so tired, I am so lonely - I panic, looking for *one last enjoyable thing to do*, and then I have to hustle and end up late anyway. I make it a gamble instead of something I can do at my leisure.

I fall asleep at 1am, it takes 2.5 to really *wake up*, for the caffeine to pass through. In hindsight....I dunno, how the fuck can someone have an adult life having to bomb themselves to sleep every night? 

What drugs might one take to get to sleep at 10-11pm?  

In my last contract job my boss barely tolerated me coming in at 10:15 and staying till 6:30 but fuck if I don't miss it horribly because she permitted it. I will never fucking have that again. It was in a big company and I could just sit quietly and listen to podcasts. I was left alone. It was still humiliating and awful and I know it makes me a bad, lazy person. That's how it's treated. I know the whole adult world...fuck it, has to endure 8am, 8:30am start times, from horrible commutes. 

I just can't imagine it. How is this normal? 

And then, having to endure that till 5 or 6, even if you don't take lunch...fuck me. What time is there for oneself, if you have to go to bed at 10-11? 

I have another temp job, starting at 9am. 

I am just...horrified and miserable. 

Fuck me, that I don't have the skills to work a 10am-6 schedule. I put myself on a path of being so low value - a serial temp - and the singular virtue expected of me is being on time. 

I can't imagine saying this anywhere but here - I've struggled with this my entire life, with morning stamina, and all those little unpredictables - the elevator, realizing you have misplaced your phone somehow in the last five minutes, a held up subway, pedestrian (or for you vehicular communters, traffic), the wait for a train - they ruin a life. They get you fired. I know that however long it says it takes in Google, you need, *at a minimum, another 15 minutes. 

And still - I have failed to do that. I have rarely ever been early for anything in my entire life and I realize now if I plan to be 10 minutes early, I need a fucking half hour jump, at least. 
 
If any of you relate, esp. those of you taking public transit I'm listening. 

90% of office jobs can be done from home and I think that's what makes this so much worse. There's no one I envy more than the remote employee. 

Those jobs are reserved for people actually pursued by employers.

From a very young age, well-meaning adults ask children, ""what do you want to be when you grow up?"" I doubt any child has ever responded, ""office drone!""

So when the vast majority of these kids grow up and get jobs that they aren't ~PaSsIoNaTe~ about, what happens? Identity crisis! Is this WHO I AM? AM I MY JOB? 
We need to tell children that their worth as human beings is not fundamentally tied to how they pay their bills. You can have interests, passions, hobbies, relationships, communities, etc. That you won't get paid for but that will be important to who you are. We should teach children to seek out and build community, but not for the sake of a line item on a resume. For it's own sake. Not everything in life has to be singularly focused toward JOB.

124,Let's put our pittance together and buy a ghost town already,"I posted a comment earlier this morning that started as a half-joke, and then led to me wondering \*why the hell not\*?!

I'm sick of putting in hours of work to make some already rich asshole even richer; of sacrificing my life, my relationships, my dreams, my happiness, my health, etc. etc. etc. only to get to the end of my life and wonder what it was all for. If I may, I'm going to assume you're sick of it, too. 

Our corporate overlords have done a fantastic job of ensuring none of us get out of this cycle on our own. I've done my part to obey the grind and I think I've done alright for myself compared to a lot of other wage slaves. My SO and I do run our own handyman and woodworking business, but he still works overnights for a corporate labor job and I work part-time for the benefits and ""security"" (handywork in Wisconsin falls dramatically during the winter). We've been able to save a little, and recently came into a modest inheritance. We're planning on buying a home, but our dream has always been to purchase land or a small town and sustain ourselves. That dream has always seemed like a far-off life, maybe even a fantasy. But I think of all the people out there who feel the same way I do, and I honestly believe that if enough of us can organize and put our skills and assets together, we can absolutely do this.

Like I said, my SO and I are woodworkers by trade, and he could build a house from the ground up given the time and materials. He's a great teacher, too. I worked in marketing for a while, and could probably organize a decent Kickstarter if I had the support.

&amp;#x200B;

There are tons of options here, but I'm gonna list three that stood out to me just to kick it off:

[Helper, Utah](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/6000-W-Spring-Canyon-Rd_Helper_UT_84526_M11094-44635?fbclid=IwAR3cDFq7fOndts6B68kfEYWDlwpWvKbT2KYZeWpNcnIuqObXQoJaqKaBdJQ) $199k - 154 acres

[Martin, South Dakota](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/29699-206th-Ave_Martin_SD_57551_M80335-24512?view=qv) $368k - 320 acres

[Cerro Gordo, California (Nevada?)](http://www.ghosttownforsale.com/)  $900k - 300 acres (My favorite, because it comes with an abandoned 22-room castle (appropriately named the Hard Luck Castle) + cabin + trailer, a wood and metal shop, a Cat 12, and is completely off-grid sustainable - solar and wind power sources. Here's a supplementary [article](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/blogs/historic-ghost-town-sale-california-old-west-spirit), but the info it provides is a little contradictory.)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway,  my SO and I have about $5-10k to work with - possibly a little more if we sell our assets. I know my mother has always talked about this kind of thing, too, and probably has about $10-20k herself. I don't know how loans might work differently as far as purchasing a town goes (I imagine it's more difficult), but assuming we'd need to put down 20% - that'd be about $40k  - 180k.

10 people with an average of  $4,000 a piece, or 20 people with an avg. of $9,000 to invest would get it done. It's certainly possible to fund something like this through GoFundMe or Kickstarter, but getting the visibility and support would take a lot of effort. 

Again, I'm likely oversimplifying and there's certainly a lot more to it - but I'm willing to learn and work towards it if I knew there were other like-minded people in it with me.

We are all suffering to keep a sistem alive which is infact killing us and those around us. Yet we think we need to keep doing it so we won't stand out too much, or in fear of what people might say. Yet those other people deep down hold the same values, they dislike their job too, but just keep it together enough to not show it or commit suicide. 

&amp;#x200B;

Where has all the beuty of the world gone? I know it's still here, but we don't see it enough in our lives. Be got tricked very badly.

So you are all that discomfort of holding a job and keeping it together, for what, for who? For a home that isn't even yours, for a car you can't afford?

Trapped in an unfulfilling, overworked and underpaid job, in which the company takes advantage of its employees, expects the world, and then wonders why things fall through the cracks when someone does 2-3 jobs. It is fucking bullshit. I feel myself trying to blame myself but I’m not going to buy it anymore.

159,"The fall of of sham biotech company Theranos, in the context of anti-work","I'm currently on a work trip to Silicon Valley, and the talk of the down is the [collapse of the sham biotech company Theranos](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/18/entertainment/the-inventor-theranos-review/index.html). Two different documentaries were released about it this story were released this week. 

&amp;#x200B;

The tl;dr is that the company, led by the charismatic Stanford dropout Elizabeth Holmes, promised a tech that would enable throwing \~200 blood tests from a tiny drop of blood, obtained by a fingerprick. No needles in your veins. Cheap, less scary and efficient. 

Trouble is, they couldn't actually deliver on that promise. It was just **not scientifically feasible to accomplish what they promised**, for multiple reasons. It's highly likely that it won't be in the future either. One reason quoted by pathologists is that fingertip blood is just not the same as blood from your veins, it's not a matter of improving their tech. 

  
The leadership of Theranos knew and refused to accept it. ""Fake it till you make it"" is considered to be the key to success in the tech industry, so they faked it.  


\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

**700-900 people worked there**, and many of them (including some who posted on other reddit subs) told of a culture that silenced criticism. Telling the truth marked them as negative, narrow minded etc. They were under pressure to show test results that met their CEO and founder's expectations, and if they didn't - they were to rerun the same test over and over again, and were guided to ignore the tests that proved the company's innovative equipment was wildly inaccurate.

&amp;#x200B;

When Holmes couldn't deliver, and the VC money was running out - she stroke a deal with Walgreens, a major pharmacy chain here, and they started to perform blood tests in stores using the malfunctioning Theranos equipment. Even worse, a large portion of the blood tests were secretly done on Siemens equipment instead. The Siemens lab tech required regular amounts of venous blood. The tiny blood drops Theranos collected weren't enough, so the **lab staff DILUTED THE BLOOD FROM PATIENTS WITH DISTILLED WATER**. This is considered to be a very bad practice. Many people got wrong lab test results and were misled about their health.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

All the while, the pretty, charismatic CEO and founder, Liz Holmes, was becoming a billionaire and a Silicon Valley celebrity. The press called her a genius and she was on multiple magazine covers. The Wall Street Journal was the first to expose the fact that their equipment can't do what they say it does, that they're using Siemens instead on their demos and in Walgreens, and that they're diluting blood and thus distorting test results. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to argue that **Theranos got caught because they were messing with people's health**. If it wasn't for the fact that they were giving people incorrect medical information, which forced the regulators to interfere and investigate, it could have lasted forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

When I read David Graeber's ""Bullshit Jobs"", I was amused by the story of a woman who worked for a inflight magazine, only to find out it didn't really exist. It was set up for tax scam purposes, and was never really issued. Now I think, well, at least she didn't falsely tell people their blood work shows they have cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

There are lots and lots of other companies in Silicon Valley that do nothing useful, and maybe even some harmful things. One company's self-driving car ran over a woman and killed her. Virgin Galactic's private space initiative caused one astronaut's death. Plenty of other companies just make another shitty phone app that makes people buy crap they don't need, or take advantage of underpaid migrants, in an employment loophole known as ""the gig economy"" (Uber for example).

&amp;#x200B;

Even in companies that really do useful things, there are many people who are tasked with doing nothing, manufacture paperwork nobody can read, writing emails and memos etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**The world would have been a better place if the 700-900 people employed in Theranos would have stayed home** for the decade the company was running, instead of working the crazy hours they did every day, trying to square the circle.

&amp;#x200B;

**APPROPRIATE** ""working"" and living activities for humans: walk, run, throw, shoot, climb, catch, handcraft and  parenting/nurturing in a group of relatives and friends.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**: The majority of all the jobs in the modern world are distant to human-appropriate activities, therefore the modern jobs cause suffering (because the brain will see it as **INAPPROPRIATE** when you stand in front of a machine in a factory hall, sitting hours long in office etc., even worse in nightshifts). And this suffering is leading to Alcohol, drug addiction, depression and suicide when you keep ignoring the uneasiness-signal. 

I would even claim that so many people aren't noticing the signal anymore. Their consciousness is lowered so severely that they will indeed still suffer but don't know the root cause of their uneasiness anymore, this omnipresent sting in the flesh. Going holidays and buying new things just mitigate the uneasiness a bit for a while but the effect is wearing off quickly and they find themselves again in the dismal situation going to work again with unhappy, pale and dead facial expression.

I asked him why that's a bad thing since it doesn't interfere with the work I do, but he was like ""blah blah it isn't! We just wish you were more extroverted!"" Like, I work with a computer, I'm not a talk show moderator. He then continued talking even more about me being quiet will make my life hard and even said I sit on my chair (""unmotivated"") is a thing I need to change.

I really don't get it. I couldn't defend myself since he talked so much and I just stopped listening. I have another meeting on Monday with him + another boss and I have no clue what to say when they bring this subject up again. My boss kept saying it's not criticism but his perspective on how he views me? I kinda feel manipulated and humilated since I've been an introvert forever, it felt like an attack on my personality.

206,A Good Way To Assess Worth?,"Some background: I recently had an appraisal that, well, could have gone better, but that's down to a multitude of issues within the department and my life right now.

However, I brought up again the idea of using metrics for assessing worker efficacy the way they do in my department. I work in an analytical lab, and the work we do involves running analyses on chemicals using various chemistry based methods.

The way the department gauges how well an analyst is doing is down to how many analytical runs they do a month, and how many fail to produce reportable results through a fuck up of their own doing, rather than because of, say, the equipment suffering a fault.

For instance, someone may do 50 analytical runs a month, and have 5 fail because they dun goofed, whereas someone else may have done only ten (perhaps they had other duties, were off most the month, or some other reason), but had 5 fail.

These are not weighted results, so someone who does fewer, possibly harder assays is not seen any different to someone who does multiple easier assays each day for the month.

My question is, do these metrics act as an objective way to assess the abilities of any one worker? Because of my experience, I tend to do more experimental and more demanding assays, and I also do more stuff that isn't related to doing this kind of work, thus meaning I may not have as many assays to do a month compared to a new recruit who is busy doing three super easy and repetitive assays each day.

TL;DR: Without further insight into the work done or weighting of metrics, I'm questioning the logic behind a simple pass/fail ratio for work assignments in an analytical lab and how this impacts work appraisals.",False,awzok7,AdmiralValdemar,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/awzok7/a_good_way_to_assess_worth/,4,3

208,Not sure about options. In chronic pain and the thought of working even part time makes me want to die,"I'll be 33 on Sunday, and back in late 2011 I had a total breakdown, during which I was diagnosed with bipolar I and had to leave my job as a greeter in a walmart-like store. I'd been getting treatment for arthritis and chronic migraines in the few years leading up to that, so while I was forced to move back in with my (abusive) mother, I tried to apply for disability in the hopes that it would get me anywhere. Between October of 2011 and May of 2018, I dealt with extreme paranoia, depression, mania, hallucinations, severe insomnia, anxiety, suicidal urges (including one hospitalization for having an actual plan to follow through), and new diagnoses of sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis, polycystic ovary syndrome (thanks to which, I had to have a 20x17x10 **CM** cyst on my ovary surgically removed), sleep apnea, and fibromyalgia.

Every time I tried to apply for disability and sent in an appeal, I was denied. The last time, the judge looked at the evidence provided in a testimony by my community mental health caseworker, who saw me once a week and had written records of me stating that I had been struggling with being suicidal for over a year straight -- a timeframe that included my hospitalization -- and completely dismissed her as an 'unreliable witness' in my appeal.

In 2017, I started attending college for the first time. I was barely able to attend even half time, or hold down the low-stress, 16 hr/week financial aid office job I had through the federal work study program. Literally, I would miss work or class at least twice a month because of panic attacks or physical illness.

Thankfully, I've moved away from my abusive and controlling mother, and in with my boyfriend and girlfriend. Girlfriend is autistic/adhd and has never had a job, but is also unmedicated and unable to concentrate on anything she's not currently hyperfocused on. Boyfriend has a full-time job that he generally enjoys with good coworkers, but he can't make enough for all three of us to make ends meet, long-term.

I want to help out in some possible way, but since I moved away last year, I've lost insurance (and medication with it) and my mental and physical health has degraded drastically, and now I've been severely depressed, suicidal, and paranoid nearly non-stop since October of 2018. I cannot concentrate on anything for longer than about 10-15 minutes, and sometimes my fibro fog is so severe I'm literally sitting on the toilet, staring at toilet paper, and completely unable to remember how to clean myself for a solid 5 minutes. Not only that, I don't have a vehicle of my own and cannot physically walk under my own power to the nearest bus stop to even begin looking around for a job, let alone be able to sit or stand in one place long enough to hold down even a part-time job.

Thinking about working makes me want to die. Thinking about living like I am, unable to do anything to even help out around the house without being in excruciating pain on a daily basis, makes me want to die. I used to write, even self-published a couple of short erotica stories once, but now I can't concentrate long enough to churn one out, let alone format it for publishing.

I'm trying to set up a gofundme to see a psychiatrist and get some medication to help with my bipolar in the hopes that will at least get me out of this constant suicidal funk. I don't know if it'll help, or if it does if it will help in time. I don't know what my options are for helping in a realistic way with bills or food -- the state of Texas says I need a doctor's note (which I can't afford to go see) stating I cannot work in order to qualify for food stamps for more than my initial 3-month period that I've already used up. And then they'll insist I apply for disability *again* in order to keep it.

After being denied so many times, I feel like it's pointless. Especially since SSDI states that I have to have ""earned"" so many ""work credits"" within the past decade in order to qualify for SSDI... which I definitely do not, because the f\*ckers kept denying me for so long! Which leaves me with SSI as my only option. And it's the worst option available because I can't get married or save up any kind of money or own too many 'valuable assets' (like a computer) or have even a $5 royalty come in from an old book being sold without the US government saying ""um, excuse me, you no longer qualify for SSI because you make too much money now""

My boyfriend's mom insists I should do this bullshit 'from home' job where people call my home phone and I provide some kind of support for something? idk she explained it badly and I zoned out to avoid a panic attack at the thought of talking on the phone and having the stress of dealing with a customer-facing job in my own home, in one of the few places I feel safe and secure, and *still* having to work on a schedule on top of that.

I don't know what I can do. I don't even know what my options are anymore. Even if I do apply for SSI, I have to find a way to get to a social security office to do so in person, because the online form is only good if you're also applying for SSDI at the same time, which I don't qualify for.

The only bad things were the 7 day per week schedule, the 8pm start time every night, leaky trash, the dog shit, the loneliness, the weather (hot, cold, and rain), and having to deal with it when residents would do retarded shit.

I had a long day and a rough night. it wasn't the first time I wanted to quit, but now it was different because I had another source of money. I realized I didn't  have to do anything I didn't  want to. It felt like the sense  of trepidation before jumping into cold water.

I have grown to realize that the only way out of this is either suicide, or to start my own business that will eventually generate enough passive income that I wont even have to work, or at least very little. My business idea cant be mentioned here but my partner and I believe it can become a multi million dollar company in the next 5 to 10 years. 

Anyhow, what this all brings me too is to mention this idea to you, fellow antiworkers. If and when I make it 'rich' I want nothing to do with my extra income besides this idea of mine. I would love to start my own universal basic income (UBI) . I am not sure about the specifics of how I will go about it, but essentially I want to find individuals who are like my current self. Who can no longer function in this backwards society, who truly need income. Personally if I could be receiving UBI right now, I know I would be contributing much more to society and be much more mentally stable. I would give my recipients ~2,500 a month. Only thing I would like in return would be personal accounts on how UBI has helped them.

-Jobs should not be allowed to ask you to find a replacement if you are sick. Especially if you go in at some insane hour like 4-5 am. Who the fuck do they expect to pick up my calls and agree to cover my shift at 4 am? 

-Jobs shouldn’t be allowed to penalize you or guilt you into coming in when they call you on your days off. You don’t owe them your free time. 

-NO employment should be “at-will”. Having a job is not “at will”. If it was, no one would have one. Because no one wants to have a job. We only want to get paid because we HAVE to to survive. This is an excuse that lets employers fire and abuse people and then escape the legal consequences.

228,i think my life is over,"just wanna share my story.

i dropped out of of hs back in 1999, never paid any fucking attention in school, never once did school work, I was a goof ball, just doing pranks and goofing off with classmates. things weren't so bad after i dropped out, i still visited my school during lunchtime to hang with my friends and i got to eat their lunch lol. they weren't really my friends tho, we hung out like 2-4times outside of school. i was the outcast in our social circle. my parents gave me tons of shit but i told em i'm studying to get my ged, never happen. when i turn 16, i got my first job.....shitttt story is too long. i will keep it short. when everyone else graduated hs, that's when isolation began. when they were off to college, we sorta kept in touch through myspace but it was mostly me, watching everyone else live a good experience. by early 20s, i started to feel very depressed. suicidal, it was knowing that i'm not gonna be anything more than what i am now, knowing that i couldn't develop a normal relationship. i felt how my entire life would turn out. i quit my job, my parents would yell at me every single day. my 20s was a major fucking waste and suffering. a lot of jobs on and off, moved in and out of my parents house, isolation, the only social interaction i got were from few dates i went on. mind u, im not a bad looking guy, it's the only thing that i had going for me and that kept me alive. when i started to enter 30s, shit started to hit the fan. i got tired of missing out life, i wanted what everyone else had but i knew it was far out of my reach. i'm turning 35 this year and i'm just feeling so sorry for myself. i went through most of my life in misery and in isolation. the excitement i had in my early 20s, chasing women, dreaming big that one day i'm going to live the life i want. it's all faded away, there's no hope or life left in me. i feel so fucking empty, i wake up feeling lonely and not knowing what to do. just not having anyone to talk to, no joy, and i felt this way for last 20yrs. 20yrs since highschool, things aren't the same anymore. i no longer look young, ppl who look like me have multiple kids, a family of their own. i'm just a deadbeat who hates his life, nobody will ever want to be with someone like me. women situation is getting worse too, girls used to not care as much. nobody sticks around cus i'm a loser in his mid 30s. i guess it's true what they say, women do prefer more stable men as they get older. i just know that i can't ever go back to work again but i don't want to continue my path like this. i think my life is over and it's pretty clear that there's nothing left for me. ppl do not change and by mid 30, it's clear that i am who i am. just a sad man. im not too worried about my parents, i have an older brother who's successful and a younger sister. i haven't talked to my siblings since the fall out. my dad has never really cared, he always yelled. only person who might deal with my death is my mom but she'll get over it. it's not like she likes me , spend time with me or call me. i don't feel scared at all, it seems like death is the most logical solution or path that i should take. nobody will remember or care anyway, the world will move on. im not saying i'm going to kill myself, i just wanted to share my story",False,azyz5u,brushman0,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/azyz5u/i_think_my_life_is_over/,33,28

231,"My take on hating your job, working for yourself, and finding something you enjoy","Every week I try to find a new subreddit and engage in a new conversation. Yesterday I came upon this one, linked somewhere in a retirement sub. I spent yesterday reading posts and talking to a few people to get an understanding of this sub. 

Maybe you care maybe you don't - but this sub is not healthy. That being said, **it's 100% okay to hate your job, or working in general.** However, it isn't normal to hate something, while simultaneously willing to do 0 things to help solve the actual problem. It seemed to me off the bat, this was a sub for people who really see the issue as Capitalism, which has its problems without a doubt, but I often find people blaming Capitalism when there's nobody else to blame, and when the system is ""wrong"" - you're internally absolved from any responsibility to attempt to fix something as big as our economic system.

I'm actually here to tell you, **Capitalism is your best friend here**. Capitalism is the only economic system where someone can work hard for 15 years, bank cash, and retire early and with enough money to enjoy your remaining years. There's enough cash out here for everyone, you've just gotta find something you enjoy doing. I'm **not** talking about FIRE - FIRE is the PF of retirement, it's easy to retire early when you made 250k for a decade, that isn't quality advice for middle class people. 

In December of 2017, I committed the cardinal sin and took a ""management"" job for the money (a huge salary for working in West Virginia). I fucking hated it - it was an immoral company, my employees weren't making shit, and we routinely scammed our patients (yeah it was a medical company on top of everything). I decided I would NEVER do this job the way they wanted me to. So I said fuck it and quit - internally. I worked at that job for \~5-6 months while doing absolutely nothing. I refused to overcharge for procedures, put customers on pay plans that had interest, and basically came in, turned the lights on, sat there, turned them off and went home. During those months, I started my own LLC and started selling video games at the flea market/Facebook/eBay. I'd buy them in bulk, break them down and sell them individually. 

Around June 2018 I finally was ready to leave my job - and sell games full time. I simply got up one day at work, took my key off my ring and gave it to my colleague and just walked out. I ended up taking the job I have now (on top of selling games) because a mentor and friend wanted me to join his firm, otherwise i'd be selling games at the flea market for a living - but that job made me realize exactly why people hate work, so I completely understand. 

The point i'm trying to make is, if you hate your 9-5 you can absolutely do something about it. If you don't like your job - make one up if you have to. Happiness is important in life, don't give up half your adult life to someone or some company that you hate. But it's gotta start with you - if you don't commit to making the change, nobody will do it for you.

287,Crying fit for the 7th time since Monday. I want to quit but I cant.,"**Background:** 
* Got a new job 3months ago (won't disclose nature of the job).
* New job is nice paying and home-based.
* I don't like home-based, I accepted it because they said 30% of my responsibilities would be on fieldwork and again, they pay well.
* Organization is pretty lean, I report to ta certain Department Manager but other managers can tell me to do things.
* I need this job because I pay rent and bills. Savings is very little vs expenses at home (living with parents and my salary is higher )


**Situation when I joined:**

* Immediate Manager is good and friendly, let's call him Bob. We have another manager that I don't like, his level is higher than my boss and since org is lean, it shows that my manager kinda reports to him too, let's call him Fred. 

So Fred is a manager I won't ever like, he's micromanaging everything I do and worsens the process my job needs to follow. He wants to add steps in the process that ""expedites everything"" but it really drains me out. Because of all his bullshits, I work on average of 13hours just to satisfy his needs. Now, Bob is useless in this, he says yes to all the shits Fred wants to happen when it's freaking obvious it's the reason why I can't do my job properly. I have raised my concerns but they say that I don't get the process at all and I should learn it. I'm now being labeled as useless because of this. They make me feel like I've done nothing and is a very disappointing employee.


I really want to quit but I need the money and I don't want to have a 3-month stint in my resume. I just want to cry and cry because I don't know what to do. Should I start looking for a new job? Should I disclose I'm just new to this company?

I hate my job. I hate my career. I just want to get up and walk out most days, but I can't. I have to pay bills, I have to pay the rent, I have to do all sort of shit. I'm just sick of it.

I work as an engineer at a small company and lately they've been pressuring me to work more, making snide comments about ""work ethic"" when I get up and leave at 5, talk about ""things that need to get done sometimes require you work late"". I'm sick of it. I'm fucking sick of it. Sorry, but I have a clear line in the fucking sand. This is just what I do to pay the bills, fuck off.

And I don't even care about the work. I have 0 fucking interest in it. I never cared about engineering. Never, not once. The only way I got through college was constantly being drunk and high. It was a fucking miserable experience and it only get worse. Why would anyone want to do this?

And now. And NOW I have to get my PE license. They won't stop pestering me about it. I don't fucking want a PE license, I don't even want to be doing any of this. More responsibility? More Work? Are you fucking kidding me? Take that shit and shove it.

Last week we had a project that literally had only been worked on for a few days and was suddenly due 100% on that Friday and on that Monday my boss say me down in her office for a little chat ""Sometimes, being an engineer means working more than 40 hours."" Fucking why? I don't make these deadlines. Why is it more than 40 hours a week? 40 hours is already too much. You think I give a fuck about making these deadlines? I worked nearly 60 hours that week. By the time I left on Friday I couldn't even see straight. 

And just last week I came home sick because I got a passive aggressive e-mail about accurately tracking my time down to 10 minute intervals. Are you fucking kidding me? FUCK OFF. Why did I get that e-mail? Because I mentioned to the secretary that I was going to have to start leaving work 15 minutes early so that I could get to my class that I have to take to prep for the PE exam. You know what she said ""You still have to work 40 hours."" I don't fucking care about the time. I'm not sitting here writing down what I'm doing every fucking 10 minutes. I'm sorry, I'm not. Fuck that.

The only good thing about this career, this industry, whatever, is the pay. That's it. That's all. There is nothing intrinsically satisfying about it. There's nothing interesting. There's nothing fun. FUCK ENGINEERING

Jesus Christ. I am just so fucking pissed. I am so fucking tired. I've been working since I was 16. I always ALWAYS keep doing what people keep telling me to do and I don't even fucking get why. I'm miserable all the god damn time. I'm tired all the god damn time. I'm not even depressed, I'm just fucking mad.

Is it unethical to do nothing at all?

319,I don't know how long I can keep this up,"This is my second week of my new job and today work ran long. I didnt get quite enough sleep the previous night because I will never be able to consistently go to sleep on time for the life of me so when I got back today I didnt feel like doing shit but playing a bit of video games in the little bit of time I had left before I had to do my laundry and pack food for tomorrow in order to get to bed in time to do it all again tomorrow.

Currently the chemicals in my brain are allowing me to have the motivation to keep going but somehow tonight I feel like it is going to run out soon and the depression will take hold again.

This job is better than my last at least. I get paid pretty well for an entry level full time job and dont get treated like shit, but it's still a job. It still eats up a disgusting amount of time. And I'm not looking forward to the 150F attics come summer. Once the flip switches in my brain it's over. Everything becomes unbearable and I can't see a worthwhile positive in anything again.

325,How to survive working when you hate work,"I thought I was alone in this world hating the concept of work, but this sub had helped me realize it actually is a stupid system and I'm not just a lazy piece of shit...

For that I want to thank you, and as such I want to share some advice that has helped me cope with the 'sell your time to live' BS.

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** **DO NOT GIVE A FUCK**

The most important rule of them all. You may be tempted to give it your all or 'go above and beyond' as they all encourage you to. DON'T.

They don't pay you enough to deserve your best. You go to work and you give the least effort you can without getting fired. Like that preggo teen who's always on her phone, hasn't shown up for work half the time and is still somehow employed. Be better than her and show up at least, but don't give them any more than needed.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Smile and nod**

This one saved my ass plenty of times. Annoying coworker who wont shut up? Smile and nod, move on. Boss wants you to work faster? Okay. Smile and nod. Customer is bitching at you? Smile. And. Nod.

Fake it, who cares, you're paid by the hour and as long as you're not getting disciplined you're golden. Let them think you're an absolute moron even if you're the smartest ass around. The lower their expectations of you are the less effort you have to put in.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Don't go for the promotion**

If somehow you still did well enough by sticking around long enough to be offered a promotion, DON'T TAKE IT.

The higher you move up, the more shit you get. It's hard to believe, especially closer to the bottom - but trust me, the higher money number is not worth it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Test the waters**

How much shit can you get away with? Only one way to find out!

If you haven't been coached yet, you're doing too much work. Most places will give you a warning for performance before ditching you, so tread the line and see how much you can get away with. This way I ended up taking 3x as many breaks as I was supposed to at one job and *still* left as a 'definite rehire'.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Know what you're worth and exaggerate**

Bad shit happens and you're back on the market for a job? No problem. Put on your confident face, brush up your resume and fill in employment gaps by expanding jobs you had before. Few will call references, it's all a fucking dance and all you gotta do is get an interview somehow. Once you're in just pretend you're gonna be that person that always Goes Above and Beyond**™**, and you likely got the job. When you do, move on to step 1.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this helped at least some of you a bit. Hang in there guys - we may be forced to do this shit but it doesn't mean we're gonna have to like it. Might as well give them as little back as possible.",False,azaga6,CantStopTheBat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/azaga6/how_to_survive_working_when_you_hate_work/,33,109

342,"Hi, new here. I hate my job and I always thought something was wrong with me bc I didn’t want to work 40+ hours a week. Maybe it’ll set you free too?","I’m in my 20’s and in college full time. I also have a full time job. My major was nursing but once I realized the absolute shit they receive every day from a big admin, patients/patient families, and other burnt out nurses I was completely over it. I also left major due to not being paid enough for hard work, emotionally stressing, it is gross, Blah blah etc. etc. I was scared every job was like this. So I did my research online and went to talk to multiple people about their jobs as well as look at my own experiences. 

I do not care about work performance. I do not need to be appreciated at my job. The only thing I care about is how this 40+ hr a week shit affected the rest of my life. Some people say they would rather work 3-4 days a week for 12 hrs a day rather than 9-5 M-F.   This is what I have found from working 9-5 vs 12s: These jobs were very similar and paid the same as well. Only difference was the hours and salary vs hourly. 

9-5: salary 
felt like my entire life at first. I got off Sat &amp; Sun which was great bc everyone else was off. I got off holidays. I felt like I had more freedom in my job bc I was salary... we get off early Fridays? That’s fine with me I get paid salary. It didn’t feel like a money game as much as 12s to me. It was easier to make habits working 9-5 every day. I felt like I could go to gym in the morning and be off by 5 and have dinner with a date or go to bed early. I didn’t get any extra pay for staying late or getting there early so I found myself not doing it, which lead to me being passed up for promotions... like I said I don’t care about work performance but I do care about how it affects me outside of work... meaning I care about income. 

12 hour shifts: hourly 
I worked MW,FSS one week and WT the next. I worked 8:30am-8:30pm. 
I was able to be productive on my days on but my days off I was so damn exhausted that I slept all day. By the time my weekend to work came around I had come up with every pep talk in the book just to get myself to show up. I always did, but it took everything out of me. They say 12 hours but you have to show up earlier and leave later, BUT i got paid for it. All the shit was closed by the time I got off. I then had to do all my errands in a few days when I wanted to do nothing but sleep. I couldn’t set habits bc as soon as I would get in the groove of working my time would be up and then I get used to being at home and then I had to head back. I hated it. Working all weekend SUCKS! I missed out on so much, which is saying a lot for a introverted person like me. I could control my income a bit more and pick up extra shifts if I needed them but I always found myself very very willing to give them up. 

Conclusion:All in all I would take 9-5 and have those weekends off! 

Bigger lesson: i was making 45K in average COL and spending all of it. I paid off all debt first. Then i lived in a 1BR Luxury apt., went out to eat steaks or whatever whenever I damn well pleased and donated to charity or family who needed it (now that one I don’t regret). I also bought a new car, nothing ridiculous just a nice Camry. I wanted it, I got it, bc I could. I just bought these things bc I thought it was what people did and bc I was so miserable at my job I had to have some type of happiness. But my true happiness came from not working like a slave. People asked me how I afforded to do whatever I wanted  and why I offered to pay for their meals if they couldn’t afford it or whatever the hell was the case... and I said well I paid off debt. I realized I was so much more financially able bc I had no debt. Now I’m working on this new thing. Retiring early. 
Then I discovered this is an actual thing called FIRE. Financial independence (debt free) retire early. I had hiccups along the road but I’m well on my way now. I encourage you all to read about it.

359,Fed up with contradictory expectations,"After a few months of burning through my savings looking for a job after taking a semester off from college for mental health reasons, I've managed to find a part-time job as a receptionist at an upscale hair salon. 

I was hired almost entirely based on my looks, as receptionists are the ""face"" of the salon. During training I was presented with several expectations that directly contradict one another. 

-	Always have makeup and hair perfectly done, but never leave the front desk to reapply makeup or fix your hair. 
-	Wear the nicest clothes possible, must be clean at all times. Work directly with hair dye every day with no apron. I will have to buy clothes for work out of my next paycheck because almost none of what I have now is considered presentable for work. 
-	Be at the front desk 99% of the time to check clients in and out. However, all other work (washing dishes, laundry, etc.) that needs to be done is in the back room. I am expected to never be idle at the front desk, but at the same time all work there is to be done is in the back. 
-	Closing up should never take more than 30 minutes after locking the front door. Doing all the tasks required to close as quickly as possible takes around an hour. 
-	On a busy day it is tacitly expected that I won't take a lunch break of more than a few minutes, even if I work a double shift (8:30am-8pm). On a normal shift breaks of a few minutes are okay, on a busy day it is heavily frowned upon to take any breaks, even to use the bathroom. 
-	Never be seen on my phone, leave it in the back at all times on a shift. Must answer texts and calls from the owner promptly. 

I have a fainting condition that prevents me from standing for extended periods, and this is the first job I've been able to find in months that allows me to sit down when I need to. My paycheck at the end of the month won't even cover my rent.

370,Suddenly I find myself on the other side the unemployment thirst," I too was once highly desperate for any work and now I have a job. I  don't agree with the company's (neoliberal) values of entrepreneurship  and stuff, but at least its an income in this viciously capitalist  society.   


Now I am not even regularized yet and my boss has  delegated to me the hiring of more project based workers. The emails and  applications coming in are eerily familiar, a mirror to when I too was  an overqualified applicant rushing in to any job opening I can find.  While unemployed multiple times after graduation, I notice some tricks  and traps that immediately screen out a bulk of applications; little  things like not attaching sample works or wrong email subject.   


Suddenly  from a paradoxical position of power — being not-yet-regularized and  yet accepting job applications myself — and seeing my past unemployed  self in these desperate applicants, I'll overlook little mistakes  because that could be me too. But it still makes me sad. These people  are overqualified. One applicant said such BS that she ""dreams"" to be  part of this part-time job. I've been there making that BS fam. I cannot  blame you for writing this, and I wish I'd take you all, but I can't.  We're all competing for scraps the capitalist system taunts us with.  


I  see the desperation in-between the lines and that was me once — and  probably still is, since I am not regularized. I have no illusions; this  open call could be the auditions for the position I am sitting right  now. But on some level, I don't care. I don't want to compete with these  people to keep my position. I just want a decent life. And I am sure  that is these applicants was as well. Capitalism atomizes us, turning  use each into readily replaceable gears.   


I don't want to be a gear. I don't want these people to be gears. There is no happy ending to this post.  ",False,b0wxhw,TheIenzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/b0wxhw/suddenly_i_find_myself_on_the_other_side_the/,45,206
371,Heavy work days and relationships : somethings gotta give,"So- I live with my boyfriend and this is how his life is organized.  

10-12hrs:work and work related activity (driving, dressing,etc) 
1-2 hrs: exercise. 
2 hrs: tv time  
 
Those are his 14 waking hours.  
He is miserable, I can tell, and he’s not afraid to vocalize it. But he feels obligated to his job, he has a boss there that has been really kind to him, and he feels like he hast to work long hours. My boyfriend is really meek and has trouble thinking for himself and understanding that this is a job- and his boss is a boss not a friend. Recently he says he doesn’t get enough alone time so rather than cut back the amount of hours he works he suggests that we spend less time together.  
 
I find this sort of laughable, because during the aforementioned tv time, we spend about 20 minutes talking about our days. Other than that we sit silently in front of the tv. Usually I draw or something I just like to be in the same room as him. So I assume the only thing I can really do for him is simply leave the room and go to a different room so he feels truly alone. 

He’s always grumpy and can hardly talk about anything that requires real thought. I feel like it’s awfully sad to let a relationship, something you once found joy in- be the first thing on the chopping block so that you can better accommodate your insane job.

I could give a shit if the world just decided to stop. I feel embarrassed to know that I dont buy into the company mentality and the idea of working everyday and rearing children. Im embarrassed to let people know that I dont think people should be spending 21 days out of a month working towards nothing. Im embarrassed to tell people that its absurd that they spend more times cooped up in an office than they do with their families. When i think about I spend about 4 hours a day (awake) with family. 

Im embarrassed to say that I dont see what other people see in todays society and that the only thing I truly understand is art because it makes people happy.

In all seriousness though, people do take all jobs wayyyy too seriously. The only jobs where timelines really is important is like... doctors, surgeons, pilots, you know.. urgent jobs. 

Stop berating and penalizing fast food, restaurant, and retail workers for being a couple minutes late. And stop forcing corporate culture on everyone. No, we don’t need to be friends with everyone. I don’t need to be friends with ANYONE if I don’t want to. No, I don’t need to be excited about being here.

No, employers should NOT be allowed to drug test employees, or potential employees, unless there is probable cause that they are high on the job. Employers should have NO access to your social media accounts or history. Why do we allow them to be so invasive?

It's like they think ""that's how you do a startup"" but to me it looks like they're play-acting and don't have any original ideas.

Then again, these days the road to sudden wealth IS to play-act a startup just long enough to get venture capital money, IPO money or bought out for millions by a bigger company.  So maybe they know exactly what they're doing.

I recently graduated college and started working in the auto industry (June last year). The culture in many parts of this company and all the other auto companies so very toxic. From day 1 so many employees just tear into people who don't drive our companie's cars. They honestly act as if my 10 year old Japanese car is actively draining sales from our company. 

I work here, they pay me, transaction over. I'm not at all obligated to purchase their products. If this was like Ticonderoga and it was a couple dollar product then I would ablige, but cars are often 30k +. If I wanted to buy a new car and I found a better deal or even just preferred a competitor car that should be fine. I personally wouldn't ever buy a new car because it's a horrible investment. 

What's worse is that they will often guilt trip the hell out of new college grads who are still heavily in debt. Telling people who barely take home any money after their debt payments each month to buy cars is rude and horrible financial advice.
