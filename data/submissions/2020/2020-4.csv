4,My manager edits every task I do,"Okay so I got my first full-time job in comms 4 months ago, and my manager has been editing every single task I’ve been doing so far. The edits are usually not even improvements I think, but a different way of putting things. Is this sth all managers do when hiring a junior? It really demotivates me and makes me feel like whatever I do is not good enough and needs to be changed.

5,Questionable decisions,"We're all stuck at home and the company that I work for forced us to use up our vacation hours before june 8th. Why? They didn't say. The vp said in a video-conference that they deemed their decision fair and equitable, which is, in my opinion, exactly what someone who made an unfair and inequitable decision would say.

My guess is that a lot of people are paid without doing their usual workload (like me) which means that they're probably just being paid for wasting time, so my company had the absolute genius idea to force everyone to take their vacation now instead of in the summer when they would have normally taken them. 

How are we supposed to take our minds off work when we have all been working from home and we're stuck at home? How is it relaxing that our reality literally won't change at all when we do go on vacation? How do you expect people to enjoy their vacation in a time where they can't leave their house? You know your employees won't be able to enjoy themselves and you don't care. All you care about is making money and you're losing more than you're gaining at the moment which makes you take dumb and selfish decisions like this one. 

But should I be grateful to still have a job? Should I be grateful that I get to do my coworker's job because she's on vacation even though it was completely unplanned and I'm untrained and unprepared for it? I never asked for this.

7,Linkedin is garbage &amp; I'm paying for this,"Debating on deleting my paid subscription for LinkedIn. I really don't know if it's worth it. 

Before the pandemic, it was OK. I mostly used it as a tool to see what's going on within the industry. But now it's nothing but an ass-licking contest and it makes me sick. I understand this has been talked about on reddit already, but I really need to blow off this steam as well.

It's almost as if... you're a lazy POS during COVID if you don't start learning at least 1 language, write a book, take a class, and post about it, too. Not to mention all of these shitty graphics like ""LEADERS NEVER STOP LEARNING"".

Makes me sick. And I'm making myself sick. Look at me, touting other people for learning and bettering themselves. I LOVE to learn. I loved it, even more, when I was younger. I was so excited about science, engineering, space, meteorology. We shouldn't be down on people who are bettering themselves.

  
But, is this really ""bettering yourself""? I feel like it isn't. It's a LOOK-AT-ME fest. It's a factory line. Are they really learning because they want to or are you posting about reading a book and taking a radio frequency online class because your connected with the CEO and want him to see? Or connected to other upper management and feel like you want to one-up them?

&amp;#x200B;

It's almost like I'm a total piece of shit for not doing this garbage. Part of me is depressed and the little girl is me is like ""What are you doing?"", but this isn't for goodness or good intentions or returns anymore.

My pandemic has been full of writing and playing Skyrim. In a work of capitalism and watered down returns in the jobs of today, it's not worth going out of my way to lick the soles off of a boot right now. I'll get nothing in return.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, I can lie and said I did something during COVID and make a similar claim of something TOTALLY IMPRESSIVE that I did.

21,What I hate about non-remote work: Physical and mental discomfort,"Just a pointless rant from me. I don't know about you guys but what I hate and absolutely despise the most when it comes to conventional, full time non-remote jobs is the horrible discomfort that comes with spending 8 hours a day in a place that isn't even designed for this purpose to begin with:

1. You can't grab a normal, full meal for breakfast and dinner in most of the workplaces - you're forced to eat cold and/or unhealthy snacks that only fill you up for a moment. I always end up with chronic upset stomach after a few weeks of working non remote. And all of these starchy snacks give me bad breath. Add coffee to the mix and I end up with zombie breath. Oh, did I mention the normalization of caffeine intake? Turn your life into an anxious depressed mess with daily coffee or energy drinks because otherwise you will drop from sleep deprivation!
2. Depending on what kind of person you are and what job you have, you might have to carry a shit ton of stuff every day with you. I need a fresh t-shirt because I sweat so fast, lots of food and water, laptop, mouse, cables, chargers, a coat (because its freezing in the morning and hot in the afternoon...), some hygiene products (I'm a woman). This all adds up to several kilograms of shit I have to carry. My back is ruined because of this even though I use only backpacks.
3. Toilet anxiety - nuff said, some people unfortunately including me have a very hard time using toilets anywhere else besides your apartment.
4. Being forced to stand for whole day - bless every poor person that has to do it. My first jobs were all retail and we weren't allowed to sit down besides the 15 minutes of break we got every day. Ruined back and physical fatigue in the name of what? Selling goddamn food and clothes? Which client cares about your posture?
5. Being forced to speak to unpleasant people - this is turbo anxiety inducing for me. Being required to nag customers in retail is another level of awful. These people dont want to speak to you most of the time and they want to run away from you, so both parties involved in this mess are uncomfortable, but the manager will insist you ask everyone what they're looking for and nag them with product suggestions because YoU nEeD tO iNcReAsE sAlEs. NOBODY wants retail workers harrassing and nagging them, and yet we as a society still insist on making people do it. And let's not even mention being forced to talk to unpleasant managers and coworkers.
6. Lack of proper sleep - unless you go to sleep at 9 pm (and thus never get any time for personal life/hobbies), you will be sleep deprived. I feel like the society will never stop forcing people to wake up at ungodly hours in the name of some absurd shit that doesnt even matter. In other words: We don't have free time. We only have work and time spent on either recovering from or preparing for work. This is absolutely fucked up

26,4 Days Left Until I Return to Slavery,"Our president announced that some (most) industries will be allowed to operate after the 1st of May. We've been on lockdown for just over a month.  


I've been working from home despite not receiving payment from our company and will apparently receive payment from an unemployment fund from the government. I've been interrupted on weekends and public holidays to cancel invoices and add items to catalogues, but I would take that over having to return to the office.  


When I'm at the office I can't glance at my phone without feeling guilty and being nervous of my manager and coworkers scornful glares, or worse the panic when my boss walks in and my heart stops.  


I have to snap to the demands of at least 10 other people on any given day, while being on standby for answering the phone and having to ensure my own work is completed and fulfill any customer request for statements, invoices or the completion of documents. It's fucking ridiculous, my time isn't my own in the slightest. It's rare for me to even get an uninterrupted lunch break.  


I'm dreading going back to being exhausted day after day, this lockdown is the best thing that's ever happened to me and I will never be so lucky ever again.

30,Why do people show such a staunch reluctance and opposition towards change?,"Seriously, it seems that many people view wage slavery as an intrinsic part of human nature, rather than a construct of a capitalistic state. Whenever you mention that not everyone thrives in or enjoys such a system, they compare your ideals to those of failed regimes, accuse you of advocating for a world where ""mass starvation/poverty is rampant"" while ignoring the fact that these things already exist in the world today, and that people want a solution to these issues that our current system isn't providing.

 Go to any major city and you will see many of the impoverished or homeless being treated poorly due to the pejorative attitude that ""these people didn't work hard enough"". Having spent many of my teenage years in low-pay retail/food industry positions, I can assure you that those people work harder than a lot of individuals with ""respectable jobs"", they are just unfairly compensated for their labour. There were people who would walk miles to work everyday because they had no car, only to be on their feet for 8-10 hours with minimal breaks- and even if you did take a break, the managers would be watching you like a hawk. 

We would all have swollen feet and sore feet from walking and standing on concrete all day, when many people could have done their jobs better if they'd been allowed to sit down every once in awhile. But no, that's idleness. Nonetheless, I haven't worked there in two years and I still have issues with my feet and back- I'm only 20 years old!

Managers knew they could bully people lower in the chain. I was called retarded for having Autism, chastised for not finishing all my work when we were understaffed,  and told that if I stayed longer I would not be paid. I helped people when I did not have to, and they took advantage of my kindness. I lost my job for calling out when I was frequently sick. Back when I was naive, I thought all that I needed to escape this cycle was to get a STEM degree and work for a company that paid more than peanuts. Oh, how wrong I was.

If you're autistic, chances are you've faced lapses in education or employment. In a lot of situations that sort of hardship is a deal breaker for an employer because it supposedly shows you are 'unreliable'. Which in the working world is code for, ""You aren't going to bend over backwards for the company."" or ""You have some sort of condition that requires us to accommodate you- we just won't hire you instead."" 

I get rejected from every internship or apprenticeship I apply to, despite having a not terrible (3.6) GPA, learning languages, winning awards in academic clubs, constantly doing shit I don't WANT to do to try and compensate for my disabilities, bad interview skills, and lack of attractiveness and connections. The only time I got temporary employment was under a scheme for underrepresented (low-income and minority) students in STEM, and that quickly ended. 

My heart sank when I realised all this effort is for nothing, my degree will be in the biological sciences which means I am confined to shitty office roles or minimum wage lab tech roles. I've been working unpaid in a research lab for months, because I have no other way to 'get experience'. The best part is that I don't really enjoy anything, I just find the laboratory work less mind numbing then office droning or physical labour, and I can sit down when my back aches.

I wanted to go to graduate school, then I realised you essentially live in poverty for years while working unpaid overtime for the benefit of your PI and university. Academia is cutthroat and relies heavily on good ole boy culture much like how industry relies on illusory professionalism and knowing the right people who can vouch for your resume to make it to the top of the pile.

Yet, the majority of people seem complacent and content with this. To speak out against a world where your worth is tied to how productive you can be to an employer is almost social suicide. I have been told to just get an attitude adjustment, to suck it up and work harder, and to find ""a career I enjoy"" -  most jobs are difficult for me due to having Autism and PTSD, even if I was interested. It isn't that I don't want to work at all, it's that I am incapable of working 8 hours a day, which is nothing but an arbitrary standard that does not correlate with productivity.

 Like I said, skilled lab work pays close to minimum wage. Anything that I used to enjoy like programming/problem solving becomes stressful in a fast-paced workplace environment where mistakes are not allowed. Things I took pleasure in as a child such as painting, gardening, and sewing aren't profitable, especially not at my skill level. 

I think it's natural and expected for a lot of us to be unhappy when we live our lives on a ball and chain to the almighty dollar. You sacrifice your passions, relationships, your time, to line someone else's pockets with cash. Work culture has ruined my relationship in a way, as my partner has changed dramatically since he got a 9-5 cubicle drone job. He has called me stupid for saying that many jobs like his are useless and that I think it's unethical for him to work 12 hours a day sometimes due to ""flexi-hours"" where he may be allowed to leave early one day if he works longer shifts in return. Oh also, I'm lazy and want free money according to him because I think many professions are asinine. 

He thinks that his profession is altruistic simply because it's in the public sector and that I am selfish because I don't see the benefit to humanity of someone filling out excel spreadsheets and having meetings all day.  I've been called nasty and selfish because I said that you shouldn't bend over backwards for bosses who don't give a damn about you. They underpaid him for months because he was hired through a disability agency, now suddenly it's okay because he finally got promoted? There's nothing I can say or do because he is brainwashed into the ""autistic person pulling themselves by the bootstraps to be successful (by having a respectable job"" "" narrative.

Why are people so reluctant to see the flaws in this system or want to change it? Why is anyone who dislikes it considered a whiner who simply didn't grind enough? I really don't get it.",False,gazc6n,PM_ME_YOUR_TUTURUS,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gazc6n/why_do_people_show_such_a_staunch_reluctance_and/,7,1

Background: Junior in College

I'm a fairly lazy person; I have ADHD and I physically cannot sit still and read a book unless it's really engaging. I procrastinate to all hell, especially when it's work that I know (or think I know) I can do well on within the last minute. As an aside, I do have OCD, general anxiety, and I likely also have depression, but that remains to be diagnosed.   


So, with that said, the quarantine has made things go from ""oh this is manageable, I can still contribute and be a good student, albeit not a model one"" to ""Fuck it, I don't care, I just want to die."" I feel dread about having to make an arbitrary number of 150 word posts every week for classes, go to zoom classes and talk to people, and I just am generally depressed. Being online as much as I am is shit for my health and ability to talk to people, too, despite being a really introverted person. I would rather do non-academic things, such as modding or writing lore for roleplaying games, and I am generally happier when I do those things.  I feel horrible for not wanting to do this work, but like, part of me is annoyed that my fellow students are expected to just be able to function. I'm sure some of us can, but not all of us, and I think  that's acceptable when there's a literal crisis going on.

I'm looking for guidance or any help from people who have actually escaped work in the traditional sense.

We're all here because we all hate working right?  I quit my job at an automotive assembly plant in November 2019. I was working 48+ hour weeks starting at 6 am on day shift and working until 4 am when on the afternoon shift. It wasn't much of a life and became physically exhausting as well as depressing.  So now I have no job, cant get one anywhere due to COVID19 ( as a backup plan when i quit I told myself if you cant find anything in 3ish months, I could always get a job at McDonalds or Walmart, just to pay the bills) and I cant get any employment benefits because I quit voluntarily. Anyways, enough of the pity party.

I understand the reality of needing a career for income. I just want one that isn't killing me, where I can live a comfortable life. I want stability (a steady paycheque, steady hours) low or no travel. Possibly self employed although I'm not opposed to working for someone/ company, just want to be valued as a person not just a serial number. I'm really open to almost anything at this point.

Doesn't have to be 40 hrs. 
The next guy to reply to me was like 'her der why not just not work? Why not get freeeeee moneeeey' but of course he was taking himself seriously.

Yeah man, that would be great. 
I don't think anyone should work more than 20 hrs a week tops, and even then there are caveats. You should be paid fairly, good benefits, interesting work, etc. And even then capitalism is jank and I hate it but that's another post.

53,Sick of work and the neverending to-do list,"Okay I'm definitely not the first one to write about this but I need to rant.

Whenever I talk about how I hate working to my friends and family, 99% of them will say ""everyone hates working, suck it up."" 

But then a lot of them ended up complaining about how bored they were after like two days of quarantine. 
Meanwhile, I feel like it has been going by way too fast (although I still had to work part time and do schoolwork online) and like I'm in paradise.

Anyway, I got news today that I might be going back to the office soon and I am just dreading it. I am 25 and have tried several career paths (teaching, translation, office jobs, etc.) and part time jobs. 

I recently quit my customer service job for an office job and thought it would help my mood because I hate dealing with obnoxious people. And although I do feel less annoyed, I also feel wayyyyy more bored and zombielike sitting in front of a computer 8h a day.

 It seems like nothing ever satisfies me enough to not make me groan when my alarm goes off or not make me spend my life waiting for the weekend. I always end up getting sick of everything. It's not the job, it's having to work, period.

I sound like a lazy ass but I really am not. I do all my schoolwork ahead of time, my home is always neat and clean, and I am a very reliable and hard worker. I just hate the obligation. Like, I love reading but I would hate being forced to read 8h a day 40h a week. 

I hate having to exchange hours of my life (when the work could often be done much more quickly) just so I can live with a bit of comfort and be so exhausted at the end of the day that I don't even have time to do things I actually enjoy. Not to mention that in many jobs you need to wait years until you get decent salary and time off.

 I don't want to spend my life waiting for the weekend and retirement but I can't help it.

I have a lot of different interests, but a lot of them don't pay and I need some kind of stability. And no matter what job I do, nothing will ever compare to the freedom of doing whatever I want whenever I want.

I just want a little  house in the woods and free time. I have so many things I want to do, I could retire tomorrow and never be bored. I want to write, read, watch series, play videogames, do puzzles, learn languages, learn to draw, play the piano, dance, travel, spend time with loved ones.. And 2 days a week and 2-3 weeks off is not enough for me, I just end up feeling overwhelmed by all the things I want to do :( 

Anyway. Right now I'm aiming for work at school librairies to at least have summers off and be surrounded by books, but even that might not make me happy for 40h for 30 years (plus getting a permanent job is going to take a while too).

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest, or I'm hoping someone would give me some miracle solution or at least tell me they feel the same way. I feel like there should be more to life than this stupid routine and to-do lists.

60,The overreaction is helping companies put us in our place.,"Every time the American economy gets going good, we programmers can start demanding close to executive salaries, buying the cars they buy, vacationing in Italy like them, buying houses like theirs, eating at restaurants like theirs, etc.

Executives HATE that, but more importantly owners and investors hate that, so each time the job market heats up like that and programmers become hard to find, those at the top start training more non-Americans to be programmers in order to keep us in our place. They could train Americans, but they train non-Americans instead, and when that doesn't work, they crash the economy to keep us in our place, but this time even those two tactics aren't enough, so they had to force an overreaction to the virus.

Now that has enabled them to cut our salaries too. The owners/investors could take a loss, which is part of the risk of investing in or owning a business, but instead, they are making the employees take a loss. They could take on debt, but instead they are making employees take on debt. They decided to take a riskier path instead of becoming an employee, and employees decided to become an employee instead of taking all that risk, but now owners are breaking the deal and making employees take all the risk.

Things would be different if there were hundreds of thousands of companies and thus far more competition among them, but government has created an environment (for decades now) that empowers a few crony corporations to suck up all their competitors, and which makes starting a new company too difficult with all the laws, regulations, lawsuits, banking rules, selective enforcement, corruption, government contracts, nepotism, and poorly educated labor pool (who attended government schools). If that isn't enough, what do you think the CIA would do to any outsider company that was a threat to an insider company?

The federal government alone spends 4 trillion dollars per year, and yet, some people think the solution to government is more government, but government is a problem masquerading as its own cure.

69,Terrified of lockdown being over/unsure what job to work in,"Hey everyone! I dont know if this kind of post is okay or will get any attention really. I guess I might just need to vent a little. 

I'm 19 years old from Austria I struggle with major depression, anxiety and I have very frequent migraines (all of them since around the age of 10). School has always been horrible but I still finished my higher education which means I'm trained in office jobs and sales jobs. 

Ever since I finished school I've worked 3 months as an office person which was absolute hell (company also put me in a wrong department which probably made it a lot worse) so I quit there after getting suicidal again, I was without a job for a bit, joined a training course for Photoshop lessons in January (thought maybe media design would make me happy) and since I'm well versed with any drawing program (I get most of my money from digital art) it was super easy.

 The course was also hard for me mentally but it was only half days 4 days a week and I met the love of my life there and we could stick through it together. The course was also about applying to jobs which was prob the hardest thing no knowing what I wanted (except maybe tattoo) I was encouraged enough to try my luck at an tattoo parlour after none of the media design jobs wanted me. And I actually found a studio! 

Being an apprentice there was great at first (no money/insurance or anything) the studio owner wasn't much older than me and struggled with depression/anxiety as well. I learned a lot there for maybe 3 months then things started to change quickly. They only said horrible things about the tattoos I made no nice words at all. His wife (the piercer there) suddenly also wanted to tattoo etc etc. Basically I got suicidal again and the bullied me a lot. I wanted to pull through tho until winter that year cause then I'd open my own business and work in his studio aka he can't tell me anything. Well I was wrong I was basically treated like dirt for a year and nothing ever changed. My parents bought me out of the contract.

I'm terrified to tattoo or draw at this point. I'm terrified to work. My already low self esteem was completely crushed there. I'm slowly picking up drawing again and I think atm my favourite job would be a freelance artist but surviving on that is super hard. I'm also not gonna have insurance end of next month unless I get a job/pay for it myself/ or marry my bf lol...so I'm really really lost. I though of tattooing again but it scares me so much and I'm not good enough. I thought maybe an office job but phone calls give me major panic attacks or maybe a sales job but my social anxiety and not being too good to work under pressure don't mix well with that...

So my big question is, what can someone like me do? Is there even hope for a job that won't destroy me? Something maybe where I don't have to do much and can draw so I can maybe escape at some point?",False,g90h20,Zodi_Art,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/g90h20/terrified_of_lockdown_being_overunsure_what_job/,3,1

75,What Do you Guys Expect to Do Without Work?,"Lurker of this sub for a few months. 

I am a college student kind of fed up with our captialist system and am opposed to following the standard ""life script"" society wants us to. 

I am fortunate enough to get through college without debt. 

But, I believe that this sub has some good ideas and also negative ideas. I believe communism is not the answer, but rather capitalism/social democracy/democratic socialism like in Northern Europe. Capitalism with a much stronger social safety net than Europe. 

For one, I know I personally need good out-of-home routine and structure in my life to stay healthy mentally. I got depressed in college partly due to a lack of structure.. 

All in all, I think that ending work should not be the goal as I believe that would be poor to so many people's mental health: 

I think the goals should be more: 

1. Build up a Stronger Safety Net in the US (Maybe Institute a UBI so poor people can choose to not try to advance up the system and aren't stuck in a shitty retail job at like TJ Maxx as shopping now should be done online to at least free those type of useless retail clerk workers) 
2. Universal Healthcare (100%; I personally wanna work on-and-off throughout my life in a mix of accounting/finance, service work like waiting tables, a high school history teacher, and eventually do RV life full time; I want to work for my own goals of saving money and doing enjoyable work that my brain feels that it is getting something out of socially or mentally; don't wanna be chained to one particular job for healthcare)
3. Adopt Minimalism (This is a great idea and I am going to try to get into this more after college once I earn my bachelors in Accounting/finance as well as maybe history; start saving more money by cutting out BS purchases on things like knick-knacks and clothes; that way you can stop whining you have no money)
4. Cut out BS Jobs (Things Like Useless Secretaries, office administrative paper-pushers, middle management; also applies to jobs that are harder and shittier but can be automated better like I already mentioned retail workers)

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I believe UBI with maybe a permanent 10-15% unemployment would satisfy more people over next 20-30 years then just having everybody not work. I know I might not like it in accounting that's why I'm planning on maybe shifting over to high school history teacher someday. I love learning history. If you can't find work enjoying something you like that is meaningful, I at least encourage all of you guys to find a subject you enjoy learning in your free time, like history or a foreign language.

The Black Death is often created with transforming labour relations in Europe.
Peasants, now scarce, could bargain for better terms and conditions; wages
started to rise as feudal lords completed for workers. Thankfully, a much lower
mortality rate means such a transformation is unlikely to follow coronavirus.
Instead, policymakers must prevent a stunning rise in unemployment from

scarring a generation with lower living standards.

93,Why do a lot of people hate people that choose to coast in life?,"I am a self admitted coaster myself, I am not ashamed to admit it.

Although I coast, I still work very hard in the right circumstances, I just do not believe in unneeded toil.

I do work, I am in the army, but even here I am basically going to stay in as minimally as possible while obtaining as much certification as possible that will lead to a somewhat cushy well paying job in the civilian world, I view it more as a relatively fun business opportunity that I am not totally emotionally invested into.

Even still I try to do things as much my way as possible and not over stress, in basic training for example, I would pay people that didn't care about getting caught to burn shine my boots, a method that takes about 20 minutes at most and makes them look significantly shinier than the other recruit who spends hours spit shining them, during this time I would instead catch up on some much needed sleep. I don't feel like the pointless toil would of made me any more ""disciplined""  and I excelled during important physical portions and weapons training, stuff that actually mattered.  

Another example, about 3 times a week  we would all get together for group PT, its usually pretty much cross fit. Anyway one guy in our unit has the ""give all effort for everything attitude"" that I find largely obnoxious and pointless for such irrelevancy, and of course he injures himself twice missing out on opportunities, while I am coasting though setting unit records because I have smartly built my cardio and strength at my own progression over the years. 

I used to own my own business before the army, I am not to proud to admit that it failed, pretty much due to inexperience and personal crisis, even still I worked very hard 100 + hour weeks and had established a moderately successful sales business that was mostly passive. I also attended networking events with other entrepreneurs and many had the same mentality, work insanely hard early for an easier ride later on, when I start another business inevitably, this is the end goal, have an easier life and more passive income, that is essentially what owning a business is. Of course another minority of these people took no interest ""business loans"" from their already wealthy parents so it was always a coast.

One person I always look up to is an old forex trader that was a friend of my ex girlfriends dad. I have dabbled in forex myself and asked him for tips and opinions on my charting, he thought I was on the right track and shared much of the same mentality I do. I told him how people would laugh at me and mock me for trying so hard to learn how to trade stocks because of my background and apparent lack of education. He responded to me saying he had experienced much of the same scrutiny until he started making it big and that the average person likes to drag you down because they are pre-programmed to do so because the media makes it seem so unachievable without already having a level of ""education"" unachievable to the common person. This man is multimillionaire with no formal training and spends all his time traveling, going to his cottage, playing guitar with local bands and smoking pot, I strive to be able to do pretty much the same thing.

I am not ignorant to the fact that a lot of people do not like me for what I am or what the perceive me as, I have been slacker based insult both to my face and behind my back, but a lot of people do like me as well and from what I have experienced already in life, the 40 hour plus workweek is pretty much a trap and the vast majority of successful people I have personally met (people that live off a passive/semi passive income and are well off NOT people making six figures and working themselves to death) share the same mentality and try to separate themselves from unnecessary toil and actually enjoy life.",False,gajxel,thecoasterboaster,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gajxel/why_do_a_lot_of_people_hate_people_that_choose_to/,4,1

It was a toxic work environment, and there was a lack of work even before this ongoing economic crisis happened. I was laid off a few weeks ago, and ended up receiving much more through unemployment due to the recent CARES act than I ever did working full-time. **A few weeks ago, I recieved a call from an HR assistant sounding like they were reading a script:**

""Hi is this (name)? I'm calling from (company name) to let you know you're rehired. 

We've had problems with others not answering us, so we called from a separate number to increase the chances you'd pick up. You are unable to reject an offer of employment without losing your benefits. If your performance is unsatisfactory during the time we're rehiring you, you will be fired, and you'll receive no benefits.

We've received a loan which is contingent on rehiring our old staff. We acknowledge most you are now making more money from unemployment, but we won't be matching it. We want to inform you that the loan only covers the next few months, and we'll likely have to lay you off again when the loan runs out, so please make necessary arrangements. Unfortunately, this would also be when the additional unemployment benefits from the CARES Act goes away, so you wouldn't be receiving any extra money than either unless new laws are passed."" 

Everyone is upset about this, the feeling is that we were tricked into working for a worse version of unemployment, and we have no leverage. Our supervisor continues to talk about bringing *more* people back, despite the lack of work. It's not a tradeoff of financial aid for job security for most people, and I've been extremely stressed.

It is not a small company. Many of the employees have been told they have to take 13 vacation days, paid if you have them saved up and unpaid if you don't. 

Today, in a meeting, we were told that this forced ""vacation"" was saving the company 100 million dollars, just 2.5% (if I did the math right) of their revenue. But ""we need to do all we can to help (company) get through these times"". 

In this same meeting, we were told that the employees in one of the other countries are not being forced to take this ""vacation"" time because they have a good union.

Why do we have to give up our earned vacation time for the company to save what is a relatively small amount? I won't be able to take more vacation for months now, as they're forcing me to use all my time and take a week of unpaid vacation on top of it.

129,A Predicament," I work as a pharmacy technician at a Walgreens. The pay is bad even without being exposed to a life threatening illness. We're constantly understaffed, meaning the techs who are there have much more work to do than they really should and not enough time to do it. We got masks (finally) and plexiglass at the front register but it's too little too late in my book. Walgreens corporate has fucked me at every turn in order to make a profit. Not surprising. However, my immediate boss is actually a very nice and understanding guy, and I really enjoy talking to the other technicians I work with. I feel guilty about quitting because it means my workload would fall to them.

137,Iowa order wage slaves back into the fire,"""As Iowa prepares to partially reopen on Friday, the state has told  furloughed workers that they will lose their unemployment benefits if  they refuse to return to work. \[....\]""

In the past 6 weeks, unemployment claims have been filed for approximate 1 in 5 workers (18% - 19% of the workforce).

The Trump administration and now the Iowa state government are responding by ordering workers back into life-threatening conditions, withholding bare subsistence from workers who fail to comply.

This is what wage slavery is, every day, in normal times -- writ large.  It's naked now.  All out class warfare is breaking out, with the pro-capital side taking the initiative and launching the first attacks.

146,Not sure wrong place to post but...,"I work for a well known insurance company(claims) and have had the privilege to WFH. This job has been a blessing and a curse since I began last February. Office jobs can be soul draining IMO. The job itself is moderately stressful depending on the tasks being worked or the phone calls you get. 

Well with everything going on my stress has been all over the place. Anxiety has definitely been higher lately. There are still plenty of calls being made - both inbound and outbound.

Basically everything is monitored and I mean everything. The technology being used allows for supervisors to view our calls and screens. Typically they review these with us during our one on one meetings. I get why they do this and of course I don’t usually mind it. Just comes with the job I guess. 

Business has been kind of slow so now they are wanting to monitor our calls and screens real times. Now this would be the first day I’ve done this and I honestly just don’t feel like doing it. Just thinking about it is making me feel sick. Like I would just prefer to wait and get feedback about my calls once they’ve had time to review them on their own time and not be micro managed as much as they are trying. 

Would it be stupid to outright say no? I don’t want to have my calls reviewed live and the added stress that brings.

149,my shitty part-time grocery store job is even more shittier than I expected,"Temp job because grocery stores are desperate for workers during the pandemic shutdown.

Have had a couple pay stubs now so I've got a clearer picture.  After taxes, union dues, etc, plus factoring in my public transit fare and travel time, I'm making roughly $6.25USD per hour.  And that's **with** the extra $2/hour pandemic ""hazard pay"".  I'm netting about $300/week for 25 hours + 5 hours travel time.

I was unemployed anyway so this is more money than I had coming in before but ... holy shit that's bad.  And it's hard work.

I read some online reviews of the company. They're pretty bad, but I did get one good idea out of it:  Think of it like a workout you get paid for.

161,Can I vent please?,"Last year I was unemployed for almost a full year after graduating from my master’s degree, and it was making me quite upset. Then I got a job offer in a giant corporate company I’d never want to work at but had to take it as I didn’t have anything else. It’s only been 4 months but I feel so burnt out already. Not only is it emotional labour to put on this personality in front of my colleagues, but I also feel like I’m compromising all my values, compromising myself while working there. Does work have to be like this? Also, who the fuck came up with the 40-hour week? I know so many people are doing it, but it’s so crazy to be sitting in front of your laptop for 40 hours, especially when you know you can usually do the work in less time but have to be present for 40 hours. It feels like the whole work culture (starting from interviews to lunch breaks) is made to be the most stressful, fake environment I’ve ever been to. I’m just dreaming of doing community work, making meaningful contribution to society as a job.

I have also **bolded** parts that I think should stand out. The gall of asking your workers to work HARDER during a pandemic while also taking away their ability to care for themselves and loved ones is disgusting. This e-mail is in addition to taking away **ALL** pay incentives and returning them to their regular pay and overtime pay.

*Subject: SAT2 inSITES: Week of 4/26*

*Amazonians –*

*As I reflect on this recent period of rapid change in response to COVID-19, I want to express my appreciation for the support and positive attitude that has prevailed throughout the site. Your feedback has helped ensure we improve in key areas for social distancing goals, including adjusting the flow of movement to allow for 6’ spacing, modifying start times and break times, adding sanitizer stations in strategic areas and as you enter/exit, improving our coverage on sanitizing spray to stations and work areas, a smooth thermal screening process, and mask distribution for all. This has taken adjustment on your part to daily routines and we couldn’t have accomplished all that we have without a whole lot of teamwork. Along the way, associate suggestions have been incredibly valuable. I’d like to especially thank those who have shared feedback directly as I walk or that have provided feedback via VOA with specifics of where we can improve.* ***To say the site has been successful during this time would be an understatement: we have grown our outbound volume substantially and have finished in the Top 10 for 3 consecutive weeks for all Amazon FCs in customer shipments fulfilled, have doubled our associate population, and have finished in the Top 3 in the network for efficiency of throughput for 2 consecutive weeks (with a whole lot of folks still learning their roles)!***

*Another period of adjustment is upcoming* ***as we return to the normal UPT policy beginning May 1****. We understand as a leadership team that there are still challenging circumstances for many of you as it relates to the pandemic, and we are committed to supporting you. Included in the communication about the UPT policy was information on Personal Leave and the ability to apply between now and midnight on April 29 for Personal Leave starting May 1. However, this option may not be the right fit for all of you. If you would like to work out a modification to your schedule that allows you to avoid using UPT while caring for needs outside of work, we’d love to assist. Here are some guidelines to follow depending on your situation:*

*•* ***We are expanding the unpaid Personal Leave of Absence policy to include COVID-19 circumstances (such as high risk individuals or school closures), waiving our normal advance notice period for PLOA from today through April 29. To request a PLOA starting May 1, associates should apply between now and midnight on April 29. For the balance of the month, we are reducing our normal 30-day notice for PLOA to 15 days for the month of May.***

*• If your current schedule conflicts with childcare or other schedule concerns related to COVID-19 circumstances but you’d like to continue to work, we are offering hardship accommodations to allow a schedule that meets your needs. These schedule accommodations can be requested on site via AtoZ, or from home you can send an email to HR at* ***REMOVED*** *explaining your circumstances and what type of schedule you need to be accommodated to – this will be reviewed by site leadership for approval.*

*• HiTS transfers (permanent transfers to another department or shift) continue to occur bi-weekly which give you the opportunity for a permanent shift change if there is another shift that will work better for your schedule long term.*

*• Shift swap can be utilized to swap shifts with peers to manage single shift or periodic needs.*

*Bottom line, if you need more time away due to COVID-19 and know that you will not be able to come to work, Personal LOA is the option for you, and you have a window to apply before the UPT policy returns to normal. If your situation has made your usual schedule untenable but you want to find a schedule that allows you to continue working, please reach out as outlined above and we will help.*

*I look forward to continuing our progress and growth as we keep one another healthy and safe and serve the customers in this great community.*

They know they haven't really acomplished much and are working slaves so they feel good about having the power to evaluate and intimidate candidates and feel better about themselves. The stupid job interviews that just seem to be designed to see the candidate  struggle for a good respond for the enjoyment of the recruter. How is having a good response to ""tell me more about yourself"" or ""describe a situation where you solved a difficult situation"" going to translate into me being more productive and help the comoany? 

And all these people that dress up for their miserable office jobs just to feel superior to other people on the subway who aren't commuting to the same ""fancy"" jobs, even though they are as qualified as them. 

And of course, the way they overrate experience. 95% of jobs require previous experience. Why? Because it's all about profit, profit, profit. It's the only thing in the world companies care about. The employee has to produce more money for the company than their salary right from the very start. No time wasting for training anybody, even though  your stupid job could be done properly by any college graduate without experience after 1 hour of training.

217,Should I even apply for 9-5s after the pandemic?,"Hey all, this is going to be a long super personal/anecdotal vent so I hope it's right place for it, if not I'm sorry! In summary: I don't know how to motivate myself to apply for jobs anymore, or even if I should. 

I hold very strong ethical positions which has made retaining a 9-5 increasingly difficult. A few years ago I was the assistant manager of a retail store and our branch called a meeting in early November. I was making $2 over minimum wage at that time, and all of our employees who were not AGMs/GMs or above were making minimum wage, AND being forced to work split shifts on a tiered system where none worked over 30hours a week. They were contractually obligated to not moonlight/only work this job. During the meeting, the manager said a memo had come down from head office which indicated there would be no time off given from November 15th- January 3rd and those who worked over the holidays would be given 1.5x rate of pay. Everyone in the room became really gloomy because we all knew that this also meant split shifts would be used to ensure nobody actually made more than their regular rate, anyway. A girl who started a month earlier raised her hand and said she was from the other side of the country and always travels home over the holidays to see her family, and that she had already booked her non-refundable $600 tickets for 3 days over Christmas. Our manager said ""Sorry, my direction is that if you choose to take a vacation anyway, there won't be job for you here when you come back."" This girl lowered her hand, nearly in tears at that. I raised my hand immediately after and said ""I quit;"" then walked out of the meeting and returned my keys/uniform the next day. 

I cannot stomach situations like that where people clearly don't matter and are as good as slaves. I feel physically ill when I'm forced to participate in something so contrary to humanity and my beliefs, and have quit a number of jobs because of similar scenarios, even when they don't affect me. 

Most recently, I found a dream job (that paid a lot more) in an industry I'm passionate about. The company clearly cared about people and made huge efforts to be THE BEST employer of it's kind, I loved going to work every day. Then we were acquired by an umbrella company. Higher-ups who were behind the ""people first"" decisions were suddenly being let go and the direction of the company turned to profit. We laid off huge numbers of our retail staff, and created a tier system where only 1-2 staff could be on the floor at a time, whereas it had previously been 4-5. So essentially, the retail staff that remained were doing twice the work for the same pay as before. The sinking feeling in my stomach began to creep up again. 

Then the pandemic hit. Because of the dream position I was in, I became a part of the decisions about the actions we would take as a company in response. Without getting into specifics, the decisions that were being made were entirely about profit and very clearly put our staff and customers at risk. I was the lone voice of opposition to these decisions. As a result; my boss had several phone calls with me where they reinforced that our goal was to make sure our stores were making us ""a shitload of money"" as safely as possible. But the ""safe"" part of that was completely MIA and everyone knew it. My opposition to decisions became increasingly heated as employees started contacting our head office with complaints and some, simply stopped showing up for work. 

I made an anonymous comment on a reddit post that was titled ""do you think your employer is handing the pandemic correctly"" wherein I didn't state the company name, my name or specifics of any kind but just said ""no, I don't think my company should even be open as we're not essential."" What I refrained from writing was that I didn't know if I could sleep at night, understanding that decisions I was a part of would likely get people working for us making minimum wage killed, eventually. 

To my surprise (but in hindsight not really) a taskforce had been enacted within the company that was reviewing industry social media to identify employees who had a problem with the company's response. They had randomly found my comment and traced it back to me, and then confronted me about it. I quit. I should have quit sooner, but I was idealistic and remembered the company as it was when I joined it, not as it was now. 

My issue now is what comes next? How do I motivate myself to give a shit about a 9-5 ever again, knowing that when push comes to shove it will inevitably place profits and ""growth"" above it's people? I want to help people. I got a degree in a field with the intent of doing just that, but of course there were no jobs. I honestly feel like if I have to keep rinse and repeating this situation with employers, my mental health will be at stake (which it already is) and not to be melodramatic, but I could see myself spiralling pretty quickly into a suicidal state. 

I haven't been able to force myself to apply for anything or even consider job hunting since I quit. At this point, where all the cards on the table and clear to read, I believe that contributing to this sick system actually hurts more than it helps and I have considered instead turning to the black market and TOR and maybe participating in credit card fraud or something to put food on the table, and only targeting the ultra rich. THAT would be more of a help to the world and make it a better place that being a cog for a shitty corporate overlord that is greasing our path to extinction and total ecological collapse. 

What other choices do I have/what are your suggestions? 

By the way, I realize how privileged this sounds. Millions of people would be clamoring for the opportunity just to have a job, and my jobs weren't all bad. But that's exactly why I feel the way I do. I have enough privilege to choose whether I have to work for a shitty company or not without immediately facing starvation, so how can I do anything but choose to oppose it? Those millions of people don't have a choice, they will work those jobs and not have the ability to gawk at something as first world as vacation limitations or the ethical repercussions of what they're supporting. But. I can, having been lucky enough to be born where there are some social safety nets.

I thought they were going to close when everyone else was, but nope. Business as usual. All of the office personnel got sent home to work remotely, but us plebs get to keep coming in. Meanwhile, most in my department quit, so now we're super backed up, under-staffed and stressed, can't hire anyone because unemployment is literally paying more right now and if we quit we won't qualify. I'm high risk - a lifelong severe asthmatic. If they did close down, since my classes are online during all this (respiratory therapy) I was planning on going back home out of state to look after my mother who is older and immuno-compromised to do her shopping for her etc, but can't bring myself to quit, especially with talks of opening everything back up. My roommate I rent from is elderly and also high risk (emphysema) so if I were to contract this and pass it off to him, that would be awful (although he's one of those ""it's just like the flu and not even that bad"" types, and literally said at the beginning it's just a social experiment, so fuck him I guess) this just sucks.",False,g6qvgr,DeadUncle,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/g6qvgr/bitter_about_work_during_this_pandemic_shit/,2,1

229,Any lawyers here? Former Lawyers? Law Students?,"What a rat infested salt mine of a profession eh? Currently in law school, going into my final year. If I weren't on a full scholarship I would bail. I thank God at least once a day I didn't take the offer at the swanky school wherein I would've been paying money to subject myself to this shit show. I clerked with a ""big firm"" last summer, and it made me want to blind myself before jumping out of the 16th floor window. I thought I was being 'Punked' when I was introduced to the partners. Surely it was a cruel joke that I was supposed to treat solemnly and respectfully these obscenely dull, insentient morons who've traded their whole life force and souls for an awful job–to become a caricature in a tailored suit– and as a result hate themselves and everybody else for it...Queue Bowie's ""Life on Mars?"" and bring out the hidden cameras...  By Thursday on the first week I realized I was going to spend the summer getting as many free lunches as I could, drinking all the gourmet coffee in the lobby, and fucking off out of there as early as I could everyday without getting canned. On an up note, what they paid me was startling, and it was enough money to cover my living expenses for about a year and a half (I live frugally). I deliberately provided them with fuckall in terms of work product... My own humble personal contribution to the fight against the dying of the light, however insignificant it may be. 

The most disturbing part of the whole thing (and the what brings me to post on this sub) is the fact that legal education and the legal profession actually cultivate a completely unbalanced and toxic work culture, and then proceed to uphold it as a badge of honor toward which lawyers should strive–When it's actually a piece of calcified shit that has somehow become rancid and needs to be thrown in the trash... In some cases, this macho work culture is weaponized and used as a litmus test barrier to entry. As in, ""if you can't hack it, you don't belong!... Argh!"" It's all very fanatical and disturbing. It's as if being a basket case who is estranged from their family, friends, community, and selves is actually something that is admirable and the mark of a ""dedicated professional."" It's stunning, and if I wasn't living it, I would think it was straight out of a funky dystopian paperback. 

I think the hardest part of this whole thing has been watching the psycho-social train wreck that has been the metamorphosis of my 150+ classmates from what seemed like, for the most part, decent, well-intended humans into sycophantic, anxious, insecure, and hysterical workaholics who've developed such severe myopia that they have trouble seeing that the jobs they're all hitting each other over the head to obtain are actually destructive– for the people doing them and for the communities in which they are operating...

So, any lawyers or law students on here? Ex-lawyers? Would-have-been-lawyers that had the wherewithal not to take the plunge? Thoughts from everyone are appreciated, of course. I want to say, that what I love so much about this sub is that it is the antithesis of everything that law school and the legal profession stand for. Sitting in class, in a room full of 150+ of the most careerist, apple polishing, boot lickers I've ever met, it's surfing this sub somedays that keeps me sane.

237,Looking For a Unique Group of Individuals to Build Something Amazing... An escape from the Rat Race.,"Have you ever felt like life was wasting away? Like you were destined for more than just working some shitty job all day every day? Do you feel a deep desire to achieve your dreams?

I have no miracle product or solution, but there is something I know. I know that when a group of motivated and driven people get together they can accomplish anything they set their minds to.

My organization is seeking to expand and bring in a founding group of individuals. This is not for people who are realistic or who want to live a so called ""normal"" life. This is only for the dreamers, the people who know deep down there is something beyond all of this that is calling us.

We will build a community from the ground up to support us. We will earn stable incomes in ways none of us ever thought possible before. We will expand, connect, and adapt with ourselves and the world around us.

We have very little money but we know money has never stopped a true dreamer in the past. We will pool together whatever amount each person can feel comfortable contributing.

We will focus on the income aspect as soon as we have the core group together.

So, once again, if you feel like you need a community that cares about you, real relationships with real people, or anything remotely human, please reach out to me. We will go from there.

238,Nonessential - Back to Work,"I had been furloughed about 5 weeks ago, and learned I would be back to work 3 days ago. I'm a landscaper at a historic site in the US. And landscapers are essential, you know, to keep the gardens nice for the no tourists this summer. I have underlying risk factors for COVID-19 and make $15 an hour, 32 hours a week. I made as much money on unemployment, where I didn't have to put myself and others at risk.

This morning, my non-essential job was moved to 40 hours a week. I learned this an hour into my first day back. I value my time more than one day's wages, so I am already upset because they stole 8 hours a week from me without letting me know beforehand or fucking asking!

But the whole reason they are bringing non-essential workers back, and giving us more hours, is to qualify for the Payroll Protection Program. The organization is getting a big chunk of cash, and a bit ends up as my and my coworker's wages. All while putting non-essential workers at huge risk of medical debt or death.

I knew I was majorly being taken advantage off because my pay is garbage for what I do and have been trying to bounce for a bit now, but this really uncovered the extent of it. They're not even trying to hide it. 

I've taken a 25% pay cut out of the blue when I know for a fact my boss can afford my full pay since the company has not been affected by the virus situation : he's taking me for a complete idiot by telling me he can't afford it when I work on those numbers... I see them... 

In addition, all my team has left, which means he doesn't have to pay them anymore and dumped their work on me. Yeah, ""can't afford my pay"" for sure. Could never afford a raise either but he's willing to give me more work for the money also. So he can afford it, actually. 

The reason they didn't like to give work from home options when most of us office workers could ? They can't micromanage us to squeeze every drop of work they can get out of us. Since he can't be looking over my shoulder all day and tracking everything, my boss is now getting exactly what he pays for. Absolute bare minimum,

me: I'm confused, I sent the template as per email Fri 13:01 can you confirm

her: just send as per email sent to X the updated you sent at 4 is fine""

This was all regarding a template which I'd COPY PASTED from what she had originally sent but somehow it wasn't correct. I was meant to add more information as per some second email.

278,The last weeks have made me realise employers give 0 shits about their employees | Pressured to agree to have my hours cut.,"Like so many others, my employment was affected by the COVID 19 measures. I'm a barista. Before the government announced the mandatory measures, we already had noticeably fewer guests, so I got less hours even before we closed.

Then my boss decided to close the store completely for the time being. Except he didn't even bother telling us. I read it on the company's Facebook page (the cafe is part of a chain). So that was great. Really respectful way to treat employees that have been with the company for years (/s, obviously).


I was desperate for a new job and applied to a couple of job listings for supermarket and drugstore jobs. No word from them, applied to a few more, got a job offer from a temp agency through which I could work at a drugstore.

They were sort of shady from the start. During the job interview, they made it seem like I'd always be in the same store which quickly turned out to be untrue. Within the first few weeks, they had the right to end the employment with 1 day notice (I live in a country that has laws regarding the amount of notice, but temp agencies have extra laws...) So I always felt on edge and like I could lose my job any moment. ""Luckily"" I'm now at the stage of employment where they have to give one week notice.

The person at the temp agency that's responsible for telling me about my shifts is completely disrespectful and intrusive. Like when I don't pick up the phone fast enough on my day off, he accuses me of staying in bed all day. He has called me during my shifts multiple times then gets annoyed when I don't pick up. I always get calls on my days off followed by annoyed texts asking why I'm not picking up.

Most recently, he called me while I was out running errands and lowkey threatened me by saying the drugstore has been making fewer requests for temp workers, implying I'm somehow making a mistake by not being available on call on days off.

Then, claiming I forgot to sign a part of the work contract last month, he asked me to come into the office the following day. I had a bad feeling in my gut and felt uneasy going there alone, but no one had the time to accompany me so spontaneously. Turned out I was right. I was supposed to sign paperwork stating I agree to have by almost 35% starting April 1 right then and there at the reception desk. One of the employees went on to explain they have been getting less requests from the drugstore chain than expected, resulting in all temp workers having their hours cut. If I hadn't signed, they would have had to pay me for the hours they had offered me in the beginning, but I probably also would have been fired. So I signed.

I feel so stupid for signing the agreement. I was tricked into coming into the office so it would be easier to pressure me. I freaking hate being expected to bust my ass and to give up my personal life only to be treated this way - lied to and deceived - and be paid the bare minimum, then even getting my hours cut.",False,g7ex5a,throwaway9237102827,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/g7ex5a/the_last_weeks_have_made_me_realise_employers/,9,1

286,Returning to work has me more anxious than everything else going on.,"I, much, like many others was laid off from my job on IT phone help desk due to COVID-19. I had started the job back in January and while it was still better than most of my previous jobs, it was still 40 hours of my week I would never get back.

My wife and I managed our lives and before you know it we were actually enjoying our time off in quarantine and getting to live with enough time to do enjoyable things, to have enough energy to get nagging projects done, and to just appreciate each others company. After a week we no longer felt the burnout of society.

Even financial anxiety fell by the wayside. No, we can't pay all our bills, but neither can anyone else and that gave us a kind of solice. Eventually unemployment came and yea, between the two of us we have been making more these past couple weeks then we have in our entire lives. 

But then work called back. Despite the state not opening just yet, they need us to work from home starting next week. My heart sank. Anxiety came rushing back. All this time to be human is about to be gone in the name of corporate profits and the struggle to get by.

More wealth on this planet so that nobody had to struggle yet everyone does.

And maybe I'm a drama queen about it. I know others have it far worse. I've attempted suicide once over work, I've quit so many jobs in a rage because I just can't stand how it makes me feel like a prisoner. Like I have no choice in the matter and this is just expected of us. I would much rather have a self sustained lifestyle.

I dread spending the rest if my life working a 9-5 and still struggling when we're too old to enjoy the world and experience life. We're on a 3-4 year plan to own our home and be debt free, but thanks to recurring society debts we will never truly be free from the monetary chokehold this world has on us.

So Monday I log back into work from home. It will be slow to start but it doesn't matter. I will be on house arrest determined by the range of my bluetooth headset. Eventually I'll have to go back to the office and anxiously pretend to be busy while corporate overlords hover above and monitor ever minute action on my screen or watch to make sure I'm actually moving my mouse 5-10 times per minute.

This virus itself is terrible. But the lockdown is the best and worst thing to ever happen to me. 

I just want to be free and not feel this way.",False,g7a3m5,gwydion_black,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/g7a3m5/returning_to_work_has_me_more_anxious_than/,2,1

If a person had 24 million dollars - they would in effect have available to them 21 thousand dollars a month - every month for 100 years.

Isn't that enough? Why would anyone need more than that?

With 21 thousand dollars available to you every single month - for up to 100 years in to the future - aren't you good? 

You can live in a nice place and have good food, clothing, transportation, medical care etc.

319,We Cannot Go Back to Normal!,"This pandemic has paused, ended, or restructured a lot of our daily lives. We are setting a precedent for new ways of being – some healthy, some unhealthy, some the same, some different.  It is now in this space of uncertainty and novelty that we must choose how we want to live. We have the power now to choose and reshape our futures – personally, professionally, economically, and politically.

Notice what aspects of this quarantine you are enjoying.

What in your life these last few weeks have you been enjoying? What has made your life feel new, meaningful, refreshed, or special?

. Give yourself this time and write. ….  
 

Now, the flip side. What about these last couple weeks during this pandemic, in quarantine, has made you feel ‘off’ – scared, frustrated, depressed, stressed, worried, weird, insecure, etc. ? Be as concrete or abstract as you need to be. Think about anything tiny in your daily life to large in the system things that you may not like, agree with, or are uncertain of. Make a list of those things now.

. I know it’s hard to switch gears. Take a moment, a deep breath in, clear your head, then focus on that gut feeling you have been trying to avoid and write what is contributing to you feeling that way. Take this time. …  


&amp;#x200B;

Life is scary, confusing, and hard. Life is beautiful, impactful, and important. We are here today simultaneously protecting ourselves, our loved ones, and society from a virus. We are here today following orders, obeying authority, isolating, and worrying. We can be dichotomous things at once (embrace the contradiction).

From my own perspective, I am afraid of living in a society that values intangible things like wealth and production over real beings, living creatures. I feel that is a warped set of values that doesn’t meet the human-level needs of a society. Needs like food, water, shelter, community, and health. We are told there are a lack of resources which is why we must fight (with our dollars) to secure our basic necessities. We are made to believe that we must step on the weaker to secure our place on top. We are living in a society that values competition over cooperation. And that competition keeps us busy and distracted – takes away our time and emotional resources to step back and realize this may not be a society we want to support.

Some of us have the time and space right now (whether we want to or not) to step back and look at what we’ve been living in. To see where the system has benefited us and where it has made it harder for us to be the people we want to be.

Who do you want to be? Deep down. If our society didn’t exist the way it does now - if these pressures, expectations, assumptions, and money weren’t a factor - who do you want to be?

I don’t have a concrete label, but I have a vague sense. I want to be kind. I want to help others. I want to be in nature more. I want to learn about the world. I want to be a part of a loving and supportive community, whether it’s a group of friends or a family – I want close relationships where we truly care about one another. I want to be a part of a society that empowers individuals to pursue their dreams, advocate for their needs, and validates their feelings. I want community understanding and empathy for differences in experiences and how that translates into ways of being and thinking. I want a world based in accepting and uplifting members of a society.

I write this feeling it deep in my bones this is where I want to live, and fearing that it’s too utopic to work. But why can’t it work? Is it because we’ve been told that taking care of our communities as if we’re all family isn’t the expectation? Is it because we're told we must fight in order to survive. What if we worked together to survive? What if we banded together and fought things that hurt our members, like waging a war against famine, pollution, homelessness, depression, and disease?

I want to de-throne the dollar. We can’t continue to disempower those with less financial support, remove their ability to take care of themselves, and only allow access to a livable life to those with wealth. Get rid of money as king, and replace it with quality of life. Not in the way that those with a high quality of life have power, but in the way that we as a society value quality of life – obtaining it for ourselves and ensuring that every member of our society is provided a life worth living – food, water, shelter, community, health (mental and physical). 

It is important that we realize what we truly value as individuals. What do you want and need? It is important that we advocate for ourselves, no matter the pushback or “ridiculousness” of our needs (it is our society that dictates what is “ridiculous” no matter how valid it truly is). It is our responsibility to take care of each other, especially in times of hardship and distress. It is our responsibility to ask for help and seek out support when we need it. We must ask, advocate, and fight for what we want and need in our lives. For what we know is True and Right. For what we value and prioritize. It’s not going to be handed to us if we don’t ask for it first.

Pay attention to those that are threatened by the idea of you living a quality life. What are they afraid of? It’s not fear of the safety of others – it’s fear that you might empower people, which threatens them being ""better"" than you (their poor egos). Empowering people to ask for what they need is crucial and important to creating change. It only serves to benefit societies. Uplift each other and let’s create a revolution.",False,g6q3to,TheAnonOptimAnar,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/g6q3to/we_cannot_go_back_to_normal/,5,1
320,"Unionizing my workplace during a pandemic... any organizers on here who could offer advice, tips and tricks?","I'm not really sure where to post this, but I have been planting the seeds of sedition in my workplace the past few weeks as we have been deemed ""essential"" and thus forced to go to work at considerable risk to our health during the CoViD-19 pandemic. I think the seeds are beginning to take root in some of my co-workers. Five so far are a definite yes, having said that they would sign the authorization cards.

The thing is, I have never worked at a union shop before, and have no experience dealing with them at all, let alone trying to organize a workplace! As I was thinking and talking with my co-workers tonight (during a 12 hour shift), I realized that we should probably come up with a list of specific demands. We want to improve our situations at work and outside of work as best we can, but we also want to be realistic and shoot for goals that are reasonably likely to be achievable. I'm not even sure which labor union we should be looking to join, to be frank. They're categorized by industry, correct?

I hope I haven't bitten off more than I can chew here. I firmly believe that we need to organize. Here we are, working during a god-damned pandemic, and we don't get sick time. Our health insurance sucks. And most of us make only 50¢ to $1 more than minimum wage ($12/hr minimum wage in Maine). Other situations have happened in the past, and I don't want to mention specifics, on the off chance that someone would be able to figure out the place and alert management, but lets just say they involved callous indifference to human life on the part of the owner. He has proven, time and again, that he does not give a shit about the people who make his fortune for him. I'm not sure he even *has* any empathy at all towards his fellow humans.

So anyway, what steps should we be taking? Other than the fact that we have to pay union dues, are there any *downsides* to union membership? As I was talking to some of the people who were there when the current owner took over the plant, I learned that the guy has threatened in the past to close up shop if we ever unionized. How often do those kinds of threats materialize, and how often are they just blowing smoke out their butts?

337,Escape the rat race?,"Hey,

many of you, just like me, might feel stuck in their job and some are fighting with depression. It really helps me to see, I'm not alone.
Nevertheless it might also be helpful to see, what kind of alternatives there are.
I worked for a worker owned coffee importer for a few weeks after school and this really was a mind-blowing experience. Don't get me wrong-it's still work within a capitalist economy yet not having a boss and being able to switch between different positions when one thing becomes dull, really made a difference for me. Also the pay is extraordinary good for that kind of work. 

Later I went to school again for getting access to University (German system is complicated :D ) and had the opportunity to go to a self organized school. Every decision is made at the assembly with one person having one vote - regardless the position/job the person has. It turns out learning is actually fun if you're not shitting your pants every morning because you have to go to this hellhole called school. 

Maybe you have good experiences as well and might provide us with useful informations about organizations that might help.

For my region (Germany) I'm thinking of:


The Miethäuser Syndikat - they help self organized groups of people to buy housing and de-privatise it. 
https://www.syndikat.org/de/

The school mentioned above
https://www.sfeberlin.de/

The anarcho-syndicalist union. Even as a socialist I have to admit, there is no other union around with such a strong sense of solidarity. I really appreciate their work. As far as I know there are some syndicalist work projects started by union members.

340,All Freelance Work is a Joke,"Apologies in advance for the long rant, but I gotta get this off my chest because none of my other friends and fam understand where I'm coming from when I talk about how much I fucking hate work. Hoping to connect with other people who have had similar issues on here.

So, I started  freelance writing because I thought it would be a great way to monetize my passion and get me out of the corporate world, which I loath. Last year, I finally got to a place (mentally and financially) where I could make it my full-time gig. I thought it was going to be amazing: I'd  be a free agent, work when I wanted, have tons of time for dream projects and I wouldn't have to kowtow to corporate bullshit.

Y'all. I was a fool. 

Turns out that all work is absolute garbage. 

I've tried different clients and different approaches, even becoming more aggressive than I normally would, and none of it matters because companies don't see you as a person, especially if you're freelance.

For one thing, no one pays writers market rate anymore because all writing is social media/content shitposting. They don't even hire ""writers"", we're all ""content creators"". My main client pays me $20/hour, which sounds decent until you actually look at the numbers. For example, I can write 70 product descriptions and only see $466 for it because they decided that product descriptions should only take 20 minutes to write. 

On top of that, they assign projects with insane turnaround times because faster is always better. There have been many, many weeks where I've spent 5+ straight hours every day at a computer to get things done and handed in on time so I don't risk my income. Do these Project Managers spend their full 8 hour work day at their desk doing work? Doubtful. So why do I get assigned a 20+ hour project to be done in 5 days? Because capitalism. 

I landed another client who accepted my $50/hour rate and I thought I hit the jackpot! 

They ended up being worse than my low paying clients. They asked me to come in full-time for 2-3 weeks as coverage. I accepted because I thought about all the money I would get. Imagine my surprise when I was told to only invoice for the hours I spent on the actual project. I lost money because that didn't account for travel to and from the office and the hours I wasted in meetings and other office bullshit. 

I took the hit as a lesson. They came back to me earlier this year with another job. I asked repeatedly for project scope, timelines, hours, etc. so I wouldn't get jacked again and because I had other work on the go. They wouldn't give me any details, but asked me to hold 35 hours a week for month because they were ""pretty sure"" they could fill it.

Like, really? You expect me to turn down other work on the prospect of maybe full time work? What happens to me when those hours don't get filled? I got a little testy and then they blamed me for leaving them in the lurch at the last minute. I offered solutions and they ghosted me.

Now they're back with another ridiculous offer that I am offended by. They want me to work for one of their clients exclusively for months (meaning I can't take on other work). Again, there's no hours or rate attached, so I have no idea how much I'll be earning. And they're asking if I'm interested.

Who in their right fucking mind would accept a job offer without a salary? No one, right? So why the hell am I expected to take a freelance gig with no monetary sum being offered as well? 

I have no idea what to say other than sHoW mE tHe MoNeY! What am I, a charity? I give you work and you fucking pay me. Any offer of freelance work without project rates/salary/hours attached is insulting. I have a skill, dammit! 

Doing this full-time made me realize how absolutely soul draining the work force actually is. I used to think it was just me and there was something wrong with me. I look back at times when I was so stressed out by work culture bullshit and I wonder if I may have been on the verge of a full-on breakdown. 

But I kept going, trying to make it work, trying to find a better job, dealing with repeated bouts of unemployment, taking low wage jobs just to make it work. And for what? I make less now than I did 10 years ago. I got paid better as a summer student in high school than I do now.

The only good thing to come out of this is me realizing that I don't actually want a job, I want to write and make art.

353,I keep fucking up,"This year it feels like my place of work has developed some sort of vendetta against me. I have been working here since 2017. In January they hired a new guy who took my desk and placed me in the corner at a smaller desk. Which just goes to show that it doesn't matter how long you've worked a certain role, someone with more education will always take precedence.

I trained a girl last year who works on my days off (Monday and Tuesday). I didn't do a very good job covering all she was supposed to know and my boss didn't want her to do a certain task because I was already good at taking care of it. I got a dollar raise and felt pretty happy about it. 

I suffer severe social anxiety. Part of my job is to contact people about warranties and I procrastinated a lot due to not feeling confident in how I was supposed to approach them and the fact most of my emails were ignored. I'm guessing due to the unprofessionalism of my emails because I didn't know how to do it.

Well, a lot of warranties piled up and I got in serious trouble and beat myself up mentally for weeks. I was self-sabatoging myself at home with food and masturbation trying to stop feeling like a worthless fucktard. It consumed my thoughts. I was close to self-harming. At work I felt like a felon. And the worst part about all of it was, I had no one I could talk to about it. If my relatives found out I'd just get another ass-chewing about what an incompetent person I am and how I can't lose this job.

This week I got a new strike against me. I vented on my Facebook about how my co-workers don't always answer their phone when they could, making me do it constantly. I have a stutter and people can't hear me well so answering the phone causes me stress. It was a busy day and we were very short staffed. Apparently the co-worker whom I trained last year saw it and told the boss about it (big mistake adding her on Facebook). Yesterday morning I was chided and told to remove the post at once. 

I was not given the chance to explain the context of the post. I did not post my vent to defame them. I did not name names or identify anyone who works here. I did not list any singular persons. I simply said ""co-workers"". No workplace was given. Nobody on my friends list knows where I work anyway. I was in the middle of a severe anxiety attack and wanted to vent--my intention was not to bring their company down. It had nothing to do with them as a whole. 

I was warned that my post was enough for them to fire me. 

Once again I'm feeling like a complete loser. I can't handle working or being a good employee. I keep fucking up. I can't be perfect like my co-workers.

355,Not looking forward to returning to work.,"So my state has a stay at home order that’s going to end on the last day of the month. My work was deemed nonessential so I’ve just been doing my own thing at home (which has been great aside from not getting paid). I’m not as stressed, I’ve taken up a new hobby I’d been wanting to try but never had the energy for, and I’ve even been getting a full nights sleep which hasn’t happened in a very long time. 

Now all I can think about is how miserable it’s going to be to be back, and I don’t think the order should end yet anyway because it’s still too soon in my opinion, but I’m starting to stress out over the prospect of returning. And I know I have it easy. I mean, at least I got to stay home and stay safe? So I should be grateful, but I’m not. I’m actually more angry than I think I would be if we didn’t shut down. 

Having this time to myself gave me a lot of time to think, I guess since I wasn’t so exhausted and apathetic anymore from working most of my life away. I’m 23. I should not be this burned out. I even like my job! But the amount of time we have to work (everyone, not just at my job but everyone) and I still stay broke? It’s too much. Sometimes I wish I could just give in to it and not think about it, because it just looks easier that way. Like I’d still be miserable, but not actively?  It’s just right now everything just feels kind of hopeless, like what’s the point in working so much just to survive? I don’t want to be here if this is all I get, you know? 

Does anyone else who is about to return to work feel this way, or is my depression just kicking in again lol?

378,"How I boycott capitalism, and why you should too!","As many of us know in here, we are tired of the corruption rampant in the system(s) that we live under. Essentially, it's practically the same thing globally, so I don't think that it's necessary to specify any nations, or specific struggles.

We're all aware that the struggle is there, and at least some of us have come to the conclusion that the reason the struggle is there is because people choose to participate in the system that causes that struggle.

We often feel coerced into servitude by artificial scarcity, and find that it's easier to buckle down and participate in capitalism while condemning it.

This is why I say that if you are within the means to boycott capitalism, then you absolutely should.

Now, what I mean by within the means is this: You are independent (no family to depend on you) and believe that you could handle the life that you would live (in poverty) as a result of boycotting capitalism.

Now, I'm not saying that you should be homeless, or that you shouldn't have a source of income. I'm not even saying that you can't have a job. BUT it would require your own determination for how your boycott of capitalism would play out. But I will tell you how I do it.

I am Schizoaffective, and I am unable to work a job without risk to my health, so I will admit that I am privileged in this regard, but I do believe that my lifestyle is possible for other people, but definitely not for all.

I am on food stamps, and cash benefits while waiting for disability. But this is not necessary for everyone that is trying to boycott capitalism, and this is only a temporary solution anyway.

I am in subsidized housing (I used to be homeless, so I had a pathway into subsidized housing).

I spend very little money, and what money I do spend is spent on things that I believe to not contribute to the exploitative aspects of capitalism as much as possible. That means that the majority of my cash goes to buying things like pot because I haven't seen evidence that the cannabis industry in my state is explicitly exploitative.

If there is something that I want or need, I will attempt to purchase it second hand before purchasing directly from the source. This isn't possible for all things, but you can use your own discretion to determine whether or not you think it is worthwhile to spend money on something.

Now, the last thing that I do as part of my boycott, and this one is the most important: I take the time to understand what I am up against, and why, and I work to refine my arguments and discuss the issues of capitalism with other people.

That is part of my contribution to the world, and it's a big one in my opinion. The world needs more people that are willing to stand up for what is right, and to learn about the issues we are facing and work towards solutions.

I boycott capitalism not because I do not like to work, but because I want to work for people, not money.

**Edit**: I just realized that I implied that I would give a reason for why you should boycott capitalism, and I hadn't quite given that reason, so I'm going to do that now. I apologize for putting this in the edit because I know that some people might miss it if they see this before the edit.

The reason we should boycott capitalism:

Capitalism, as we understand it, is a system by which we use a monetary system in order to trade goods and services.

This, in theory, is an excellent system when you believe that there needs to be payment for every service and good provided.

I am of the belief that people do not need to be coerced into doing things to continue their own survival, as well as the survival of their community. I don't believe that we need to be held hostage on the premise of collective survival.
I believe that the reason it is so common for people to not want to work is because work isn't what it's meant to be. Work isn't a means to continue your survival and comfort. If that were the case, then all jobs would be essential. There would be no Starbucks, or movie theaters, or car dealerships. There would be no tobacco stores, clothing stores, or theme parks. There might be some of those things, but the premise is that if work was about survival, then there wouldn't be so many people working jobs that contribute nothing to our survival.

That is the problem I have with work.

But that's the thing, there are so few people needed to produce all of the essentials of our world that when we think about that fact, it starts to look like we would have one class of people working, and one class of people benefitting from the work. That is not the system I would advocate for. Rather, I would advocate for a system that removes many of the barriers of entry to various fields of work to make it easier for people to follow their passion, and also removing necessities from the list of things that we need to pay money for.

Necessities should be free, regardless of the fact that someone needs to work for them. I would be willing to volunteer much of my time to producing the necessities for our world if we were no longer living in a highly exploitative system, and I think that you would too. I think that most people would. I think that the same people that are working now under a system of coercion would also be working under a voluntary system.",False,g2mll7,SevenSoIaris,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/g2mll7/how_i_boycott_capitalism_and_why_you_should_too/,12,14

They've been paying taxes their entire adult lives, and forced into an economic system where they have no choice other than to participate or be prosecuted, and they feel like they don't deserve help when the system they were forced into crashes? The government won't let me leave capitalism and go fucking homestead somewhere, I'm forced into this thing through property taxes, at the least.

395,Wait... that's not right... POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT WHILE UNEMPLOYED?!,"I don't mean to flex on anyone with this post, I'm just not used to things genuinely getting better and wanted to share a bit. 

I'm 30 and was forced to move in with my grandmother a couple years ago. I kept working with untreated bipolar disorder and undiagnosed ptsd, and had a breakdown less than a year later after the worst job I ever had (stay away from the veneer industry, folks). Things were ok for a couple months with treatment and working part time. I then also started a trade school program that was basically full time. I wasn't passionate about it, just wanted to get out of poverty with an IT job. And between its insane workload and the dumb, life draining retail job I had, my mental health unraveled again. No breakdown, but I got fired early January after I snapped and argued with mgmt over tImE tHeFt (Fuck hardware store chains). I dropped out of the program the next day.

Since then I've been taking advantage of what little luck I have to get monthly SSI checks and have been working on getting set up for college in the fall (looking to get an education that helps me grow food and would also help me get into the cannabis industry). I was struggling to find another job (think I was too honest with my resume), then covid-19 happened and I gladly said fuck it. I could only get warehouse and service industry jobs, and I've wasted enough of my life on them. So I'm focusing on bettering myself now and for the foreseeable future. And I don't think it's coincidence that my mental health has improved dramatically these past few months. Despite a deep phobia of disasters and the end of the world, I'm actually kind of thriving right now.

My sleep is great, I'm getting over old hangups, reading more and getting back into playing music and writing. I'll start working out soon, thinking next week. And I'm slowly regaining long lost confidence.

I know how oddly fortunate I am, so I can't say I have much in the way of advice. I guess this post is something like a ouija board message from heaven. Sort of a taste of life without pointless toil, probably more a rebuke to the workaholic/hustle culture propaganda. I'm only ""hustling"" to be the me I want to be, and it's so much more fulfilling than trying to get into the highest possible tax bracket. We've been lied to, friends. We're worth so much more than the value we create. We deserve incalculably better, in both work and leisure.

I don't know how this pandemic is going to pan out. No idea how long this streak of mine will last. But at least now I have a taste of what to struggle, grow and maybe fight for. The crazy part is that it could be much better than this.

I wish you all more fortune than I've stumbled upon. We all deserve better, and I think we can get it. Unfortunately it's probably going to take a lot of hard work and pain. So please stay safe, stay strong, stay informed, and stay you. Do what you can to look out for your fellow workers, and if you have to work now, keep your dreams alive. Don't let capitalist conditioning snuff your spirit.

Take care, and don't toil too hard. Love ya.",False,g3zwdw,Mecha_Globzilla,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/g3zwdw/wait_thats_not_right_positive_development_while/,7,2

408,One reason I support socialism - dignity in work,"It's crazy to me how capitalism combines both feeling a loss of dignity in your work as well as needing that work to live. What I mean is, every job I've ever had, bosses basically treat workers like shit. Just me, today, I got yelled at for not balancing two impossible tasks and not working past midnight (I'm salary). Myself and my coworkers, I've seen so much yelling, namecalling, chewing out people, etc. And all of this is in the context of if you do bad enough, you lose your ability to provide for yourself through the job. So we're all left to feel like our jobs rob of us our dignity, and if we are ALWAYS in a precarious situation where if we do bad enough, we are in danger of losing nearly everything.

Contrast that to a society where the workers own the means of production. Of course you need to be good and efficient at what you do. But if not... there's always going to be something else you can do instead. No need to feel you need to compromise your dignity or your ability to feed yourself. You work to benefit the community, not the capitalist class.

Hello friends, In 2018, I graduated with a BA in Education and Teaching (Honors; GPA 95) with an emphasis on Citizenship Studies and the Advancement of Youth at Risk.

After graduation, I decided to take a gap year that went beyond and became two and a half years; My father was hospitalized in a serious condition near the time that I finished my degree and had to stay with him for two months of hospitalization and then another two months until we hired a home medical practitioner; Over time, I got more and more lost; I was diagnosed with chronic depression and other medical problems (which do not affect my function); I became an isolated and rather miserable person because of the long unemployment and now I am in paradox, before that I thought I would not be hired because I was unemployed for a long time and then I decided not to send a resume and the gap continues to widen.

How to explain my long-term unemployment so that I can work as a teacher or instructor and start a good career. Or is the situation lost and my whole life destroyed?

In my resume there is quite a bit of volunteer work in various organizations at the municipal and national levels, and for two years during my studies I worked as a therapeutic educational imstructor for at-risk youth. Before that, I worked for two years at a medical information center, as a security guard for a year and worked as a prison guard for three years (age 19-22). That's all my resume.

Help please.",False,g2yvon,sidenotes30,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/g2yvon/how_to_develop_a_career_after_25_years_of/,3,2

435,We are the Problem We are the Solution,"The system is rigged right? You sell your labor, which in turn leaves you timeless and exhausted. In return, you receive the most basic necessities of life; food, a house to live in, etc. When you cannot maximize your labor output, fall sick, etc., you are left behind and life becomes increasingly miserable. 

You see posts of kids hypothesizing that life will be this way. In fact, you almost remember having the same thoughts. Yet you, like most of us, allowed yourself to become 18 with no plan, get a shitty job or try the whole college/trade thing because it was, “normal.”

You have a friend that did this too. It worked for them though. Their dad had money, their uncle had some rental properties, or a friend of a friend got them their start. You think that is how it must work- someone gets a leg up and the world is their oyster.

It’s an easy narrative, it’s more comfortable. It’s also holding all of us back. 

This fallacy is killing us, and it is a fallacy. Sure Buffet’s dad was a congressman, and sure Bezos got a 250k loan. What made these guys different though, is these guys saw the drudgery of everyday life looming ahead. Instead of spending the loan on computers, or hoping congressman daddy will get you out of trouble, these guys decided to work nonstop with no guarantee that it will pay off, in the hope to avoid the treachery. 

These people were willing to work themselves to absolute misery. Misery with no breaks. This much work paid off. However, they have come from a long line of successful people. It seems apparent that intelligence, and a family culture that valued monetary success are also shared between them. Therefore it seems easy to see why that kind of work paid off. Compounding this problem, they feel ok in exploiting the working class because, “they had to work their ass off for it, we should too.” They did, but how can we achieve that when our parents taught us more about football and fixing cars than index funds? No matter what, it still seems unbalanced.

The answer is what we can control. We might not have generations of monetary wisdom, hundreds of millions of dollars to turn the tides, or legislative power, but we are all people. We can all work, and by work I mean the opposite. We can all work to leave the system behind. This means your job, your rent, your insurance, etc. 

If all of us do this, there will be absolute misery, but a new system on the other side. Much more than ever felt by a Bezos type, but it will ensure that their turn is next. Those who understand capitalism or “this game,” cannot exploit those that do not play, and nor will they want to once they see how poor of a world they create without those that generate the wealth. If we can tolerate the pain, we can end the system, and there is no better time than now. People that become rich typically spent their misery in at least some physical comfortability. We won’t have that luxury. However, if we choose to do nothing, that is what we will continue to have.

Question is....will remote working continue for many once COVID is no more? |
ask this because many organizations over the last 10 years have struggled to
adopt WFH. Those who ventured did so cautiously out of concern of losing
control and wondering if their employees put in the same amount of effort
and time as they did so when he/she worked at the office.

Organizations are like parents with a child... we hold their hands as they
struggle to walk and when the moment arrives to let your child walk on their
own we are afraid that our child may fall and hurt themselves. With practice
and time, the child is able to walk on their own because you as the parent had
faith that your child was ready to walk on his/her own.

how can a system that provides comforts such as convenience stores, same day delivery, drive through restaurants and other modern day marvels be considered ruthless? if you can not answer this question, perhaps consider yourself priviliged or uneducated.

from the fact that you work to survive to the point where you feel worthless when you are not slaving away. symptoms of a system that is not working. where people are forced, yes forced to work by being classified as 'essential'. forced to face getting infected by a life-threatening disease.

while many governments around the world have put citizens under a lockdown their thinking that it is a good idea was mostly one dimensional in nature. lock down the country - contain the spread - solve the problem. right?

many people are still out there because the system needs slaves to function. how many articles / stories about not enough protective gear have you seen? cashiers, delivery people, medical personel. each one a potential carrier. each person a potential death. a person, with family, hopes, dreams, aspirations. someone similar to you and me.

politicians are shouting about aid and stimulus packages. blah blah. we hear nothing of taking care or assisting those who have lots their jobs. could lose their homes. years of serving a greedy master destroyed in a few weeks. while all of this is going on a bank near you is probably contemplating how much money it will make from the reposession of houses. forgetting about people living in those homes. the aftermath, financially, is going to be worse than the epidemic.

what governments ( plus big corps and rich people ) don't understand is that while these lockdowns are in effect the world is still turning. dues have to be paid. rent. food. bills. utilities. capitalism is still breathing down our necks while we are not earning money. there is no reprieve. behind all the promises is the idea of getting the system back to normal.

i spoke to the owner of the business where i work a few days ago. i understand his concern and share it. despite the strong anti-work ethic in me i still need to earn a living. but during all the back and forth he brought up something which removed all misconceptions i might have had about him and his apparent caring attitude:

""this (covid-19) shows us, you JUST have to stay healthy and you will be fine.""

privilege is a horrible thing. not being aware of suffering is sad. being blind to the needs, not wants, but needs of people being crushed by a system is sadistic. 

at ground level you hear people talking and online you read articles about how to deal, how to cope. these do not seem to come from the people you would expect. the rich have locked themselves behind closed doors. those who can are hoarding food while those who can not are turning to looting facing criminals charges or worse. the people on the ground, the most affected, are the furtive soil for ideas on how to get through this. the ones looking after each other.

You see, Or. Capitalism had used his

to build companies and corporations that
utilized the labor of millions of wage slaves
to further grow his own personal wealth to
scene levels.

Or. Capitalism used a tiny fraction of a
percentage of his wealth to then get early
access to the hotdog stand so that he’d
never have to actually witness the plight of
the common man who had to actually wait
in line. You know, the common man who

490,Tired of being told to be grateful,"Didn't really know where else to vent about this.

I'm a delivery driver; Which as far as having to work goes is pretty chill. I get to be out and about all day just listening to the radio and dropping off car parts to shops.

Well with all this coronavirus stuff going on work has gotten really slow and there isn't enough stuff to deliver to keep us busy. So our boss has been having us do inventory. It's boring but it serves a purpose so I get it. But its been a few weeks now and we've run out of parts to count in the warehouse.

Yesterday the boss pulls us all aside and says that at least through the beginning of May we are going to only be getting new deliveries three days a week now. I got kind of excited thinking maybe I'd get some more time off.... nope. He said we are still going to be working full time. And since we've already done all the inventory to fill our time we are going to pretty much be playing janitor. I asked him what happens when we clean everything and he said to just clean it again so as to look busy.

So instead of my normal job I have to do one I don't like *and* it's just busy work for the sake of busy work. I'm not accomplishing anything but I'm stuck there for 8 hours a day. 

I was talking with my coworkers and saying I just wanted to go home rather than sweep the floors all day and they all got annoyed at me saying I should be grateful they're keeping us at work and I shouldn't be complaining about 'easy money'. I tried talking to my best friend and my parents and they all echoed what my coworkers said.

I just don't get it.",False,g32q8d,BeatnikFink,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/g32q8d/tired_of_being_told_to_be_grateful/,10,3
491,Why the rush for everybody to go back to work?,"I think I know why you see the billionaires funding right wing protests for people to go back to work now. The extra $600/week payments on unemployment have just started for most people. Now depending on the state average maximum unemployment rate is $450/week. Some states are more generous like Massachusetts with a maximum benefit payment of $823 for an individual or $1,234 with dependents. Some states are horrible like Mississippi with a maximum benefit of $235. Each payment is for a weeks worth of benefits. Average payment is about half the regular wages. For those on the lowest income tiers they are going to make more on unemployment than if they work. While you cannot quit your job and collect unemployment there are now exceptions. If you reasonably feel unsafe working you can. Many grocery stores have been working overtime to secure PPE, install sneeze guards for the cashiers, moving to one way aisles and stuff like that. They do not like having to spend this money but they’re doing this so they do not have to worry about massive resignations and people collecting unemployment. 

Now here is the thing. If you’re earning near minimum wage you’ll likely qualify for $150/week in unemployment. Add the extra $600/week and you’re looking at somebody who was earning less than $300/week now making $750/week. People who are making closer to $15/hour are now going to make close to $900/week instead of the $600/week. Not as drastic but still better. For the average unemployment payment to match the extra benefit payment you’ll need a wage of $20.88/hour in Mississippi and $45.85/hour in Massachusetts. If people get used to this payment over the next two months they will not want to go back to earning between $7.25/hour to $15/hour.

They’re scared of a revolution and we all know it’s going to come sooner or later. They want to push it back as far as they can. They want us to think that a better world isn’t possible.",False,g3tst5,amanor409,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/g3tst5/why_the_rush_for_everybody_to_go_back_to_work/,14,15

497,"A tirade (rant) against the false dichotomy of ""winning""","As you may be well aware the current US President is obsessed over ""winning"". His statements to this idea indicate that he never loses and that the US will win so much we will tire of it. I am tired of it, but not for the assumed reasons of boredom.

I am weary because of the false dichotomy which ""winning"" implies. To ""win"" there must be at least two conditions. 1: we are in a competition. 2: there is at least one loser.

This obsession with ""winning"" isn't Trump's invention. I believe that this obsession is borne from scarcity economics and a economic system built on competition. In short I believe this is a direct fruit of capitalism.

The result of this obsession of ""winning"" is apparent to many of you here. But, there is a more subtle aspect (to me) that worms its way into our behavior. I speak of a dichotomy. This either/or stance and focus on dualism is a root of many difficulties in coming together; us or them; blue or red; labor or capital; poor or rich; black or white; good or evil; winning or losing.

This mentality tends to assume that existance is a zero sum game and that there is finite room and resources (at our current population and resource extraction). I have observed that this kind of simplistic thinking mainly afflicts those of a conservative persuasion but this thinking can effect anyone since it is so persistent in our language.

I would like to say, that I do not wish to win. I just wish to be. I wish to work for my bread and then be left to my books. I do not wish to ""beat"" my brothers and sisters at some economic game (it does not make fun sport). I would rather take a liesurely stroll in the meadow or next to the brook with my brethren and sistren.",False,g3oegq,left_hand_stranger,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/g3oegq/a_tirade_rant_against_the_false_dichotomy_of/,3,1
498,"I usually agree with everything on this sub, to the point in which sometimes I question if I'm actually thinking for myself. Why didn't I agree with this post? Looking for insights.","Like I said on the title, it is absurd how much I agree with virtually everything that is stated on this sub.  But I just saw a post I couldn't agree with and, as usual, I expected people in the comments to 'replicate' my opinions. But it went differently and I wanted to ask for a few more opinions.

It was this post about **'""how unfair it is that YouTubers make a million dollars while dentists make only \[this\] much$$"".** The person accused them of sitting on their asses and what not. 

But the disconnect is weirdly huge, and the bitterness isn't something I appreciate. Do people actually think being a YouTube with a million subscribers is that easy? A quick Google search shows me there's only around 15.000 channels with over one million subs. In the entire world. Of those, I'm betting the vast majority are just music labels and other big companies, not 'creators'. Then, a lot more are probably non-English speaking channels. So really the chances of being the next YouTuber with 1M subs is virtually 0, right? And if it were to happen, it would usually take years of not getting enough money too and building the audience and what not. I don’t want to compare it to other profession, but that doesn’t seem easy at all. 

**I can ABSOLUTELY see how unfair it is that medical professionals aren't appreciated more (not with applauses, but with money) and someone who didn't study anything can make 15.000 times more money,**

But isn't that the system's fault? Why take it out on the YouTubers? And really, if it's that easy and they just sit on their asses, why not do it yourself?

507,"I feel like this is a good subreddit for me, but I don't quite get it","So in my own experience I'm looking for an out of work but I've been focusing on a FIRE retirement plan with smart saving and cutting back. 

My entire life I've been trying to find the ""perfect job where you never work a day in your life"" that my Boomer parents convinced me was out there if I just looked, but after almost a decade of teen years and half my 20's ignoring what made me happy (because it wasn't work) I finally realized that work sucks and I'll probably never find my ""I'm so happy to get up in the morning to go to the office"" job but my path to happiness is being content with my job (the happiest I've been at work was a pressure washing job where I could listen to audiobooks for 9 hours a day) and focusing on what makes me happy, spending time with my kids, reading, biking, spending time in nature.

After looking around Reddit and the internet I came up with a plan to make the most of a life in a shitty system. I can use my parents help they already gave me (I was lucky enough to get help securing a mortgage with my parents help, they were in a position to do so and I know this makes me more privlaged then most people) to make this plan into a reality. In 15-20 years time I can find myself a good houseboat or RV, the mortgage payments I'm on I can get it paid off in 14 years and start renting it out for income, with my income and cutting back on expenses I can save/invest about 300-500 a month to get a good investment portfolio that I'll be able to cover the living expenses of a houseboat with rental income. If all's good I can retire by my mid 40's and be out of the rat race.

So what I'm wondering is do I fit in with this subreddit? I'm sick of work and this escape route is slow but it's the first thing that's made adult life seem worth living since my childhood ended. But my personal solution seems counterproductive to helping others get out of the rat race or changing the system that traps people (since I'm going to be relying on stocks and being a landlord). 

Here's my million questions now. What's the ideal end goal of this group? I see people talking about how much they want to quit but I haven't come across any people talking about how. Would the right path to end the rat race be everybody quits and watches the corporations crumble? A slow migration to off the grid communities focused on living together? Is there a way I can use my situation and my privilege to help combat the rat race? Or am I doing the right thing by focusing on how I can get my escape?

Sorry for the long post and the ramble, I'm really interested in the cause of ending the wage slavery but I'm unclear on what the overall point of the community is and if I'll be able to contribute.",False,g1ldn0,Dazzling_Rhubarb,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/g1ldn0/i_feel_like_this_is_a_good_subreddit_for_me_but_i/,9,8

It changes citizens into taxpayers--so individuals become angry at even the notion of the public good. It changes neighbors into consumers--so the measure of our value as humans is not our humanity or our compassion or our generosity but what we own. It changes parenting into panicking--so that we vote against the interests of our own children; against their health care, their education, their safety from weapons. And in effecting these changes it produces the perfect capitalist, one who is willing to kill a human being for a product (a pair of sneakers, a jacket, a car), or kill generations for control of products (oil, drugs, fruit, gold).

560,Every job I have ever worked made me feel like a slave after a while.,"I'm nearing 40, have been working full time over 15 years (in order, asst. building superintendent, home improvement tech, and now plumbing tech.) The work is physical, hazardous, and dirty, but the pay is supposedly- but not really- good. My back hurts every single day. I never go out or do anything after work because just remaining standing hurts my back a lot... like constant background pain 24/7 and it makes life even worse. Lack of good health insurance means I'll never be able to afford to fix that... if it even is fixable. I damaged my back slowly over many years by working for managers who would say things like ""Scared money don't make no money"", or ""I didn't know I hired a lightweight"", or ""What are you weak?"", or ""If you can't do this, that's fine, I can get Jose to carry twice as much as you do and faster."" etc etc. So I did whatever they told me to do... year after year... just to keep my jobs.. until i just carried too much one day and something tore in my back and it's been hurting every day since.. even when i'm just carrying a 20lb box. I learn to live with the pain, but I won't lie, it makes every day this much harder.

I get up every day between 5 and 6 am, head to a job an hour away, and don't get home till 7 or 8pm.

The pay is supposedly ""middle class"" but where I live, this barely only pays rent, food, and healthcare. Nothing else. There is literally not a penny left over for anything. I have not been on vacation since my 20's.

I could spend the next 5 years getting a plumbing license to increase my income a little bit, but honestly after all expenses to maintain that license, i wouldn't make much more than I am now. And thinking about doing this for more years... when I Think about that every morning after I wake up, it makes me wish I didn't wake up at all.

I looked at other places to live that are more affordable, but the jobs in those areas pay alot LESS, basically cancelling out any savings. This means whatever I do, wherever I live in this world, I will have to work every day for other people until I die.

Is this how everybody lives? check-to-check? Only making enough to pay for a place to sleep and eat so they can keep working every day until they slowly get older, get sick, weaker, lose everyone they knew growing up, and then die in some nursing home alone?

How is this NOT slavery? I don't know how to keep telling myself to go on like this every day... and I hate how everyone else seems okay with this... ""hey this is life""... yes but this is not a free life.. this is slavery life.

I don't want to be a slave anymore... I don't care how much i get paid and promised, i just don't. I'm done with this.. i want to live MY life FOR me. I don't want to spend my only existence helping greedy strangers accomplish their goals by screwing other people out of money. I feel like a slave and a tool, and to top it off, eventhough I do ""essential"" work, I feel like i'm making society worse by charging these people the outrageous prices I am told to charge them... i think this is what society is all about... people trying to screw the next person out of as much money as possible for things they need to survive.

565,A Race to the Bottom,"(Written for [abolishwork.com](https://abolishwork.com) August 26, 2018)  


  
  	For a while now, mainstream articles spurred by Keynesian economic thought have decried that middle class jobs are disappearing. That is to say, those 40,000 dollar or more per year jobs upon which one could live, if not happily, then at least within a modicum of comfort. While automation and the new gig economy (in which stability is a thing of the past) are partly to blame, another, more insidious factor is to blame. 	

In his seminal work *Wealth of Nations,* Adam Smith wrote that people want to spend as little money as possible for anything they buy. Employers want to spend as little money as possible (hence maquiladoras and sweatshops), while customers of any business want to have more savings to sit on rather than less. It hardly need be explained in detail how there are coupon clippers and bargain hunters everywhere trying to squeeze as much as they can out of their shopping experience. 	

While Smith failed to mention was that employers seek to buy the labor of the people who work for them. Labor is a commodity. An individual person can be sized up like a used good at a thrift store. Different people, from a human resources perspective, can appear to have different values. It often happens that an employer will play favorites within the workplace, promoting a newer person that they like better over someone who has been there longer and has been known to be dependable. Evaluation of people is a subjective process, often prone to error. It's impossible for one person to completely know another person, let alone judge their potential. 	

However, it is not only possible but likely for the boss of any company to look at the balance sheets and discover how much money is being earned, how much is being spent. Statistics are far more knowable than individual people. It is for this reason that bosses the world over choose the bottom line over their employees- ie, profit before people. Dollar amounts are just easier to work with. 	

It might come as no surprise then, that many workers are just earning less money. Nowhere is this more apparent than the new, stultifyingly burgeoning online freelance market. Workers in India, who can bid for 3 to 4 dollars an hour, get jobs over American workers who bid 20 dollars an hour for the same position. The boss quickly looks at the numbers and comes up with the following conclusion: 	Spending 16 dollars an hour less means spending 640 dollars less per week, given a 40-hour work week. This leads to a per annum savings of 33,280 dollars. Naturally, any boss who spend tens of thousands of dollars less on employment costs is going to do so. It will take those same workers from India getting wise to the situation and realizing that they too can charge American rates until things really change. 	

As for the traditional, brick-and-mortar jobs, the situation gets bleaker with each passing year. No matter the experience, time spent within a company, or the skills that an employee has acquired along the way, the boss doesn't have much incentive to drastically increase pay for any one person. Supposing that the period of employment (for example, two years) the employee has generally worked well and helped the company make money, the boss has no reason to believe that the state of the company will worsen if raises are not forthcoming. As a result, there is a glass ceiling in wages- a certain point beyond which people cannot get past without changing careers. 	

Although this is good for bosses, it's not so good for employees with inflation increasing every year, taxes increasing, everything becoming more expensive. Apartment rent is, at times, ridiculously beyond what anyone can afford. Student loans are so high that they might as well be called ponzi schemes at this point. Everything costs money- and there isn't much indication that bosses are willing to hand over greater shares of their profits to help fund the lives of people who just happen to work there. There's a race to the bottom to make as much money with a business as possible while spending as little as possible. The phrase, “you get what you pay for” doesn't necessarily apply in such situations- not when an employee is compelled to try their best or else facing having nothing instead of very little. 	Though the unfortunate result, in the short term, is increasing poverty and a disappeared social mobility, in the long term, the result appears to be a bit more fortunate. Talent will always go where the money is. If there isn't any money to be had working in any particular one job, then people will go elsewhere. If working for a boss isn't profitable, people will become their own bosses. 	What employers today do not realize- for they have no incentive to think of business in such a way- is that wages being suppressed in an information age inevitably leads to people changing careers. Internet startups are on the rise because people would naturally have more money rather than less. People are self-teaching themselves how to program so that they can release apps through the Google Play Store to make money. Self-motivated individuals who can learn and grow are slowly walking out of the traditional economy. The people who are left are those who finds themselves stuck in those jobs due to whatever odd circumstance. 	

I can personally attest to how it feels to be stuck in a job, wishing to go elsewhere, not finding any opportunities come open. For a confident, well-read, educated individual like myself, it begins to feel like the system is rigged in favor of those who have massive amounts of capital and resources to call upon- and rigged against those who do not. 	

A cursory glance at the American Constitution provides a glimpse into the mindset of those who were the upper class of society trying to make their own rules about how things should go. They declared that only male property owners could vote- ie, have a say in how the government worked. Women could not vote. Poor men could not vote (though they were most often affected by government decisions). People of color were considered 3/5 of a person in the usual insane governmental attempt to redefine reality itself via legal decree. 	

It was only through prolonged agitation, struggle, and general unrest that all of those restrictions were removed. Fortuitously, no such effort will be required to for employees to improve their own conditions on the job. They need not go on strike and form unions to obtain higher wages, though many undoubtedly will. They need only put down their badge, clock out, take off their uniform, and start working for themselves rather than for others. 	

This process won't be easy. Many won't be able to adjust. Yet, in order to avoid the perpetual race to the bottom, all any employee needs to do is leave the track and stop running. Both financial freedom and financial success are increasingly unlikely to be found by the supposedly beneficent hand of a supervisor, and more likely to be found by self-motivation and self-direction.

583,Employer not providing mask to health-care workers during pandemic,"I work in home health care. My day consists of helping elderly and disabled individuals with personal care (such as bathing, dressing, catheter bag drainage and emptying, other grooming), meal preparation, light housekeeping and socialization. I drive from place to place, typically seeing between 5 and 10 patients per day.

 Since the COVID19 outbreak, coworkers in a different area have recently tested positive. Up to this point, my employer has provided minimal masks and told us we only need them if we have symptoms of if our patient has symptoms. As we know, COVID spreads without symptoms and many infected do not have symptoms. 

We should be provided with masks at least for when we are face-to-face with our patients providing direct care at this point. They still won't let us use them. I can't outright refuse to go to work, but I can refuse situationally for health and safety. For example, I could refuse to provide close contact personal care without a mask. I've had a lot of sick time due to stress about this. My supervisor is supportive but these directives come from higher up. 

I could take an unpaid leave of absence for a month or two, but I would feel like I'm letting my patients down. Many staff are already off work as it is. Refuse every time I need to be face-to-face with someone unless I get a mask? What say you? Thoughts, opinions, advice all welcome!

591,Being laid off is finally giving me the time to work on my health problems,"Due to the virus, I have recently been laid off, as many people have.  I work a physical labor job so working from home is not an option.  It's been wonderful!  I feel so free!  I must admit this feeling is addictive!  But that's not the point of this post.

I have been quite ill over the last 4 years or so.  Everything from chronic fatigue, to anxiety, depression, panic attacks, brain fog, insomnia, breathing trouble, aches, you name it.  At my worst I was nearly bedridden.  Thankfully I'm not nearly that bad anymore.  I do still have severe fatigue, brain fog, anxiety and depression but have been able to go back to work.  

However, work has been one of the main things preventing me from fully recovering.  I am aware of the causes of my personal issues, but working was keeping me from putting a healing plan into action.  

As much as I feel guilty for saying it, and I truly feel bad for those suffering right now, this virus has almost worked out in my favor.  Not having to work has removed my main stressor and given me the time I need to get my life back from depths of chronic illness.  My anxiety and depression has already lightened.  I can now focus on the most important thing in my life, my health.  Nothing else in this world matters if you don't have health.

I'm not worried financially, as I have plenty of money saved and am thankfully able to draw the extra unemployment benefits.  I'll be making more on unemployment then I was working!

Having this taste of freedom just makes me more determined to find a way out of wage slavery!  Hopefully if I can get my health back and after this whole pandemic is over, I can travel like I have wanted to for a long time.  I may not even return to my job I have now.  I really want to move to a warmer state anyways.  But until then, I am so thankful for my time off to focus on what's really important.",False,fyv1sd,JRexrode,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fyv1sd/being_laid_off_is_finally_giving_me_the_time_to/,6,1

We already have confirmed cases at our building, the Dallas ft worth air hub, if you in the area DO NOT SHIP WITH UPS DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING SHIPPED BY UPS WITHOUT GLOVES DO NOT BRING IT IN YOUR HOUSE.

I feel really lost. I write this in hopes of nothing. If you take the time to read all of this, thank you.


I have severe depression and social anxiety. I currently take medication for it (150mg of effexor twice a day) and am not going to therapy as it never helped. I graduated last year from an alternative high school with a certificate, not a degree. I don’t have a job. I work with my mom in housekeeping but I make little money. I have no desire to pursue a career and no path in life that I want to follow. I just don’t give a shit. We waste our lives working to get things that are essential to survive. In our short time on earth, we are slaves to the system. The thought of that depresses me. We aren’t humans, just things that were made to earn and spend money. I genuinely want to kill myself over this. I’m really dumb and have a hard time learning so university and college are out the window. Working in retail and other jobs requiring no degree usually involves talking to others. I wish i could be self-employed and work from home. That would be my dream! Unfortunately there’s really nothing out there that I have interest in. Since the coronavirus pandemic started I couldn’t help my mom so I’ve been sleeping a lot during the day. I sometimes cry for no reason and I’ve been eating my feelings for months which resulted in 30 pound weight gain. I think about death way too often and especially my own. I feel like such a failure but I have no motivation to do anything. I’m stuck in a rut, I can’t be saved. I’m too far gone and I’m going nowhere. If i don’t get a job in two years, I’m ending my life.

622,This sub is largely indistinguishable from a typical socialist/communist sub.,"And while I happen to be quite sympathetic to socialist ideas, I can't help but wonder why this sub even exists. I haven't been around here for too long, but my impression so far is that the majority of people here are anti-capitalist rather than anti-work. Not only does it seem to me like this is missing the point, but it also gives the sub a rather angry tone, something that the internet already has far too much of. It also causes ideas that should be incredibly popular here, like UBI, to actually be downvoted because a UBI is considered a crutch for capitalism and the resident socialists downvote it. I don't know if this sub was always this way or became this way over time, but as it stands, if you asked me whether any given post was from r/antiwork or r/latestagecapitalism, I'd usually have to guess.

With that said, I'm not entirely sure why I bothered writing this out. I fully expect a hostile reaction and I plan to turn off notifications so that I don't have 30 different comments in my inbox all calling me a moronic bootlicker.

653,Why the night before work is worse than the working day itself &amp; How work invades your bed.,"I HATE getting to bed early so that I am well rested for work the next day because it infects my free time, my private time, my sleeping time with WORK. Relaxation turns into work-preparation and my bed is no longer a safe space.

So I stay up until 3am, get up at 7am and feel awful at work all day, because I refuse to give even more hours of free time to work by going to bed early.

For the longest time I was told that my sleeping habits are bad, that I should ""grow up"" and acquire a routine. Tons of articles about changing your sleeping habits rave about how better sleep can help you become more *productive* and *efficient.* In other words become an economically more governable and desirable person. Guess why I feel so much more alive and inspired during the night; there is no labor to be done, no boss to check up on me, no money to be earned or spend. If you, like me, are naturally more creatively 'productive' during the night then you are screwed in a 9-5 economy. Because they don't care about your personal productivity, only about the kind that makes them money. So you go to bed with your boss and make sure you are well rested for tomorrow.

(Subject) How to sell during a crisis?

(Body)
 

Now is NOT the time to stop selling.


If we all stop selling, we will crush our economy. Companies will be forced to shut their doors and lay-off employees.

Those employees won’t have an income to provide for themselves or their families.
They have no choice but to stop buying from other businesses and that’s when the economy collapses.


The economy relies on sales and we must continue to support each other. ❤️


For instance, I’m intentionally pulling out my credit card, going to the websites of friends and clients who run small businesses, and buying stuff… even if I don’t necessarily need anything at the moment.


Why?


Because we’re in this together. 👭


If they go down, we all go down. Get me?


By continuing to buy and sell, you have an opportunity to help sustain our global economy.


So if you have a small business and you know you have to keep selling your products and services… but you also don’t want to come across as tone-deaf or sound insensitive…


Here’s how to sell (in a cool way) during a crisis:

1️⃣ Sell what people NEED


Think about it, why have products like hand sanitizer and toilet paper seen a HUGE spike in sales?

Because people NEED them right now.


So your first question should be: What do people NEED?


In most cases, you won’t need to change your entire business… product or service… but rather the way you TALK ABOUT your business or offer.


So if you’re struggling to sell right now, you might just need to change your message…


2️⃣ Is your messaging still relevant?


If yes: keep going.

If not: change the message.


In a crisis, things change. And people become more focused more on self-preservation than aspiration.


Aspirational marketing is about creating positive emotional reactions for consumers.


Examples that appeal to aspiration include:

How to Get A Bikini Body (In 30 Days or Less)

How to Grow Your Instagram Following . . . Fast!

15 Ways to Travel the World for Free (And Get Paid to Do It)


Self-preservation marketing would be focused less on desires and wants, and more on people’s instinct to protect themselves and ensure their survival during a challenging time.


Marketing examples that appeal to self-preservation include:


How to Protect Your Investments During A Pandemic

Top 5 Tips for Securely Working from Home

How to Save Your Company During A Crisis


So if you don’t want to come across as tone-deaf or sound insensitive, simply shift your marketing message from aspirational to self-preservation.


Here’s the TRUTH about your future…


Your sales will go down, and you will continue to lose clients…


IF you keep doing what you’re doing.


BUT if you have a strategy to PIVOT… then you can secure sales and stabilize your business during the economic contraction we are facing!


I want to help and support, by giving you the exact steps to navigate these extraordinary circumstances.


That’s why I created a NEW roadmap to guide you during this new economy.


If you want to protect your business during a crisis, I can show you how to have a LIFE PRESERVER.


I can show you how to be secure during insecure times…


This is exactly what I'd do to start getting customers and clients consistently in 30 days (. . . even in a recession).


We’re in this together!


All my best,

￼

679,Is the pandemic making anyone else realize how unbearable they find their job?,"I’ve always been firmly in the “work to live” camp and have tried to find ways to work as little as possible, live off a part-time salary, look into early retirement, etc. 

But until the pandemic hit, I had more or less come to terms with the fact that work will have to take up a lot of my time, and that I’ll probably dislike my job but just need to focus on doing the things I care about (for me, music) with the rest of my time. 

However, having my normal routine disrupted by the pandemic - as well as being forced to think about mortality and how short life can be - has sort of jolted me into really realizing how much I dislike the thing I do for most of my day. It’s also just underscored how wrong it feels to be expected to put a large amount of effort and energy into something that I couldn’t care less about, and be continually asked to do things outside of the scope of my work because “we’re a family” (a phrase which makes me want to vomit when applied to work situations). 

I recognize that I am VERY privileged compared to many - my work can continue from home, they haven’t had to do any layoffs yet, and I don’t need to worry about where my income is coming from. But I’m finding it incredibly hard to just get through the workday. Surely some of that is due to the constant background anxiety that I’m feeling these days because of the Covid situation, but I’m also feeling like my tolerance for spending most of my life doing something I hate is taking a permanent nosedive. I was actually really excited at the prospect of a layoff since I’m lucky enough to have some savings and would survive without a normal salary for a little while. 

I’ve been at my current job for about a year, and it’s by far the best paid job I’ve ever had. I will admit, not having to worry about finances has been great. But I’m starting to feel like the mental toll isn’t worth it.",False,fwr8nr,bottleglitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fwr8nr/is_the_pandemic_making_anyone_else_realize_how/,15,1

I was kicked out, good thing i dont trust anyone or the world and saved every penny.

I cant believe this is how people are treated in job market.

701,Two wrongs dont make a right but it made me feel good.,"A decade ago I used to work for a big supermarket. We were asked to arrive 15 minutes early (unpaid) so we could count a till ready for the day; and they made us stay an extra 15 minutes after our shift (unpaid) to count the till with a manager and make sure it balances. I couldnt stand the job and I couldnt stand that they were forcing us into working for free and I mentioned it a bunch of times and each time they said it was the way it was and the way it will always be.

I decided not to make a big thing about it, but to make things fair I would take the equivalent of 30 minutes of my hourly rate in products (roughly $5). I often worked the bakery so that was one perk as I would often bake a few too many cookies and eat them while baking the next batch for customers. Sometimes I'd grab some meat or cheese and write it off on the till as damage and walk to the bins but just eat it. Probably the worst was during a bad day when I was going through some personal stuff; i took a bottle of wine from the shelf and drank it in the bathroom on a break (what was I thinking?!). I only got away with that because I was baking bread in the back and nobody could see me being tipsy.

I never had the balls to take things home. I was never searched in all my time there but still didnt want to chance it. Security wasnt that lax there as a few got sacked for stealing from tills and another few got sacked for returning items that were not there and pocketed the equivalent cash (so the till still balanced - not sure how they catch that).

Anyway, what I did wasnt good and it was clearly theft. I felt they were stealing from me so my actions were justified, but in retrospect it was just a silly risk that I was doing on principle.

It makes me wonder how common this stuff is and if a lot of people were doing similar things.",False,fzp1vw,flyinghorse1,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fzp1vw/two_wrongs_dont_make_a_right_but_it_made_me_feel/,7,8

This car costs $760 a month! I never knew that until then. So, fast forward a year later and I’ve been paying on this car like a slave and working overtime to afford it. Then I had to take off work for three months after moving to a different state and wait on my new professional license to legally work. I could not make the payments in that time frame, and I no longer want to make the payments. I am tired of working within a career that I hate, and I want out of this country (United States).

# PLEASE reach  out to Aldi and ask them : ""What is Aldi planning to do to stay  competitive with other essential retailers like Home Depot?""

You can leave feedback on their website, but posting publicly on their  social channels would also be great. That is exactly what prompted Aldi  to offer senior citizen hours in the stores. Customers’ opinions really  do impact Aldi’s actions.

I've been tired of it for a while, the job itself, the people, the politics, but with the recent spread of Covid-19 I've never felt so disappointed in my co-workers and management. Many of my co-workers do not think the pandemic is serious or will effect them in any way, and because we were classified as essential, some people are working 60+ hours a week and expecting others to do the same. Management doesn't seem to think it is serious, and when people bring up concerns to them, they get defensive. Over the past week or two management started implementing some changes, like allowing office workers to work from home, but the workers in production are told to clean their workstations, and keep distance. That's basically it, with zero enforcement. I took it upon myself to work different hours, opting to work in the afternoons outside of core hours, and while management accepted this, one of my co-workers (and good friend, up until now apparently) is giving me the cold shoulder and will not speak to me. Another one of my co-workers is currently visibly sick with a cough and sinus problems, and he still shows up every day. Management has their heads in the sand. They just seem to pretend like it isn't happening.   


  I work around many vulnerable people. Of the 4 people I work around closest every day, one is 70+, one 65+, one in his 50's and overweight, the other is in his late 40's and smokes.

811,I wanted to do part-time but I'm legit not even good enough for any job in the town..,"I wanted enough free time for myself left, yet need to help my household in the income area a little bit. However, it seems I can't find any job which I can actually do, because

- I'm a massive introvert. I'd rather avoid not deliberate social interaction

- I've almost always been alone on my own. so I'm really social awkward so nothing really helps that much. Another issue is, that I am not too much interested of what ""others"" think of me, which makes it harder to even come through the interview process, because I'm simply not interested in licking someone's boot; I simply want to try to offer my working power for exchange of fair money, guess in a *capitalism* system this isn't the best mindset.

- I enjoy solitude. I'm a somewhat thinker, although I haven't publicly showed it yet, considering for example that my grammar is not to the point yet where I am absolutely sure I convey what I want to convey.

- I'm not that fit to lift heavy stuff, although I try to improve on my overall fitness status, there's still a long way to go and I'll never reach a state where I can easily lift stuff, because I'm simply not interested and too lazy to constantly work out for hours a day. Currently I try to ""sprint"" job 2 to 3 minutes (building it up currently to do more minutes) per interval and doing about 4 to 5 intervals a day.

- I can't stand bullshit. In my view for example an accountant is just a bullshit job to do. All this learning for basically no benefits. Also in other areas, like being nice to a customer although he's rude to me or similar stuff, where I am forced to act even though I do not want / I am not like that in person. 

So I think these tools I have available to somewhat do work with:

- Fast typing

- A good amount of knowledge about the internet, or rather how to use it.

- maybe, just maybe the fact that I somewhat understand English to the point I would be able to *understand* academic language.

But you ain't getting paid for being a philosophist, or for playing games (non-professional). So I currently have no other choice but to be in a job/apprenticeship seeking welfare, where I get healthcare and $200 income directly given to my family for seeking an apprenticeship.

My ultimate issue here is, that I absolutely cannot go to bed early, so an apprenticeship starting early is basically a no-go (but as far as I know they all do), nor am I too interested in anything yet to do it for 8 hours a day. Heck, I have about 5 interests overall currently and I balance them out over the day, maybe making them at best 2 to 3 hours a day per interest.

I know this problem is quite complicated and I searched for an answer for quite some time already. Has someone lived through a similar thing and have some experience to share? I'm really lost for any way to get out of this dilemma.

818,"So I’d hate to work for someone else and have to compromise my life for the right to live, I want to earn money as a musician, entertainer, artist, writer, and cam girl, problem is though","I’m not a creative person, when I sit down at my piano I don’t know what to do, how can I live when I cannot create, also I’m trans so I can’t just live money-free with the help of soup kitchens and breadlines, I need constant income to pay for my hormones, electrolysis, voice training, ect. 

I’m going to Berklee College of Music and majoring in songwriting and composition, I don’t like learning online all that much because I like people to help me understand things in person, learning how to write a song using an online source is like trying to learn how to swim from a YouTube video and then testing it out by trying to swim in the middle of the ocean, it allows you to learn vast amounts of knowledge, far faster than your ability to apply that knowledge

so my plan to make money is make friends at Berklee, start a band and learn how to write songs, transition, when I eventually feel comfortable with my self become an entertainer and promote my self and the band through social media, be a cam girl as a hobby, write music as a livelihood, maybe live with my friends until I can live on my own, write novels in my spare time, and live my life as a free person, able to express my self how I want

I’d rather starve to death in the streets than to work for someone else 

but I’m scared, I’m scared that I won’t be able to do this, I’m scared for my safety, my life, my health, the fear of missing out isn’t the only reason I want a relationship and to lose my virginity before I graduate high school, another reason is I’m afraid if I don’t do it before then, I might never get to before the cruel hands of the bourgeois forces me to bite the dust

I don't know what i want to do i life what the fuck. I don't want to end up doing mortgage (i don't know what that is but sounds like it sucks lol). I have seen the adult life here and i think it sucks to just go to college and then score a job to feed your ego and consumerist needs. My only hobbies are to play bass guitar and read. I dont like to do anything else. I don't want to swim in the job market when I get older, I don't want money to take my life and desires away. Seems like I am doomed to this and I don't know, I think it sucks. Mostly because I get a lot of weirdos looking at me, I don't know if it's because I don't look white or black, I don't know.... Im a weirdo here and i dont have any friends and i dont want to work to just pay bills and be happy buying stuff that I don't need. I'm pretty scared.

835,"My mother is a cultist, and I hate myself for having been one too.","So I ( graduating Uni student, 22/M) happened to be around my mother when the television was showing the striking Amazon workers. I commented that it was good that people were finally starting to protest, and my mother says something along the lines of “but amazon is donating 100M to the Covid efforts, why are they doing this?” Before, she praised amazon for giving people 15 dollars an hour and was planning to apply there since she lost her part time job around this time and was in danger of losing her main employment (not bothering to research the grievances caused by Amazon while singing their praises; also it’s quite telling that we’re conditioned to accept decidedly minor changes such as a 15/hr wage as “progress”.

This is the same person who endlessly tunes to religious televangelicals more than ever at this time to assuage her fears about the world’s state as a result of the virus, and believed in some hoax about cell-phone radiation.  She also believes in the cult of hard work (anyone can be rich if you work hard) and seriously believes that the US is the best country in the world (she’s a Nigerian immigrant, and despite having gone to college in Europe in a much-less stressful environment by her own admission, sees America as a place of “opportunity” where “anyone” can make it, citing her relatives and their children as examples.

My point in saying all this is that the only person less intelligent than her was me at just 18 years old, for succumbing to the endless propaganda that both my school and mother imposed on me (go to college or you’ll be POOOOR), for not having the intelligence to do his own research and mindlessly picked a major (computer science) just to assuage my propaganda-driven fears and to get my mother to shut up. And after 2 years and some major switches, when I eventually wanted to drop out because the major I was doing (music, for the sake of “getting a degree”) wasn’t in line with my solutions for supporting myself in the future (aviation career as an idea), I was told to finish because it wasn’t “within [my mother’s family’s] pedigree to not have a degree”. So me, already being in debt, and already 2 and 1/2 years in with no idea as for other viable options, listened.

I hate the state of the world, and I hate myself for having been born into this mess and having sealed my own fate by not having the clairvoyance to see past propaganda so that I could have actually formed viable strategies before it was too late. I hate myself for having listened to an education system that I’ve always despised even in my adolescence as well as my mother who is completely incapable of doing her job (EFL teaching) because she doesn’t know how to use a computer. I hate myself for not having the potentially life-saving knowledge that I only have now much earlier. I still utterly despise education and the cultism surrounding it (to my mother and many others, it’s a place of learning and opportunity) when it’s bullshit and it’s meant to crush your spirit to prepare you for wageslavery. And I hate that the system has won. I may not have accepted wageslavery in my heart, but consider my spirit crushed.",False,fvztaj,EstrangedNeko,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fvztaj/my_mother_is_a_cultist_and_i_hate_myself_for/,4,1

840,I returned to work this evening.,"First of all let me fill you in a little on my background as it will help you understand my decisions. So I used to be in the us army as a 74d or chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear operations specialist. The unit I spent most of my time with specialized in mass casualty events (think bombings, chemical and biological warfare, radioactive fallout). 

So this covid 19 pandemic would have been right up our alley. Fast forward to about a ago. I'm at my current job, a manufacturing plant. I've been watching this virus spread like everyone else. I tell my wife that we as a country are fucking this up. We aren't doing anything we should be doing. 

So I go to work and ask if they have any plans to shut down or layoff to help curb the spread here. I literally get laughed at. So I scheduled every single bit of my vacation in the hopes that by the time I'm supposed to come back they will have understood the severity of the situation. 

I find out through Facebook while on this vacation that we were considered an essential business. And while that may be true in an extended scenario if we were to just close the doors for a month or so the world would never notice, we manufacture parts for semi trailers. 

So this evening is my first day back. On the door there's a paper stating that visitors must stay 6ft away from us, employees must take their temperature an hour before their shift and call in for anything 101 degrees   or higher,  and must wash their hands or use sanitizer on every break. I get to my pre shift meeting that we have every shift and my supervisor tells me that for the past week our plant has had atleast one person daily have to go into quarantine. 

Yet here we are still making trailer parts, risking our own and eachothers lives because of rich people not wanting to lose out on any money. I wish that I could bring myself to just walk the fuck out. But I still have things to pay for. My landlord doesn't give a fuck about the virus, my city's water doesn't give a fuck, my Internet provider doesn't give a fuck, only my electric company has decided to defer payments.

 Is it time to take to the streets in massive numbers yet?  I'm so ready.",False,fvnea4,ShabbyPath,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/fvnea4/i_returned_to_work_this_evening/,4,3
841,Mom tries to push me into jobs I don't like,"So I am currently in the status ""seeking apprenticeship"" welfare program, so I get about ~$200 paid directly to my family (""child money"") and health care. Until I'm 25 I cannot get the real welfare program called ""Hartz IV"" (rent paid, health care + ~$470). 

I'm living in a town and there's just bullshit jobs like grocery stocker. Legit, underpaid, too drawn out hours because capitalism does its capitalism things. 

Literally all jobs in town are some bullshit. Honestly, I'm not made for the traditional bullshit job. I'm not interested either, so I can't just force it, I'll get next to zero production done after I get bored, which gets easily to after just a few hours.

Also there's this other problem that I sleep until 9 a.m. otherwise I'm sleep deprived, so I can't do the usual 9 to 5 or 10 to 6 job. Nor do I want to, because I'm seeking to do my hobbies, otherwise life is boring... It's a real issue, which is why I thought staying forever in this job program, however it might hurts my family because I'm not the only one. My sister has to sit out a few months to be officially 25, so my family pays her health care... and she could be in the same status as me, but they're apparently too proud to and so when she hits 25 she won't go in probably. I said she should several times, so maybe she actually will.

So all in one it's nothing I can do about. Every day I'm forcing myself to learn Japanese a bit and English grammar, so that I have a chance in translation later (or writing a story.). By the way, I'm not a native, but I'm a sucker in my native language. 

So in my point of view I can only try to force myself to stay into this welfare for my own sake and health... School was already hell for years, I forced myself through it and burned out pretty much.

So... I despise working full time. My current plan has been to upskill, get certs, leverage experience and then look for internal move part time. 

Internal opportunity has come up to work 3 days instead of 4,    in a better job, with no management, but it'll take a good chunk off salary if I accept. Same hourly rate, less hours, I can still pay my bills though. My thinking is I'll also pay less tax, petrol, eat healthier, and it will improve mental health.

I've trimmed my expenses (phone contract, bills etc), paid car off, and stopped buying unnecessary stuff.

875,"The Virus Is a Reminder of Something Lost Long Ago; In rebuilding a broken world, we will have the chance to choose a less hurried life","&gt;The frightening COVID-19 pandemic may be creating such a change now—by forcing many of us to slow down, to spend more time in personal reflection, away from the noise and heave of the world. With more quiet time, more privacy, more stillness, we have an opportunity to think about who we are, as individuals and as a society.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Habits of mind and lifestyle do not change easily. Without noticing, we slowly slip into the routines of our lives, like becoming so accustomed to living on a noisy street that we cannot remember our previous neighborhood and a time of silence. Some powerful force must strike to awaken us from our slumber. Now we have been struck. We have a chance to notice: 
**We have been living too fast**. We have sold our inner selves to the devil of speed, efficiency, money, hyper-connectivity, “progress.”


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Since the Industrial Revolution, the pace of life has been driven by the speed of commerce and business. And the speed of business, in turn, has been driven by the speed of communication...The resulting increase in productivity in the workplace, coupled with the time-equals-money equation, has led to our acute awareness of the commercial and goal-oriented uses of time.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;We have created a frenzied lifestyle in which not a minute is to be wasted. The precious 24 hours of each day are carved up, dissected, and reduced to 10-minute units of efficiency. We become agitated and angry in the waiting room of a doctor’s office if we’ve been standing by for 10 minutes or more. We grow impatient if our laser printers don’t spit out at least five pages a minute. We cannot sit quietly in a chair for 10 minutes. And we must be connected to the grid at all times. We take our smartphones and laptops with us on vacation. We go through our email at restaurants, or our online bank accounts while walking in the park.

&gt;We have become slaves to our “urgent” appointments and to-do lists and addiction to nonstop stimulation by the external world. A momentous but little discussed study by the University of Hertfordshire in collaboration with the British Council found that the walking speed of pedestrians in 34 cities around the world increased by 10 percent just in the 10-year period from 1995 to 2005. And all of this has happened invisibly. Little by little, the noise and speed of the world have increased, so that we can hardly remember an era of slowness and quiet, when we could let our minds wander and think about what they wanted to think about, when we had time to consider where we were going and what we believed in.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Suddenly we find ourselves alone with our thoughts. (Excluded here are such people as the *heroic* workers in health care and in grocery stores, and parents with young children or elderly relatives needing constant attention.)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Even for those who continue their professional life working online, schedules have become more flexible. Demands have retreated. Daily routines have been interrupted. We suddenly have unstructured, free-floating, beckoning time. This terrible disaster has freed us from the prison of our time-driven lives. At least for a few months, we have the chance to slow down. In the past, we’ve had little opportunity to do so, swept along by the rushing tide of prosperity and speed in the modern world.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;What might be regained with a less hurried life? As many people have noted, there is simply the needed replenishment of mind that comes from doing nothing in particular, from taking long mental walks without destination, from finding a few moments of quiet away from the noise of the world. The mind needs to rest. The mind needs periods of calm. Such a need has been recognized for thousands of years. It was described as early as 1500 B.C., in the meditation traditions of Hinduism. Later in Buddhism. An ancient passage from the Buddhist Dhammapada reads: “When a monk has gone into an empty place and has calmed his mind, [he] experiences a delight that transcends that of [other] men.”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Psychologists have long known that creativity thrives on unstructured time, on play, on non-directed “divergent thinking."" Gustav Mahler routinely took three- or four-hour-long walks after lunch, stopping to jot down ideas in his notebook. Carl Jung did his most creative thinking and writing when he took time off from his frenzied practice in Zurich to go to his country house in Bollingen, Switzerland

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;In a 2007 clinical report for the American Academy of Pediatrics, the physician Kenneth R. Ginsburg wrote that “play allows children to use their creativity while developing their imagination, dexterity, and physical, cognitive, and emotional strength.” Yet “many [children] are being raised in an increasingly hurried and pressured style that may limit the protective benefits they would gain from child-driven play.”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But there is something more to be regained, something more subtle, more delicate, almost impossible even to name. That is the restoration of our inner selves. By inner self, I mean that part of me that imagines, that dreams, that explores, that is constantly questioning who I am and what is important to me. My inner self is my true freedom. My inner self roots me to me, and to the ground beneath me. The sunlight and soil that nourish my inner self are solitude and personal reflection. When I listen to my inner self, I hear the breathing of my spirit. Those breaths are so tiny and delicate, I need stillness to hear them, I need slowness to hear them. I need vast silent spaces in my mind. I need privacy. Without the breathing and the voice of my inner self, I am a prisoner of the frenzied world around me. **I am a prisoner of my job, my money, the clothes in my closet. What am I? I need slowness and quiet to ponder that question.**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Sometimes, I picture America as a person and think that, like a person, our entire nation has an inner self. If so, does our nation recognize that it has an inner self, does it nourish that inner self, listen to its breathing in order to know who America is and what it believes in and where it is going? If citizens of this nation, like me, have lost something of our own inner selves, then **what of the nation as a whole? If our nation cannot listen to its inner self, how can it listen to others? If our nation cannot grant itself true inner freedom, how can it allow freedom for others? How can it bring itself into a respectful understanding and harmonious coexistence with other nations and cultures, so that we might truly contribute to peace and well-being in the world?**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Such self-reflection, such tending to the inner self, is not a onetime event. It should be an ongoing part of a life lived deliberately, to use Henry David Thoreau’s language. And that deliberate living requires an enduring change of lifestyle and habits. At some point, the coronavirus will pass...For years, we will be trying to rebuild the broken world. But perhaps the slower lifestyle in these months can help put the pieces back together. And perhaps a more contemplative, deliberate way of living can become permanent.

Then, during my undergrad, I both realised the amount of exploitation and misery present in academia, and became disabled with a chronic pain condition.

I managed to graduate, with poor grades and little opportunity to pursue further education without massive hurdles (given limited finances practically impossible to overcome), and I'm now faced with the drab reality of life outside of, what I realise now is a fairly sheltered uni experience. My country luckily gives some disability payout (albeit not enough to live on my own so I'm staying with my parents), and healthcare, which is giving me the ability to try a laundry list of medications to help my (complex) medical situation.

Turns out, I didn't respond well to most medical options and I'm now trying one of the last options available for my condition. Of course I hope that I'm cured, or at least helped, by this, as the alternative is a lifetime of pain, but there's also a sense of dread that I'll be completely fine in a few months and removed from disability benefits to face the job market again. Because of my bad grades and lack of real experience, in part caused by my medical condition, I'm unable to get a job in the only field I believe I could find any sliver of joy in in the foreseeable future, which means I'd be forced to take on the sorts of jobs I've despised in the past in order to get by, as I'd love nothing more than to move out and gain some independence, as well as being able to have a social life at all outside of my immediate family. If I were to be declared permanently disabled, as opposed to currently being in treatment, I would get a bigger disability payment, allowing me to do just that, but again. A lifetime of chronic pain. 

To the point of my post, there's been a recent scandal in my country surrounding disabled rights, as payments were being cut and abled people stating no one deserved that much for ""just being at home all day"". This of course prompted disabled and chronically ill people to declare that they would much rather be healthy and in a terrible, unfulfilling job. To some extent I agree, I would do almost anything to get better, to feel like I have value, that I'm not a leech, to talk to people without feeling ashamed of being useless, but at the same time I can't fully embrace this movement due to anti-work mentality. 

Given the choice between physical pain and deep depression and misery regarding my everyday life, I'm not sure I could make that choice. I'm stuck between hoping my medications help and give me some relief, and dread I'll have to return to what amounts to mental torture for the next fifty or so years. At the same time, I can't find any solace in disabled communities who would love nothing more than to rejoin ""normal, productive society"" and all that entails.

903,Sunday night insomnia turns out to be an actual thing! DAE have this?,"I have always had sleeping problems and insomnia, but today, my eyes were opened. I got promoted 9 months ago (please read: I was assigned to a new position comprised of much more difficult tasks than I had before, a huge workload and a lot more responsibility, but somehow still paid the same as my old position for the first 6 months, i.e. less than half of what my colleagues in the same position make- now I make slightly more! Yay! /s). 

With the new job, I am so tired all the time, I actually started sleeping 5-7 hours a night (still tired, though) almost every night. Except of course SUNDAY. I can never goddamn sleep on Sunday nights! And I realized a few weeks back why: because I'm so angry/frustrated about the fact that weekends go by so fast and I feel like I never have any time for myself so I subconsciously work myself up into a state where I can't sleep, so I can have just a few more hours to myself, doing things I enjoy! It's the same reason why I get so angry when I have to leave work even 10 minutes late. 

And so my Mondays are always shitty (just like now). I'm so goddamn sleepy and 100% sure i'm not doing my best on Mondays. (Also, usually by Friday I'm fried, so that's probably also not my most productive day of the week). And I was thinking- for the 18373636280094th time: had I had a 3 day weekend I would probably be a bit more productive and definitely a much happier, balanced person. Just one extra day would make such a change for me! And for a lot of people!! 

Tl, dr: sorry for the longest rant. Basically, I can't sleep on Sunday nights because sleeping would feel like cheating myself out of a few extra hours I could dedicate to my hobbies, since my job is already stealing too much of my time. Randomly Google searched 'sunday night insomnia' and it turns out it's an actual thing, some surveys saying 1 in 4 people experience do. Do any of you have it too?
