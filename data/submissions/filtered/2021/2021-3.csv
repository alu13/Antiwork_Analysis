19,Automation,im writing this to address some misunderstandings about automation  specifically these articles coming out about the stretch warehouse robot  the issue is that a lot of these articles are actually just antiunion propaganda since amazon workers are trying to unionize and are basically just corporate terrorism  i was reading one of these articles about stretch a warehouse robot with an articulating arm with the undermessage of the article being this will replace warehouse workers  and it is union propaganda because making a robot similar to stretch is childs play for boston dynamics a company funded by darpa which is a us govt entity that creates alien technology  highschool students can make something like stretch this isnt some big development because we dont have millions of boston dynamics teams to service every amazon warehouse on earth  the issue is most people didnt read the article  this warehouse robot is still piloted by someone  all this development really reflects is a further alienation of the worker from their labor  there will still be someone who needs to pilot this triumph of automation  there will still need to be someone to code and upgrade its programming someone at the call center to service troubleshooting there will still need to be someone to manufacture its parts someone to do maintenance someone to dispose of it when it has outlived its usefulness  you will always need someone somewhere to mine the very ore that its components are made from out of the earth  the issue that any form of automation will constantly run into is that it posits that the goal of capitalism is the preservation of and slow growth of capital rather than growth by any means necessary  as soon as a machine replaces some job for humans the human workforce will be thrown back into the fire once more they will always find a job for them because  this is an all hands on deck situation  any automation simply accelerates the growth of capital  if this stretch robot were to be adopted by amazon one possible situation is that they are able to now demand more of their workforce since they are no longer performing physical labor  they will probably be under more intense mental and scheduling demands controlled more effectively as their capitalists demand a more unreasonable output from their workforce due to human limits being addressed  that satirical wage cage where you need to ask your manager to unlock your articulating arm cage to go to the bathroom immediately comes to mind   as long as capitalism exists there will never be true automation there will never be a genuine removal of the need for some worker  workers will only be further alienated their position in the processes of capitalim will be devalued and further exploited  as industry becomes more and more sophisticated through the use of more sophisticated machinery workers will transition into more specialized jobs to sustain a more and more industrialized workforce  this also makes the whole society more precarious as it depends on a constantly shrinking workforce that no longer can comprehend the immensity of processes that hold up that society,mh6erf

24,Being squeezed dry,i work for a community mental health center in a small midwest city i worked my way up from part time to full time case management with kids i used to really enjoy working with kids but now all i can see is us breaking them like horses and indoctrinating them into the cult of work  i recently attended a training for aba therapy for kids with autism and the whole training felt inhumane and like we were training the kids like dogs to make matters worse my peers were all very excited for this training mostly new hires who all spoke to how applicable the training was in our work with clients  i really pride myself on my relation with the kids on my caseload and that they feel like i am a safe space to discuss troubling things in their lives or that they can just let go and be themselves around me the center i work for though continues to heap new work onto the position because they  reorganize over and over and over again and every time its the lowest paid fulltimers who get a slew of new paperwork as part of the expectation for the position i have watched the center roll back expectations for paperwork completion from a week to three days to one day now over the course of three years the standard for service delivery has risen higher and higher too despite evidence that the effectiveness of the services decreases as caseloads become higher i feel it is clear and plainfaced that the organization is trying to squeeze as much out of their low wage staff as possible  i have no delusions that the university i attended pushed me through my social work degree i was a stem major and floundered for years i was never particularly prepared to live on my own and my schoolwork suffered imagine my surprise when i switched to a social work degree and started getting straight as  so here i am i dont know what to do moving forward i want to go back to school i want to find a new job but more than anything i just want to be happy my grandfather passed recently and he was a forklift driver with the same cannery for 45 years i used to wonder how he could work the same job for so long or get fulfillment from a job he wasnt personally passionate about or made a difference in other peoples lives but i have realized how foolish i was to make that judgement that rather than living to work he worked to live with consistency and mutual respect to provide for the people he loved and the position he was in is really the best we can hope for  love yall and today the only power i feel i have is in sharing my experience,mhcp9n

28,I need to unsubscribe from this subreddit for my own mental health,the us laboreconomy systems are really fucked i think we all understand that i agree with 99 of the posts of this subreddit whenever im scrolling through reddit which is most of my free time i just get really depressed whenever i look at posts on this sub it just reminds me how messed up of a system i was born into hospitals are businesses employers are greedy and quality of life is not a priority for our leaders i am apart of the working class i work full time i pay rent that is more than a mortgage i will never be comfortable enough to have my bills on auto pay i know the top 1 percent run this country whether i like it or not i wish for them to be taxed more but it will never happen because they are the ones supporting politicians they just hide behind their tax shelters and use bank accounts in other countries to avoid taxes i understand that some people believe that taxation is theft but its not fair that i pay more taxes than some millionaires if the government is stealing from me than they should be stolen from too im literally unsubscribing from this sub just to help me ignore the truth because if i dont i just get depressed like it or not there is nothing we can do about it we can join together and try to vote in politicians that will try to do good but it will never happen money is power thats why bernie has dropped out in 2016 and 2020 because he is anti billionaires and since billionaires run the government they will never fund him enough to win the democratic party they will just push through the guys that will do nothing about it billionaires will just fund the guys that will leave them alone politics arent about helping the people of this country they are about helping themselves we will never see a federal minimum wage increase we will never see better health care and we are all just gonna have to live with it whether we like it or not,mgxcw9

44,"At work, bored out of my mind, and need to rant about the insanity work can cause.",you just wake up eat work come home try to destress but you cant so you resort to stress eating or absorbing your mind into video games then barely get any sleep because your sleep is spent dreaming about the work you hate because of how burnt out you are on it you constantly get stuck in a backbreaking infuriating cycle of work never able to destress delving further and further into the realm of an almost schizophrenic level of insanity until the day you die constantly being bent over and fucked in the ass by corporatepsychopath bosses who are incapable of viewing you as a human being  example my old boss often showed signs of psychopathy but the moment that took the cake was when one of my coworkers quit because our boss got mad that she needed to take a day off due to her sister having complications during childbirth and she needed to be with her in case anything happened his exact words to her were so youre going to let this get in the way of your job work before family fun joy happiness physical health etc  you dont get paid based on how hard you work you get paid based on how hard you are to replace and thats just the truth you work like what 260 days a year sacrificing time that could be spent with your family and loved ones selling your soul at a place you hate just to afford basic human necessities that are by default denied to you then get a 1 week vacation per year if youre lucky to get one at all until the day you die or are too old to be able to work wtf i cant do this i love my girlfriend but in the long run i cant see myself living such a meaningless existence ive already attempted suicide before prior to meeting my girlfriend partly because of personal issues and childhood troubles and partly because of the maddening infinite cycle of work im starting to fall into the same cycle of thoughts that lead me to my first suicide attempt the only difference this time is i have something holding me back and preventing me from doing it which is the fact that with how close we are my girlfriend would fall into as dark a state of mind as mine if i were to die a breakup sure she could move on but i know for a fact that even postbreak up she would be completely devastated if she found out i died so i cant do that to her   honestly the idea of having a family sounds nice but im torn on actually having one because im not sure if i want to force more souls into this world our potential kids just so they can then be forced to endure the same cycle of bullshit that me and her go through its cruel yeah unlike my childhood our kids would have a great magical early life but i cant save them from the dreary maddening onslaught of bullshit that the world will greet them with when they become adults   idk man i just need to rant i dont understand the people that can delude themselves into thinking that work is meaningful and that youre not a good human being if you dont sell your soul to a corporation every day until the day you die,mgod0y

55,Some thoughts about bootstraps,i feel like there is some merit to the whole pull yourself up by your own bootstraps arguement obviously you should expect food and labor when you yourself have done nothing to deserve it it should be a sort of trade a trade of one kind of energy for another  but the thing is with how companies are operating the company owners themselves are doing just that especially with the larger companies they are not providing a fair trade of energy the workers take the brunt of the labor and energy expenditure then get a small percent of what their work is worth these company owners are the ones who arent pulling their bootstraps they steal the energy from their workers that they dont deserve and this causes a debt   i think this is also the cause of many of us average folks not being able to afford our own existence now because the company owners literally stole it from us we did pull ourselves by oyr bootstraps we work hard we deserve the fruits of our labor  but people like the owners of these huge corporations corrupt government officials landlords etc they dont do their share but then they steal our energy without doing the work to provide back for it and thats why our economy is shit and why average folks cant afford shit because the fruits of our labor is being stolen by lazy people who cant pull their own bootstraps and instead steal other peoples fucking boots  this is why i agree with many who are starting to say that localism is the answer it helps to elliminate this debt by us average folk providing a fair or as close to fair as we can get exchange of energy the answer is to stop supporting businesses that steal their employees boots   thats my thoughts neither right nor left are wrong we do need to pull ourselves by our own bootstraps but we also need to stop companies from leeching off of our hard work,mhi0lq

58,Ramblings about some ideas I have about work,is it possible to reframe our thinking about work so we can live happier lives is the word work the issue here i understand the need to be paid for ones services but what if instead of seeing it only through the perspective of a job for which we receive payment if instead we saw it as a project   lets say you have a personal project that you really want to work on working on that project will bring fulfillment to your life no matter if you get paid or not similarly we can think of companies as the way for the owner to fulfill his project or projects if you are not happy working on such a project you can always move to one you are happy with if you are happy with even an administrative role within that overall project then thats good for you would time be better invested in the long run to trying to find and becoming qualified to do that job  another idea is if you dont want more control over your own future then one should think about creating their own business you get to be independent and can treat employees how you would like to be treated personally if i were an owner of a business i would place the human aspect of recruitment first and foremost  ive also been thinking about what i actually want to do in life and wondering if its sustainable the first big issue i have is trying to live an independent lifestyle and moving out from a fixed 95 schedule maybe farm life would suit me i get to grow my own food i could have solar panels to power my home there would be few things i would have to pay the government im a software engineer so i could think about working remotely from there too   another thing i would consider is instead of constantly looking for a promotion and climbing the ladder or learning new technologies i would instead take a job im overqualified to do something artistic or creative maybe this way ill be valued more for my work and i can do the job with relative ease after a certain point having an extra bit of money is not important id rather focus my energy of budgeting and optimizing   anyways thats my thoughts feel free to pick them apart im still learning how to approach the world of work and life in general without losing my sanity,mgi5hd

95,I tried to do it right.,ive tried my best i really did   i got trained in a trade but i have a neurological disorder that would prevent me from ever working in that trade professionally the trade school had no trouble taking my money knowing they were training me for something i had no chance of working in    so i got a degree in a thing i love and do well heres a loan everybody said that jobs wouldnt care what the degree was in they said that it just mattered that i had a degree   then they started saying that i had wasted my time getting training in the thing that i love so i got a degree in the thing that was supposedly lucrative that i hate but so many people did the same thing that the job market was flooded with people who had the same skills   i send out dozens of applications a day knowing that 50 are probably fake or just companies farming data i lie in interviews about liking highstress fast paced work environments i pretend to give a rip about company values as if a company were an entity that could have values   i take the jobs i can get i have three 60 hours per week with an incredibly varied schedule that precludes making plans of any sort but theyre minimum wage contract jobs with no benefits i daydream about having dental coverage keeping teeth is a luxury i guess   now im faced with a tide of people telling me to just get a side hustle its my fault that im not on top of my finances because im not working hard enough not working enough hours get a gig a hustle but that has even less security than contract work and when would i do that where are these hours of the day going to appear id have to borrow from my sleep again and thatll kill me in the long run   looking at the numbers ill never be out of debt at this rate ill never own a house ill never retire ill never be able to afford endoflife care ill keep at this prying at the doors of stability for the rest of my life lining someone elses wallet   i tried to do it right ive developed myself into an educated and hardworking employee several times over the bank can get their minimums my bosses can get my minimum effort i tried working hard and got nowhere i may work hard again somebody but im done for now,mgn8i8
96,A different view,just to give a different perspective as most posters on here seem to come from different backgrounds than me  i am a relatively high finance executive at a large public company and the main function of my job is to help manage our profit margin largely sitting in on meetings and discussing the ideas other departments put together and occasionally throwing in some of my own blended with reviewing auditing and analyzing our financial statements    ampx200b  whether its labor optimization inventory revenue growth capital planning etc ive done pretty much all of it and i think the one thing people on this thread get wrong is that people think there is malicious intent coming from a companys management when callous decisions are made  no matter how high in a company you go someone is breathing down your neck for results even the ceo there is no such thing as good enough and vacation time is always looked down on    ampx200b  the worst part is in my view that its a self feeding cycle that forces our economy to function this way  people demand bargain basement prices for stellar quality  if you think about that for a minute youll realize one of two things is happening when you get those great prices either youre being lied to about the quality or something is happening behind the scenes to allow the product to maintain quality at such a price because remember the golden rule there is no free lunch    ampx200b  the food industry is a great example  people love cheese and cheese is expensive so in order to get it to the masses and fill the ravenous demand companies had to get creative   first they tried creating a product that was almost cheese velveeta but once people started realizing that it wasnt really cheese and just effectively toxic waste sales started not doing so great  the demand for cheap cheese was still there though and companies had to again get creative    ampx200b  in order to get people real cheese and keep prices low animal abuse was used instead  cows are now treated like machines and rarely allowed outside if at all let alone allowed to graze like they should locked away in factories where consumers dont see them  now consumers get their product and quality so long as they play along with whats happening    ampx200b  pick any industry that has been scaled and youll find effectively the same thing just replace cows with chickens factory workers customer service reps amazon drivers anything that requires large quantities of living beings to deliver its product or service but has a customer base that isnt willing or able to pay what the true worth of the good or service is    ampx200b  this leads to the other end of the cycle  imagine the amazon worker barely scraping by on 15hr this person is in no position to be eyeing the ethics of his food housing or other goods and services he or she needs in order to prevent death  thus he or she is forced to become the very demand that is driving down his or her own wages    ampx200b  there are obviously other factors at play that suppress wages for the bottom 40 of the work force unskilled immigration globalization  international labor markets the destruction and vilification of unions but i think they all take a back seat to the obsession americans have for a good deal  sure you could go buy the high quality local famers market or grass fed meet or locally made domestically sourced cotton shirts that would all help create middle class jobs but people wont because walmart offers immediate gratification for your bank account at the expense of the american working class for decades to come  so which came first the chicken or the egg,mgwej0

101,"Asked for sympathy, met with confusion",before the pandemic i worked for a place where a small part of my job was to feed reptiles frozen rats   now before i started working here i had pet rats and they were starting to get old in fact i had already lost one to a pituitary tumor and still had two but knew that at most they had maybe 2 years left   now i had no issue feeding the reptiles normally they werent my rats i was feeding them but i was thinking ahead and thought to the day i would inevitably have to say goodbye and i didnt think id be able to feed the reptiles in the few days immediately following a pets death   i told my supervisor as much and i was met not with the sympathy i had been expecting but with confusion as to why i couldnt get over it and id have to realize these werent my pets   where i get hung up is that o wasnt saying i couldnt do it ever just immediately following a death as it would remind me of my sweet pet i had lost  but i guess sympathy was too much to expect anyway they laid me off last march so i guess its not an issue anymore,mgnaj4
102,"""Inactivity Kills Millions: Movement the 'Miracle Pill' That Could Save People and Planet""",credit httpswwweuronewscomliving20210330inactivitykillsmillionsbutmovementisthemiraclepillthatcouldsavepeopleandplan  and this talks more about physical exercise and urban planning but it definitely relates to our modern work culture    if i asked you  prepandemic  to think about public health your mind would likely go towards flu jab initiatives healthy eating campaigns and posters warning us of the dangers of smoking you probably wouldnt think about urban planning  but if we want to truly combat one of the worst health crises on our hands it should be a public health concern  inactivity is currently the worlds fourth leading cause of death its a problem often confused and conflated with laziness and personal choice but in reality the issue is geographic systemic and woven into the structure of modern living  in short if we want to fix our increasingly sedentary world we have to redesign it  political correspondent and cycling enthusiast peter walker dedicates a chapter of his new book to this exact issue the miracle pill why a sedentary world is getting it all wrong is an eyeopening read addressing our global inactivity problem and suggesting solutions for readers  the more i read the itchier i became to leave my sofa and get moving after a couple of chapters i ended up downloading the audiobook version so i could pace around my neighbourhood while listening to the seemingly endless bleak figures about the scale of our inactivity problem  currently 15 billion people around the world are so inactive they are risking their longterm physical health every year an estimated 53 million people die from causes related to inactive living  roughly the population of norway an extraordinary 80 per cent of british children move so little that they face a future with poorly developed cardiovascular systems weak bones and chronic illness  these are just three of many statistics walker presents and explores in his book but far from being a guiltinducing read making a reader feel ashamed of their desk job or reliance on their car walker manages to instil a relentless sense of hope throughout  during the book it is repeatedly made clear that patterns can be reversed health can be improved and its never too late to start moving  most importantly however walker never assigns blame for this public health crisis to individuals we havent all become collectively lazy on a catastrophic global scale the problem is far bigger and more structural than any one persons choice to swap exercise for netflix  how is urban planning linked to inactivity solving this sedentary crisis requires in part a rethink in how we design our towns and cities  weve designed the world such that in many many places driving is more or less the only thing you can do walker tells me  but if we could all harness the power of activity our lives could be dramatically altered  the books name  the miracle pill  relates to a study in denmark that tracked 30000 randomly selected people over the course of 15 years after adjusting for all other factors the people who cycled to and from work an average commute of just 15 minutes across the group were 40 per cent less likely to have died during the research period  its this sort of statistic which helps you understand why some experts can go a bit mistyeyed when they talk about activity walker writes in the book its also why so many of them compare everyday movement to the miraclegiving pill  he argues that were a team of scientists to discover a drug with the same lifeenhancing effects a nobel prize would be more or less guaranteed yet despite the obvious health benefits for people and planet no such prescription for mass movement has been given  throughout the book the experts walker talks with repeatedly explain that the decline in global activity levels is because we have systematically removed the need for incidental movement from our lives incidental movement is the activity that happens naturally throughout our day not purposeful exercise but things like walking to the shops or cycling to work  if we can redesign our towns and cities to support incidental movement and cycling it will be better for planet and people  as more of us work from behind desks drive to supermarkets and  especially at the moment  no longer even have a commute its increasingly easy to be inactive for the majority of your day  interestingly though activity levels tend to be better in cities  theres more people who will even just walk 10 minutes to get a bus or train rather than just get into their car and drive straight to where they need to go explains walker  so my exhortations for people to cycle and walk more are great if you live in the city or even in a town but if you live in a kind of small village and your nearest shop is a mile or two away and theres not even a pavement to get there  then often the only safe option is to drive  he uses the cyclingloving netherlands as an example the dutch are obviously very well known for having bike paths in urban areas but in lots of rural areas too they will have a kind of separated footway and bike lane  thats the kind of thing you need to think about you need to think about how places can be designed to allow people to move to an extent this lies in the redesign of cities and towns allowing for more cycling and more walking  the interesting case study for this is all these low traffic neighbourhoods ltns which are being introduced partly in london and lots of other cities to make it easier for people to cycle or walk  for change like this to happen walker adds its up to our governments  we need central government to get involved its too big for it to be left to individual local councils  getting politicians to take notice however is a different matter entirely  i once asked the head of the dutch cyclists union what she would do if she was in britain to get more flexibility she said well id start 30 or 40 years earlier than you are now and thats almost the most difficult thing because no one wants to be at that starting point  the pandemic may have helped shift perspectives almost a year ago as much of europe entered our first wave of national lockdowns there were reports from across the continent of nature and wildlife recovering in the uk for the first time since the second world war daily exercise was mandated to the nation as we were each allowed an hour outside our homes to move  parks started to halfresemble some sort of idealised victorian sanatorium full of joggers brisk walkers people skipping or lifting weights writes walker in his books introduction  when i speak with walker he reflects on how people reacted to these early weeks of lockdown  a lot of people who live in urban areas had this period where they suddenly thought oh my goodness the skys really blue the smog and smoke has gone the air feels clean  and a lot of people really like that and they liked the fact that they could cycle around their local streets there was no traffic on the roads  a year into the pandemic many people will be quite desperate to get back to the office he caveats but there has undoubtedly been a widespread desire for improved air quality less traffic and greater connections with green space  precovid the idea of governments especially in the uk intervening in public health as dramatically as weve seen over the last year would have been unimaginable but walker feels this same kind of approach is needed when it comes to inactivity  weve had a period now where entire economies have been more or less closed down for a year to save a lot of lives but arguably inactivity over two three or four years will kill more people than covid has  there is this idea that perhaps the bar for what the public will accept in terms of health interventions has been raised  when will the miracle pill power of activity be realised though the netherlands is a pioneer when it comes to urban design that encourages movement figures in the eu are still dismal twothirds of the adult population dont reach the minimum activity levels needed to be healthy  however walker says a revolution could be just around the corner though its clear we needed to start decades ago things could change very very quickly  he uses an analogy from his first book how cycling can change the world about how bikes were the dominant presence on the roads in 1890s britain  there was this long debate about whether the motoring movement should be allowed to join explains walker  it was seen as this kind of innovation this novelty  these strange people who drove cars with a man in front waving a flag but within 20 years the cyclists had virtually gone the cars had taken over  and nobody expected it  so these revolutions come and theyre not necessarily the one that you were waiting for but you know things can change very very quickly,mgm92h

113,We just lost our best receptionist because she wouldn't be owned by us entirely.,rant  its hard to find a good receptionist at a veterinary office they need to have some basic medical knowledge be very organized good under pressure polite but persistent need to be able to remember a lot of details they go over our puppy plans and other things and so on they are also the face of the practice theyre who people hear when they call see when they come in when its not covid and talk to on their way out  and weve struggled to find good ones it seems like we can find nice receptionists who arent organized and we can find organized receptionists who arent patient we just struggle to find ideal ones and you at least need that one good one whom everyone else can turn to when they need help its okay to have a couple just okay receptionists as long as you have your rock there too  we had our rock she wasnt always nice sometimes she had a bit of an edge but she was good   and when things were slow shed lean on the counter or sit on it and get on her phone  our manager never said anything because she was still doing more work than every other receptionist i never said anything because there was never a time when i needed something done and she wasnt doing it i am the veterinarian its effectively a 1doctor practice the owner does surgeries but only basic spayneuter and leaves at noon most days hes semiretired our receptionist had a job and she did it and she did it better than anyone else and then she took time to enjoy herself when there was time to spare  but the cameras caught her sitting on the counter a few too many times so the owners pressure hr to pressure the manager to say something and it turned into a fight she ended up walking out and she ended up not coming back  look i get that there are some issues there for example even though she gets stuff done and the others dont her example could cause them to want to also be on her phone but other than that i think the rest of the arguments are bullshit im paying her so she should be working yeah you paid her to be a receptionist not to own her soul for 8 hours if the place needs cleaned you should hire someone to clean it you know good and well that the 20 minutes here and there that the receptionist spends cleaning it doesnt constitute the undertaking of a necessary task and its obviously not a task that will be done to completion anyway its makework busywork and if it needed to be done someone needed to be scheduled and hired to do it   obviously there are things that are part of her job that sometimes can be done she should stock the shelves call upcoming appointments and so on things that are literally part of her job that are written into her job description that wont get done if the receptionists dont do them but she was doing those things dammit but now shes gone on the principal that we own her as opposed to we hired her labor to complete specific jobs and if she gets them done efficiently she can take time to herself  it bugs the crap out of me it goes double because no one is going to say shit to me im the vet im sitting here on my laptop literally with my arms over a pile of records who are waiting for callbacks but no one is going to say anything to me because i dont have a security camera pointed at my office because im on salary for whatever other reasons somehow im special i grant that im a little harder to replace though certainly not irreplaceable but theres more to it than that i think theres an attitude that if youre a lowwage employee youre owned by the business during work hours while as a higherearning professional im allowed to conduct myself as i see fit under the presumption that im just a different class of being who will selfpolice well guess what im probably the laziest least efficient person in this office if im being honest   and now our office is just a little bit worse because one of the receptionists who often kept me in line she was very perceptive and even though she couldnt see into the office she always knew when i was fucking around vs when i was actually busy and would very politely say dont forget doc youve got x to do at just the right times where id feel guilty and hop right up to get it done  dont get me wrong its not like i have spare time at my job i dont want anyone to think im just sitting at my desk all day ill pay for this post later the practice will close at 5 and ill get out at maybe 6 or 7 if im lucky and this is an unusually slow afternoon where i dont have patients waiting   but as far as using my time effectively or never getting on my phone fuck that im terrible but its okay because lowwage workers are worthless existing only to perform the labor of the owners and its just an attitude thats baked into everything     okay thanks for listening to my rant,mgsw8f

125,"""We could have discussed it...""",started a new role in january after an all too short interview with the owner where they touted the worklife balance of the firm white collar job in accounting salaried exempt 100 remote dont care about the hours just get the work done knowing the industry a little overtime was expected so i figured thered be some balance like shorter hours in noncrunch weeks that should have been my first red flag my second was the email from the owner to everybody the day after i started with this years work plan which included 2300 hours on the clock holidays and vacations not figured into this calculation mind you that was shortly revised to 2250 hours to encourage worklife balance i shrugged it off and clocked my 40 hours a week for 7 weeks figuring the worst that would happen is that my promotion potential would be limited by the fact that i wasnt putting in 55 hours a week like everyone else i did good work senior people in the firm liked me everybody seemed to not care about the fact that i clocked out at 500 pm on friday and was gone until 830 am on monday there were rumblings during all hands meetings about saturday lunches at the office starting soon which i ignored because i was 100 wfh yall want to work saturdays go nuts ill deal with whatever you sent me on monday when im on the clock  march 7th a sunday my personal phone rings at 415pm its a number i dont recognize so i let it go to voicemail its the weekend i dont know you leave a voicemail if its important ill call you back the next morning i log into my work computer email from the closest thing to a manager that i have we need to discuss your work hours cue a 25 minute phone call where they basically talked at me about how important it is that everyone does the hours they laid out in the work plan theyll resend it to me just in case i didnt get it and implying that my future with the firm was dependent on my getting with the program they touted themselves for working 60 hours a week last year while helping a family member with a health issue they talked about how it used to be 8090 hours so be glad its not like that anymore i nodded and smiled through the whole lecture started looking for a new job that afternoon off the clock mind you started working a little overtime remember salaried exempt so no compensation for this found out during that call that the firm had been hourly the year prior but had changed to a salaried exempt classification in the last 12 months gee wonder why that is  in the ensuing weeks i got several emails addressed to everybody about how the work plan was required or expected and that we all needed to do our part to ensure the work was fairly distributed and that no one was shouldering all of the burden had a couple of conversations with the owner that all pretty clearly communicated that they expected everyone to put in the time to reap the rewards  interviewed on the 15th with a company i worked for several years ago breezed through the interview process got the job offer yesterday put in my two weeks notice with the current firm about an hour after i put my notice in the owner calls me hey is it too late to talk about this  it was too late when one of your managers called me at 4pm on a sunday come to find out the next morning they wanted to talk about my work hours it was too late when i got an email that week with a copy of the work plan and the implicit suggestion that my failure to put the required hours in would be detrimental to my future it was too late when you sent an email last week laying out how important it was that everyone put their time in it was too late when you spent 30 minutes during this mornings all hands meeting talking about how the new people to the firm need to pull their weight  well we could have talked about it everythings a discussion item i have an open door policy funny i didnt get the feeling it was a discussion item what was communicated in the last three weeks was that everyone who wasnt doing the 55 hours a week could have been 60 dont you know and just be glad its not 8090 hours like the good old days was not meeting the expectations of the firm doesnt feel like a discussion item  cue circular discussion about how the owner had to put in my time when i was young and now im reaping the rewards cool story same logic as the we shouldnt forgive student loan debt because i had to pay mine off crowd if your business depends on a workforce of salaried exempt people willing to work 55 hours a week you have a bad business plan  brought this up during the interview new boss was very clear that they work 86 monday through friday except for holidays the folks on the team have an 8hour shift and we rotate schedules so someone gets 84 someone gets 95 someone gets 106 if youre not scheduled youre not working not exactly ending work but certainly a lot saner than my current job,mh95ry

176,Why do so many on this sub blame capitalism?,tldr i think the problem is with the justice system rather than capitalism   i realise we are living in a capitalistic system but just because a system is being misused doesnt mean that system is the problem isnt it the misuser that is the problem   for example if a hospital loses a patient do we blame hospitals or diseasesinjuries sure you get bad doctors and mismanagement and those individuals should be held accountable but does that mean we shouldnt have hospitals  similarly i see the necessity of work because people need goods and services to enjoy life but it looks like the misuse is in greedy bosses who want employees to work full time and more for decent pay as opposed to part time so they can enjoy life with the other part of their time just to line their pockets   in other words those in power dont have enough compassion that doesnt mean power is the problem it means we should enforce and reward compassionate behaviour and the system in place to do that the system that needs to be reformed is the justice system not the capitalist system,met146

183,Why workers do not give 110%.,at every job ive had 6 i do the bare minimum  why because at every job ive had ive gotten nothing when going above and beyond  do i expect anything no of course not      but who do i see get rewarded instead complete and total ass kissers people who get all chummy and schmoozy with the management people who dont really do much more than the bare minimum sometimes even less but who is the first person to get an ass chewing at the slightest mistake  me thats who  ive seen my wife as well as myself through personal experience get reprimanded for the slightest most minuscule offenses and see the favorites the teachers pets end up with not a word spoken to them for doing the same exact fucking thing not 10 minutes later  i work at a cell center and have identified major functionality issues things that need addressed quickly in order to better serve our clients issues that prevent us from doing our jobs correctly  but no one listens to me because i am a peon a regular worker then weeks later management finally catches wind of it and suddenly its a big fucking deal but my opinions my concerns do not count   this is not just my experience ive seen it happen to countless others people enter a company with huge hopes and dreams only to get them squashed   ive seen people who are the epitome of a successful achieving perfect employee get passed over for promotions and instead they get handed to someone who was nice to the boss yet a complete and utter fuck up at their job   so giving 10 going above and beyond and working your ass off is rarely rewarded this is why good workers do not last   you cannot hand someone criticism constantly for times they do wrong and not compliment or reward them for when they do more than expected its emotional blackmailing its abusive and its the fastest way to get rid of a good employee   people tend to get divorced for the same reasons when a spouse constantly criticizes another and never compliments   so this is why workers do so little work they ride the knifes edge of doing just enough to not get fired  if you want more from employees you need to recognize when they truly go above and beyond because otherwise they wont do it again its that simple,mfg9up

193,Why so much emphasis on stress?,ever since i started university i couldnt help but notice the big indirect emphasis on stress thats been pushed by peers  okay lemme be more clear i have the impression that ever since students enter college older students teachers other people etc try to impose on the them the idea that they can only truly grow up and have a full on college experience if they get into a bazzilian extra curricular activities outside of their main degree such as associativism junior enterprises events organizations sports all at the same time and these people always claim that doing so many stuff at the same time is crucial for a huge and delightful cv to grow as a person and to learn how to be a better manager of ones own time time management skills i cant help but notice how this indirect points towards the overrating of stress if a student has a full on college degree to complete while having a dozen other extra curriculars full of projects to complete all at the same time of course theyre going to end up stressing out or even burningout ive had colleagues becoming depressed just because they felt too much pressure of being involved in so much academic stuff all while having to study for tests and assignments yet the majority of people at college portrays this as a good and healthy thing  i just dont get it how can a practice that easily leads to burnout be even considered healthy why is there so much emphasis on having to experience and live full on stress why is it so weird to only want to go to university and complete a degree without having to be stressed with side compromises and wanting to simply live a relaxed life why cant people just take things gradually and at their own pace   i fail to understand why being stressed is portrayed as a positive and necessary experience to go through in order to be an adult when it can quite literally make you unhealthy both physically and mentally   and im posting this here because i guess this pressure of having to be stressed and having to have multiple stuff to do at the same time carries on from college to the workplace seeing how in college they relate these activities so much to building a decent cv  ps i already completed a bachelors degree and iam on my way to finish my masters and never once got into these extra curricular compromises just went to watch some lectures and workshops from time to time when i deemed them as interesting nothing more id rather prioritize my wellbeing than doing something just because everyone at college age is doing it,mereer

206,You don't have to be Einstein to realise this.,                          private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands the result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society  his is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who for all practical purposes separate the electorate from the legislature  the consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population moreover under existing conditions private capitalists inevitably control directly or indirectly the main sources of information press radio education it is thus extremely difficult and indeed in most cases quite impossible for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights   albert einstein why socialism ,mf9wl5

215,"Conflicted, tired and sore. More importantly..BORED.",hello all this is my first post here at rantiwork so what better way to introduce myself then with a work rant  im a shift supervisor at a large coffee company our store is small but very high volume this has increased exponentially in the last year despite covid as of late i have felt mentally drained my body hurts i feel disconnected from my coworkers and dont feel as if i am doing what a supervisor is supposed to do i am a great reader or body language and the energies people give off which does me more harm than good most of the time because i tend put myself in a mental fetal position where have small fears of coaching that person in the moment and often forget i feel that the work i do goes unappreciated but the work i miss or overlook is put on a pedestal   the one thing i always said when i took this promotion is that i would not ever change who i am as a person in the process i feel i have changed not for better or for worse im conflicted and part of me wants to step down part of me wants to find another job but another part of me wants to suck it up and accept whatever challenge comes in front of me   to sum it up i just want to do better maybe instead of looking at my job as just a paycheck i would invest more of my personal time in it the truth is i like to clock in work then clock out and go home and id assume thats true for most this company wants someone that goes above and beyond perhaps if im not that person what do i do where do i go i have other dreams and aspirations but im not in a financial position where i can throw all my eggs in one basket   i dont expect anyone to show me empathy on the internet i more or less am looking for constructive criticism outside of people close to me   thanks for reading,mfo7e9

218,My (limited) experience with work.,ive been working for admittedly not a very long time im 24 currently and had my first job at around 16 ive only had a few jobs in between most of my work has been physical labor i started as a construction aide moved to a cashier  salesperson at a few jobs and have been a mechanic for the last 5 years or so almost everyone i have worked with in the industry is depressed to all shit they tell me to leave the industry as fast as i can that if they could start over they would never do mechanic work they wouldnt tell their kids to do it one of my coworkers would do hard drugs at work like meth and cocaine to make it bearable my next coworker was a raging alcoholic to such a point where he missed work because he was drunk all the time my next coworker who is also currently my friend  manager is 32 hes balding smokes several cigarettes a day usually within minutes of each other and drinks frequently he has a lot of money but he practically lives in the shop ive known him to sleep in the couch in the employee room what kind of fucking life is that he has an old yellowed refrigerator with a bottle of rum and ginger ale he orders all his food online or picks it up from the closest fast food chain he sleeps on the couch  floor in a sleeping bag at work the most fun ive seen him have is when hell bring his xbox or playstation to the shop and hook it up to a decade old flat screen so he can play some call of duty on an office chair in the employee room for a few hours what the fuck kind of life is that he works 8am  6pmish every fucking day i think even sundays sometimes he spends more time at the shop than he does at home he cheated on his wife so often that they divorced i mean honestly why would i want to subject myself to this shit  and my dad too hes so full of love for work that his love is directly conditional on if i go to work or not i cant even talk to him without him asking me if im going to work soon or what my next job is going to be literally i can walk into the room and be like man my head really hurts today and hed be like you know why its cause you dont work brain is shutting down because of the lack of work stimuli  i dont want to slave away for decades and decades so i can afford to buy things that ill never fucking use because im too busy working,mfin60

222,The reason the U.S. doesn’t have universal healthcare,the reason we dont have universal healthcare in the us is because it would negatively impact big businesses that rely on the benefits they offer along with a salary or wage to keep employees from going to better jobs with more money people are hesitant to give up employer sponsored health insurance so they wont leave crappy jobs because the risk of getting sick without any form of insurance is too great to take the big companies that fund campaigns and politicians know that if we had universal healthcare people would be more mobile in their careers and they would have to pay better wages and have better working conditions,mevq1m

231,"The US is a totalitarian dictatorship, it's just the oppression is outsourced to employers",i was listening to a podcast about the former ddr east germany in their jobs east german workers really had power and freedom you could vote to fire your boss if you boss is corrupt you could let the authorities know and theyd investigate and if they were found to be corrupt they were gone you had a very significant say in how things were run there was real democracy in the workplace and everyone had a right to a job this was enshrined in their constitution so you didnt have to live the constant precariousness of losing your job all pretty typical more or less of most socialist countries  now in the us your boss has total control over your life the type of control that you employer has its on the level of the worst dictatorships you cant say shit to your boss every single interaction has the potential to ruin your life you have no say in how things are run you have to do everything you boss says you say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing you lose your job and in the us since we have so little social protections losing your job can lead to a whole lot of bad things up to losing your life and this is true of employers collectively you get fired or have bosses that wont give you good references finding a new job is so much more difficult so if you dont play the game by their rules no only can you lose your job but the system makes it all that much harder to recover and get another one  i reject the idea that you have to decide between the two but if i had to decide between having democracy in my workplace or democracy in my political system ill go with workplace democracy not like the us has political democracy anyway,mf47h7

270,Was there a turning point in history or technology that made work shitty?,my elderly uncle talked fondly about his career in the usa from about 19501990 and mentioned that the whole office would shut down for 2 weeks every christmastime i was like wtf  are there any events in the late 20th century that can be seen as a direct connection to the shittiness of employment today or was it lots of gradual changes collectively was it the rise of computer technology turning people into halfrobot wage slaves  i know historically work was always shitty for the poorest parts of the population to the point of actual slavery and indiscriminate death on the job but when did it go wrong in the modern way it is today,mf7pp3
271,Questions About Anti Work Itself,so i might be stupid but im kinda extremely confused about the anti work idea as a whole for starters how can a work free world actually be achieved because you literally cant have any modern society without someone or something working you just cant someone has to make the food someone has to clean the houses someone has to fly the planes you have to have a group of people working to keep society afloat and right now thats basically everyone the work gets spread fairly evenly among the common populous so everyone contributes to society but also can do their own things but if theres just this huge fraction of the population if not everyone who doesnt have to do any work then who does robots nope almost all normal jobs require a modest amount of intelligent thinking so to create a huge workforce of intelligent robots to do all of our work would immediately result in terminator and im serious maybe a fraction of the human population could do work so that way the other could live without work gonna have to pass on that cause that sounds waaaaaay to much like having a giant army of slaves and that is you know morally and objectively evil and classist but beyond the logistics of having a work free world just the idea is practically unthinkable work gives people extremely valuable experiences and lifelong virtues that can make them ten times the person they were before and yeah ill give you the fact that not all good traits in a person come from working but when it comes to actually doing something with your life and making a living those traits achieved from working are more valuable than gold so yeah maybe sitting on your ass all your life might seem pretty nice but when you take two seconds to look at it a work free world is not only logistically impossible but also morally evil and corrupt,meqsde

327,How to make employees quit their job without having to fire them,lets face it no ceo or manager likes to fire people at the least its uncomfortable and in other circumstances it can be downright emotional employees have their bills to pay and often families to support and rarely take kindly to losing their livelihood managers frequently face a whole host of undesirable issues when firing employees from dramatic scenes in the office to even being sued for dismissals these complications take up valuable time and resources  which you could be spending elsewhere in your business  but dont give up there is a solution im about to share with you the way one innovative company has figured out how to get employees to resign on their own so they can avoid the stress of letting them go simply repeat the steps from the method i will describe to you and see your business flourish as you get rid of employees hasslefree  lets dive right in  in 2007 i started working for a big australian engineering company in perth australia this company had about 8000 employees spread across over 50 offices around the globe the headquarters were located in cbd on adelaide terrace and my department was on the 8th floor now this company had a great slogan  people clients management in an internal pr move im sure will be familiar to many of you this company had an induction program where employees were told they were the biggest assets of the company and every success the company enjoyed was built on a foundation of mutual respect  after about 8 months with the company i received my first performance report and it was excellent then one day the section manager was promoted to department manager and was replaced by a relative of the branch manager it became clear pretty quickly that the new manager did not like me  to put it mildly over the next few months he would make derogatory remarks about me and especially my appearance  this got progressively more intense until one day on the way to a client he threatened to kill me i decided to go to hr  now i know what youre thinking this is the part where things get tedious  with endless rounds of politically correct hr people having meetings and trying to iron out difficulties things that are a pain for many companies not interested in problem employees  but stick with me youre going to like where this goes i promise  the hr manager a guy by the name of todd reacted with surprise to my complaint informing me that everyone had a high opinion of this man and i was the first one to complain i knew this was not true and other colleagues had also complained before me  but i kept quiet and todd promised to investigate  after a week i had heard nothing from him then the new manager who id complained about saw me in the corridor and told me i heard you went to hr i fucking hate snitches i went straight to todd again he said theres not much i can do hes a close relative of the branch manager  so i talked to the branch manager and he said i should quit if i didnt like it there i reminded him of the slogan of the company client people management but i got nowhere i decided to file an official complaint and todd said he would do that with me next day in the morning todd told me that if i still wanted to file an official complaint some things were going to change in my work routine i said i didnt understand what he meant to which he replied i would find out the next day i filed the complaint  now thank you for sticking with me and continuing to read heres the part youve been waiting for  introducing the glass room quitting method tm  the next morning todd came to my desk and said management wanted to relocate me to another desk the 8th floor where we worked from was an open space area with 15 m high cubicles it had three meeting rooms two large and one small full glazed one in the middle of the office floor the small meeting room was about 3m x 3m in it was a table four chairs and a phone  todd asked me to follow him when i started packing my workstation pens and other stuff he said leave everything here just come with me  we went to the small meeting room he took three chairs out and left the last one then asked me to sit down then he said from now on you will work from here you will wait until your manager comes and tells you what to do he left the room taking the phone as he went  so there i was  sitting in a completely empty fully glazed room at an empty table of course the manager never came to tell me what i was supposed to do i just sat there hour after hour with nothing to do but be bored and humiliated  todd would come in every morning and ask me if i wanted to resign when i said no he simply said i would have to continue to sit there and wait till the manager came and told me what to do  this went on for a week and i slowly started feeling like i was going crazy i sat every day in the fully transparent glass room like a monkey in the zoo having nothing to do you might wonder if my colleagues said anything about it later i was told that they had received an email saying i was going to work from the meeting room on a project for a new client they of course knew that wasnt exactly right and something was wrong but fear or embarrassment and not wanting to rock the boat meant they simply kept their heads down and busied about doing their tasks trying not to look at me  the week after i decided to go to a lawyer  you might be worried now that this ingenious solution would reach a sticking point here and the company would be forced to stop treating me this way but think again  i was told that from a legal point of view the company was not doing anything wrong if they simply fired me i would have a case but as long as they didnt i had no chance so i resigned  some weeks later i met an older excolleague of mine by chance in a cafe he had worked for the company for over ten years he told me the glass room method was common there he remembered that the longest someone managed to sit there and do nothing was three weekstill he willingly resigned  so there you have it the glass room method for getting your employees to quit so you dont have to go to the trouble of firing them,m65auu
328,Kicking the caffeine habit to get back at work,anyone else going through this  i realized that as much as i like the feeling of coffee as a recreational drug energy fiend what the daily coffee addiction basically amounts to is a push for me to take a stimulant in order to be more productive provide additional surplus labor for my job  its very obvious that this is why a lot of companies provide this stimulant for free  however there seems to also be a worrying amount of corporate meddling in scientifichealth research in the english speaking world not only because big coffee is a huge lobby in its own right but because it is the cornerstone of industrialized grind culture  while it definitely doesnt seem to be as damaging as smoking there are similarities in the commercialization of the scientific research lots of nonsense around a narrative of it has negative effects but is fine in small doses also it nurses a habitual dependency but if you fall for that youre just a moron  simply put caffeine probably wont give you fairy cancer or lupus or some other secret scary disease were all secretly getting  all we need to do is observe what it does to us when we take it it can make us hyperactive it raises stress and stress over long periods of time is extremely dangerous leading to hypertensionhigh blood pressure and eventually heart disease  not being sleepy at work aint worth my heart  now if youll excuse me ill be taking a nap in the bathroom,m5rma8

332,Math ability has excessive control over determining People's fate,i see a lot of people who seem to have a desire to change math as in to make it more vague and less definitive so as to give a leg up to people with less ability in that realm i personally am not sure about the long term viability of this idea but what i am confident in is my belief that we need new avenues for people it seems to me that if somebody is really bad at math then this might have a large effect in terms of determining their eventual economic status the perception of their overall intelligence as opposed to simply mathematics intelligence a certain kind of brain power etc   what im not asking is that we corrupt math do away with it or relegate it in a way that excessively messes with it as an avenue for the people who do have ability for example people like terence tao who are brilliant and deserve their careers in math not to mention people who might not be at his level but certainly deserve their career or their respect but i definitely think we need to expand into a system where sucking at math or a particular topic in general doesnt necessarily mean somebody is lower status set to be lower income or considered foolish   obviously this is very much an idealists concept but i really think its a fair one there are infinite forms of intelligence and humanity simply needs to keep developing and using their creativity to find new ways to ascertain the value that lies within people uncover avenues where people who previously werent going to be discovered or able to excel will be thanks for reading,m5hrdr

337,"Quit my Big Tech job 6 weeks ago, best decision I've made in a really long time.",i love this sub it has carried me through the last few months at work while i was waiting for our yearly bonus before quitting i wanted to maximize the amount of  i could pocket from this job before quitting but the last few months it was really hard to pretend i cared   from my experience big tech jobs are golden handcuffs in that they throw tons of money at you in exchange for getting you to spend your own limited amount of time on this planet working on completely useless at best products surrounded by tech bros while execs play political games and throw money at the wall to see what sticks it pays well and has enabled me to get to the point where im comfortable quitting financially but its soulsucking when i realized i was crying every monday at the prospect of another week of pointless video calls about a product that shouldnt be made in corporate bullshit language full of acronyms and words like netnet paradigm shift and powwow for some reason the progressive tech industry still thinks its ok to use this word i knew it was time to go   i am extremely lucky in that my partner happens to be a freelance artist whose business has been steadily growing for the past few years it recently reached the point where he started needing extra help and so we worked out how he could start employing me to help him i very excited as i have been following his business journey from day 1 with all its interesting challenges that i helped him problem solve i love what he does i want to see him make more art and so im very excited to free up time for him by taking on more of the administrative tasks of running a business so he has more creative time i am of course taking a big pay cut compared to what big tech offers but i really couldnt care less he pays me a reasonable living wage and the amount of joy i am now able to derive from choosing what i do with my time every single day is priceless i feel like my skills are perfectly complementary to his and i am now able to use them on a project i am passionate about my last day was february 1st and i will never look back   it feels so natural to wake up and do what i want without worrying about what time it is what people that have power on me might want from me what appearances i need to maintain to fit in i am still in awe at how long i convinced myself to stay at this jobindustry for the past several years bonding with colleagues over crying in empty meeting rooms or drinking ourselves blind enough to talk about and process the soft misogyny we were all experiencing i feel a million times more productive even though i work less than 15 hours a week the rest of the time i cook i have started spending time doing art myself i look forward to volunteering to get involved in my community i learn new skills i prepare my garden for spring i work on the house etc i can go to shops in the middle of the day and stop by to chat with a friend then work on our business until 10pm if thats when im feeling productive its truly wonderful and i wanted to share the joy with this community as it has really made me feel less alone in my hatred of corporate culture and bullshit jobs,m6om4g

376,"DISCUSSION: What is a better question for ""So what do you do for a living?""", the setup  our jobs and careers consume a large part of both our day and our lives so asking someone what do you do for a living is a shorthand for gauging not just your financial stability but also insight into who you are as a person if said job or its industry is what you would be doing for the remainder of your working life you identify with your job asking so what do you do for a living helps identify you as a person its a classic icebreaker question for getting to know someone  only after the person answering the question has passed ie has a stable jobincome and is happy in that job meaning its sustainable not that your happiness is a requirement to theirs does the person who asked the question ask additional questions related to who you really are as a person eg your emotions your thoughts your passions your history your family your culture your dreams your hangups your problems all the questions related to getting to know one another and join two lives in other words if youre prospectable then youre pursued we all do this   the scenario  but if your job is without dignity not making you happy not generating enough income and generally allaround unsustainable and you therefore choose not to identify with it outside of your job eg i may be a mcdonalds worker but i dj outside out that then what becomes a better question to ask a person in such a situation is it  so what do you do for a living lt answers career job lt normal questions  so what do you do for a living lt answers poorly prospectable job like mcdonalds  lt    is it a follow up question like oh do you do anything outside of that  or is there a superior question to start with that isnt so personal right off the bat like so who are you as a person what are your problems with your father tell me about your deepest troubles and dreams,meklv6

378,Essential Employees should have unionized at the start.,ive been working this pandemic since the beginning like most of you and like majority of front line workers we would have   1 made more money on unemployment benefitscares act bonus 2 had leisure time or time to improve our lives 3 make passive income and focus on things that truly matter to us 4 not be exposed to the virus so deadly we had to shut down an entire global economy  the problem i saw was that not too many essential employees were unionizing i have met 0 essential employees in my area willing to step up towards there employer or employers willing to step up for there employees there is a big problem when those on unemployment benefits are making substantially more than those working but i am not here to argue that because wage workers tend to be underpaid to begin with as a whole  as an essential employeefull time student i would have benefited heavily from being laid off but i was forced to work i have elderly at home who i take care of and obligations towards my education along with work i would have made more on the unemployment benefits   i just wish people stopped pretending like they care about frontline workers and told them how it is you got screwed thats all,m6pntq

406,Can you guys explain the theory of this sub,im a little confused as to what you guys are advocating is this a socialism or communism or what is this because any economic system people have to work  dont get me wrong im all for abolishing the 95 and a healthy work life balance im just not sure what this movement advocates for,m4m8xh
407,The system is slavery and nothing will change unless people accept that.,when was there every an option to optout people look at me and laugh at me or pitty me as some kind of bum who doesnt want to work because he is too lazy and it frustrates the crap out of me people think slavery was abolished years ago but it never was since when did we have a choice to be part of this system we are born  slapped with a name sent to school to learn how to be a good cog told to work until we are old and broken where is the choice in any of that      oh but you can escape the system  yeah if you have tonnes of money i often honestly tell myself that i wish i had never been born into this era i would much rather have been a hunter gatherer with my family all around me in a tribe struggling to live from day to day rather than working for the man who has no idea what it is like at the bottom of society and continues to use me and abuse me every single day      people need to realise it is slavery sure some people escape the bottom classes but only the very lucky ones and their success stories are dangled tantalizingly infront of people to give them unrealistic hope that they may one day do the same dangling a carrot before a donkey until the donkey gives out and they get another donkey      why just because i was born to a lowerclass family is my fate to work myself into an early grave for people at the top who couldnt even care less about me nothing is going to change unless the people who have been indoctrinated into thinking this is normal wake the f up,m495qy

409,The weekend is a lie,by that i mean you barely get one so we probably all know the high of quitting time on friday and a lot of us probably think the two days for the weekend is not long enough so saturday comes maybe you went to sleep later because there was no work the next day or you woke up later for the same reason but youve got to go buy food prepare for the coming week and because everyone else is also at the shops on the same day you wind up losing the middle of your day then you realise your saturday is mostly gone you still have laundry to do chores etc then its sunday you know youve got to get to bed early because of monday maybe youve got ironing to do lunches to prepare for the week so thats less time to do your own thing then add in how your time might get used up if you have children and thats your weekend gone  i was just thinking this today but yeah the weekend is too short,m4axz2

411,"14 hour shifts, no OT pay, NO breaks, unsafe toxic environment but I'm too scared to quit.",i recently started a job 15 months ago as a manager of a legal dispensary i was referred by a mutual friend of ours and hes said from the beginning he wouldnt hire anyone else but me since i have experience in this industry since we opened during lockdown we have been very slow so he vp of ops who is working in the store with me for the time being decided it would be best to not hire anyone and split the work between us this meant 3 of days i was working alone for 11 hours and the other 2 days i would be working 7 hours i agreed to this for the time being because i thought it was manageable and because i didnt want to cause an issue to be honest it has been a little difficult working the long 11 hour shifts alone with no break but i managed  now that we are out of lockdown we are able to stay open 9am11pm i was under the impression that we would be hiring 2 more people to allow us to work a normal schedule but when i spoke to him last week he suggested that we work 5 regular days 78 hours 1 14 hour day and have 1 day off instead of hiring more staff i already decided prior that i would not be willing to work this schedule because i knew he would suggest this when he suggested that to me last week i told him that i dont want either of us to work those hours but it was a boundary for me and that i would prefer not to keep in mind that i did not get paid overtime for the previous ot i worked nor would i get paid for the additional hours with the new proposed schedule this means either i do work the proposed schedule or i work 7 days a week and im not really comfortable with either  he spent the next 10 minutes being upset with me and trying to convince me that working the long week wasnt so bad which then made me feel like maybe i was overreacting   since then he said he wants to hire another staff member at the end of the month but to be honest im not sure if i trust him i had the perfect candidate for the job and when i suggested that we hire him before we increase our hours he brushed it off the 2 separate times saying well wait a bit longer before we hire him until the candidate was no longer available so im not sure if he actually wants to hire more people or just is tiding me over regardless ive already worked this schedule for a week and i dont want to do it anymore even if i wouldnt have to do it in 2 weeks the fact that he expected me to work this schedule got upset with me when i said no and then i was somehow guilted into doing it doesnt sit well with me   on top of this my anxiety has been the worst its been in my life on 2 occasions i thought about taking myself to the hospital and on 1 occasion i called an ambulance i dont think its a coincidence that this started when i started this job my problem is that since its only him and i im really screwing him over by quitting and i feel absolutely terrible to put him in this position im going to offer to stay another week and help him find a replacement but like he said he wouldnt want to hire anyone and train anyone else for this job he has no clue i want to quit so im in a really shitty spot and im going to put him in an even shittier one i know i shouldnt care since hes clearly shown he doesnt care for me or my wellbeing but i just feel so awful about it i want to do this tomorrow so it lines up with the pay cycle and ill receive one last pay cheque but i feel sick to my stomach about doing it   tldr employer is giving me 2 schedule options im unhappy with either work 7 days a week or work 60 hours a week with 1 day off not sure if im being dramatic or if this is a boundary i am justified in upholding and quitting,m58qcc
412,The hypocrisy of companies offering extra health and wellness webinars during the pandemic without systemically changing anything else is amazing (in a bad way),of course there are plenty of things both before and during the pandemic that has gotten worse on us workers but one thing that has really stood out has been the company i work for offering extra optional health and wellness webinars focused on covid what amazes me in the worst way possible is that these sessions like managing stress during the pandemic type sessions are nice to offer sure but theyre ridiculously performative absolutely nothing will reduce employees stress and improve our mental health if you dont reduce our hours and workload lower expectations stop firing a bunch of people etc it really does amaze me that companies think they can boost everyones health just by offering a few extra webinars its like putting one single band aid on a gunshot wound we so clearly need massive change in my opinion a reduction of the 40 hour work week is a start  and a realistic and reasonable one at that im just so frustrated that i keep seeing these sessions offered and i do attend them and all they do is make me angrier the good thing is the ones leading the webinars usually send out follow up surveys so i at least get to write in my thoughts afterwards but really i dont see change in my own company and ive had enough,m56y80

420,My SO is a slave of his workplace and I'm about to lose it.,currently waiting for him to come home after a 9hour shift that was originally 7hours long but became 9 because they didnt hire enough people and force their employee to do overtime we have to do a lot of stuff today and were running late because of this the worst part is that his coworkers are all like this that workplace is built on explotation and people who are so eager to please their management that are willing to start their shift 2 hours earlier any morning and stay there until the work its done this would probably be removed as its only a rant and doesnt offer much to the conversation but its fine i needed to rant and theres no place better than this to do it most of the people i speak to tell me its is job and hes doing the right thing if he want to keep it,m47psm

424,"I love to work, but....",this will be a big one but bear with me  for the last 5 years i have worked in one of the largest european multinational companies in an engineering job my job consists basically in designing new products for the automotive market and in the paper this is one of those fulfilling jobs where you get to make the difference   the problem as with most jobs is in the execution first of all i am not native to the original country of the multinational many of you should know that by definition my career and job climbing is limited by nothing else than my own nationality this is a known secret in all multinational companies that in fact have nothing multinational about them except promoting the use of cheap labor in other countries   this meant i could never ascend to the top ranking inside the company which to be honest was not my goal but this also meant that my opinion even if highly back by proofs calculations simulations and reasoning will be in the best case head to head with the natives heartfelted belief and that is not how science or engineering really should work   the second problem is the local environment in which i work the local bosses and the full local hierarchy are nothing else but patsies that dont even dream the rise above the limitations imbued in their brains the central headquarters and everyone which actually tries to be better is to some extent marginalized   during the time i was there i was one of the responsible people to win a large public financed project to foment the technology development and specialized workforce of my own country the idea is to get these tech projects to be done in less developed countries so that they could close the gap the more developed countries using some financial and social incentives the idea is of course amazing however after 5 years and hundreds of people involved i feel we got nothing to show not necessarily because the projects didnt create anything useful but because it was never about being successful once this project ends nothing interesting in knowledge will actually stay at my country or even my work group we will be back to the meat grinder of useless poorly paid jobs   and this is what led me to antiwork most of us are either working for someone to get rich or working for absolutely no reason whatsoever it is not that i am against working i love working and see my creations come to life but i realize that the current statusquo will never enrich the society which i am part of and that destroys me from the inside,m4ulyx

427,being punished for not working quick enough,so for my job me and three other people unload a truck each week for our local retail chain we range from the ages 20 to 55 and do a pretty decent job however this past week our supervisor decided that we had been failing miserably according to her she was pissed that truck didnt get done was pissed that even though she scheduled us the max amount of hours she could that truck still didnt get done was pissed that she had to help us cause apparently shes not supposed to was pissed that we fucked up her planograms and set her back a week all of that didnt bother me because this is a part time job for me just to pay my bills the part that pissed me off was when she said that she would start taking disciplinary actions against us if this continued how the hell do you take disciplinary actions against people who are trying hard there is 3 of us who unload a whole truck and stuck everything each truck has anywhere from 400 to 1000 items in the time ive worked there 3 months weve maybe finished truck three times i already hate working but this makes me hate it even more,m4mqia
428,The absurdity of our work culture,i was talking with my wife last night about work  my wife is very supportive so she was trying to talk me out of my unfounded feelings of guilt worthlessness inadequacy etc  she wasnt saying anything that i hadnt thought before but it made me realize that the core absurdity of our work culture is that we are made to feel emotionally invested in work which we logically know is meaningless  i cannot simply rationalize away the emotions that are connected to work because we are immersed in an entire culture that fundamentally conflates work with your identity  the hooks are in us at a subconscious level  i am stuck with an emotional level of care for something which i simultaneously find rationally meaningless  if this aint hell i dont know what is,m3ts8j

430,Pathetic workplace,i learned that one of my coworkers was fired for refusing to work full shifts on weekends on top of weekdays he stated that this wasnt in his contract at all and couldnt work weekends they fired him on the spot that day their reasoning was that he didnt have any family or kids so he should accept to work on weekends and the pay wouldnt be better either were in healthcare but not in hospital  i find this so utterly pathetic and such a tragedy to be taken for disposable trash because you didnt give the last bits of your own free time to your work master i hope he sues our workplace because i doubt its even legal to have fired him for that reason he had worked for years with our workplace and was great but an exhausted individual just like the rest of us  its just a tragedy maybe they will fire me too because i refused twice to go work on weekends now  at this point i wouldnt mind it i just find it sad how workers are treated in our lifetime,m4cfel

453,Globalism makes change harder,through history revolutions have taken place in small groups or as big as countries now these groups have characteristics in common and were independent which is why they are capable of a revolution   but nowadays the economical system capitalism and neoliberalism are all over the world all countries are connected to each other if one country tries to change it cant do so without hurting its relationship with the other countries be it importation and exportation the transnational companies etc   what we need is an international revolution which is imo a lot harder than a national revolution i think this is one of the reasons change is so hard,m3ugaq

460,The problem is not working. Its simply working TOO damn much.,listen to this  8 hours a day 11 invested daily 5 days a week  listen to that again 8 hours a  day 5 out of 7 days a week  it gives you about 2 hours a day of actual freedom and only 2 days out of an entire week  no human being on this planet should ever dedicate more than 6 hours in a single day to work  even 6 hours is questionable but under any circumstance a shift shall never pass 6 hours in 1 day  besides the fact that its just simply inhumane and i say fact strongly cause the science backing is literally endless it is just extremely inefficient and is done too much in 1 week to even make sense  i dont care if you work 2 3 or 4 days a week i reiterate under no circumstance should a human be labored longer than 6 hours in a single fucking day,m4sxkd

472,Being a transgender person in the workforce makes it so much worse,tldr im being discriminated against by my horrible manager and its got me feeling hopeless  im new to this subreddit and also new to the job force my parents didnt let me get a job until they were vaccinated for covid im an 18 year old transgender man hehim and im very open about that in both my application and to my coworkers i refuse to hide my identity from people just because they think my existence is a debatable subject maybe not the safest idea because i live in the bible belt but whatever trans rights bitches   i think i pass well as a guy and im fairly well established in my workplace as a maleidentified person i work in a chain restaurant and when people approach me at the drive through theyll usually refer to me as sir man or bro depending on who im interacting with i have 3 managers well call them managers a b and c and manager a the one whos the most tolerable even told me one day that she told everybody in the staffing and management at the restaurant what my pronouns were and to tell her if i experienced any discrimination manager a and b as well as most of my coworkers are very good with remembering my pronouns but manager c the most dickish of the managers just wont call me by my pronouns i have no idea why he just constantly refers to me with she which does not help my dysphoria at all manager a said she told everyone in the restaurant c included so theres no reason why he should be calling me by incorrect pronouns unless hes just incredibly forgetful and doesnt hear that just about everyone calls me he unless hes doing it intentionally i asked manager b to tell c to stop misgendering me and she told me that it was between me and c for that discussion to happen which i hate to think about why should i have to ask the person in charge of everyone else for basic respect im also nervous that calling him out on this could result in me getting snapped at which already happens to me a lot because manager c is horrible to the workers under him he accuses all of us of playing around when hes not doing anything to help us during the dinner rush snaps at me when i forget to hand out drinks and even has the audacity to yell at me for handing out the wrong bags of food when he hands them to me and tells me which car to bring it to needless to say its not a conversation that i want to have or should have to have  i may be new to this subreddit but ive known that capitalism is a fundamentally broken system for a while now and now that im experiencing the discrimination that i am and i know that discrimination against me will always be present in the workplace towards me just because of how i am its getting me immensely depressed im considering filing a complaint with the higher ups at the corporate leveli assume that because im being discriminated against when the contracts i signed specifically said i wouldnt and its a chain restaurant with more red tape to work around than an independent company then i should have at least some luck on my sidebut i have my doubts itll do anything i still live with my parents and am going to college in the fall so i dont desperately need this job so technically i could quit any time but im just so tired of not having money to afford things i want to be able to get top surgery and keep paying for my testosterone in the future not to mention i need to have money in reserve for emergency expenses   i feel like it might look better on my resume if i stay with this job for at least 3 months but im already so miserable besides that i have other things to focus on im still a senior in high school and i still need to prep for college but the truth is that even though i know that id be happier if i quit my job im scared to drop it i dont want to not be able to afford things now or in the future and i feel like im somewhat useless if i dont have a job at 18 i wanted a job so badly before my parents would let me get one so it feels defeating to quit it after ive only been there for a month so im at a loss but i still have to work for 7 hours straight tomorrow it doesnt really feel like any move i make now will be a step in the right direction,m3yib5

479,My doctor strongly recommended bed rest and all I could think about was work 😞,i go to university full time for animation i have a slipped disc in my spine which is causing sciatica and i also have fibromyalgia  chronic fatigue syndrome i really need a break i was running myself into the ground and my doctor could really see that im in a lot of pain so i got strong pain killers he told to spend the next 2 weeks in bed before i get an xray and i freaked the fuck out 1 because my painkillers make me sleepy which makes me extremely unproductive and 2 because i knew for a fact my university would not allow me to have 2 straight weeks off and even if they did i would feel so much guilt about not working i ended up trying to think of a creative solution which was to move my pc and cintiq next to my bed so i could satisfy both parties while completely ignoring what i needed and wanted   my partner told me that was insane and that i needed to take care of myself i took a step back and realised how long it had been since i have had an actual break which has been a very very long time how long i had been neglecting myself how badly i had treated myself that im sick im disabled and that i need a break i even went to the doctor not because i needed help but because i wanted to stop the pain so i could sit down and work again because i was terrified of missing my deadlines how screwed up is that my student loan is my only income and im too disabled to work a normal job   i still dont see a solution to my problem as of now nor am i asking for one i just wanted to share my experience it is rather haunting that we are conditioned from such a young age to just run ourselves into the ground with no regard for our health and wellbeing the thought that we have to earn our right to exist its disgusting but i dont see anything changing this has strengthen my anti work stance even more though i will try my best to not teach my future children this i do not want them to determine their worth based on how productive they are,m4d5h6

495,Are we perpetuating industries because we have no way out?,many people work in industries or at companies that dont align with their values and these industries and companies continue thriving because people cant all just massquit and put them out of business   mcdonalds would have no workers if there was ubi but because people need an entrylevel job and dont have other options they put up with working there despite the poor employment practices   its not easy to just pick up and leave were not incentivized to because there isnt much of a safety net even if youre a whistleblower it can be a long time before you get compensated if they get compensated at all   if i didnt have to work i would not care about the industry im in i would focus on cleaning up the environment helping animals selling food but i dont leave because these are the skills i have and i make much more money doing work i dont align with i used to like my work but after so many years im disenchanted with it   i was watching a webinar for work and imagined that the person doing the webinar cares little about what theyre saying but they say it because theyre paid to do so if we werent forced to work for a living its likely webinars like that would go away because who would seriously want to do that when they could go do something that aligns more with their values   how many industries would disappear if we werent forced to work for a living and how many companies that didnt treat people right would shut down because nobody would work there   i think of employees at wells fargo that opened fake accounts and forged customer signatures because they were told to meet quotas if they didnt have to work for a living they could more easily justify leaving but someone who has tons of bills and has to work justifies doing something unethical because they need to survive   just a rant and another reason people shouldnt be forced to work to live,m51mln

596,Many of us probably has a passion that fits perfectly with our personality. But we spend so much time working we’ll never discover it.,once you have a job and a family you dont have time anymore to explore mew hobbies or interest you work 910 hour days come home to spend 2 hours with your family make time for a 30min  1 hour workout so you dont die from bad health and then collapse from mental exhaustion every day i dont have time to try new hobbies i just end up playing video games or watching tv because its easy i dont have a limitless supply of drive because the 10 hour days are killing me,m23ezt
597,What do you guys think about GME? As a means of fighting back? Or more importantly spreading leftist ideas?,i wanted to know what you guys thought about it if there was something i maybe wasnt understanding but the way i see it why isnt this being talked about more in leftist communities there are a lot of leftist ideas already on wallstreetbets but i havent seen many leftist subreddits talking about wallstreetbets unions and workers uniting are of course great but very difficult and a violent revolution almost certainly not happen today and would be crushed so why not this its already gained a ton of somewhat lasting momentum and has the potential to be extremely effective i think it would be a mistake to not take advantage of this momentum to not only hurt the super rich but to also get more people on board and spread class consciousness would it not,m24dk3
598,Learning to un-internalize capitalist mindset,i work in an industry that i genuinely enjoy but doesnt pay the best at least not at my level of work since the pandemic business has suffered and the scope of my work has been pared back lotttsssss of downtimeredditsocial media instead of work additionally my company put us on workshare which means im capped at 32 hours a week but still qualify for federal unemployment assistance   initially i struggled with this i legitimately liked my job and was eager to advance and this change in my work felt like a complete halt in any sort of professional momentum id developed but now im starting to embrace it i work 20 less have a three day weekend every other week and with federal unemployment assistance i actually make considerably more in take home pay than if i were working at my standard 40 hoursweek releasing considerable financial pressure   im coming around to learning that im worth more than my economic value i mean how good for my mental health can it be to tie my self worth to a system that has inadvertently rewarded me for doing less true i do want to feel useful and fulfilled at work but barring that ill take this pay bump  note this post is not meant as a brag so many people have suffered terribly over the last year and for a long time before that its just sheer luck that ive somehow benefited overall from the pandemic and how absurd that situation is,m2av8p
599,"I'm broke, but I feel okay.",im not happy about it but im not sad about it either i guess im lucky i learnt from a young age that money cant make me happy i have a job that pays well but my heart isnt into it and i enjoy having the freedom to just be and to do what i like when i like more than i enjoy chasing money just to spend it on things that i dont even need  the strange thing is i feel just as peaceful now as i did when i wasnt broke heres a quote thats really resonating with me at this point in my life  i have no problems because i dont demand anything from anybody or from life  j krishnamurti from this videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0g5skbgilqg,m2wvrc

601,I’ve started half-a**ing my work and I feel happier and more productive,been in current job 25 years constantly understaffed too much work work is boring repetitive analysis stuff denied growth opportunities and now theyve all dried up because covid not many jobs out there right now ive spent so much time depressed and miserable and unable to motivate myself got told last quarter i had been missing work and to change way i was doing stuff this was mostly the method of doing work and changing this improved stuff the last week i decided i was sick of it im trying to learn skills to get another job but never had time and burned out after work so i started halfaing my work i used to basically spend a lot of time analyzing stuff making sure there werent any errors making sure i put lots of effort in i still do that on some files that require it but ive been doing it long enough that ive started making quick decisions and moving on ive gone from doing maybe 30 files a day to 100 and then i reward myself by doing stuff i want to do because im well ahead of schedule maybe theyll say it has errors or maybe its how i should have been doing it all along and theyll laud me for my productivity and increasing the numbers either way i feel liberated well see how it turns out,m279zb

604,Alternative societies,i see a lot of complaining on this sub but what im yet to see is someone with an alternative solution as to how we can live in society with such a large population of humans  my first thought is people are going to need to work thinking especially farmers or laborers for example in order to keep us all fed and sheltered people with these skills would need to work tirelessly as they already do how would we compensate them without money and going back to capitalism  are there any authors or theorists out there who have suggested an alternative way of living in a society and one which we can realistically transition into from the state we are in now   id be very interested to learn about alternatives as i believe the mental health crisis we are currently undergoing is caused by the somewhat purposeless lives most of us feel that we are living by grinding away 8 hours a day 5 days a week at least that as i am not smart enough to think up any myself,m2sbrt
605,Boomer Coworker Speech:,my supervisor gave my coworkers and i a very rousing speech this morning about toughing it out she explained that we should all be greatful for our great pay and easy work that she herself was once in our shoes and thought of quiting many many times she confessed that she stuck with it though and that now after 25 years shes too old to go anywhere else she closed out the speech by asking us to up our numbers and do mandatory overtime this weekend  for context my office is two permanent workers and six contract workers our titles are all office administration assistants but we do custodial work for the documents department moving hundreds of files day in and day out its actually very physically taxing and we have to also data entry 200 files per day as well   we get paid 12 or less an hr with no breaks save for a half hour unpaid lunch which in my state they technically dont need to provkde for us thanks va and of course no benefits the jobs we all have are not permanent in anyway even though theyve been rotating contractors in these same exact positions for 5 plus years  this is at the corporate offices of one of the largest most profitable banks in the nation whose ceo got a 55 million dollar bonus during the pandemic this year    sorry needed to vent a bit trying to look for something else on the weekends i absolutely despise corporate office work cant beleive they get away with having a majority of their departments filled with contractor positions seems like there should be limits in place they treat us like second class citizens even though we are all skilled and decently educated,m3nywa
606,Full time jobs take up too much time for anything else,im young 19 and honestly i just think to myself there is literally zero chance i can and will do this my whole life i just walk through my job and see people making the same wage as me and they are in their 50s 60s all of that i imagine how they feel because they probably have back pain leg pains all that and they still havent retired and yet some of them are there basically full time  now i have no problem with working full time i make good money and i pay for my car bill phone bill and a portion of the rent and my car ensurance the problem isnt working the problem is how much work takes up your actual life  i work for one of those grocerie store companies but anyways its just dumb how much working takes up your time like ill be scheduled 5 or 6 days straight and 2 days off but sometimes theyll finesse my schedule and work me 5 days farther to the end of the week and then theyll work me the first day of the new week so basically i would work 6 days straight instead of 5 and its still just 40hrs per week its basically like 80 work and the other 20 is spent thinking how tf imma get out of this work life   people always say certain things are unrealistic like wanting to actually go for your goal or passion example  pro athlete actor singer rapper influencer and more honestly id rather go for my real goals and passions which could take a year or maybe more to reach instead of slaving for these huge companies for the rest of my life honestly i just want financial freedom and actual freedom working for companies is more like they own you and you have to work around the schedule they make for you  like i have something on the side that im working on to turn into my main income but a lot of the time i never have time to work on it because once i get home at around 940 im already tired and ready to eat and chill for a bit then once i wanna work on it im too tired and then i fall asleep and wake up in the morning like welp gotta get ready for work again and then when the off days come you always are thinking in the back of my head damn i have to work tomorrow regardless im just gonna grind on my side goal and once i make income from it enough to equal my wage now then ill quit working for another man for good  idk this is just a rant im just wondering if anyone else feels the same way i feel bc work is too time consuming,m3kj3w

618,If they made primary school more the workplace...,some parts of primary school absolutely condition kids for a life of capitalism homework unnatural waking hours threat of being homeless in your future life if you dont do well but what if we went even further with this what would primary school look like   if we really want to condition kids to what life is like first we need to start getting them up at 6am their school is over one hour away with traffic and even though school doesnt start till 8 their teachers expect them their at 745 they are made to feel bad if they show up at 8   the classrooms are grey and beige primarily   every single day teachers have kids teach themselves out of a book in the same subjects year after year if they have a question the teacher acts like they are bothering them and makes the kids feel dumb passive aggressiveness is the main control mechanism it is nailed into the kids heads that if they dont do well in school they will be homeless as a direct consequence   there is no art there is no gym there is no music or extra curricular activities just books reading studying and doing exercises from the book all day recess they need to use their time more productively electives too much freedom   kids dont speak to many people at lunch in fact the lunchroom is made specifically too small to accommodate everyone for building cost effectiveness most kids eat at their desk in silence   school hours are from 8am to 5pm with every other weekend kids are conditioned to feel guilty for leaving at 5pm on the dot and there is no more cheering when the final bell rings they almost have to appear disappointed that its all over with sometimes theyre called in randomly at 7am on their saturday off there is no summer break or any other breaks for that matter the kids are given 1 week of holiday a year or 2 weeks if theyve been in the school district more than three years     i am pretty sure most people would consider this kind of life soul sucking to children they would go so far as go call it abusive and cruel but its literally what we go through every day on top of the other adult things like maintaining our living areas paying bills cooking and other things we have to do day in and day out that eat up the rest of our adult lives,m3952n

633,"Raising the minimum wage to even beyond $15, using Free Market Capitalism (lol)",hey all i may not be the first to think of this and subsequently the first to post it but its a fun idea that is worth sharing  all lowminimum wage earners stuck at their job andor people who are comfortable at their job and want to help start applying at targeted businesses crush the interview and the second interview up until the point of them offering you the position  at this point we all pause and inquire about the starting pay and regardless of what they pay we politely decline citing the pay being way too low and you will be taking another offer or staying at your current job  if enough people did this besides wasting their time and payroll extensively in the already costly hiring and training process they would start to see that the rate that they pay isnt enough to attracted anyone that they identified as talented enough to pass the interviews   so by supply and demand they are not able to attract talent and must slide the pay upwards until the position gets filled  due to opportunity cost everyone is perceivably already being paid more at their current job or other offers to accept  rinse and repeat and literal profit,m3002w

640,I have an interview for a life changing job tomorrow and I need it but I really hope I don't get it,i fucking hate my current job and dream of up and quitting every single day i do incredibly basic financial data entry in an office i literally spend 8 hours a day sitting at a desk copying and pasting and clicking buttons for shit pay im a robot who as far as i can tell provides no real contribution to society words cant describe how menial and braindead it is i couldnt find a job in my major after graduating last may and this is the best i could do  ampx200b  but tomorrow after months of applying i finally have an interview with a super well known company i probably shouldnt name it but its probably easy to figure out in a position that could lead to great opportunities down the road directly tied to my college major i should be stoked this is finally my chance to set my life back on track except god damn as shit as my work life is now i know that if i get this job im going to hate it infinitely more ill have to work 13 hour overnight shifts 4 days per week meaning i will never again have time or energy for anything other than work ill have to move away from my friends and family so even on the three nights i have off not weekends btw ill have nobody to see and there sure as hell wont be anywhere open to go to the work itself will be incredibly fast paced and high intensity right now at least i get to sit at a desk all day but with this new job i dont know how i wont be constantly exhausted ill be managing other people and given the reputation of this company i assume that means one of my primary tasks will be breathing down minimum wage workers necks and cracking whips at them something i dont agree with and would hate to be expected to do i wont get holidays off and vacation time is the one benefit they leave out of their benefits webpage so ill get maybe a week or two if im really lucky  ampx200b  all of this is to say i hate this situation im stuck in like i said the last year of my life has been miserable and hopeless thanks to my current job and acing this interview means a huge advance in my career with a large pay increase to go with it but i just know that if i get offered this job ill have to take it but my life will also only get worse with it maybe the best outcome here is if i just dont get offered the job and continue being a braindead lowpay robot i just really hate how in order to truly advance our careers were forced to take jobs that suck every ounce of our lives out of us until were reduced to work and sleep and nothing else,m2jbpr

643,We had a mandatory formation on mental health at work...,and honestly i dont know why i even had expectations  since the beginning of the pandemic we were told that productivity had to stay the same or go up or else some of us would have to be let go to cut costs ironically both happened we had a good year production wise but they still fired a lot of people whos surprised right  but a lot more employee have been take time off and taking mental health day so they decided that the issue had to be addressed and created a formation about mental health that we all had to take  was it about how to talk about mental heath at work how to get accommodation what services they offer or anything like that of course not it was about how having positive thinking will solve our mental health issues  i would be fucking insulted even if i didnt struggle with mental health but now at least i know that being positive will cure my bipolar disorder s,m3hx4j

651,My mother is a serf,my mother has had a long 40 year career doing an incredibly degrading job for rich people  shes an accountant for one of the richest families in michigan  they have so much wealth to keep track of that they employ an office of twelve people to manage it all year long  most of what her job entails is moving hundreds of millions of dollars in money and investments around to try and help these fat cats dodge taxes  she also has the fun job of telling their trust fund kids that they exceeded their 60000 spending limit for the month  she has an alright income rate from all of this and solid job security but the extra things they make her do are abhorrent for people who have so much  every tax season she and her coworkers have to work all weekend every weekend for two months on their own time no overtime all to try and do some extra manipulation and heavy lifting to make sure these richies pay as little in taxes as possible  i can imagine some pretty awful jobs but this one is riddled with so much disgusting irony her entire career revolves around making sure the people who have the most contribute the least to society,m38411

653,I love working. I just don’t love working to stay alive.,my guess is a lot of you most feel this way too id love to build something that enhances society or makes people happy but if im so concerned with making enough money to keep the lights on i may never do it  how did we get to a place in society where our ability to live became so closely tied to how much we could do for others  i hope that one day we can rely on machines to do enough work that we can create a utopia where people can choose whether to work and choose what to work on and when because all of our basic needs are met without anyone having to work  or just get rid of capitalism and let people do what they want maybe then we can advance as a society instead of advancing aka coming up with more bs to peddle that forces people to work longer hours so they can afford it,m33i3g

655,What are your plans?,i know most of us want to stop working or possibly change jobs or the nature of work but what realistic and achievable plans do you have in place to make that happen and im talking about a realistic and viable plan and concrete steps toward that end so if your plan is i want to overthrow the entire system thats admirable but in order for this to be a meaningful discussion id like to hear about the concrete actions you are taking or planning to take and how those will bring it about and what would you do with your life when that plan has come into fruition  id like to know because maybe we can share our ideas discuss those ideas help other realize their goals and maybe just support each other  i realize that people here come from different places in their lives and what may seem like a viable path for someone may not be even within the realm of possibilities for another but maybe we can actually help each other so even if you are struggling with minimum wage and just being able to put food on the table or pay rent maybe we can come up with a plan so that the future isnt quite so bleak   my situation is in short this i grew up poor i went to school and landed what people consider a cushy corporate job i worked hard for it and the payoff is actually pretty lousy and soulsucking not to mention the damage it has done to me mentally and physically   ive calculated that i need to save up take risk in stocks to the tune of about about 500k so that i can retire and live in a hut in the middle of nowhere and generate just enough in dividends to buy electricity and food   while i understand that that is capitalism and it might perpetuate the problem we all have here i dont see any other viable option for me im not able to bring about the social economic or political change in a short enough amount of time that i could achieve my goal in the time frame i want ie about the next ten years however if enough of us corporate tools get out before a normal retirement age maybe that will also bring about some change  so i save as much as i can so that i can get about a pretax income from capital alone of about 25k which leaves me with north of about 1500 per month after taxes   i want my children to go to university and study something they care about and not something they think will benefit them in a corporate setting i dont want them in a corporate setting at all and i just want them to be able to do what they like and live free   my hut is not some majestic mansion just a hut in the middle of the forest electricity but no indoor plumbing  ive asked people around me who say they want to be rich about how much money exactly do they want most of the time i hear some unachievable round number like 10 million and theyre always shocked to hear that my goal is 5 of that   i want to be free not filthy rich   so hopefully this is a somewhat ok discussion starter,m3gsia
656,Goodbye to my employers,for the past 2 years ive been running a company for my bosses without the acknowledgement or the right remuneration purely because i cared for my job  over the past year theyve spent the time abroad in their house in mexico avoiding the lockdowns weve had in the uk despite that i continued my work because hey were all in this together  earlier this week i called them to ask for the correct title and remuneration for the job ive been doing theyve agreed over the call but yesterday theyve retracted their decision and said no to my ask so i resigned  dont let yourselves be manipulated and know your worth its so hard to realise that you are worth so much more than this hindsight is a beautiful thing at the end of the day this is purely a business transaction,m32djq

659,Full time jobs take up too much time for anything else :(,im young 19 and honestly i just think to myself there is literally zero chance i can and will do this my whole life i just walk through my job and see people making the same wage as me and they are in their 50s 60s all of that i imagine how they feel because they probably have back pain leg pains all that and they still havent retired and yet some of them are there basically full time  now i have no problem with working full time i make good money and i pay for my car bill phone bill and a portion of the rent and my car ensurance the problem isnt working the problem is how much work takes up your actual life  i work for one of those grocerie store companies but anyways its just dumb how much working takes up your time like ill be scheduled 5 or 6 days straight and 2 days off but sometimes theyll finesse my schedule and work me 5 days farther to the end of the week and then theyll work me the first day of the new week so basically i would work 6 days straight instead of 5 and its still just 40hrs per week its basically like 80 work and the other 20 is spent thinking how tf imma get out of this work life   people always say certain things are unrealistic like wanting to actually go for your goal or passion example  pro athlete actor singer rapper influencer and more honestly id rather go for my real goals and passions which could take a year or maybe more to reach instead of slaving for these huge companies for the rest of my life honestly i just want financial freedom and actual freedom working for companies is more like they own you and you have to work around the schedule they make for you  like i have something on the side that im working on to turn into my main income but a lot of the time i never have time to work on it because once i get home at around 940 im already tired and ready to eat and chill for a bit then once i wanna work on it im too tired and then i fall asleep and wake up in the morning like welp gotta get ready for work again and then when the off days come you always are thinking in the back of my head damn i have to work tomorrow regardless im just gonna grind on my side goal and once i make income from it enough to equal my wage now then ill quit working for another man for good  idk this is just a rant im just wondering if anyone else feels the same way i feel bc work is too time consuming,m3kraw

690,My boss lied to me and thinks I can't read,another rant i couldnt help but post here recently i requested that i be able to skip take my lunch break at work i asked for this for a few reasons the first reason is that my lunch break is constantly interrupted im a warehouse worker and i am responsible for receiving and loading large shipments off of trucks the issue is that these trucks always show up around my allotted lunch time nobody else is able to work the forklift so i am literally the only person who can take care of this so at least twice a week if not more during busy season i have to stop my lunch and process these shipments the second reason is that my commute is a solid 45 minutes each way and i work an 85 hr day this means that if traffic is average or bad im spending an average of 10 hrs a day away from home if i dont take my lunch and just took 515 minutes to eat i could be home a solid half hour earlier to the woman i love ultimately i realize this is a personal request and not everyone has the luck to even ask this of their employer but i dared to ask anyways i wouldve taken a straight no for an answer without issue i take issue when my boss not only side stepped my request but lied to me as if i wouldnt be able to fact check them i sent them a direct email they didnt respond to me so i asked a coworker who had more direct contact to tell them to check their email and respond to me my boss had the audacity to not even respond to me through my email or by phone but instead responded to a separate coworker who gave me their response it essentially amounted to no you cant do that i want you here until the last minute to make sure the place is in order every day well whatever right nope they kept going stating that law required me to take lunch and it was out of their hands except i had looked up both state and federal law before asking to make sure that it would be a problem for this exact reason i looked at evey possible credible source and found no such requirement on either a state or federal level no other person at my workplace lives more than 10 minutes away having worked for this company for 5 years i figure maybe the boss would give me this little leeway so that i could not only have the annoyance of interrupted workthrough lunches removed but also get home to my dear a little earlier in the evening but no ill go fuck myself because my boss thinks i cant read between the lines and take no like an adult fuck them and fuck the people who spew shit hrough their teeth like they do im so fucking sick of being treated like a middle schooler at work tldr my boss lied about there being a law preventing me from skipping my nonexistant lunches to leave a little earlier to go home to my love,lzs6w4

693,UBI and Assured Housing will just lead to serfdom if we aren't careful,i know a lot of people on this sub really like the idea of ubi and assured housing to remove the violence of capitalist society  however when thinking of this its even more important to use logic to get through this situation  why would your torturer put down the lash if not to pick up a worse tool to hurt you with  serfdom was actually a pretty good deal for its time  free land to till your lords armies and walls would protect your family from bandits and your lord would even throw you parties out of appreciation yup pizza parties are that old  did i mention they worked an average of 3 days a week  thing is this was back when the elites of society were basically dying from the same things we were and not even living that much more comfortably than peasants plus there wasnt that much of a technological gap between swords and ploughshares  this is the best case scenario for ubiassured housing and it doesnt have a chance of happening  modern elites are used to being able to extract 20x1000x the profit for something they pay for you can bet your ass theyll be doing that if theyre giving you a stipend and a place to stay  3 days  how about 7 you now live at your job  we dont even have to imagine this there was a very good post on here that was unfortunately deleted where the person detailed being offered free housing by an employer who then verbally abused them forced them to build countless projects on their property and even asked their work to scale back their hours to do more unpaid tasks for them at home  yang and musk are sus  when an elite is talking about ubi or assured housing it should send a chill down your spine  they do not have the same needs as you or i  even the most well intentioned politicians are brought up to the status of elite once they win their election  they will never worry about being hungry their resume will assure them some form of advisory role in some company for more than you will make in your lifetime just because of their role in society  when they hamstring their campaign promises when they sabotage their constituency when the only elites who can say anything that would actually fix our issues are too weak to do anything that isnt them being stupid or incompetent it is part of the plan  please dont be dense there really is no such thing as a free lunch under capitalist society    we will need some form of assured resources housing etc to remove the violence from capitalism but it must be taken from the ruling class that power must be physically removed from the hands of the ruling class and placed in our control or we will never be sure what we are giving up in the short or long term,ly8n1v

746,Rant: my company has an annual bonus program to “incentivize you”,so like others have said here we have an annual bonus program that is actually not half bad but there is a catch they add up your hours of availability then run it through an equation so for example lets say you got sick a few times took three whole days of funeral leave had to take another week off for surgery got covid and followed health department guidelines to keep your actual coworkers safe and healthy and your year end quote availability was only 85 even though you accepted plenty of ot shifts throughout the year then because of their little number crunch equating you lose 60 of your bonus   how does that incentivize a person at all it 100 incentivizes you to come in to work sick break pandemic protocol miss your grandfathers funeral and come back to work high on pain pills from having delivered a baby last week are these people for real   this is my first year ever i will have ever gotten a year end bonus last year i got one for 2019 but i was hired in june so i only got half a years worth which was still pretty nice     2020 happened i worked all year through the pandemic a lot of employees got to work from home but my job is essential we are happy to get a bonus this year because the business was down quite a bit but no matter this year i had a funeral missed three shifts due to quarantine rules had surgery and called out twice due to a whole 25 weeks out ill be losing like 20 of the bonus i think i dont see the incentive though   this year im pregnant and will be taking 12 weeks off and im happy about that whatever but ill be out for so long i probably will get zero dollars for 2021 bonus i definitely could take 68 weeks off but the bonus would still be so small i dont see the point there is no actual incentive    the only incentive i can see in the entire company is some higher up vp who gets like a 20 bonus since im hourly and a lowly worker i get like 7 who has a kid he will totally show up for work the next day after baby is born in order to keep his bonus and honestly he just pushes paper all day doesnt really make product so its backwards as usual,m1o4bz

757,Comparing American work vocabulary to British work vocabulary reveals stark differences in work culture,in the uk when you want to take time off work and travel you go on holiday so happy and fun the word is focused on what you do instead of work it makes sense that theyd use such a happy word the british have guaranteed time off every year and their passport used to grant them free access to all of europe  in america a holiday is only used to mean time off on christmas martin luther king day new years etc regular workers dont even get time off in those holidays in the us some office workers get some of them off but its all up to the boss   when we take time off not on a holiday we use a super negative word for it  we dont go on holiday we leave our post vacant we leave our beloved boss with a vacancy we take a vacation  the word itself is not fun at all the word itself is trying to shame you for taking time off,m1ier6

764,Antisocial culture will kill us all,im not even exaggerating  i understand that not everyone wants to go to parties dance around in clubs and go to family gatherings but hear me out  humans as animals fucking suck  we spent literally millions of years getting hunted by better animals  we only really have two beneficial weapons in a stone age world  we are really good at collecting stuff and we are able to work together  forget the big brain shit because it literally doesnt even matter until we can get those two skills down  the only reason we are where we are at is because we learned to cooperate because we were friendly enough to have other humans to watch our ass and do the things we werent as good at  im a big lefty but currency had a big hand in this  see humans dont have the brain power to actually have that many social connections it caps off between 100150 maximum which is a pretty small community  you cant actually do very much with only a couple hundred people you cant have sophisticated sewage systems and you cant have scientific research  this changed with technological advancements starting with bartering systems currencies like gold and eventually fiat currencies like dollars  what this represents isnt the development of capitalism but a necessary development of systems that would allow for collaboration across many different 100150 sized social groups    now in the modern era we have been so propagandized by a bourgeois society that we have almost entirely replaced socialization with the technology of currency exchange and it is killing us  this is because doing that only works if you are already at the top of the system  a rich person is fundamentally different from you and i  they have so much money that they dont go shopping they pay someone to do it for them  they dont manage their own money they pay someone to do it for them  of you are rich you can completely replace your social system with a system of paying people and you can do this until you die  the rest of us literally cannot do this  if you do not maintain social connections you will be taken advantage of and robbed  you probably will not ever have enough money to sustain a lifestyle of replacing all of your social connections with monetary ones  this is why the system is so sinister you will see your capitalist live like this replacing the effort needed in creating social relationships with the almighty dollar they will say that one day you can be like them  you may go all in replacing time spent socializing which would give you a sincere stable support structure for an opportunity to replace it with money  they will take and take and take your time while you chase that dream until you eventually fall short are too old to build that support structure with your body too frail to take care of yourself and you will die having done nothing with your life except make your boss rich  capitalism is an antisocial social order and it will run us into the ground  i dont need to worry about the planet if i have enough money for a bunker is a meme that will kill us all,m1yjot

769,I really wish people would stop glamorizing entrepreneurship like it’s not still work...,rant   i get it working for yourself setting your own schedule unlimited income is all amazing perks of being an entrepreneur but its still work i had a business in the past and in the beginning stages i wore every single hat from accounting to social media management and it can be exhausting to force yourself to close your laptop for the day and not answer emails because sometimes you feel like you just havent done enough or there isnt enough time in the day to get all of your work done even when youre no longer in the start up phase youre still devoting so much of your time to working which for some people may be fine if youre doing what you love but even people who work their dream jobs arent walking on rainbows everyday they go into work   as an entrepreneur sometimes the pressure is on 10xs as much because youre the one that has to pull yourself out of bed so you can pay your bills feed your family and live a comfortable life so many influencers and entrepreneurs nowadays glamorize entrepreneurship like being able to sleep in until 12 or theyre always in hawaii like sure theres perks but there are a lot more entrepreneurs that are sacrificing time with family to make sure their business runs smoothly so they can keep up their selfemployed lifestyle so they dont have to go back to working a 95  sorry i really just had to get that off of my chest im just so annoyed of hearing people say oh youre sick of working a 95 start a business dont like your retail job monetize your hobby the answer to our capitalist system is not always entrepreneurship and to be honest its not for everyone its hard work instead of resorting to forcing entrepreneurship down peoples throats support causes and ideas that promote a society where everyone can live comfortably without having to hustle outside of their day job,m06oxd

780,Working isn't bad on its own. Exploitation is.,id like to get a conversation started on this matter     while i agree with the sentiment that work can be a drag and a hinderance working is still prefered to the alternative     if we look at this from an economics perspective here is what we have    gdp is the total value of goods and services produced in an economy over a given period of time   if people work less then assuming everything else the same there are less goods or services being offered in an economy which means the private consumption of them diminishes      which in turn makes businesses lay off staff since they no longer need as many people working there      that in turn pushes for a weaker demand in the economy less sales mean a negative forecast and less need for workers which increases unemployment     all of this is capitalisms fault you might say well capitalism is vastly preferred to the alternative there are academic studies that have followed the evolution of gdp per capita in power purchasing parities during centuries and concluded no other economy has had such a sustained and expressive growth as capitalists economies have      which means when capitalism works everyone gets richer and they get richer compared to economies that havent implemented capitalism and that is proven its not my opinion      furthermore when you start increasing the demands for businesses to operate in they will hire less people the harder it is to fire the less people will be hired since businesses can antecipate the legal hardships which in turn increases unemployment and if working was bad not receiving any income is worse    it seems that most people on this sub dont hate work as much as they hate working in a toxic environment or working in a place that doesnt fulfill them in a significant matter    you dont hate working you hate your job       does the system need to change yes is it by abolishing capitalism no,m1lhvk

Feel like a loser now if I were to drop out and do a trade or something.,if i say how much i feel about not liking college in another typical kind of sub about college id probably just get told to suck it up or you dont have it as hard as i did   they tell you that you have to do shit you dont like because that shows employers that you are a capable person  doing mentally taxing work and spending an unfavorable amount of time doing it or that it prepares you yeah preparing me for more miserableness in the future   they tell you that you should get these higher paying jobs like stem so you can live more comfortably sure more money is good but is the effort even worth it in the first place though   ive been spinning my wheels in college for almost 4 years and im like not even half way to be able to get an associates yet my fault completely the further time i have left and added on difficulty of progressively more difficult courses to take gives me dread   i feel like a loser compared to other people in their 20s i still live with my parents going to school and might end up going until i get a bachelors which would be when im like fucking 27 years old thats like 22 years straight of going to school this is hellish i feel like a loser for wanting to drop out and just do a trade that doesnt stress me out mentally i can take physical stress much easier theres already tons of people in their early 20s living independently and some people right around my age already about to graduate im like the kid who got held back a billion years  i dont know if i can handle the stress of creating programs as my career its so daunting now already my mind is forced to constantly have to create original things which makes this feel even more harder than doing math,m06g37

801,The myth of being a high performer at work,it is said that in order to get a raise an employee must do more than what they are paid although this sounds like it makes sense i think thats not how it works in most workplaces for one thing ive yet to work at a job where just the amount of work and effort one needs to complete it is just righttheres either an overwhelming amount of work making completing it an impossible achievement in and of itself let alone excelling in it or jobs that require minimal effort to complete and people just sit around 80 of the day which in most cases are those sinking ship companies where they arent gonna invest in raises and growth anyway in the first case excelling at the job is impossible where in the second case pointless   i think performance has more to do with playing the power game right rather than actual performance the notion of doing more than what you are paid for benefits those on the top but not necessarily the worker especially when excelling at a job is a requirement rather than something actual high performers are rewarded extra for  in reality most who give it 100 every day are simply doing their job while those who have realistic expectations for work are considered to be slackers   ideally a job should only require 6070 of effort to complete with the remaining 3040 reserved for employees to think rest reflect plan cover for a colleague on leave or to willingly work harder if they want to go after a promotion you simply cant exceed expectations when youre expected to give it 100 every single day,lxaiqz

815,Ethics of passive income,so i really wanted to add to thishttpswwwredditcomrantiworkcommentsgak6ztwhatupfirefolkfp1ep6v comment thread because i disagree with the upvotedownvote distribution but the post is archived so hecc i guess ill make a new post d  it doesnt really make sense to me why writing a book and getting royalties would be any more ethical than investing money in the stock market and getting dividends in the case of publishing a book you put in the work up front to write a book which enables workers who assemble and distribute books something to sell you sit back and collect a portion of the earnings while they do the ongoing work in the case of investing in the stock market you put in the work up front to earn the money you invest which is used to build the means of production that enables workers to produce you sit back and collect a portion of the earnings while they do the ongoing work  i guess you might argue that most of the stock market is owned by people who didnt work to earn the money they used to invest but inherited it from rich parents or collected it by doing nothing at an overpaid bullshit job or something but id argue thats more analogous to your parents writing a book and letting you publish it under your name either way same situation as above only you didnt put in the work upfront so i still dont see how owning intellectual property would be different from owning stocks from an ethical standpoint there are all sorts of ways to acquire both  the way i see it writing a book isnt comparable to doing a normal job only you get the money later instead of right away because theres no upper bound on how much you can earn from royalties its getting a theoretically infinite amount of money from a finite amount of work just like investing in stocks its possible because someone else is doing the ongoing work of assembling and selling the books but idk what do you guys think  on another note im not sure if id say fire is ethical but i dont really think its unfair as in i dont think people doing fire are getting more than their fair share of value for putting in less than their fair share of work basically people doing fire work full time for 1020 years until they save enough to live on for the rest of their lives 40 hours of work per week for 10 years is the same amount of work as 10 hours of work per week for 40 years and dont we basically believe that everyone should have enough to live on while only needing to work 10 hours per week so i really cant bring myself to grudge fire people who only accumulate what they need to support themselves and their families   i mean okay theres no real ethical way of existing in this capitalistic system and we should abolish it etc etc but thats going to take time im not saying individualistic approaches are a solution but in the meantime is there any way to make things more tolerable for ourselves without being a complete asshat,lxzt87

825,There's something living behind the walls where I work..,either im going insane or im seeing things clearly for the first time i dont know  maybe those things arent distinct  what i do know is that what ive seen and felt is just as real as it is absurd and that absurdity makes it nearimpossible to talk about coherently but ill try anyway because as i type this my life has reached and passed the point of being only just barely bearable as far as i see it i have absolutely nothing to lose and hopefully writing it all out wil be therapeutic in its own way  for a long time i enjoyed my job or at least found it comfortably tolerable but a little over a year ago something changed  something almost imperceptible but something significant that i couldnt pin down until recently slapped in the face with the obviousness of it  this low and almost imperceptible sound sensation that buzzed hummed rumbled whistled and whined all at once with a subtle smell of damp and rot when i noticed it there was no unnoticing it and it was there not just in the but the background but the background itself emanating it seemed from all directions at first i assumed or hoped it was a mechanical abnormality maybe the furnace laboring especially hard because of the cold weather but i found it followed me home subdued slightly until brought back and felt at its full volume on my return to work it was as if the building and my body were speaking a language i could suffer but not understand  it was allconsuming i assumed or hoped i would eventually tune it out or be able to focus my attention in spite of it but it was both subtle enough to not completely overwhelm and constant enough to be irritating and unignorable with each passing day week and month i could feel my memory and energy eroding along with my very will to exist at all there was no longer a single aspect of my job to trick myself into enjoying anymore and i would dread the cycle continuing from the moment it finished i attributed my newfound anxiety and the strange symptom it had manifested to a general fatigue of covid and the accelerated absurdity that was 2020 and lets be real the few years preceding too but i couldnt shake the feeling that something was seriously off something beyond normal  it was like my spirit was being sucked suffocated and smothered by some force unseen  force that preferred me exhausted to dead  i figured my stress was also made worse by a timely midlife crisis i just turned 30 where i was struggling to let go of whatever brighteyed childhood dreams i once lived with and had now forgotten and diminished to a drone in pursuit of a goal i couldnt quite wrap my head around  a goal that made no real sense to me or i suppose the goal made sense but my means of getting there didnt i was stuck wanting to be unstuck and the only way to get unstuck i was told was to unstick myself  my manager must have noticed how disconnected id been because he called me in to his office and asked in a hushed tone and with great concern if everything was okay  i told him about the general stress fatigue and anxiety id been feeling lately and also made up some lie about learning of an old and imaginary friends passing all while the buzz hummed tirelessly as it always did behind our conversation although i had mostly acclimated to life with the sound and stench of this sensation for the first time since i had felt it for the first time it overwhelmed me and consumed everything else in that room and i could only sit there alone injured and not sure how or who to ask for help because i couldnt even quite articulate what i felt was happening to me  seriously thegreatself are you alright you look like youre about to pass out  his words broke through each word and then each syllable punctuated by static  i grimaced and pinched the bridge of my nose i asked him if he heard a buzzing  like tinnitus  sort of i guess not really or maybe i dont know i have to make an appointment with my doctor  he smiled wide and wildly eyes unmoving  his face set with an expression that felt far too exaggerated for the kind of interactions we usually had  have you ever met our boss  i struggled to answer because the question was a little stupid and one he already knew the answer to anticipating my confusion and im sure reading it on my face my hesitation was his turn to continue  i mean the real boss  the one above all else  the way he said those last five words creeped me the fuck out and a deep instinctual gut reaction to just run reared its head then and there his change in tone was so stark that it sounded like some disembodied voice had pushed its way out through a portal and past his lips  i briefly wondered who the fuck could be above the sole owner and founder of our company and the biggest asshole in the building but before i could answer his eyes finally shifted to match his smile igniting like someone just given permission to share something intimate  something they desperately want to talk about but cant or dont often get the opportunity  follow me theres something i think you should see  i sat up from my chair before he even finished and as if propelled by something i wanted no part of followed behind him past a row of cubicles and down a stairwell towards the ground floor and eventually past it into the bowels of the building whatever it was that pushed me forward was only helped by my veryhuman capacity for curiosity and whether or not i wanted to be a part of whatever was going on i was  so i moved forward the only way i could go  the further we descended the more intense the sensation seemed to surround but it morphed into something else twisting and contorting itself with the added sounds of grinding metal shattering glass explosions gunfire and tormented human screaming layered into a single consuming cacophony that was one endless crescendo  i dont know exactly how many flights of stairs we climbed down but it had to be more than actually existed by the time we reached the bottom i could barely walk or hold myself up unassisted and my faithful guide had to steady me to make any progress my heart was pounding faster than that one time i ate too many edibles and every beat sent bursts of pain right to the centre of my brain and it felt like my skull was about to explode torn apart by a noise i could hear but not understand  i wanted to collapse but i was being propped up and practically dragged by this point  what the fuck is happening to me i need to go to the hospital  theres nothing wrong with you and theres nothing the hospital can do for you dont worry were not far now and then youll see  and then youll wish you didnt see  see what whatever it was i didnt want to see it i just wanted some relief from the hell in my head but when he said the hospital couldnt help i instinctively and instantly knew he was right  i knew whatever was wrong with me was something significant and i was its opposite i knew that if i went to the hospital i was going to end up in a psych ward but the longer we continued the more that seemed like maybe thats just what i needed  we trudged down a long corridor lit by those awful fluorescent lights that smother everything in a flat constrastless and cold white a single heavy metal door with a porthole stood out at the end of the hallway lined on each side by doors that looked far more appropriate in the context of an office building every few seconds a banging on the door repeated in some strange disjointed pattern like discordant music from another dimension  and then everything was quiet  i heard quiet for the first time in over a year i stood limply at this door now overwhelmed and sick with exhaustion stricken by a silence that seemed foreign and alien to me if the buzz was allconsuming then the silence was its inverse  pure emptiness  i felt sick  i wanted to collapse  i was urged forward by a voice that trembled with a mixture of fear anger and anticipation  were here go ahead its all right in there everything you need to know is in there everything youre feeling is in there you asked about the noise so now witness it see it feel it let it show itself to you let it consume you open the door open the door  i felt like i was being beckoned by something vast and ancient  as if i was being called into a void that might swallow me whole and in swallowing me relieve me of everything that burdened me  if i had a choice i didnt know it if i could have turned around and walked back upstairs i think i would have  but i didnt because i couldnt  i could do only what i did and grip the doors handle tightly with both hands and heave  the sound of metal scraping started the symphony of sound again a cold air blasted past me carrying with it every awful and terrifying image and symbol my brain knew and could imagine it was as if i had opened a door to a raging storm in a boundless ocean where the wind whipped and carried with it things that were not things at all but more like memories disfigured and distorted and twisted by times passage  the sound and stench were back and more than ever and in a single horrifying flash i knew that its source was not external  it wasnt in the building behind the walls or even the door to another dimension i now stood in front of  it was living inside me and it had festered and grown until what i was once was consumed and all but forgotten what i saw behind that door was only a reflection of the ugliest parts of our own particularly peculiar human sickness  greed gluttony ignorance and contempt  there was nothing to see but i saw it anyway  an infinite blackness silhouetted a vaguely human form some strange amalgamation of familiar but mutated parts arranged nonsensically that danced in a frenzy thrashing and jerking with eyes absent yet looking straight through me as if it simultaneously didnt even acknowledge me and viewed whatever i was with a great radiating hatred  as it danced it counted and as it counted uncountable jewels sparkled and shimmered and rained down all around it and with each obscene and unrecognizable number it grew  more  more is all it wants all it knows and all it is more more and more forever more insatiable allconsuming accumulating endlessly forever  and ever  and beyond ever because never is enough enough there is no enough more always more more is all there is more is all that drives it  there is no end and no enough just a tireless march towards more a singular purpose of more more more more more more more more give me more more is not enough everything there is not enough there will never be enough  with a deafening crack i was back sitting in my managers office nose pinched between my thumb and finger and words echoing and rattling in my head  seriously thegreatself are you alright you look like youre about to pass out  the sound and stench were still there just subdued  what do you work for  he raised an eyebrow considered and confidently chuckled his reply  money  his laugh seemed to echo through the entire building and nestle itself to the now barely audible but still debilitating hum  maybe i never really left that office but maybe that didnt really matter  maybe what i saw was still real regardless maybe what might be true is just as significant as what is or at least what appears to be  i know it exists because i interact with it daily and i see hints that most others do too  we just dont know how to frame or conceptualize it beyond talking about mental health within the boundaries it permits  it wails endlessly and im sure differently for all silently screaming its own sick song or whispering vague promises of fulfillment to those chosen to be wielded to its end  to continue and preserve it as the one above all else  it is ancient and it is evil and most terrifyingly it is a part of us and a part seemingly inseparable an inoperable tumor that has been with us for so long we cannot imagine life in its absence because as far as we know there is no such thing  it exists because it must  or so it has led us to believe  so it manipulates us into prostration and so it forces submission through its singleminded and sole purpose  more is never enough  it doesnt want you to know that we can talk and that conversation might be all it takes to destroy or at least cripple it it has prepared for that by instilling in us a sense that this is just the way the world is as if the way the world is is completely untouched by our collective ideas about it  seeing the acceleration into absurdity that is the past decade im convinced its possible to get a message out and that message might shrink it not kill it outright but at least wound it im counting on it in fact because everything i read and everything i feel in my gut leads me to the inevitability of this worlds total collapse not by entropy but consumed by our own parasitic miasma of peddling and profit  a world where power politics and profit are indistinguishable  a message so simple it cant be misinterpreted  a message so simple it will be misinterpreted  unify  that is our only hope of depriving it  of smothering it underneath our collective gravity and extinguishing it with our shared sense of what is right what is good what is just what is valuable what is true and most importantly what is possible  the only thing it fears if it even knows what that is is that we might wish it away because as allconsuming and powerful as it is it is just as fragile perched on the precipice of uncertainty andfed powered and driven by nothing other than us and our own warped inclinations and desires  our perfectly human inclinations and desires  and with all that said there is nothing to do but return to wageslavery and give myself over to the void because really what else is there  nothing  just the counting,lx1shq
826,I really hate Jack Welch and I think he stands for everything wrong with corporations,keep in mind there are probably a lot of other guys much worse than him but this guy sticks out to me because how much they jerk him off when we now know he was an absolute fraud  jack welch was chairman and ceo of general electric ge between 1981 and 2001 he was called one the greatest ceos of all time i mean the profit figures said so the stock said so so he has to be great right  they jerk him off so hard that even when i first heard about him i was sorta skeptical they would keep talking about his great mindset his great vision his great leadership etc they even have stuff like the jack welch management institute books on how to lead like himgoddamn it makes me wanna puke soon theyre going to put his face on mount rushmore and create statues of him bigger than the jesus one in brazil  in reality hes the equivalent of one of those kings whos reign caused irreparable damage to the kingdom and would keep declining until it died general electric despite surviving over 100 years as one of the biggest companies was booted from dow jones industrial average recently and you can thank him for causing it  basically he stripped and sold all the electrical related divisions of general electric that he didnt consider profitable enough yeah killing the things that made it last over 100 years he cared so much about ge being a financial company he basically let ge capital run wildly without restrictions not too mention all those failed financial service projects which is what he used the money for after selling divisions and laying off workers oh yeah and dont forget about all those accounting tricks he used to make the profit numbers look real good lol  when it came to his culture he was the guy who made the vitality curve aka forced ranking so basically everyone regardless has to be ranked and every time there will be some guys forced to be at the bottom those guys get fired this system has been copied by many firms and even if not directly used the mindset from it is still there people become paranoid as the workplace becomes survivor all thanks to this wonderful guy  its funny when he talks about high performance because if he was under this system he would have been fired long ago  in 1963 an explosion at the factory which was under his management blew off the roof of the facilities but luckily back then workers had more rights and forgiveness until he came along to crush them i never worked for the guy personally so i cant tell but i heard he was a massive prick in real life like the kind of boss that would constantly turn red throw tantrums and expected no one to oppose him even when he played a lot of golf with the president like the ego this guy had could probably solve our energy crisis he even tried to change the ge logo with his own design but thats to be expected right sociopath who arent good at working but talking and backstabbing are the guys to rise to the top and hes just another prime example office politics 101  i didnt do very in depth research so theres probably a lot more stuff about him especially all those meaningless business buzzwords the point is the media and corporates love to jerk him off when he was the complete opposite he pretty much represents everything wrong with corporate culture the damage he has done not just to ge but the rest of us because of many companies following his values is beyond measure,lxmc6w

829,"""The Customer is Always Right"" is fascist brainwashing.",the nature of capitalism is primarily one of a dictatorship of capital a dictatorship of capitalists as the primary owners of capital  in wielding capital you effectively wield dictatorial power even as a working class person for the small moment you exchange currency for something of value the culture of capitalism offers you dictatorial power the customer is always right  why is that  its because it is foundational to capitalism capital has unlimited power under capitalism  without the practice of allowing even the lower classes dictatorial power relative to the exchange of their currency a vanishingly small share of capital there would not be the dictatorial power of bosses landlords and banks using their greater overall capital to wield even greater dictatorial power over employees over tenants over politicians and smaller capitalists  the customer must always be right because in essence even the employeeemployer relationship is a merchantcustomer relationship  your boss is your customer they wield dictatorial power with their capital and purchase your labor power time out of your life and own you for a period of time  even if you use the freedom to walk away from a bad job you are still beholden to the customer is always right you will need to find a new customer a new capitalist to survive every time risking that this dictatorial power will be antagonistic to your livelihood  if you offer bad service or appear rebllious this will spread like with any business and you will risk not finding new customers a new capitalist  you are not owned by any one person like under a feudal system you are owned by capital and by extension those who wield it  the customer is always right because under capitalism capital is your god and it can do whatever it wants to you,lwwabp

884,"Theoritically, rat race needs us to be obsessed with safety",in my life ive been chilling a lot especially during studies because at that time i was the poor student with access to a very small though state grant my country france offers some 460eurmonth to children of underprivileged families i still was under pressure regarding exams yes because if you fail your year you lose access to the grant but fortunately i didnt run into trouble  at that time i was stressed a lot on my homework and learning was tough but i still had hopes that after that my work life would be something more slowpaced with my evenings being rid of any homework  just to realise it is not entirely like this  first as usual i need to find time to fend for myself and with my days occupied by work some evenings are dedicated to buying a new piece of furniture having an interview with a banker or an accountant basically any project hat requires professional assistance makes me think are these people busy during the day lots of persons have negative feelings for nonworkers but at least these nonworkers can visit whatever store and counselling office they want between 9 and 5  and consume accordingly  second the way a whitecollar job demands homework is more vicious because no one really tells you what you need to perform and yet everyone expects you to grow at one point or another in your life so they could promote and responsabilize you sometimes some clues pass by your manager mentions to you about x industry magazine or y seminar that would improve your skills  third you get to realise the days where your transitioning to a job could be subsidized are all gone and if you want to transition to another industry you are on your own so if you grow uncomfortable in your job then you cant even relax at evening and weekends because youd be busy reassessing your initial choice  fourth if you need to keep your field but change companies basically what we call the slave choosing his master then you need to keep going with the complete charade of searching for a new job but this time during your own jobs clock because when your schedule is cleared employers are too everyone gets home at 6pm right and yet this needs to be done quietly because openly looking for another job can lead to trouble in the workplace  fifth maybe you are in a situation where you are underpaid and would like to start a sidegig maybe youre working abroad and need to learn a new language well that will be on your own too because such matters are considered personal life  in conclusion i observe a lot of the socalled personal life is spent to acquire necessary assets to please the corporate overlord be it a potential employer or a potential customer for small business owners  my life goals are on the side of hobbies i want to learn uselessunsellable things for myself because i enjoy them and want to find communities with whom i can share i also like having my hands in multiple different topics which makes for poor commitment on my part it is the way i am wired  i dont know where else this rambling goes this life just makes me very tired not everyone can sell themselves or their skills so why just not let them be i wonder im sure i have a lot of qualities that are underused by the society just because that one size is designed for all,lwuy32

907,The link between the decline of religion and less anti-workism,most people probably see the decline of religion as a good thing and i think thats obviously true for when its used as a tool for evil however at least some religions have ideas which go well with antiworkism such as asceticism meaning working much to buy useless stuff would be pointless of course you can follow such a lifestyle without being religious but it seems rarer and maybe harder this is just an observation on how it seems less religiosity is linked to antiworkism being a relatively small movement and how the oppression of some religious institutions basically seems to have been replaced with the oppression of secular institutions like corporations,lxf6fp
908,Stress from my job has given me nightly panic attacks that prevent me from sleeping.,im essentially a glorified data entry drone with a large retail company making barely a livable wage over the last year ive been growing more and more dissatisfied with my job theyve made some changes to the kind of work i do that essentially makes it harder to perform well about a year ago without increasing my pay  every time i protest this change they brush it off and tell me they know im capable of doing a good job however over time my metrics have noticeably dropped and a couple weeks ago i was informed that i was now on a 48 week probation and if i dont improve enough for them at the end of it i get fired despite the fact that i was a fantastic often placing top percentile within the department employee for the last 5 prior to the implementation of these changes as my probation period goes on its becoming more and more clear that im probably going to lose my job  starting a couple days ago ive been having some kind of episode every time i lie down for bed every time i start to drift off im suddenly seized with a sensation that i cant breathe and that my heart has stopped it instantly shocks me into being wide awake and the first night it happened i literally didnt get a minute of sleep all night  i saw my doctor about it the next day because it understandably freaked me the fuck out he told me my vitals were great pending some blood work results im probably physically fine he asked about my stressanxietydepression levels after hearing my response and situation he told me that basically ive internalized everything that is happening so much to the point where even when im not actively thinking about how fucked i am at work and how fucked my life is once im fired because im a college dropout with no marketable skills its essentially made itself a part of my entire conscience and im permanently stuck in a state of red alert even the simple process of falling asleep causes my brain to freak the fuck out and force my body into fight or flight mode its torture  my doctor gave me some medications to help fight this and they helped a little bit so far but not a lot over the last 3 days ive gotten maybe 8 hours of sleep total im so fucking tired i constantly feel like im going to have a heart attack in my sleep  im a little bit lucky to be in a position where im allowed to go on fmla my therapist recommended it and ive already put in my request for it im taking a significant amount of time from work and i know itll help me in the short term but it wont help with my overall situation and once my fmla is up ill be right back where i started  i feel like im in a pit if i lose this job my only option will be going back to retailservice assuming i can find a job in the covid landscape i wont be able to afford my apartment on minimum wage and my parents dont have roomcant afford to let me stay with them i dont even know if im capable of going back to retail i could barely handle it last time around and trauma has caused my mental health to significantly degrade since then i have a very high chance of ending up homeless and jobless i dont know how im going to take care of my aging cat  sorry for this wall of text thanks to anyone that read it theres no point to this or anything just a rant i just wanted to get all this off of my chest and i figure the denizens of this sub would get it,lxdyj6

918,Yesterday my manager sent an email offering everyone voluntary overtime,sometimes i feel bad that im so burned out that i somehow cant sit and focus or do as much as others even while some are doing less than theyre capable of i have adhd and my coworker with adhd can cut through way more work than me however its because she likes the routine and monotonous data entry aspects of our work to her its therapeutic so she completely zones in for me its like hitting a wall and i get off track constantly because im so fucking bored no amount of adderall is enough to trick my brain into thinking this is interesting and sometimes i feel bad that i cant do it i always feel like we are overworked and understaffed but some how no one else complains then yesterday after that email i realized that as much time as we have been offered overtime since i started two years ago that thats evidence enough that we are understaffed and too much is expected per employee its unrealistic my friend worked for a german company and they found this american ot working culture so strange they apparently have the belief that you should be able to do all work within 3040 hours and if you cant then that means youre giving your employees too much work or dont have enough employees i agree 100 no wonder im tired burned out and checked out,lw4mvx
919,I think this is sub is driving me crazy,hi everyone  first things first i agree with everything you stand for i am lazy i hate all kinds of work and believe no one should be forced to slavery for 45 years  when i first discovered this sub i was glad that i found like minded people i still am and realized that there is nothing wrong with me it was the others who normalized this slavery have issues   however more recently the sub started to make me go crazy for a few reasons   1 i am not sure i can put this into words but for a moment i read this sub and feel like i am right everything is shit but when i return to my life it is completely different there is no one else in my life who understands what is being discussed here if i say to them working is shit they will just say stuff like  so what will you do if you dont work everybody works or your career is a part of you it is what defines you  2 all we can do is complain the system slavery is not going anywhere and we are already selfaware we know how shitty everything is yet we are powerless to make an impact i dont believe in things like collective power idealism etc my country is corrupt as hell deep down to every fundamentals so we are just getting angrier each day and closer to burst but no escape from slavery  3 what irritates me most is that all my coworkers are workaholics especially after reading this sub with likeminded stuff my toleration to workaholics dips it is becoming really harder to survive in slavery i am angry all the time about how can they stay happy while wasting their 60 hours of week for nonthing how can they accept working overtime in weekends without questioning how can they are not irritated to have only 2 weeks off annually etc   i truly believe the system is shit and working is worse than hell it is probably the most thing that i am so sure in my life but we all live in hell and we need to cope with it until slavery somehow ends this sub makes it harder to tolerate work,lwc790
