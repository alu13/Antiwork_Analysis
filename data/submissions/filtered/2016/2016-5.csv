0,Degradation Through Work,sorry that everything is lowercase this is the way it is in my digital copy and i do not feel like fixing it  gt men generally work too much to be themselves work is a curse which man has turned into pleasure to work for works sake to enjoy a fruitless endeavor to imagine that you can fulfill yourself through assiduous labor  all that is disgusting and incomprehensible permanent and uninterrupted work dulls trivializes and depersonalizes work displaces mans center of interest from the subjective to the objective realm of things in consequence man no longer takes an interest in his own destiny but focuses on facts and things what should be an activity of permanent transfiguration becomes a means of exteriorization of abandoning ones inner self in the modern world work signifies a purely external activity man no longer makes himself through it he makes things that each of us must have a career must enter upon a certain form of life which probably does not suit us illustrates works tendency to dull the spirit man sees work as beneficial to his being but his fervor reveals his penchant for evil in work man forgets himself yet his forgetfulness is not simple and naive but rather akin to stupidity through work man has moved from subject to object in other words he has become a deficient animal who has betrayed his origins instead of living for himself  not selfishly but growing spiritually  man has become the wretched impotent slave of external reality where have they all gone ecstasy vision exaltation where is the supreme madness or the genuine pleasure of evil the negative pleasure one finds in work partakes of the poverty and banality of daily life its pettiness why not abandon this futile work and begin anew without repeating the same wasteful mistake is subjective consciousness of eternity not enough it is the feeling for eternity that the frenetic activity and trepidation of work has destroyed in us work is the negation of eternity the more goods we acquire in the temporal realm the more intense our external work the less accessible and farther removed is eternity hence the limited perspective of active and energetic people the banality of their thought and actions i am not contrasting work to either passive contemplation or vague dreaminess but to an unrealizable transfiguration nevertheless i prefer an intelligent and observant laziness to intolerable terrorizing activity to awaken the modern world one must praise laziness the lazy man has an infinitely keener perception of metaphysical reality than the active one  gt i am lured by faraway distances the immense void i project upon the world a feeling of emptiness grows in me it infiltrates my body like a light and impalpable fluid in its progress like a dilation into infinity i perceive the mysterious presence of the most contradictory feelings ever to inhabit a human soul i am simultaneously happy and unhappy exalted and depressed overcome by both pleasure and despair in the most contradictory harmonies i am so cheerful and yet so sad that my tears reflect at once both heaven and earth if only for the joy of my sadness i wish there were no death on this earth  cioran,4luc7e
