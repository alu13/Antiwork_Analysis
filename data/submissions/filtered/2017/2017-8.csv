0,I feel like a huge reason behind ADHD denialism is that people want to believe nonworkers are just lazy and bad people,people don't face the reality that due to a neurodivergence  a person can't work  they want to believe it is a choice  or that it isn't a barrier to work  they want to force everyone to work and adhd  especially treatment-resistant adhd  is a threat to the social order  people don't care about mental health if it disrupts their obsession with forcing everyone to work   capitalism and ableism are interlocked oppressions ,6r8uey
