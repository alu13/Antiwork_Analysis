5,"We reject work and build an anti-work society, then what?",please dont misunderstand my question im as antiwork as it gets but i am concerned about the possibilities of social reproduction of the basic necessities of people i know that with current technology we could reduce the workforce a lot but we still would need some organization in the transitional phase to full automation which could last centuries   how would people handle this would they really do it work for themselves provided we make conditions as fair as possible of course would we still need some coercion should we use incentives all of this is tricky because it reproduces the social logic of capital productive ideologies appraisal of the working man etc etc but its just that i think we have to use a gradual approach even today ,8fv8th
