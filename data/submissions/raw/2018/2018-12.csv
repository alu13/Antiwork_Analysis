10,Quitting a farm to start a farm,"I am a 24 yo male. After a bout of joblessness (where I was truly happy but understood it wasn't sustainable because of a lack of funds to achieve my goals of not needing to work for someone else - which is kind of ironic when you think about it) I found myself back at the factory farm where my parents work and where I worked part-time for 7 years while in high school and college. This time I'm working full-time in a semi-supervisory role with one individual who works under me. I make decent money: more than I ever have because I've never been able to find a job, much less get an interview for a job I actually have an interest in, with the BS in Psychology degree that I worked so hard for. I have been depressed for as long as I can remember and I have felt like a worthless, lazy person for how I feel about work(ing for somebody else) until I just discovered this subreddit.

I feel like I and all the other employees at this company are being raped. We are selling our time of course, but we are also selling our dignity as the manager, who is emotionally immature, screams at us when a task is done incorrectly. We are selling our pride in what we do when we never see a dime for our efforts (this company is notorious for it's lack of raises). We are selling our spirit when we efficiently and effectively complete the tasks of the farm, but have to stay an additional 3 or more hours ""just because"". And I know damn well that they are only able to ""pay well"" because they profit exponentially on the labor that we provide.

I am just finishing up my second semester of local community college accounting courses, which have done nothing to help me even get a phone interview for accounting-type positions.

I feel like I have a lot of pressure from my family and boyfriend that I live with to keep working until I find something better but there isn't anything better, at least not until I can establish an income from my own farm in the future. I want to produce as much of my own necessities as possible (energy, food, clothing, etc.) and sell the surplus to pay for the taxes on my land and that's it.

I don't know how to get there without committing suicide over the draining, exploitative, unappreciative, 45-hour work week (with 9 day on stretches). Through the many different jobs I've had these feelings still persist. At least this one is bearable for my social and generalized anxiety, and depression. I cry almost every day and I'm able to cry at work because I spend a lot of time alone in the loud barns.",False,a44srh,sporadicallydrifting,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/a44srh/quitting_a_farm_to_start_a_farm/,8,1

20,Wanna be a mod? Step right up!,"Hey, everyone! Hope your holiday season has been OK and not too stressful.

We had a bunch of troll posts today and I had forgot to check up on the subreddit which left them up for longer than they should have been. As such another mod had to tackle the issue. It's not a huge problem but having another mod (or two!) will help keep this subreddit cleaner on a more consistent basis.

If you're going to be a mod you *must*:

* Be respectful to sub members 
* Communicate with the other mods about decisions unless you think they are a no-brainer (preferably through chat, we can make a mod group chat)
* Use your mod powers responsibly (""with great power comes great yadda yadda"")
* Try to give people a few chances to mess up before banning them. This goes in line with my previous comment! For example, I usually tell people about our rules and remind them to follow them, they usually insult me/them, I warn them and then they insult me again, so I ban them.
* No prior mod experience required, but appreciated!

And that's it! Sound ok? 

Feel free to comment below or PM me or u/onedayitwillbedaisy about it!

I like the term practice makes perfect, because there’s room for improvement and it implies something one is intrinsically interested in doing. But I tend to be misunderstood when I have distaste for people commenting on my work ethic. 

So what’s your take on it? Or quick responses that won’t make you sound like you’re lazy (although being lazy sounds like the worst someone can be in capitalism) or anti-improvement.

23,Fucked.,"This will be long. Brace yourself.

I got a dwi which is a felony because in my state 2 in 10 years is felony (previous in 2012). It wasn't really that serious. Just huge snow storm to where I literally couldn't park my car at a friend's like I normally would do when drinking so I had to go home because I had to work and got stuck in the snow 5 minutes from my house. Barley failed the breathalyzer and honestly drinking had nothing to do with me getting stuck in the snow. It would happen to me every morning even without the blizzard conditions. Anyways I'm not here to defend that or get out of it. It's my fault and I take the reprocussions. Being scared of a possible felony I hired a lawyer for $6000. Turns out I didn't really even need to as going through this process I've seen several people in the same felony diversion program with just a public defender but none the less I got a lawyer. 

At the time I had a job I was at for over 2 years. It looked stable enough. It could have been stable enough. There wasn't much I could do to get fired. They relied on me for a ton of things and used the shit out of me without ever giving me much. I was previously a line worker like anybody else that they cycled through from temp agencies except for that for whatever reason I had gotten hired to the actual company unlike most of my co-workers. Eventually I tried out the fork lift position which I was weary about because in the past, at other jobs it always was a position where you're asked to do too much that literally one person couldnt do. I was told not to worry about it and took the position.

4 months later I'm full blown in this forklift position and the person who got me to do it was already gone, forced out of the company in a shady situation herself and I'm doing exactly what I feared.........everything and anything. And I'm doing it for $2 less than what the position is supposed to be paying according to the national average. The excuse from managers and higher ups was that they didn't hire me for this position with previous experience so I didn't deserve that pay but maybe if I'm a good little boy as I am right now maybe I'll get it down the road. Meanwhile I'm loading and unloading trucks, dealing with the drivers paperwork's, still working on the line helping out (even though every previous driver never did that as it's not their damn job), training new employees on everything and anything, handling office related stuff, troubleshooting common problems........you get my point. So I demanded the raise to at least match the national average. I got it. But I was down talked like a little kid and made to feel like it was a privledge and an honor. It wasn't. $14 is still shit pay for the amount of work I was doing. Sorry not sorry. Also I was going through managers left and right as the company was in a changing process so basically I was dealing with new supervisors who didn't know me, my history with the company or anything about what I'm capable of and constantly having to prove my self over and over.........until one day after dealing with drama from 4 different directions and feeling like I was about to get into a brawl with 15 people (whole nother story).......I went to break and never came back.

Rewind three paragraphs and you can see my delimma. The quitting of the job coincided with the DWI. I quit the job just a few months after hiring the lawyer. I only payed him $2000 of the $6000. Now..... he hasn't been that great, he barley contacts me, he has missed a few court dates and he never has a clue what's going on with my situation etc. etc. But still he holds my fate in his hands .....and I haven't payed him since the end of June .....so I guess I'm lucky he even shows up at all. I'm actually almost done with the pre trial program (weekly meetings and check ins). Before I quit the job I was having these strong anti work feelings about everything we talk about here in this sub. Life is just too short to be someone else's bitch and to be a miserable cunt every day of your life, especially when it's montonous sometimes even strenuous manual physical labor. The reason why I was even there so long is because I could listen to podcasts and music on my headphones and skate through the day and it was actually semi enjoyable because of that.......and I also had a female co worker who I got quite chummy with and became good work buddies with and enamored with.......until the company started threatening the headphones constantly for no apparent reason other than control (literally) and the girl got pregnant with twins and went on leave. She came back but it just wasn't the same. I was miserable and in the midst of the forklift position. Now my anti slave anti work feelings were becoming dominant (they're always there it's just no one wants to hear it and I have no other means of money).

So this was an absolutely terrible time to quit my job but now that I've been out of work for 6 months I am completely lost and hopeless. I haven't had a dime most of this time (luckily I live with people who allow me to live rent free and aren't kicking me out, that's a whole nother story and a blessing although it does make me feel like a joke......no they're not my parents lol). I have been looking for work this whole time but I'm sort of unavailable because my car got repossessed in the process and I'm not available at all times due to the meetings. I also have no bus line anywhere near me. I feel like a fucking bum. I honestly didn't expect it to be this hard to find a job again. I suffer from social anxiety disorder, depression etc. And I also have a previous charge on my record that's apparently showing up to employers and making me look terrible (charges were dropped while I was in jail which is why I didn't even know they still existed and its thrown me for a loop, apparently employer's can see it either way)...... I've never had this much of a problem after leaving shitty jobs. But here I am completely fucked and don't know what to do. No matter how much I know what I need to do it just isn't happening. Next court date is soon and this lawyer doesent know my thoughts about all of this.....just wonders why I don't have any money for him. It's like I'm dealing with the mafia lol. I've lost control of why I even started making this post and I apologise. I guess if I just didn't owe this lawyer all this money I would feel so free right now. I'd still be truing to find work anyway because I do have a kid but I can not lie because I do feel liberated. While I am completely fucked right now because of the legal situation I do not regret leaving that job that was causing me so much stress. Life is too short. It really is.",False,a5o6yf,AnAlienFrom1955,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/a5o6yf/fucked/,5,1
24,The Story of the Mexican Fisherman,"An American investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked.  Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna.  The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.

The Mexican replied, “only a little while. The American then asked why didn’t he stay out longer and catch more fish? The Mexican said he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs. The American then asked, “but what do you do with the rest of your time?”

The Mexican fisherman said, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siestas with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine, and play guitar with my amigos.  I have a full and busy life.” The American scoffed, “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually New York City, where you will run your expanding enterprise.”

The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, how long will this all take?”

To which the American replied, “15 – 20 years.”

“But what then?” Asked the Mexican.

The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part.  When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions!”

“Millions – then what?”

The American said, “Then you would retire.  Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siestas with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”",False,a4i3lu,g7x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/a4i3lu/the_story_of_the_mexican_fisherman/,3,1

Now don't overreact I'm not exactly suicidal I just wanted to run from the pain so bad. Hell for the first time I even drove to a therapy center for help. 

I live with my parents and while they said they will support me to I get a better job and can support myself I feel like I'm completely worthless. It's more of a fantasy anyways  cause I'm too afraid to kill my self, just like it's a fantasy I can find myself in a better situation by quitting this job.  

I've been feeling more and more hopeless because of me being unable to get a girlfriend, curate my loneliness, and stymie my existential dread. I go to work with a sense of dread like everybody else but I feel all alone over there and that nobody cares about me.


 I also feel like it's a major waste of time being there. If I quit I could probably find a new job but it's not like things would be better you know it could just be way worse. I hate when people say they find meaning and purpose in life even with the work toil.


 I thought about being homeless living in my car, would that be better than working 40 hours for a job that can't provide me a living wage?

Or do I get two or three jobs and lose all time? Cause I don't to see the part in my life we're im content with the real world and there's literally nothing that can be done because it's a necessary evil.

 So in theory I can survive no problem and mentally struggle with the loss of my job and worthlessness. Or keep my job, keep making some money, struggle mentally with my hoplessness.

55,The definition of 'work',"It's frustrating when I try to explain my anti-work philosophy to people and they can't see it as anything other than ""wishing that others suffer so I can keep watching TV and eating cheetos all day"". Doesn't help that 'working out' is the most popular English phrase for performing exercise. I don't have a job or make money other than selling my plasma right now, but that doesn't mean I don't do things. In fact, I think the things I do are every bit as productive as what millionaire investment bankers do to destroy the economy. If not more so (because I'm not destroying the economy by coding and writing).

Unfortunately, 'work' is a 4 letter word everyone immediately understands. 'Bullshit work' or 'junkfood jobs' is a little better, but still requires at least a paragraph of explanation. What word or phrase do you guys use to distinguish 'work' from 'productive, healthy, expenditures of effort'? I mean, in my opinion even the 'productive' and 'healthy' parts should be optional. People deserve the right to be unproductive and unhealthy so long as they don't put a disproportionate burden on everyone else although even in that case, it's not like we would just kill off all disabled people. True equality would mean everyone has the right to live like a disabled person.

I like to use 'conscious work' to describe what I do with my life and what I don't mean when I say I'm antiwork. Basically it's any work I consciously, voluntarily do, without any promise of reward. So writing would count, but so would exercise, but so would conducting experiments to prove my hypotheses. On the other hand, selling my books, selling my plasma, or conducting the same exact experiments I do but solely in exchange for money rather than due to a desire to sate my curiosity, would not count as conscious work.

74,How many people IRL do you know who are voluntarily unemployed or homeless?,"This past year, I've met many new people. Some I reconnected with a year or so after graduating college; others, I met through friends or volunteering.

13 of them are either voluntarily unemployed, or voluntarily homeless. Since unemployment and homelessness are stigmatized in society...especially if it's voluntarily so, I was quite surprised they were so open and honest about it.

I didn't probe too deep into the reasons why they chose this lifestyle, and only went with the information they shared with me. 3 of them are staunch anarchists, and they live unconventional lifestyles. Couch surfing, dumpster diving, bartering, etc. etc. They also have large support networks of non-family members, which I was quite surprised about. I feel if I ever adopted those lifestyles, I wouldn't get any support from people.

The others live hedonistic lifestyles, and their expenses are either funded by family members, or welfare. Still, these people have very vibrant, happy, and social lives. None of them are depressed or self-loathing as the folks over at the NEET subreddit are. 

These friends range in age from 23 - 48.

92,I want my boss to be ripped apart by dogs,"The other day, when he forced the team out of the building for his routine not-mandatory-but-totally-mandatory-if-you-want-to-stay-in-my-good-books lunchtime walks, some of the other team members lagged behind a little bit, say, 10 seconds behind. He stopped, waited for them to catch up, and told this story:


""I remember back in my old country, there was this man who would take his dog for a walk every day. The dog would walk beside him. Cutest dog ever. Then, when the dog got older and older, you'd see the man walk past, then you'd see the dog walk past a few minutes later. Each year the dog would be further and further back and the delay would get longer and longer. That's what you guys are like more and more!"". Nobody took well to being compared to dogs. 


There was a long, tense pause. Until he continued:


""And, even more pertinent to our situation, I remember the old man walking past one year and the dog was gone forever"". One of our team members started picking his pace up, somewhat in jest. Another team member asked him to clarify: ""&lt;team member&gt; is reading into your story too much, isn't he?"" to which my boss replied ""No, he is reading into it exactly correctly"".



He is such a megalomaniac that not only forcing his team to walk with him at lunch on their time off isn't enough, no, he has to dictate their pace under threat of being removed from their fucking job. In his mind a good worker keeps up on his lunch walk and does what he says even in their free time.


I fantasize daily about seeing how his excellent pace would hold up if we were replaced with very hungry, rabid dogs.

101,Sitting at “work” completely demotivated,"Tried quitting 6 weeks ago but boss begged me to stay with (now what I realise were false) promises. Was made redundant beginning of last month. My last day is 20.12.18 but the offer for me to stay is that I’m going to be on the books paid until 31.12.18 without any annual leave deducted between 20 - 31 December. Then I get essentially a further 6 weeks of salary while “on leave”.

Issue is, i recently found out a lot of information that has been withheld from me about why I was made redundant that’s too much to get into but let’s just say my IP I spent a lot of time researching, developing and implementing (and finalised between the period of resignation date and date of redundancy) was sold on by my boss to a cheaper option (subcontractor) than keeping me on board. 

So now I really just can’t be assed anymore to do anything. Why bother doing anything at all if there’s no employment here come the new year? 

No opportunities around me right now but I have a pretty good idea for a start up and now the equipment and know-how to get the ball rolling. But if I up and leave now I’ll miss out on around ~$2800 in wages plus superannuation plus more accrued annual leave. Hence why I’m here just sucking what I can get out of this dump until it’s over but I just feel sick sitting here.

Anyways not sure why I’m posting except I guess just having a winge that the boss still expects me to be working happily here while he basically stabbed me in the back (he doesn’t know I know this).

The semester for me is finished up tomorrow since all I have to do is take a quiz and be don’t with it. While I’d love to have Tuesdays and Thursdays to myself once these college credits are over, my boss insisted that I work those days again once I’m done with class. But next week I sorta lied and said that I have finals when IRL I’m done the week before. Thankfully I requested off that Wednesday so I have three full days to myself come this time next week. I should also mention that while I’m at work the only thing I legit think about is going home at 5:00. I’m counting down the days to when I get a nice mini break from this place and it legit cannot come soon enough. 

If this is what adulthood is like it’s no wonder why so many people decide to opt out and end their own lives. ",False,a3cyzn,hughsocash45,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/a3cyzn/i_have_three_days_in_a_row_requested_off_next/,9,1
103,You anti work anarchists/communists should just be honest with yourselves," 

The only reason you chose your political stance is not out of empathy for your fellow proletariat but rather because you chose to become artists/musicians and no one ended up liking your shit. So because of your personal failures you blame the rest of society. Why do you care so much about homeless anyway ? (or pretend to care ?) Its their own personal failure. Why would anyone be expected to build them a house with free labour ?

Just the other day i read a post on [r/socialism](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism) about how degrading finding a job is. Lol you losers just need to grow up. You dont hate the work place because of MUH ALENATION but rather because your lazy fucks who want to leech of society to support your musical passion. lol

Most of you only go towards communism because you are lazy and dont want to work like the little lazy commie that you are. Its not a generalisation its a fact. I have binge scrolled many socialist/communist/anarchist subreddits to confirm this. A revolution lead by NEETS would never work and it makes me laugh that you do think this. HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAH

This is not a generalisation but rather cold hard facts that you are weeping about because you know im right. You pot smoking blue haired degenerates are going nowhere in life just like your own shit ideology that was funded by some fat lazy fuck (karl marx). No wonder you follow him lol.

104,Guy Debord on Automation and Labor as Commodity,"&gt;Automation, which is both the most advanced sector of modern industry and the epitome of its practice, obliges the commodity system to resolve the following contradiction: The technological developments that objectively tend to eliminate work must at the same time preserve labor as a commodity, because labor is the only creator of commodities. The only way to prevent automation (or any other less extreme method of increasing labor productivity) from reducing society’s total necessary labor time is to create new jobs. To this end the reserve army of the unemployed is enlisted into the tertiary or “service” sector, reinforcing the troops responsible for distributing and glorifying the latest commodities; and in this it is serving a real need, in the sense that increasingly extensive campaigns are necessary to convince people to buy increasingly unnecessary commodities.

Turns out, it's not as flexible as I'd imagined. After specifically telling the boss that I wanted 25 hours a week, my second full week of work ends up being 40 hours- which really interferes with my ability to take the programming classes I've been doing. I told the boss of the place that I wanted a part-time schedule on my very first day (when I was there for half an hour for paperwork), and when I went to tell him about the schedule today he doesn't recall me having said that. I guess I'm not important enough for him to remember. And the value of an employee certainly isn't high enough so that he'll keep his word to me, or anyone else- or stop passing the buck around by telling me to speak to someone else.

114,"""I fucking hate when these bitches work slow""","...were the words my supervisor uttered to me in private on the second day of my job concerning my team.

Every day, we are constantly berated by our supervisor, and/or threatened with disciplinary action for even *minor* errors, such as missing *one* damaged part (e.g. a shelf leg) out of the *thousands* of shelf legs we process. Even when tasks are reassigned (which they rarely are) when an employee does something incorrectly, the newly assigned employee -- even ones with excellent track records of quality and productivity -- is intimidated. ""You better do this skid right, otherwise you're going to get me very angry,"" ""If I find out you do this incorrectly, that'll be *it*.""

And, none of the employees under my supervisor do anything about this. They just take it. They allow themselves to be treated this way -- perhaps understandably so. Perhaps they cannot risk losing their job or causing even more tension, so it is more in their self-interest to stay obedient.

It also doesn't help that my supervisor, and our shift supervisor (my supervisor's supervisor) are family friends.

I understand my supervisor has her own set of responsibilities by her superiors, and there is a lot of pressure and stress associated with organizing a team, and ensuring this team achieves daily goals effectively. I understand she may be responding to this because elements may feel out of her control, and this is her understanding of the best way to react to such a situation, or even that this is a natural reaction for her.

But, I don't think threatening, intimidating, belittling, scolding, and yelling -- constantly yelling -- at people is an effective way at doing things. I've worked in many hierarchical organizations, and when such problems arose, other conflict management approaches were applied.

I work very hard every day, and I am recognized as one of the more productive members of our team. But, I hate being treated this way, and I hate when my fellow teammates are treated this way. I understand, even from them, that they do not like being treated like this.

I wonder why they do nothing about this. I am currently submitting a complaint to HR regarding this.",False,a7rkgd,Shadows-of-Hiroshima,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/a7rkgd/i_fucking_hate_when_these_bitches_work_slow/,6,1

123,Feminisms relationship to work,"First of all, i just found this sub so if this is off topic or not related with this sub im sorry. 

I am female and was raised in europe by a feminist. Also the area i live in has very high feministic standards. From the very first second of my live i was raised to be ""strong and independent"". I was raised by my mother telling me how i could never be dependent of a man otherwise he will destroy me (i have to add here that she was a SAHM for 20 years!)

""Work"" is a virtue, the highest point of live according to how i was raised. A job according to people around me was the peak of live, the absolute freedom and empowerment for women, the ultimate goal i should have as a woman to be modern and valuable. 

The thing is - i dont see any of this. Work for me is not a virtue. To see work as positive and not as a weakness or something only the lower classes have to pursue is a rather new concept that developed after the industrial revolution. And even back then work was already criticised. Work is not the ultimate goal - whether work is seen as positive or negative is totally dependent on when you lived and on the current philosophy.

I have depression, i have an anxiety disorder and a dissociation disorder especially when i am put under stress. My entire live i dreamt of running away and living in a small forest hut.

I have a hard time with that thought. I was raised to believe that without work i am not worth anything. That i betray other women and what they fought for. That i am weak and just ""lazy"" - while lazy is seen as a bad trait.

But i dont feel empowered by being a slave to a job. I dont feel empowered to loose 8h+lunch break+getting to the job and back each day of my live. I dont feel ""free"" and ""independent"" - its the opposite. I am threatened with my live to stay in this job otherwise i wont get payed and i will starve. 

The biggest lie is that work gives us a ""purpose"" or a ""meaning"" in our live while the only thing we are is interchangeable pieces in a big system. Women arent empowered by work, they are just brought to the workforce so theres even more people giving their life to the economy.

I dont know how people in this sub feel about it. Can you relate?",False,a3g26q,randomcarrotaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/a3g26q/feminisms_relationship_to_work/,21,1

127,"Quit Another Job, and I Don't Regret It","So the new-ish job that I got in an attempt to get a flexible schedule for myself turned out to be run by exploitative capitalists who didn't take my needs into consideration. They gave me too many hours four weeks in a row, so that I had difficulty focusing on my education. They didn't give a regular schedule- they often had me come home in the evening one day and report in the morning the next day. That alone was enough to make me want to quit.  


Then, to make matters worse, they would regularly give me infrequent breaks. My last day there, this previous Friday, they actually broke a US labor law by letting me go more than five hours without a break. I hadn't had breakfast that morning (my own fault), so I was extremely hungry and just wanting to eat. Of course, you can't really eat in the drive-through. And it was a Friday, so everyone was using their fresh new paycheck to buy fast food.  


On that day, they ran out of:  
\-Chicken Nuggets  
\-Chicken Tenders  
\-Salads  
\-Caramel drink mix  
\-Chocolate Milk  
\-And the Frappe machine hadn't been working for the last two days.  


When yet another evening-to-morning shift came between Friday and Saturday, I sat down to figure out my budget and I realized that, since February 1st fell on a Friday, I'd have four paychecks this coming month to pay my bills. So I really didn't need the money, and I'd already been extended an offer anyway. I was already hired elsewhere at another place that promised me the hours I wanted.  


So I just didn't show up on time for my shift. I washed the single work shirt that they gave me and expected me to wear four to five times a week, eight hours a day, along with the stupid hat that made me look like a goof. I took a nap and walked in at about three o'clock in the afternoon.  


Of course, it was so busy there that I couldn't just say, ""hey, you're full of shit and I've had enough."" All the managers were occupied working, because that's how fast food is. They like to do all the work themselves and never actually show or teach people how to do it themselves.  


I ended up just walking to the small manager's office, leaving my uniform junk on the cold metal folding chair and walking out without another word.

139,Let's share absurd things people have said to us,"I'll go first

""That's life!""- in response to hearing about the suffering that comes from having people devote their lives to menial jobs they find no benefit in. This one really makes my blood boil, I am a humanist with a very strong, almost spiritual belief in progress, everything around us is in the name of said progress and the fact that we humans can change the world as we desire.

There is no mindset that I am more against. If someone complained about a minor temporary discomfort than that might be a different story.

""You need hunger.""- In a discussion about my determination to contribute in the field of science and technology and trying to use my time to that end. This one pretty much speaks for itself given the context of the conversation

&amp;#x200B;

""You need to respect what people have to do to get by""- I was having a conversation just like the one above. My dad's horribly overworked girlfriend equated fantasying about a world where people like her and her daughters would have more time to enjoy life, pursue happiness and learn new things with disrespecting working people.

&amp;#x200B;

And of course, I've been told I need so-called self-respect which is just laughable as self-respect is one of the very things I'm preserving by following my dreams even with all the odds against me.

140,You can't even enjoy weekday morning walks through neighborhoods,"I have a job where I can work 2 or 3 days and be done for week. So it gives me time to enjoy a very long weekend. I took a walk a week ago and got stopped by a detective in a middle class neighborhood. He said someone called police I suppose and that there's a lot of old people in neighborhood. Well I guess that's what I get being an able bodied male with facial hair enjoying myself when I should be working.

I partly understand the reasoning. However, this is a bigger hidden issue. It's all rooted in the idea that a young man shouldn't be enjoying himself so carefree when he could be working. You couple in racism and classism then then the problem gets even bigger.",False,a65d3h,whyworkwhenicanplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/a65d3h/you_cant_even_enjoy_weekday_morning_walks_through/,19,1
