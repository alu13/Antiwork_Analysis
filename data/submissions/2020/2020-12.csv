# I spy on a lot of pro-trump and conservative subreddits and forums, what I found is sickening.

It  seems at one point in time, and I'm not exactly sure when this became  less frequent, one was expected to help their fellow friends and  neighbors.

Here as you can see in 1951, a huge crowd of people rushed to assist a near drowning victim at Coney Island.

But at some point, this went away completely with Republicans and Trump supporters.

Currently (and this is a few weeks old), almost **20 MILLION PEOPLE ARE AT RISK OF EVICTION.**

While  anyone with a reasonable amount of common sense can pin this on the  pandemic, the only person being blamed by them, is YOU.

I  cannot wrap my head around the fact that these people are blaming each  other. Not having enough savings, working ""for lower wages"", ""renting or  buying a home that is too expensive"".

WTF..if  these people were alive during the great depression, they would of  probably blamed people for ""keeping their money in the bank"".

I can't...these people seem to only blame themselves. Can't possibly be due to the pandemic, the economy, the government, etc.

Nope,  if you are facing eviction ""your fault for not saving enough money to  get through it"", ""not being better prepared for this"", etc etc etc.

These  people have no soul, no heart, no empathy or compassion for anyone  else. A nuclear bomb could hit their city and ""it's your fault for not  having a bunker"".

6,My realisation,"I don't know if anyone will care about this post but let's go.  Remember 2016 when it felt like every famous person in the world died?  Well, one of them got to me.  David Bowie.  I'm not a huge fan but that man was famous my entire life.  My sister had a poster of him as I was growing up so I've always been aware of him.

Anyway, he died at 69.  All that fame, money, whatever.  Nothing helped.  His doctors were probably the best you could get and very possibly might have been fans of his.  

In the UK, where I am, I'm due to retire at 67.  68 for people coming up now (and that'll go up no doubt).

So you work your whole life and you might get a year or two of retirement?  If you get that far?  That felt like 100 percent bullshit to me.

I can't even complain, I've got an okay job.  I work in an office but I get my fair share of stress.  Pay is alright but I'd still get that feeling every monday morning.  Stood in front of the office and thinking 'oh man, fuck this place.'

I didn't hate it as such, but it just felt like a waste of life.  Sat at a desk doing shit that ultimately doesn't matter.  Anyway, I went up to one of the directors at work and said 'you're loaded, what do you do with your money?'

He explained that he invests in a self-invested private pension and stocks and shares ISA.  He told me how (it's not difficult).  Instead of buying expensive shit like cars and unnecessarily fancy holidays, now I'm saving up for my freedom.  

I'm going to get out in my 50s.  It's not ideal but by then I'll have my house paid off.

One thing I changed was not buying tat.  I'm a film and games guy but I had a lot of merch and nonsense.  I sold everything I wasn't actively using and I stopped buying things I don't need.  Things like Pop Vinyls and shit like that.  It's all nice and decorative but now I just buy things that I'll actively enjoy.  A bigger TV, a PS5, a guitar, decent tablet.   Shit like that.  But I'll often sell things to help balance it.  And any money left over goes into investments.  And one day I'll be free.  I might still work.  I might volunteer somewhere.

I wonder why i do this when i cant even pay my bills. My body is already destroyed, and all i can think is that i will probably have to do this until i die. 

I try to make changes, but i dont have the money to do so i.e. college.  Made a budget sheet, and after everything is paid for i dont have enough t o eat, buy clothing, or do anything for entertainment.

I cant afford mental health care even though ive become severely depressed. What kind of system is this? I cant fix my car, im waiting for the utility companies to shut off my water, gas, or electric. Everyone tells me to snap out of it and try to find something better.

Im doing the best i can, but with how deppresed i am now fue to work, i can barley get out of bed, let alone leave my house when its the weekend.

There really dosent seem to be any place to turn at this point. Ive been considering leaving and moving to a place where i can live freely and work in a community like a commune or something.

Ive given up on the idea of materialism because i realize that buying expensive stuff will just put me into a deeper financial pit and it wont give my soul sustenance.

I think its time to give up on the capitalistic dream. We dont live in a free economy anymore. There is no point to keep plughing away when all your hard work is underpaid and most of it just goes to the government to buy missles and provude aid for other countries.

in order for your hours to count toward your paycheck
if you don't you are basically working for free.
Now, I got to Hospital B, at 3:00 pm, which was when I was supposed to be there, realized I didn't have my phone on me
had to race home. got my phone at 3:30 called ryan (who was still supervisor at this point) told him to call the guard I was to relieve
and explain I forgot my phone.

At the time he said ""It's all good, shit happens""

I got there for 4, an hour late.

he calls me the next day
WHY WERE YOU SO LATE FOR THAT SHIFT!?

Because I FORGOT MY PHONE
I CALLED YOU AND EXPLAINED DICKHEAD
""well you should have worked without it!""
""Then how was I supposed to sign in and get paid?""
""Use the hospital phone!""
""I don't know the number, it's in my contacts... which is on my phone...""
Basically, rob was upset I was an hour late, and wanted me to have worked for free.

""This wouldn't be a problem if someone didn't put a half hour commute on my shift either way.""
""What do you mean?""
""I've forgotten my phone when I was working at hospital A, which is a 5 minute drive from my house.""
""you wanna know how late I was? 15 minutes tops.""
""well you don't decide where you work, I got guys in who live in [town A] working in [town b], and guys living in [town b] working in [town a]!""

I wanted to say ""sounds like an idiot is doing the schedule.""
but, let's fast forward a bit.

I get an email. apparently Ryan stepped down!

I hear through the grapevine he got alot of complaints.
there's 2 new guys who took over for him
Adam, and Greg
Adam wanted me to work on Christmas day
8am until 6pm
I show up at the senior home for 8 am
no one is there to let me in
I wait out in the cold for 20 minutes
finally someone lets me in
just in time for Adam to call and say
""actually it's 9 until 7.""
I agreed to stay until 6, because on Christmas day we have a super at my sisters and you know when that usually ends?
around 7 or 7:30
I agreed to stay until 6 because I could leave the senior's home , and make it in time to have supper at my sisters. (she only lives a 5 minute drive away)
now he is saying ""SIKE! miss out on the entirety of christmas!""
I call him and have it out with him.
he agrees to have someone relieve me at 4.
So I was there for 8 hours, only getting paid for 7.
and I spent those 7 hours... on Christmas day shoving around a senile old man In a wheelchair, because the instant his wheelchair stops moving he starts having a temper tantrum.

I am not a fit man, I'm about 400 pounds.
and this dude is about 250
who the fuck knows how heavy the chair is
I was exhausted
by the time 4 o'clock rolled around, I was about dead.
Today, I get a text.
""January 1st and 2nd, senior's complex, with same resident. 9 am to 7 pm""
7 hours nearly killed me.
now I got 20.
But it get's even more fucked up
cause I called Adam
and tried to explain that shoving him around for 7 hours nearly killed me.
You wanna know what I gleamed form that conversation?
you wanna know what I learned?
""Ryan told me you should have this job.""
ADAM IS GETTING HIS ORDERS FROM RYAN!
RYAN IS STILL THE SUPERVISOR

there is one aspect of this though, I really need to get off my chest
something that pisses me off like you wouldn't believe.
anytime I try to talk to my mum about it. she's all ""well be glad you have a job!""
I'm just so tired of people acting like a job is the goal.
like, people act as if we exist to support a job, and not the other way around.
a Job is supposed to be a necessary evil. something that is a pain in the ass, but you do to support the things you enjoy doing. a job isn't supposed to be your singular purpose
How fucked is it that getting pusnished from work is having your hours reduced
and a reward is to get to work more
This all could be so much more bareable if people just fucking understood that, but no it's like everyone in my life is all ""Hey, Life is work! Ya gotta work until your dead!"" WHILE THEY THEMSELVES DO NOT HAVE A JOB
This job literally cannot sustain me.
yet I'm supposed to lay down my life for my corporate masters
I'm just so fucking tired of capitalism's bullshit.",False,kmwzgk,link11020,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kmwzgk/i_just_need_to_get_some_things_off_my_chest/,0,1
47,Working less hours but couldn't be happier,"Just came across this thread. It's relieving to hear people talk about their work gripes and frustrations; I feel less alone about sharing those same feelings. Recently I changed my full availability to only working 4 days a week. 

Truly I don't love the job but I tolerate it bc my bosses and coworkers are overall helpful and nice people. Being a shy introvert in the restaurant industry is not self serving to someone like me. I could care less about interacting with people. 

Thankfully I saved money even before the pandemic happened. Losing hours doesn't affect me. Also the industry has been hit hard by Covid, most days are incredibly show. I just wanna be happy and find another job that truly fulfills me. In the past few months I've submitted applications for the job field of my interest but there has been no success (I bombed one interview so horribly I could cry.) I'm socially anxious and have a hard time talking through interviews.

52,Recruiters suck and HR is a thankless job!,"Okay straight to the point i am working as part of HR. My job is to onboard and set news guys with everything they need for their first working day.

On my daily interactions i am surrounded by recruiters, benifits specialists and honourary paperrats.... this has beeing going for 3 years nows now I simply had it by the clown world that HR is and wish to change fields.

What i mean by clown world you may ask?
Being hated by candidates for being more persistent than a fly on shits and creating retarded job ads.
Being a waitress for the hiring manager, with your only task being taking notes of shity requirements and what the positions needs to do  and sprinkle some corporative BS on top of the already steaming shit.And saying yes sir we will have it tomorrow.
Being viewed as expense by the company and nothing more than a potential cost saving.
While repeating the same 30 min talk 8 times a day while smiling.... quite the clowns recruiters are.
Oh and naturally if you decide to be actually the mediator and strike a good/honest balance your told that simply that wont do as the company wants the best at zero costs.

Then you have the next clown... the benifit specialist if you even have a such. Tasked with the noble task of finding the  best discounts the best medicial coverage the best sport plan. Forging the path for free fruits in the office... a tireless job for the  benifit of all. Well except that all  major employers actually talk with eachother and the ceo's/directors already decied that every company in this fiels will ofer the same. So the benifit specialist does nothing actually. All smoke and mirrors.

Lets not forget the paperrats... tired long ago of reading docs. They simply opt to keep the same as usuals. No revision and reduction of paperwork. The clown of christmass pass.

In November I got another seasonal position with burlington that ends in January. 

Recently I got an interview with Staples, this was fairly exciting as I actually liked working at Staples. 

Sears and Burlington were/are depressing places to work and the general atmosphere and work environment of my local Staples is nice. Since the start of the pandemic, I applied to Staples multiple times and was rejected every time without an interview so finally scoring an interview was nice.

The hiring manager also remembered me, although I didn't remember her. Regardless, the interview was quick and easy.

69,My Realization of Hard Work =/= Success,"This memory smacked me in the face over the holiday break.

My mom and dad reinforced “If you work hard, you will be rewarded” in every aspect of my young life. My dad is an engineer that shot up the ranks, and now he is in the top leadership of his company. But those days are long past.

I went to college to be a teacher, then went to culinary school. I graduated and worked 60-72 hour weeks for 14 years. The only time I ever missed work was the death of my beloved grandmother, and that was only two days. I put work first and broke relationships because “I just have to work hard now and things will naturally come to me.” Throughout this entire time, I never made more than $36k per year, BEFORE taxes, despite working for some of the most successful, award-winning chefs in the country.

My best friend and I were able to hangout one night, which was extremely rare for me. He told me he was receiving a promotion and raise at his bank job. He also told me how hard he worked to get there. Something inside me broke or snapped at that sentence. I started crying and my voice raised and said “Why?! You don’t work as hard as I do. You haven’t sacrificed like I have!! My fiancé left me because I put work above her!! You don’t deserve this, I do!!”.

The conversation went on and I didn’t get any better. The next day I woke up and was so ashamed of my response to great news from someone I love more than I can say. I made the decision to get an easy job and do the minimum to keep it.

A few months later, I started work as a Restaurant Consultant. I “work” 25 hours a week, have great benefits, a month of PTO, nearly 3 times the average salary I made before, and I don’t work hard.

But it's 6am start time and 30 minute drive are so hard for me to manage with. I've been late so many times, or took days off often using sick leave. The reason for this is because of my unexplained malaise and fatigue. Fatigue that has slowly been getting worse and worse and I still haven't found what's causing it yet. My life is slowly falling apart and I've gotten my first write up for not communicating with my boss that I was going to be late.
I've been late 3 times since that write up due to not being able to get out of bed in the morning the fatigue is that bad and everyone says I'm lazy. I'm 28 male and shouldn't feel like this. But each time i was late I communicated it so I think things are... Ehh, OK for now.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I knew what the employment market was like pre-COVID, but I have a feeling that the virus just amplified some already existing issues with the economy.  Wealth inequality, for example, has been running rampant rendering some people homeless or in poverty and giving billions to a few. Jobs are getting out-sourced because it's so much cheaper for the employer and the people who would have retired 10-20 years ago, are working until they're dead. I truly do not see how much longer this current system can last if these issues are left unaddressed. That's not to mention the fact that I only mentioned a few that were at the forefront of my mind...

79,"I had an interview today for a job I didn't want, and it didn't even go well.","Well, the \*end\* of the interview didn't go well, I should say.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: The job search and interview process is still a crock of shit. You've seen this same post ten thousand times before, I just have to get this out.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this year, just like many others, I was laid off due to COVID. When I returned to work, there was a discrepancy with my pay, and when I asked for assistance with it from my superiors, I was very swiftly denied. After losing ten years to that place with hardly any progress to show for it, and after tolerating all sorts of other shitty things, that was the final push for me, so I left. Since then, I've been on the hunt for something less soul sucky.

&amp;#x200B;

Given the state of things though, not many places (at least in my neck of the woods) are hiring. Even then, I don't have a degree, and my experience is somewhat limited since I had been working at the same place for ten years, and in the same field (automotive) for most of my working life. So I find myself applying for all kinds of entry-level jobs, just so I can try to have something in the meantime. Still though, trying to find something that won't make me feel like garbage at the end of every day.

&amp;#x200B;

The interview today was for a teller position with a credit union, which I will obviously refrain from naming. It was a panel interview via Zoom, and there were three people interviewing me; the area vice president and two hiring managers, nobody of which was from the branch I was applying to, which I found strange. It was pretty typical. I was asked the same question seven different ways, I had to provide examples of conflict resolution and where I ""took initiative"" in my previous jobs, I had to give three different words for myself, and name three different qualities that I'd like in a supervisor. Typical, easy questions to field, I didn't act out of line.

&amp;#x200B;

As the interview came to a close, when I was given the opportunity to ask some questions. I had a couple lined up. Like I said, I was looking for something that wouldn't make me miserable, so I wanted to avoid certain things. A lot of my answers to their questions reflected that I wanted to be working someplace that would prove more supportive and understanding than my previous job. I don't think that's a terrible thing to ask for.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions weren't out of line, they weren't rude, and they were very enlightening in spite of the interview. I'll give a bit of a reconstruction.

&amp;#x200B;

\-What does upward mobility look like with \[company\] and is there any sort of timeline for when someone at entry-level could start expecting to be considered for promotion?

I was told that typically people get the hang of things after a year, but sometimes people are moved around earlier, so it was a pretty generic answer.

\-Where have past employees or candidates fallen short?

The \*\*\*AREA VP\*\*\* said ""I don't know how to answer that."" This is where I started to know for sure that this wasn't going well. I thought it was a pretty straightforward question, and this prompted me to look down at my notepad (I had been taking notes the whole interview) and went, ""Uhhhhhhhh,"" and reiterated, ""Have any of the three of you ever hired or interviewed someone and realized they were missing a specific quality you were looking for, because I want to be sure that I could meet that need."" The VP chimed in again and said ""I don't know how to answer that."" So I said ""Okay, I can move on to the next question.

\-What sort of support structure exists within \[company\]? What comes after direct management, and how easy is it to find the support that you might need?

This question was, again, because I was looking for work in a place that would hear concerns and work with employees. I was told that each branch has a manager and assistant manager, and beyond that there are specific departments that cater to specific job roles. So this led to my final question, which I offered with a disclaimer.

\-I understand that a lot of people don't like answering this question, and if that is the case here, please feel free to refrain. Based on this interview, is there any reason that any of the three of you wouldn't hire me?

The VP spoke up, and I had started writing down her response but was jolted to a stop once she started talking. ""Based on what you've been saying, you seem too concerned with hopping over management to get what you need, and that makes it seem like you wouldn't have any trust in them."" I was stunned, and in an attempt to clarify, I said ""I'm sorry that I've given you that impression. Like I've stated, I'm coming from a job where there was literally no support system, so I'm just trying to get a feel for what \[company\] has to offer."" She didn't respond, she didn't offer anything else, she didn't say ""Oh, I understand now,"" she just smiled and nodded at me.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm not mad that I'm likely not going to get the job. I didn't \*want\* the job. If they call me to offer it to me, I'm going to reject it based on the interview. What has me so goddamn angry is that I've just been reminded of all of the bullshit that still exists in the workforce, and how even in the midst of a pandemic, nothing has changed.

The job does not involve making videos at all but that assignment will clearly disadvantage people who do not have those skills.  It's also a sneaky way of sussing out age, race, etc without the hassle of bringing them in for an interview.


As for writing, it's not a main part of the job, and you'd think with my 3 degrees, years of jobs that involved quite a bit of writing for high-profile organizations, and having taken actual writing courses, that they could go ahead and assume that my writing skills are decent.  And if not I could get someone to write my 350 words for them anyway so that assignment won't mean shit.

91,Quitting my job after nearly a decade...,"I've finally done it. I've given my resignation notice, and after 2 weeks I'll never have to come back to this place. I've known for a few years this was a dead end job led by subpar management, but I was never quite brave enough to cut the umbilical cord. Still, I put forth my best effort and worked hard at my job and succeeded (with whatever inane measures they used to measure success). As years passed, I became more and more a shell of my former self. I started living for the weekends and dreading the Monday blues. I became entrenched with other unhappy employees and we were stuck in this loop of unhappiness with no end in sight. I questioned what normalcy at a job even was, and if this was it, we were SOL. 

It wasn't all a waste land of horribleness. In the beginning it was new and shiny, and possibilities seemed abundant. After a short while, I began to  resent the false promises and the ""we're like family"" culture aka overworked and underpaid / underappreciated. I consulted with many people before making the decision to leave, but I've known the answer deep inside for a long time. And for a long time I ignored it. Some called my decision an error in judgment; that it was simply idiocy to leave during a pandemic. Others saw the value of honoring myself and beginning a new chapter. The past year, my health started going downhill as I started experiencing chronic anxiety at work. I started to feel a sense of doom while in meetings talking about x amount of hours saved, or stupid excel sheets, or working together as a team to solve never ending problems. Twice I checked in with doctors to make sure the symptoms weren't part of something else going on.

As I handed in my resignation my manager seemed very blasé about the conversation. They didn't inquire about pay, my unhappiness, or really show any curiosity about why a long term employee decided to quit during a pandemic. Not even a half - assed speech thanking me for my time there. I've poured so many hours into this place that I begrudgingly felt, over time, part of my identity was tied to this team and company. And to top it off, I hear they'll hire multiple people to fill my position. I think that just solidified for me that I made the right decision, and how I should have left sooner.

When the time came, I thought I'd feel elated and finally free. In retrospect, I feel older. It's true. I feel like I'm playing catch up as my skills were left to stagnate. But I don't regret my decision one bit. Those around me could see how much of a toll this job took on me. For me, it is the right decision to leave. A different type of anxiety has set in, one I didnt anticipate, as the course of my sails have changed and the lay of the land looks very different. It is simultaneously new and scary and promising. That said, starting over has never felt so right. Thanks for reading.

101,Welfare cut yet again!,"Just needed to rant because the Australian government has decided that the unemployed/underemployed apparently don’t need to eat anymore! 


During the height of the pandemic many welfare payments were doubled (job seekers, students, parent payments etc.) to combat our spike in unemployment. This was lifesaving for me as my sister moved out so it was just my partner and I living in our house. 


I went from $650 a fortnight to $1,200 a fortnight. For six months I was finally (just) living above the poverty line. In July the government decided to cut those payments by $300. Tomorrow (New Years day), they’ll be cut again by another $100. In April next year they’ll be back to normal. 


So I’ll go back to $650 a fortnight. My rent alone is $435 a fortnight. 


I found out a couple of months ago that I have ADHD. I’ve been desperately looking for an affordable psychiatrist to diagnose me so I can hopefully get on medication and look for a job. Unfortunately psychiatrists aren’t covered by Medicare in Australia, so I had to find one that would either be bulk billed or offer a substantial rebate. I’ve been studying at university for the past two years; the reason I haven’t been working is because I can’t work and study at the same time due to my ADHD.

113,Hopefully this helps you if you need to see this (movie and book recommendation),"This last week I watched “Soul” on Disney+ and read “Dark Horse” by Todd Rose and Ogi Ogas and the combination had a huge impact on how I plan on spending this next year. 

Not to spoil the movie but it’s unlike the typical afterlife mentor/angel/guide movie. The main characters never find out what “their purpose” is. In fact, the big message of the movie is that what you end up “doing with your life” really isn’t that important, but rather the relationships you make and the experiences you have along the way are what matter most. One of the film’s writer/producers gave an interview and his father passed away in the middle of making this movie and he said it ended up changing his entire perspective and what he wanted to say with this movie since sitting and speaking with his father he realized the things he looked back on weren’t work or career related at all. And he even said he wants the culture at Pixar to change since so much of animation and what they did at the company involves long hours, little sleep, and little downtime to spend with your family while working at one of the biggest names in “family” entertainment. 

The book is a bit different - it focuses not on finding a “good” career but instead on finding the best career fit for each individual. Lurking on this sub it kinda felt like maybe some of the feelings people have with their jobs or careers wasn’t that they hated everything about everything but that they were doing something that was soul-crushing AND had to put up with a lot of bullshit all at the same time. 

The book goes into how the problem with corporate culture is that so much of it has been standardized thanks to the industrial revolution, the push for increased efficiency during the early 20th century (think Henry Ford’s assembly line), and the increase of productivity that the digital age ushered in. Now everything is standardized, including education, and this standardization is coupled to a cultural promise that if you eventually master whatever area of interest you choose to go into you will eventually become magically fulfilled - and you do this by being like everyone else, only better. 

This, of course, isn’t true and many quickly learn that standardization leaves literally no room for fulfillment and the cultural promise is more or less a lie. So, as an alternative to the standard career path of education then corporate ladder climbing the authors advise instead to look at what job or career would make you fulfilled. To do this they say to find out what are your “micro-motives” - what drives you, the things you enjoy doing - and to be as specific as possible. 

An example of not knowing your “micro-motives” they give is if you just say you like working with animals. This would be too broad, they say, as many would traditionally suggest becoming a veterinarian, but anyone that actually is a vet knows that you primarily are still working with people (the pet owners) and not animals. An real-life example of knowing your “micro-motives” they give is a micro-biologist who loves classifying types of mycelium (fungus) who now works full time helping other researchers/biologists classify and find mycelium for whatever they need. The micro-biologist not only liked classifying and organizing things but also became fascinated with fungi - he realized that by putting his two big interests together he could do something that he really enjoyed every single day. This echoes the advice that Mark Cuban once gave which was, and I’m paraphrasing, “find something you already do for free and find a way to get paid for it.”

I tried the exercise they recommend in the book and took a few days to record the emotional responses and judgements I had in my head about everything going on around me and realized that I didn’t really like “helping people” as I had told myself for years, but that instead I actually liked “solving problems,” which is why I likely never enjoyed any of my customer service jobs - that and being yelled at by a grown man because I couldn’t magically fix the camera on his laptop while on the other side of the country the night before he had a big zoom meeting. 

Maybe you’ll enjoy the book and movie or maybe you won’t. Maybe you really do just want to live off the grid and become a mountain-person. This is just what I took away from both. But after trying the traditional “safe” route of getting an expensive education and trying to shoehorn myself into traditional corporate culture I decided to try something different and finally bet on myself this next year and see where it takes me.",False,kmexlf,czerskiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kmexlf/hopefully_this_helps_you_if_you_need_to_see_this/,4,1

I can't just accept how truly shitty this country is. The ""United"" States.

So many people either just love it or accept it. 

If you challenge it, ""that's just the way it is bub"".

No, it's not the way it should be, that's the point. 

So much food thrown out, and this year due to the pandemic, literally millions of pounds of unsold food and produce was buried. 

The capitalists can't stand seeing people get something for free. So they just toss it. Same goes for clothes, a lot of retailers just throw them out and then go the extra mile by cutting them up so no one can wear them. 

So much paper and shit it wasted. Go to Burger King or McDonald's and you get an almost foot long piece of paper for no fucking reason. How do you return a big mac? Bring it back after you shat it out and demand your money back? I get that some people need receipts for business purposes, but it should be optional, not foisted upon you with the presumed guilt of now having wasted a small scrap of paper. It seems tiny but keep in mind 10 MILLION TREES are used to make receipts each year in the US. Most receipts cannot be recycled, either. 

Don't even get me started on packaging, either. I bought a pair of replacement brush heads for my electric toothbrush the other week and while the heads are 3"" long, the plastic packaging was nearly 10"" long. Oh, but someone might otherwise steal it, you say. Alright, let's waste a bunch of material because maybe 1 in 100 will get stolen. Real genius line of thinking right there. In fact there is an entire fucking subreddit dedicated to plastic and other excessive packaging waste. Amazon in their ""efficiency"" loves putting something the size of a deck of cards in a box that a toaster over would come in. Think of all the fuel being spent transporting all that extra air.

Callendared holidays. Christmas, New Year's public holidays - wouldn't it be better to ditch this concept? 

So, I know a fair bit about cognitive biases (I could probably publish a sixth paper on why Dungeons and Dragons using a single die for most rolls is badly thought out psychology) and I'm a little annoyed at myself this thought never matured until today, but. Concentrating enough people's days off to be visible, creates a notable shift in how much time away from work they think they need. Because 'everybody is home for christmas' the days off for the period are over represented in most people's consciousness, even people that actually work those holidays. It creates the false impression you have enjoyed more time off, or that your time off was of higher quality that is the truth. 

Once that sentiment is spread to near ubiquity, it erodes some of the negotiating power of all workers. Both by adding complacency and making them willing to settle for less, and making employers bolder and willing to demand more.

I do wonder if the culture of scheduled holidays could be wiped away, how many days per year of leave on our own schedules might become the norm for each day of 'everyone' being visibly free at once we excise.",False,kn5jvj,UnknownSolder,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kn5jvj/scheduled_holiday_events/,12,1

The whole “tax the billionaires” things sound good on paper but once you start doing that and they leave the country and take jobs, wealth, taxes with them then the working class person is even worse off and standard of living drops.

Or we can “tax the middle class” but is that really fair. Someone has taken on debt, spent 8 years at uni to become a doctor and then only to be taxed more to pay for a fat single mother what wants to eat Doritos and watch daytime tv all day.

I have been on disability for over a year, and I have been told that it is likely I will never be able to successfully cope with today's working expectations and that I will probably never be able to hold down a full-time job. This information was devastating. I grew up impoverished and hated it, so I am very bitter that that is my life for the next 40-odd years.

My question I guess is how *do* you get the most out of this life? I feel like garbage for not being able to contribute and being ""dole trash/a benefits scrounger"". I hate people asking what I do for a living because I'm ashamed and I lie to avoid admitting I'm useless and dependent on charity to survive. I live in poverty, so it's not like I can afford to do anything worthwhile. And I have no one in my irl life beside my parents, because none of my friends live nearby and the way adults meet people is apparently through work. 

I live a shit, isolated, depressing life and I hate it. What's the point of being born just to be fucked in the head, considered dirt by society, and suffer in poverty? How do you get the most out of a life you don't want?",False,knnle5,PMDDBitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/knnle5/getting_the_most_out_of_a_workfree_life/,8,1

176,Serious question: What do you guys propose as the alternative to work?,"I am constantly seeing posts from this sub criticizing work, yet I never see any solutions or recommendations.

I agree that the culture these days encourages over-working, and employers certainly aren't putting an emphasis on home life over work life. People are working themselves to death and not enjoying their life to the fullest.

But we definitely aren't at a point in our society where things are automated enough such that any significant percentage of the population can simply stop working. If people stopped working right now, society would grind to a halt and the amenities that you and I enjoy wouldn't be available.

How would we grow &amp; harvest our crops? Who would design new modes of transportation or architect new buildings? How would the government function? Who would teach our children? Who would develop the COVID-19 vaccine?

I'll admit I'm biased. I really enjoy working. It gives me purpose, it challenges me, I enjoy the feeling of accomplishing something meaningful. 

So back to my original question: if we all did away with work--as it seems you all want--then what?

180,Rant because I’m sick of working on holidays,"Sorry for the rant, just feeling really tired, stressed and hopeless.

I’m tired of having to build my life around my work schedule. I have to be up at 3am tomorrow to be at my job at 4:30am (commute is like an hour, gotta love devoting even that time to work without pay). So if I want 6 hours of sleep I have to be in bed at 9pm every night. And then I sit there unable to fall asleep because of the anxiety of having to wake up the next morning and because it’s so early to be sleeping and suddenly it’s 2am, I haven’t slept and now I have to be up in an hour. And this just repeats every day.

It’s New Year’s Eve and everyone around me who works the regular 9-5 has the weekend and holidays off. But because I work one of those jobs that’s open 7 days a week, I have to be at work tomorrow which means I’m losing out on both the enjoyment of tonight and of tomorrow. 

I feel like I’m wasting my life away. I have a bachelors degree yet I’m working this job for $10/hr. And we aren’t even allowed to sit down at work, we have to stand the entire shift. I just can’t believe this is what my life has been reduced to. Just a cog in a wheel. Giving up my prime years of health just to be a wage slave and work on a holiday so the company owner can have more positives on his balance sheet. 

Holidays used to be fun for me when I was a kid. It was a time off, with family, to relax and eat good food and watch movies and play board games. Well I’ve worked Christmas Eve and Day every year for the past 6 years and now I just dread the holidays. It’s not even like on a holiday work is slower, they turn out to be some of the busiest days of the year and people are cranky and rude and don’t appreciate that you’re giving up your time with your family to be here so they can have their fuckin Starbucks or hamburger or whatever the case may be.

192,This quote shows us what a purely work-focused life will do to us: I am strongly reminded of the “Cybermen” from Doctor Who...,"What we \[“should“\]desire creeps silently inside us and replaces what we really desire. ... We take jobs, make compromises, and settle down for the long wait, for the arrival of the future that will bring the reward of happiness we so justly deserve for our sacrifice of the pleasures of the moment. The process is so slow we scarcely notice the substitution of plastic for flesh. We forget how the body sang when it ran free; how it rejoiced in stretching, rolling, skipping, dancing, walking, eating, loving, bounding, leaping, resting.

  
Gradually the body begins to change to protect itself against the intrusion of joy or sorrow. It armors itself against the threat of playfulness and spontaneity. ... The working body is complete when it is thus armed against those emotions that would threaten the primacy of the work ethic and the pattern of delayed gratification upon which it rests.

198,My job killed my career passion and I have survivor guilt,"First of all, I know complaining about a job in 2020 might be ""first world problems"" or not being thankful enough. I do feel thankful that I haven't gone thru many of the issues and problems that some people that I know have. However I do need to get things out of my chest as a way to know that if I'm alone on this or if there are other people like me are struggling with this issue about how much work has killed your passion or your career and you have this ""survivor guilt"" when you want to quit

I work for a logistic company as marketing analyst. my job was simple but I'm the only one with a carer in marketing in my whole area, everyone else was a group of graphic designers including my boss (the area stared with my boss and slowly grew into something bigger so she grew up n the position) but since my boss doesn't know anything about marketing administration. it is simply frustrating to see thousands of dollars in investment simply go down in waste because there is no strategy or sometimes logic behind it .  Salary was always mediocre at best (today is simply bad b/c of pay cut) but it was enough and some for savings. 

Anyways, being in this position and seeing how my boss is rewarded for ""pretty things"" even though money was wasted and 0 sales killed my passion for this job and career. is this how it is and always will be? I wanted to quit several times but pandemic happened. I even had a  date on May 15 because I was traveling for 3 months to Germany with my girlfriend but of course it didn't happened. I put a new date again on November 5 thinking that the whole thing would blow over by then and of course it didn't. right now my new travel date is February 1  People were laid off and I had to pick up their work so now I'm doing the work of 2 other people for the price of 1 and with pay cuts. Also working from home has seriously destroyed my schedule. I've been finding myself working a lot until 2 to 3 am almost everyday including Saturday and Sunday.  because of my travel date on February 1, I'm thinking on putting my 2 week notice next week even If my travel plans are postponed again or indefinitely I really don't like the job or this company or how I am treated.

He worked for 4 hours that day. When his test ended up coming back positive that day, he called the district manager. The district manager had him sent home. There was a rumor floating around at the time that he might have had it, but there was never any action taken by management to inform everyone that he in fact had Covid. There was never any action taken to clean the store or anything, business carried on as usual and the store stayed open.

I work a demanding job with a frustrating lack of work/life balance. I normally work 55-60 hour weeks, and work every other Saturday. I am EXHAUSTED. The work is very fast-paced, so it’s not like i’m working for 9 hours but really only “working” for 3. it is literally 9-10 hours per day of nonstop work. we are also short staffed, so the workload, which is normally a lot, has also increased. I hate that I am responsible for so much.

i am just burned out and exhausted. i also have mental health issues, specifically depression, anxiety and CPTSD, and i don’t want to play the victim or use my mental health as a excuse to get out of work, but i literally am so wound up all the time from work that it’s negatively impacting my mental health. i get really bad migraines, most of which are caused by stress. 

on top of all this, i feel guilty. my work has temporarily moved to WFH due to COVID, and i recognize that is a privilege in and of itself. i get paid pretty well with good benefits and 401k, which i also recognize is a privilege. overall, my company, from my immediate management to the c-level folks, have been trying their best to support employees during the pandemic. i do not hate my company, my bosses, or my colleagues, but i do hate how working makes me feel. 

part of me wants to just get a simple data entry job where all i do is straightforward, menial work. i feel like something tedious and boring would be a nice break from the constant pressure and exhaustion. 

does anyone on this sub feel this way? can anyone relate?",False,kk8tvq,littleray35,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kk8tvq/burned_out/,18,1

217,I have drastically reduced the amount of time and effort I spend at work and can't explain how good it has been for my mental health and family,"I am a SysAdmin at a large organization. Back in March when COVID first kicked off, while the majority of the company tele""worked"", I was grinding long hours (12-16 hour days) at the office to make sure everything stayed afloat by ensuring all personnel could tele""work"" and that the network stayed healthy. You know, just everyday thankless SysAdmin shit.

I was the definition of a workaholic. I was spending significantly more time at work than home with my family because I wanted to give off a good impression. What did this *actually* do? The only thing it did was create the impression for users and management that I was ""available"" 24/7 and that it was okay to call me as late as 1 AM because a user couldn't log into their VPN because they're sick in the brain workaholics and are working at 1 AM.

This burned me out really hard and upper management treated me like the token subhuman IT/SysAdmin guy, and so for the past several months I have been putting in the absolute minimum amount of time and effort at work possible.

- I will go in and as long as the network is healthy and no users need help or have tickets, I will just get up and leave for the day and go hang out with my family at home.

- I ignore all calls/texts on my off time that aren't alerts I have setup for the network.

- I take extended lunch breaks.

- I don't show up to or acknowledge 95% of ""meetings"".

- I show up late nearly everyday, sometimes as much as 15-20 minutes.

I for sure thought that doing this as long as I have been would get me written up or even fired, but I just received my annual rating and I was rated as the top performing employee (lmao). So with that said, I am just going to keep doing it.

Anyway, that's it. I just wanted to share because I am sure a lot of other people have been getting treated like garbage at work during all of this COVID madness. I realize that not everyone has a job in which they can do or even attempt to do what I have been doing for the past several months, and I wouldn't even say I am ""antiwork"", but the past year has really put life in general into perspective for me.",False,km2uhy,decyphier_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/km2uhy/i_have_drastically_reduced_the_amount_of_time_and/,9,1

221,Things I've learned at work,"So I've been working for a couple of years now, here's some highlights:

* Extra effort = wasted effort, unless a pat on the back is important to you. If you work harder than you're supposed to your only reward is more work and higher expectations. You'll never get a proper raise for it and you will be under higher pressure all the time.
* If you develop tools, such as scripts, to make your work easier, keep them to yourself. Don't share them with your colleagues and enjoy the extra time you get from it. I did and I was actually reprimanded for developing it instead of doing MORE MORE MORE productivity.
* Negative things will get noticed, positive things will not. The extra OT you put in to make that deadline will be forgotten but that one mistake you made a year ago could haunt you until you quit.
* Also, putting in OT will barely be noticed, it's rather expected. However leaving too early WILL get noticed. If you have ""flexible hours"" it will flex in one direction only.
* If you have a yearly performance based raise, they will invent excuses to lower your evaluation and thus lower your raise. The extra effort you put in suddenly never happened but that one mistake you made will cost you your raise.
* Your company likely makes enough money to pay you more, they choose not to. Why would you then choose to put in extra effort? Compare profit numbers to number of employees and you'll see.
* Ass kissing &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; productivity. You can be a total lazy bum and make constant mistakes, if the managers like you you'll get away with it. 
* Always have an excuse to not be more productive. Slow network, unclear planning, anything. Have a backup.
* Document everything you do, such as what time you start/leave, your activities per day but keep them hidden from your managers. Don't give them a single second more than what your contract states. They don't deserve it.
* Loyalty is a trap. Especially larger companies have ZERO loyalty towards employees. If you don't generate enough profit according to their spreadsheet, you're out. 
* If you flex to fix someone else's crappy planning, they won't learn a thing. Next time there's a bad planning they'll expect you to pull them out of the fire. Don't do it, not even once. Make sure they learn their boundaries.
* Always be on the lookout for positions that pay better. They exist!
* Don't screw over your colleagues. They're in the same boat as you!

222,I quit my job today,"Graduated from law school in 2013 and have been grinding at big law firms ever since. Had a baby this year and tried to do the ""working mom"" thing. Made it less than three months before my head nearly exploded. Gave my two weeks notice today.

My job was so awful. I was expected to drop anything and respond to emails at any time. Even on Christmas Eve and over the holiday weekend I was getting emails to revise briefs. I didn't respond. In face I didn't even see the emails till today. The job sucked before I had a kid but now it became impossible. I literally couldn't respond and work during hours I didn't have childcare. Felt like the walls were always closing in on me. Like that episode of Lucy where they're at the chocolate shop and the conveyor belt just keeps moving faster and faster and they can't keep up.

I'm taking a ""break"" possibly permanently from work. I'll prolly never be a lawyer again god willing. I was making the world a worse place with every minute I billed. I know I'm one of the lucky ones so I'm sorry if this sounds like bragging. I just wanted to share my happy news with someone who would understand. There's more to life than cashing checks and grinding. 

I still have to clock in for a few more weeks but a weight is off my shoulders. I was becoming a total bitch moreso with every passing day bc my anxiety and irritability levels were off the charts. I cant wait to be my real self again and start living my best life.

225,I'd rather end my life than spend it working at a job I don't care about just for the money.,"I love life and I love having the freedom to do what I like, but at the same time I'm not afraid of death. So the idea of having to spend most of my life doing things my heart isn't into, just so I can afford to continue living, which is mostly doing things I don't enjoy for money is absurd. I would honestly rather die. 

&gt;*...if you say that getting money is the most important thing you will spend your life completely wasting your time! You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go on living – that is to go on doing things you don’t like doing! Which is stupid! Better to have a short life that is full of which you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way.*

Unfortunately we live in a society that's only interested in turning everybody into just another cog in the wheel, so most people don't even know what they're passionate about. They never think about it, because what's the point? It won't make them any money. I realise that it's also unlikely that one of the things I'm passionate about (making music) will make me any money, but [I stopped caring](https://soundcloud.com/remedy97/5-i-stopped-caring-in-97?in=remedy97/sets/watching-the-sky-fall) about that a while ago. I've realised that It's better to do things not just for money, recognition, or attention, but because you enjoy doing them.

I enjoy making music, and I love sharing it so if you can spare about 5mins of your time and listen [to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3jwOZhRCeI&amp;feature=youtu.be) that'd be cool.

236,Any antiwork bookkeepers?,"Hello everyone. I'm currently in the middle of trying to change from working as a lab assistant to working as a bookkeeper. Honestly nothing really pulled me to bookkeeping besides desperation to have a skill in order to get hired somewhere else. My mom is a bookkeeper/hr/payroll/office manager. She basically wears all of the hats at a small business. I only want to be a bookkeeper; if someone wants one worker to do 3 jobs, then they should get 3× the normal salary. Which of course my mom does not. I'm wondering if bookkeeping is a good job or not. I feel like it'll be a lot better on my body cause it's not strenuous and you can actually drink water while you work. I'm worried about phone use but every job has something that'll suck it seems. I also struggle with working individually, which is one of the reasons I'm suffering in my current position. I want to work with people, be told what to do, and ask other people to help me if needed. I feel like not many jobs want people to do that, and I understand that bookkeeping is the same way. In my area I've seen job postings that'll pay between 12-30 an hour and it made me realize that once I get enough experience to get 30 an hour I could work 20 hours a week and get about the same amount of money as I do now. And tbh, that'd be fucking amazing if I could achieve that. I took a basic accounting class and an excel class so far and it's just okay to me. I passed with flying colors but only because they were online classes and I... relied on my book and the internet immensely. I hope that with practice at work you just get used to it and remember the concepts.

244,What do people think of the news?,"I'm coming to a place where I'm realizing that there are tons of influences vying to consume my time, which, arguably, is my most precious resource. Work is given, and it's a common sentiment on this reddit that work sucks. The FAQ does a good job spelling out what (little) alternatives there are.

But I was wondering what people think about other seemingly fruitless time-consuming activities... For example, following the news? While I understand the importance of following the news on a generalist level for the purposes of social awareness/responsibility, I often find myself feeling helpless when I'm overexposed to it. The news just feels like this vortex of dark thoughts, and it's becoming more and more impossible to track. I get into this place of feeling like a total dope for not knowing what's going on in Sri Lanka or Quebec, because I see people touting false omnipotence about global affairs (not to mention national- I'm in the States) like this badge of honor... 

But then I get to thinking- is the news just another type of rat race? I mean, part of the allure of the intentional living communities mentioned in the FAQ for me is their embrace of what is local and important. Just as I feel it's impossible to give up so much of your life to a 40 hour work week and be fulfilled, I'm wondering if following (emphasis on the word *following* because I cannot keep up) is just another aspect of an insidious attention economy.

But what's the alternative?

260,"We all hate forced jobs, but what are some actual solutions?","A lot of what I see on this sub is upset ranting. And I can't blame y'all - I want to rant at the injustice too. But, what are some actual solutions to dealing with these things that we all hate? I think giving people some hope and potential solutions is much better for mental health.

Here are a couple of ideas I had. My goal here would be to be able to sustain yourself on a part time job (or less) rather than full time. Which is a start. What tips or lifehacks do you have? Share them in the comments!

\-Living in a car, or doing best to be mortgage or rent free. Exorbitant housing prices are major thing that force people inside a slavish lifestyle. Try to live in a car or van. Barring that, try to pay little rent with the use of several housemates. For a long term game, do the normal grind to raise money to buy a small apartment of your own, rather than trying to buy a full-sized house with a mortgage and all. Living minimalistically in terms of housing (and life in general) can save a butt-load of cash. 

\-Get a Costco membership. Seriously. It's cheap and you can buy bulk food. Eat out as little as possible, or make a day or specific meal to eat out once a week to control extra spending. If you don't like to cook, you can still eat healthy while being minimalistic about it. A magic bullet + fruit + keifer + protein powder = a healthy smoothie in less than five minutes. Sandwiches + an apple are easy, cheap, and not bad for you. In my first full time job out of college, I had a meal almost daily of canned salmon with greek yogurt and a spoonful of mayo for taste. You can eat healthy without using up tons of money, or taking up a ton of time cooking.

\-Saving money is key to working less, so question anything that you buy for leisure. Do you really need something in the moment? Pursue your interests, obviously, but don't splurge or buy needlessly. If you want something expensive, make a separate budget for guilt-free-spending where a certain small % of all money you get goes into it. If that account doesn't have enough money for what you want to buy, put off the purchase for a little bit until it does. Another rule I made was that if I was going to purchase something for fun but felt guilty about it, I would donate the same amount of money it costs to some charity. If it seemed like too much to give to a charity at the moment because of my budget, it would be too much for me to spend on something frivolous. I don't overspend or buy things needlessly, or when I do I donate to charity as well. Win-win.

\-Similar to above, cut out unnecessary costs. A little bit goes a long way. Buy a coffee or lunch everyday? Maybe, uh, don't do that. That's YOUR money, don't let those bastards take it from you.

278,Just joined today. Hello. I wish I was still on unemployment,"I work at a call center and the pay is trash. The standard pay is 10-something, but will only pay you two dollars more on ‘incentives’ for clocking at least 32 hours a week. This week Im working 38. All my life I have loathed doing things I don’t want to do; things that I *had* to do. I dropped out of college 5 years ago, and have been working different jobs ever since. Ive been writing a novel since then as well, but due to ADHD, depression, and the need to work just to stay afloat has made it a real drag. 

I feel like my only worth in this world is my ability to produce revenue for richer people. I now take calls for an unemployment debit card program. Its an absolute dumpster fire. People in the thousands being audited and locked from their funds, a finicky security system that will block so many necessary transactions, and a sheer lack of tools on my part to actually help them with their problems. I’ve had people on the phone begging me to release their funds, something often out of my power, while the people over at the Sirius XM section of the center ring bells and cheer every time they make a god damn sale. It feels very... dystopian. 

Ive never worked this much. Its not as much as some other people grind, but I hate it all the same. Its ironic that I was driven off unemployment in August, believing that the benefits were going away, only to learn shortly after that they were being extended. Now I take calls from the unemployed. Sometimes I can help them, and I guess that feels good when I do, but Ive berated and threatened over the phone too many tines for my taste. 

I sometimes think about minimizing everything in my life and living out of an RV or something. But no matter what you have to pay your dues, even for just *existing*.

1) I applied to this promising job online, but had no info about pay structure or start date

2) A rep from the company e-mails me a few days later, saying they’d like to have me do a set of self video interviews, where you’re answering questions instead of talking to someone online (I really hate these).

3) I couldn’t do these interviews for almost a week because of technical issues on their end, and spent a lot of time e-mailing them as a result

4) I finally got access to do the video interviews, and completed them

5) A few days later, another rep requests to have a 15 minute phone interview with me in 8 days at the soonest. I’m frustrated that I have to wait another week, but oh well

6) The next week comes, I nail the phone interview. Thought I was in the clear until the rep talks about the pay, which is low for the position. Then she says that the position starts in 5 months, but I’m not even confirmed yet because of the still ongoing recruiting process. At this point I’m just angry, but politely end the call. 

This company has had me going through the applying process for almost three weeks, all to tell me at the very end of it what their job listing should have originally had. This is so unfair.

299,I feel forced to major in something with a direct path to a job.,"Not sure if this is exactly antiwork, bc I definitely will end up working (although I really wish I didn't have to), but...

I'm about two years behind in school due to mental health issues. I'm almost 21 and will be either a sophomore or junior next year. Originally when I was applying to schools I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I applied to some as an elementary education major and to others as psychology. I ended up choose one in which I applied with a stem major that is VERY niche (like, one job path. Only one.) and you need grad school for (which is extremely competitive). I was scared off due to the pressure I felt even looking at the major requirements and switched to one which was more up my alley but the job (it also had one direct path) has a salary range from like minimum wage to an average of 35-40k. I always imagined myself working that sort of job but I was unaware of how. unappreciated and underpaid they are. During fieldwork for that major, I was exhausted and couldn't imagine myself working that hard while struggling with money. 

I've been at community college for almost three years now and am going back to a 4-year in the fall. I'm most interested in psychology, sociology, and anthropology, but I know that those majors don't lead to jobs. I am so fearful of not being able to afford basic necessities that it terrifies me to actually study something just because I like it. I've always been told to choose a major with a job in mind or else it will ""be for nothing"" and ""I'll end up working at Mcdonald's."" So, I've applied with my first stem major (which is interesting, don't get me wrong) and am going back and forth about what to do. If I went that route, I'd be in school until I'm \~26-27 and have another year after that under supervision. I'd be working a 9-5 pretty much. I think the job is fulfilling (it's a helping profession) but I'm also scared that I'll feel stuck. Overworked, burnt out, regretful. But I don't know what I could do if I just got a bachelor's in a liberal arts field. 

Anyways, if anyone have advice or can relate to my struggles, I'd love to chat. In an ideal world, I would be free to hike, travel, and help people without needing to spend thousands of dollars in school.

315,Have you ever had a job you liked?,"I worked at the arcade counter at Seaworld for about a year and a half and it was my favorite job I've ever held. The pay was modest ($9 an hour) and probably not enough to live off of, but I lived with my mom at the time so it wasn't too big a deal. 


Our duties were simple; keep the token machines full, keep games stocked with tickets, clear any ticket/token jams in the games, keep the desk stocked with prizes and candy (which I would indulge on occasion) and keep the place looking nice. When it was slow, I had plenty of time to read while waiting for customers to come. Pretty sure I went through a few books on that job actually.


Coworkers were cool. Boss was awesome. Biggest downside is that it was seasonal (shut down in January and February) and there weren't always enough hours to go around between the 5-6 of us with usually 2 on duty at a time. But that job never tainted my outlook on life or made me consider suicide like my current call center job does, despite the current job offering better pay ($14 an hour) and benefits.


I guess the reason I liked the arcade job more is because I was  under much less scrutiny and didn't have any bullshit metrics to meet. I always knew what was expected of me and it wasn't constantly changing.",False,kkiqsc,SlimCagey,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kkiqsc/have_you_ever_had_a_job_you_liked/,46,1
316,No More Excuses,"I'll come right out and say that, obviously, I hate working a job; my job is boring and useless. I sit on the computer for 8 hours per day and listen to customers pout and blow up over our garbage software. Since March, I've been working from home and that has made the job SLIGHTLY more bearable. Anyway, I recently tested positive for COVID and my job has done nothing but hassle me for paperwork to prove it. I had to show them proof that I was diagnosed with COVID, which, in principle, is honestly ridiculous and I feel it's a violation of my medical privacy (some people say I'm wrong for feeling this way due to the legality of it, but I don't care about legality, it still feels wrong). On top of that, they want a letter from my doctor not only saying that I have COVID but explicitly stating that due to my symptoms I am unable to work from home. This is after I had already explained to them that I'm really sick and cannot sit in front of the PC for long periods of time. So, basically, they don't believe me and they need an outside party to assure them that the symptoms that I MYSELF am experiencing are real. They may as well create a system where your employer has indefinite access to your medical records. Honestly, I'm on the verge of telling them to shove the job up their ass. I mean, is this it? Just work a 9-5:30 Monday-Friday job until my last breath? 

Now with people working at home becoming more prevelent, it's only a matter of time before all of these companies start cracking down and saying, ""Well, you only have the flu, just bring your phone and laptop into bed with you and help clients."" The glory of missing work due to bad weather is already practically erased now. I believe that the pandemic is going to work out greatly for these companies in the long run, because now employees have ""no excuse"" not to work. At least in the past there were ""little joys"" in between like getting off work and going out. Now, you're supposed to go wake up, work, watch TV in your home, go to bed, and do it all over again indefinitely. I guess it was like this before too but now it's even worse. It seems like business always gets a free pass and wins at the end of the day in this society.

Give us a universal basic income, free housing, and free food. That is my minimum requirement for society.

I don't want there to be more work. I want there to be less work. People who do not work at all, and the people who do work to work less.

The only people who should be working 8, 12 hours should be doctors and and other high-end professions. Not Amazon workers.

Once self-driving cars come, then all of the transportation jobs could be replaced immediately.

&gt;Oh no, people would just play video games all day.

I don't really care. I don't really care what people choose to do in their free time.

We are living in the age of abundance. We make more food in America then we know what to do with so we dump the rest of it. Why is there starvation? Why are we working under the threat of starvation? Oh right, it's not profitable to give food to the poor.

How many people need to die of starvation before we just give everyone UBI and free food?

If I was ruler of the world, I would make some changes really fast

1. It would be illegal to throw surplus supply out. That means surplus food, materials, clothing. Don't throw away good usable stuff.

2. It would be illegal to own a house you do not live in. You have to live in all your houses. You can't just own two houses and then rent one of them out. We are going to seize that immediately.

3. Give everyone a universal basic income, free food, and free housing.

4. Also, we have to stop exploiting other countries. Slavery is going to be abolished worldwide.

5. No one under the age of can be employed. Worldwide, this applies worldwide.

6. Nestle? Shut that company down immediately and arrest the CEO. He's an asshole, I hate him.

7. It is also now illegal to deport people immediately after they are fired from their jobs. Companies threaten to fire workers if they don't do what they are told under the threat of deportation. you can't just deport people. That would be illegal.

8. You only get a seat on the World council if 10% of your population isn't working. They must be unemployed but not living in poverty.

9. The CEO of a company can't make more than eight times what the lowest paid employee makes.

10. The minimum wage in America gets raised to $20 and is raised every year to adjust for inflation.

11. Everyone gets a minimum of two months paid time off, worldwide.

When I woke up around 9:30 my brother was on his laptop doing work. I asked him if he took a bereavement day and he said yes. So I then asked why he's working and he said that the work needs to get done and sometimes you can't trust others to get the work done. I understand that work needs to get done for your job, but on the day you're burying a loved one? Really?

I'm (not) sorry, but my time it too valuable to even consider working outside of working hours. I start work at 9 sharp and end at 5 sharp. They won't get an extra second out of me. Hell they don't even get the 40 hours they want me to work. I work just as hard as I need to get my work done and luckily I'm still considered one of the best on my team.

I mentioned to my brother and mom that I thought working more than is required is insane and not worth it. They came back basically saying that I won't get a promotion and won't make more money than I am now if I don't...bullshit. I've had co-workers send emails at 9 at night, meanwhile I've already clocked out, exercised, showered, had dinner, and am now relaxing.

As a co-worker she annoys the living hell out of me, but to every one else and management she is just wonderful despite never pulling any weight whatsoever. 

Because she was in a semi-senior role before this current job, she has learned the ins and outs of continually being off on the sick, without being caught in a web of lies and deceit. When she comes to work she can still continue to be ill and is given 1/5th of the workload she should have. She is someone who befriends the ‘right’ people and is someone who knows exactly what to say in meeting to impress...without executing anything she means. 

Our job is very physically demanding and busy. She comes in dressed in beautiful clothes and shoes that are gorgeous but pinch your feet. Her nails are always immaculate and she never has a hair out of place, which goes to show how little she actually does on the floor. 

I have to pull my own weight and pick up her slack. I wear trainers, dress comfortably albeit not very trendy and my hair is scraped in a bun everyday because I come ready to WORK and work damn hard. 

I run around like a blue arsed fly, absolutely haggard at the work load. She swans in and chats for 20 minutes, goes to the toilet, gets a drink of water, has a snack as part of her ‘illness’. All of her responsibilities are fobbed off onto someone else, or if she has to do a 5 minute task she easily disappears for 15 minutes at a time. She walks as a snails pace, talks at a snails pace. Everything about how she conducts herself is about wasting time, pointless conversations and questions with managers which turn into full blown conversations. Constantly going to the toilet. Taking time away from the floor, even to insidious things like putting on hand cream, chapstick, washing her hands, it’s all to waste time from actually working.

Italian once gripped all the feathers
off a live chicken as a lesson to his
followers. He then set the chicken
on the floor a short distance away.
The chicken was blooded and
suffering immensely, yet, when Italian
began to toss some bits of wheat
toward the chicken it followed him
around. He said to his followers
""His is how easy it is to govern
stupid people, they will follow you
no matter how much pain you cause
them, as long as you throw them a
little worthless treat once in a while”

361,I attempted to track down my mom's former abusive boss. Not surprised by what I found.,"As a kid, I remember hearing his name over and over again at the dinner table. My mom hated him. He would scream at his staff and have daily temper tantrums.

Decades later, after I've experienced abusive bosses for myself (dealing with one now), I decided to look this mother fucker up online. Turns out he's dead. Died of a stroke a few years ago. Not surprising. My mom said he used to work nights and weekends for a good 15 years. He literally worked himself to death - worked himself to death for a company that no longer exists. 

I went to his online obituary and there are 3 comments, all from past employees who worked for him. They said they were sad to see him go, but reiterated that he ""pressed hard"" and ""kept us on our toes"" (i.e. verbally abused them). 

I found his widow's Facebook page. There's a photo of her and him in the hospital. It was eerie looking at the frail old man who abused my mom, a single mother of 2 at the time, for 12 years. I thought about how he caused destruction to himself, his employees, and likely his family, working 80+ hours a week for no fucking reason.",False,klx0m7,Slapinsack,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/klx0m7/i_attempted_to_track_down_my_moms_former_abusive/,3,1
362,It's shouldnt be fucking normal to have a mental breakdown every day before and during work.,"I feel like I'm on the brink of total mental collapse.

363,I’ve seen at least 3 posts in the last day or two where OP is suicidal over work...please read my experience.,"Reading posts on this sub the last few days, it’s quite clear we have a major mental health problem in the sub. So is it the job causing the mental disorder, or the mental disorder causing work to be unbearable? Unless you can easily change your job, It doesn’t matter. 

But don’t ignore that. Talk to a doctor. If you’ve seen any of my posts on here you know I generally hate work and my job in particular. It’s extremely physical and I’m in constant pain with back problems. I have to be up at 4 am and drive 1 and 1/2 hour to and from work. Some days I would be so in my head and miserable every minute felt like an hour, and the best solution seemed to be jumping off the roof or hanging my self with an extension cords. I’m not exaggerating. I sat at work and contemplated this many times. It got to be too much on my wife. 

I’ve had problems with anxiety/depression for years. I’ve tried many of the medicines with no luck and all of the bad side affects. My therapist recommended I call a Ketamine clinic. The results are much better than with ssri and when combined can be life changing. I’ve had 3 sessions with the last one being tomorrow. It’s been a month since I started and I haven’t had one day I really couldn’t get through. I don’t know how long the affects will last after my last session, so another session every once in a while might be needed. 

I still hate my job, my back still hurts, but something is different. My days are tolerable again. The hours don’t drag. Reach out to me. PM me. I’ll talk to anyone who is in a bad place and just needs to talk. Ask me about my sessions or the clinic I use. Call a family member or friend, but don’t hurt yourself over a fucked up system that’s not your fault. ✌️ ❤️ 🍄",False,klr693,rluzz001,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/klr693/ive_seen_at_least_3_posts_in_the_last_day_or_two/,31,1

375,Fed up again,"Started off the day by getting yelled at by one of the supervisors because apparently I haven't been working enough on solving the backlog assigned to me. 

This came as a shock as I tend to check my backlog pretty regularly so situations like this don't happen. 

Turns out they've been assigning other people's backlog to me without my knowledge for about a month now, something they do pretty regularly but the difference is that they usually let people know beforehand and give them training. 

This didn't happen with me, they just started shoveling other people's backlog at me without ever telling me and now they're mad because I wasn't working on it, when I never even knew they were doing that. 

Oh, and they're not giving me assigned time for this either, they're just expecting me to work on this on top of my regular work, which is answering calls that sometimes stretch up to one or two hours and have between one or two minutes in between them on a good day. 

And it's useless to complain because if I do they'll just spout the usual shit of ""oh we assigned this to you because we know you can handle it!"" Like me being here for almost three years means I'm somehow more ripe for exploiting.

It's really hard to convince myself that this isn't somehow personal, why give others a heads-up and not me?

376,Today I officially give up on society.,"Your first question is probably where am I from and will I be homeless from today?

Who's gonna pay the rent?

&amp;#x200B;

I live in family apartment and my whole family is shattered over the globe. I am paying for expenses. However, country that apartment is located is a black hole of Europe. Median monthly salary is 450€ and life is a joke. I never licked boots or joined corrupted parties for jobs or benefits. I made all money thanks to the knowledge and effort. I have 17 years of formal education from meteorology to kinesiology and economy. Non related but still earned and somewhat employable.

I own car and I saved enough money to leave in one direction. I have bag with clothes prepared and I do not seek relationship. Soon to be 27 and already a guy who tried everything with girls. Doesn't work just like jobs. I don't mind it. It's okay.

&amp;#x200B;

I would rather die in my car. Close eyes and go back to where I came from. I never asked for any of this and know that I did everything that was demanded from me by society, I am miserable thanks to society. I never stole a dime but seems like society committed felony. Who should I report it to? Everything is rigged.

&amp;#x200B;

This life isn't interesting, time is flying by, influencers and public clowns are milioners. Money lost meaning to me since 90% of it goes to worst of my species.

40 Germans own as much as 40 million Germans and Germany supposedly cares. Yeah...

I feel flat. Not even mad. My family isn't very rational so I don't even bother explaining or saying goodbye. My specie is primitive and weak, unable to start revolution or general strike. Just like being born, I am now left alone.

I will never again read idiotic job descriptions of requirements. Interviews are worse than interrogations in regimes. Death is welcoming compared to all that inhumane misarble existence.

I know if I go in there, I'll be given the duties of a full time employee, even though I only work part time hours, I'll get scolded, coached, etc. And I'm just not sure if I can deal with that. I've begun to stop caring. I don't even know why, I feel weird and conflicted about taking the steps of quitting, but I also actively long for them firing me.

380,I don’t have a career and I don’t have a purpose.,"I am 24f and I live with my parents. It’s been my life’s dream to move to the UK and study art, then get a job I love. I wanted to do graphic design until I found out how difficult it is to get a stable job, the pay sucks, and I actually may not enjoy the subject - it’s nothing like drawing.

I now have no career path. No degree interests me anymore, I don’t want to go back to school. I just want to draw. That’s my purpose. But just drawing won’t put food on the table. I have to join the 9-5 rat race soon and become someone I don’t like in order to survive. I don’t want to live then. But I’m too much of a pussy to kill myself. I have not touched my art supplies in ages, it pains me to think it’s useless now.

I should honestly just get a rich boyfriend/husband with a good job and become a stay at home mom instead, but it’s easier said than done. I can’t even get a guy when everyone around me is getting married... love is a whole nother problem.

I got in less trouble staying home from school. Somehow education is less important than work, in our fucked up world.

I didn't pay to go to public high school, I get paid to go to work. Why do companies think I'm intentionally staying home to screw myself of $60-$100 for a whole day?

These places use all this guilt-trip bullshit ""you're bringing down the team!"". 

As if humans have not carried the weight of someone who can't for I don't know..thousands of years?

It should be downright illegal to punish people or dangle their ability to eat or not be homeless over their head like a fucking carrot on a stick.

It also forces people who are sick to come to work, where they get other people sick. Now instead of one person being miserable, five are.

398,Who created the idea that everything at work must get done within 30 seconds or else you’re lazy? Just wanna talk,"I always thought that the standard for responding to a business-related email or voicemail is within 24 hours. Or by end of business day or something. 

Nope. Someone leaves me a voicemail at 5 (when I leave the office for the day) and they left me another message just a few minutes after 8 am the next morning. When my voicemail lists my hours. 8-5. So you left me two messages within 15 minutes. But ok. 

Someone left me a voicemail at 3.15 and sent me this super rude email at 4 using caps and shit. “I left you a voicemail FORTY FIVE minutes ago with NO response.” It’s been 45 minutes holy shit chill out. 

Can you take care of this by the time you leave? Um, I leave in 30 minutes. No I can’t. 

Someone emailed me right before I left last Friday and then forwarded the same email to me once on Saturday, again on Sunday, and again on Monday morning 2 seconds after I sat down at my desk. 

I’ve had people leave me one voicemail an hour for an entire day. So 8-9 messages from ONE person in one day. 

I have a job that is extremely fast-paced and busy. I unfortunately can’t sympathize with the people who complain about only doing a half hour of work a day and then sitting around for the next 8 hours doing nothing. I really wish I could. I’m literally working every second of the day from 8-5 minus breaks, meetings, etc. On any given day, I can receive 25+ voicemails, 50+ inbound calls, and 70+ emails. My task list is normally 50+ items long as well (not counting the rest of the stuff). It’s higher than usual because of COVID but regardless the people who can’t just fucking chill out and let me get to them and feel the need to almost harass me make me want to pull my hair out. 

Somehow we’ve fostered this culture of instant gratification where things need to be done NOW NOW NOW and if you don’t you’re just ignoring people or not working fast enough or whatever and it drives me fucking crazy. I’m one of the fastest workers in the office (I know people here are fans of being purposefully slow but in a job like this it’s not possible) and I still manage to get complaints about not being “responsive” or whatever. Back when I worked in retail it was the same thing. Someone stands in line at the register for two seconds too long and they start huffing and tapping their foot. It’s physically impossible for everything to get done within 2 seconds. Some things take time and the world doesn’t revolve around you.

409,Got written up...after being employed for three months,"I’m working as quality control in a lab for the company I got hired at in September. One of the things I have to do is to monitor a production line and every 20 minutes or so grab a sample and run some tests on it, one of those tests being checking for expiration codes. There are also people working on that same line further down who monitor the progression of the line (this will be important later).

Last week, I was working and felt I was doing well for a relatively new-hire. The supervisor had said to me that she was impressed that I was picking up on the job so quickly. I was running tests, imputing data to the paperwork and excel spreadsheet, and keeping things moving smoothly. Or so I thought. 

On my next shift the following day, the supervisor comes to me and says that there were 32 pallets of product with no expiration codes whatsoever on them. I told her that as I had been doing my checks, the codes were clear and legible. She said that there were absolutely no codes from 4:48 am until after 7:00 am when the next shift took over. I got sent the write-up paperwork and was told today (12/23/20) to fill it out and submit that I had seen it, read it, and accepted it. 

After having done so, I came onto my shift tonight. I told a coworker (who has been training me for the last two months) about it and she was really skeptical about it. We wrote down all the pallet info and went to the warehouse to find these 32 pallets to try and see what was really happening. They weren’t with the rest of the pallets from that night. My trainer is sure that the parent company to the one we’re working for wouldn’t be okay with wasting 32 pallets worth of product and I agree. We also couldn’t figure out where they would have put them in any case. We were able to find a pallet and a half sitting in a random spot in the warehouse from that night: all of the cases had legible, clear codes from around 5:00 am, 10-15 minutes later than the alleged time that the codes disappeared.

I can’t help but wonder what really happened. I wanted to be shown proof, but the supervisor didn’t have any. So I got written up, with no verbal warning, about something that I have minimal training on. Not only that, but the people down the line from me didn’t report anything or stop the line at all to fix the issue they would have been able to easily see.

All of this is aggravating beyond belief, as I feel that were there really an issue that needed to be fixed, one of us would have caught it and said something about it. My biggest complaint is about the write-up: if there was indeed a problem, why wasn’t I shown evidence of it? Why wouldn’t they want to rub my nose into the proverbial carpet to prevent this kind of thing from happening again? I certainly would love some proof, but as I’m brand new, I have no political weight in the company to throw around yet.",False,kj9w01,Papyrus_Sans,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kj9w01/got_written_upafter_being_employed_for_three/,6,1

This summer I busted my back so bad that i got two heavy disc heirniations with pain so bad that i could not sleep and bend at all. Leaving me the options of either staying up in my feet or just staying in bed. Sitting was out of the questions.

As i work in a office. Work was out of the question and had to visit a doctor which found the problem mentioned above. Recovery period months/ almost half a year if ever or doing a operation with recovery in the months again.

Now my position is critical for the company as there is no one else on my position and new employees cant start work if i dont work as i need to set systems create profiles and so on. Of course they had to find someone to cover me while i am gone and had to task the allready understaffed Eu team.


Of course during this whole time i received weekly calls to check how i am and when i am comming back and being pressured to commit to a hard date when i am comming back. Every week I heard how difficult the work is how they have alot of work and are hanging by a thread. Even the regional manager called me to almost beg me to come back even if for two hours a day how they are also gonna hire adittional help to come as soon as possible. I mean the whole thing made me feel like i was guilty that i was sick and putting pressure on the team. When i think about i had to write a very stongly email that i am going on sick leave and i wont be loging in ""just for couple of hours"" at the begining as for some reason managment beleived that i will work on my sick leave...

I feel so fake and the person I try to be just isn’t me. I don’t have the energy or the right mindset to continue on with applying but I’m aware that if I don’t apply I won’t get a job and my current living situation therefore won’t change. But -

For my first job I wanted to work at the pet store with my two friends but now I'm thinking it'd be a bad idea. They already have multiple ways to contact me and they would probably go straight to me to ask if I can cover a shift.

I feel like I would end up just seeing them as annoying co-workers that will ruin my life instead of seeing them as my best friends. I plan on putting in the bare minimum effort possible to not get fired just like the advice I see here all the time but I don't know what their views on working and capitalism are so they might say bullshit like ""you should help out more"" ""you're being a bad friend for not covering my shift"" etc. and I'd feel awful and probably end up losing them.

About a year ago I had a major breakdown (due to a mixture of childhood trauma i hadn't dealt with and workplace anxiety/trauma). I used to be a super social butterfly and confident. Now I'm a potato. I am in therapy etc. And was approved for 2 years of long term disability. 

I have 1 more year to figure out what to do and I honestly have zero clue what the hell i want from life. I am estranged from my crazy family and married to an amazing man. 

Part of me wants to have a low effort job because I honestly dont think my brain could handle much more. 

Part of me wants to try and find somthing I enjoy and hopefully get us to a point where on or both of us work from home. 

And a third part of me wants to just give up and live off disability / make artwork/ take care of the house etc (im honestly very worried I'd not qualify anyway though and I would have a hard time with the stigma)

I'm not a ""lazy"" person... I just have legitimate anxiety attacks in public now and I can't just call off when I'm having a bad time nor can I have a panic attack while at work twice or 3 times a week. 

Used to work for a developmental disability center for the state- which scarred me out of what I'd wanted to do since I can remember (be a therapist). 

I'm sorry if this made no sense. Im just trying to maybe get some advice or know im not the only one? I have been working on myself for a year now.. its been weird and hard because I just dont feel like myself anymore.

I had to work today, went in for 4 dumb hours where I pretended to be busy since this job doesn’t actually have enough of anything to do. It’s garbage and it’s not hard to see how much of this job could be automated. If things were set up right I could show up work half the time and get twice the work done if they just Dodd this the right way. Sadly we all know that even if that were the case they sure as shit wouldn’t pay me as much. 

I came home to my lovely girlfriend who kinda lives how I dream to . I unintentionally enabled her to not work at all while she is home whilst I work full time to pay both our bills. I know this paints a bad picture of her but we are working through her mental struggles and ideally neither of us should have to work full time to make our financials work

I also could have an opportunity to pursue school in hopes of working less. I love my art and wish I could just do that. Live in the middle of nowhere with a garden and maybe some chickens. Working via my art only just enough to pay for things like internet video games etc.

I hate that minimalist lifestyles are the most expensive. I have all this energy to make something and enough spite to fight my way to a nicer life but i just don’t know how. My arts isn’t appealing and going to school for it leaves me in debt destined to work to pay it off

I hate that these diseases I require medication for in order to  live ropes me into the hellish “lifestyle” work enforces.

One of my coworkers decided to sit down while sorting through the cables since there was a chair near him. He wasn’t working slower than us at all- we were all going at pretty much the exact same pace and he was working just as fast sitting as he was standing up. 

Our boss’s wife saw him sitting on the security cameras and decided to “have a word with him”... very loudly, in front of all of us. 

You got that right. My coworker got berated in front of everybody just for *sitting down*, even though it made no difference in his work output. 

By the way, did I mention warehouse employees at my company NEVER come into contact with customers? So it’s not like they cared about keeping up a “hardworking” appearance... they just honest to god did not want my coworker to be more comfortable while he worked.

486,"I did nothing, and it was everything I thought it could be.","  So, a few years back I was working yet another temp job. Who knew temping could be a career choice?  
  My first day, the supervisor told me to sit with another employee because she didn't have time to train me, and my desk wasn't ready. Same thing the next day. Third day, my desk was ready, so they showed me how to log into the computer, check email and such.  Still no training. The other person I was sitting with was busy, so he said to just sit at my desk until the supervisor was ready to train me. I finished the first week, no training. Supervisor signed my timecard and I'm thinking... Easy week.  
  Next week, I check in on Monday, and the supervisor says wait at my desk and she'll come get me when she has time to train me. So I sit. Thursday morning, same thing as Monday... Go wait at your desk. OK. She signs my timecard on Friday, I'm thinking, another easy week.  By this time, I am surfing the internet all day reading up on my new video game, World of Warcraft. More easy money.  
  Third week, Monday, same thing. Supervisor says I don't need to keep bugging her about training, she'll come get me when she has time to train me. I figure, no problem, I'll go sit in my cube at the dead end of a row so hidden that no one comes by my desk. I have a window with a view to Seattle's harbor. I can see the boats coming in and out all day, so I got that going for me at least. Not too shabby. And I wait. And wait. And wait.  Every week she signs my time card, and I surf the internet. Lots of Warcraft sites and make notes to improve my WoW game.  
  After **NINE MONTHS,** a consultant comes by my desk. Literally the first person to come by my desk since I started. He says he has to have a chat with me about my internet usage. I found out that the consultants had come through to make things more efficient. Where have I seen this before? I knew I had done nothing but surf the web for 9 months, and thought well, it was a good run, had to close out sometime. But the consultant and I shared a common interest in World of Warcraft. So he cut me a break and said he'd wipe my history out of his report before he sent it in. Just so long as I wasn't surfing gaming sites after the next Monday, I'd be in the clear. I thanked him and even powerleveled him in WoW after he jumped over to my server.  
  So the next week, I start bringing in audio books. I come in, log into my computer, listen to audiobooks from the library for 8 hours waiting for my supervisor to train me. Every week, she signs my timecard, every week I wait for 40 hours, not really wondering anymore if she is going to teach me what to do.  
  A year and 3 months go by. They call everyone in to say that our company had been bought out by a larger delivery service, and they will be shutting down the branch. It will take about 6 months to get things sorted out. I continue to do my same thing of showing up every day, listening to audiobooks from the library and wondering when I will get the axe. 5 months go by, and my supervisor is laid off.   
  Her supervisor says to just keep doing what we're doing and bring our time cards to him to sign until they tell us to leave. This goes on for another month until he tells me that this will be the last week. I look sad, but he says not to worry, he'll give me a good recommendation. I brighten up and that's pretty much that. 

I spent a year and six months at that assignment, and I did **LITERALLY NOTHING** the entire time.  
""I did nothing... And it was everything I thought it could be."" was never more apt.

  The next best part was the next Monday I got a call from my temp service, and the SAME COMPANY (under new management now) had another assignment for me.  They needed someone who could work without supervision on a project that would take a year to a year and a half, maybe more to finish. I would be boxing up 30+ years of employee records from the bought out company to send to be scanned.    
  It took me about a month to clear out the HR file cabinets in the same building I had been *""working""* in. When they sent me to the warehouse where the rest of the records were stored, I saw what they meant by the ""It would take over a year"" --- Massive rows of racks 12 feet high. I was tasked with doing it ALL. SOLO.  I had complete discretion to figure out how to get it done. I wanted to find out how much work was actually here. I spent the day just counting boxes. 

  Then I did the math and figured out that all I needed to do was box up, actually just seal up and prepare to be shipped, 3 boxes an hour, then it would take me about 15 months to clear the whole warehouse, and I would still be 3 months ahead of schedule. The first day of actual work, I finished an entire 8 hour days' worth of work in less than half an hour.  
  So the next day, I brought in my laptop. Connected into the wifi of the Starbucks next door and played World of Warcraft for 7 hours. Each day, I would bust out my work in a half hour and the rest of the day was mine. I would take a few minutes every so often to move some boxes out to the dock space they set aside for me and then it was time to level characters and have fun in WoW.

487,Argument against FIRE,"I’m getting downvoted somewhere as I’m expressing how outrageous (and nonexistent) interest rates are, and that I don’t really trust investing..
Can anyone help substantiate the conclusion I’ve come to, that it seems like saving your savings by “stuffing them in your mattress” or simply minimizing your living costs is just as effective as investing.. 

I get it, stocks and bonds grow, 3-5% wow yippee much percentage wow

but for someone who makes barely anything, the whole having a savings and ETFs and all of that jazz is kind of meaningless when you barely have savings to begin with.

Right now in my “high yield” savings I basically only make enough interest to cover my Netflix subscription every month (which is worth it because it helps me not be so depressed).

Idk am I wrong to distrust the stock market? Am I wrong to not want to participate in this clown fest where small percentages only work for people who are already wealthy?

And to my title, how many of you have researched FIRE or all that early retirement stuff, and have you found it to be accessible or isn’t it just part of the “temporarily embarrassed millionaire” mindset of the American ? Yeah I’m a bit biased, I lean more towards the latter..

518,Employer conundrum / a rant,"Tl;dr: my employer made an accounting error, is trying to make amends and (allegedly) avoid potential legal issue , I can likely ask for what I want, but what I want is a way out of this shit, not a new package. The fuck do I do now?


Without going into obscene detail, I worked in a professional office setting, and left the company/country to pursue something completely different. After a few years, shit happened and I needed to come back home, and also chose to go back to my employer. I worked out a unique deal with my employer which gave me tremendous freedom of schedule/time/hours worked, no benefits (to which I agreed) but complete with your typical profit-driven, dehumanizing attitude about work. The work itself is very tedious, and frankly, boring.

Over the years since returning, so has the malaise about the job itself. Not sure if it’s the actual work, the toxic environment, or my own existential crisis that life is more than 40 hours a week of making profit for others. 

In these years since returning, to put it plainly, my employer fucked up. They are legally required to provide certain benefits, even if part-time (which I technically was due to previously mentioned situation), and they didn’t. I brought it up, they “fixed it”, but it still wasn’t correct. Brought it to them again, finally fixed it. 

Since that experience, though, some other bullshit has happened regarding benefits. I reached a tipping point last week where more negligence was shown by my employer, and I had to get loud. 

 I exploded on them (as professionally as possible, while still conveying my message), and pretty much said, “I have been patient and gracious with your misgivings, and then you have the AUDACITY to say that your errors happened because I’m the only employee with this situation?”, as though that excuses their violation of law. 

So, we are in talks, they are “trying to make things right”. I have an opportunity to probably name my package at this point, as they (likely) fear litigation, even though that’s not really something I want/would do. 

My heart knows I want/need to leave. My finances (student loan debt $45K, mortgage $109k) tell me otherwise. AND, even if I did leave, I have no real goals/inspirations/dreams to pursue. 

I don’t even have a question to ask at the end of this...I just feel confused, conflicted, scared, and depressed. And I know a lot of others here do, too. I’m not lazy. I’m not anti-labor. I’m anti-fucking people over, wringing them out of their energy, time, mental health, and their lives, just to turn a profit.

- Work at my current job for 5 more years or so, while continuing to live in my tiny, rent controlled apartment - then switch to working part-time and living partially off of my savings. Would probably have to stay in my tiny apartment or move to another more affordable city for this to work, though, and live very frugally but I pretty much do that anyway. 

- Again, work for a few more years, then mayyybe go back to school so I can eventually get a job I might actually care about? I’m thinking about something in the social work area, but who knows; I’ve heard the burnout in those areas is huge so it might be as bad as / worse than the meaningless corporate jobs I’ve had 

- Either way I’ll continue to work on writing &amp; recording music which is the only thing I really love to do, and I guess there is an off chance there that I’ll become financially successful doing that someday, but it’s a small chance and I never want to actively try to monetize this one thing that I care about for fear of taking the joy out of it. I could make many other posts purely about how cruel the system is for people who make art of any kind, and how I think the reality is less “oh it’s so sad that so many artists are mentally tortured individuals who end up killing themselves” and more “our society makes life incredibly punishing for artists and they often see no other way out,” but alas.

I was more than ready to pay the penalty fine, but the conditions at that time didn't let me, so I had no choice but to kept coming to work for the remainder of this month. I can't even see a lawyer, as some of you suggested.  


Today, I'm taking another sick leave because my blood pressure is starting to rise again, I'm feeling sluggish, my head is kinda dizzy. I already have high-blood pressure for two months, probably from stress from working, or it's genetic, or both. However, the doctor seems to be ""uncomfortable"" when I asked him for sick note. Saying that I ""take too much sick leave in short time"" and it ""endanger"" the doctors because in this area, the companies are prone to call the clinic and doctor to confirm if their employees are taking sick leave.   


Maybe I exaggerated things, but yeah some of my co-workers already told me that those who worked around this area, whatever company it is, are kinda difficult to get sick note from doctor around here because of things I described above.   


Anyway, just got contacted by co-worker, said that I MUST come next week because of stuffs I need to do, ""and you still are the only one capable of it"", and said co-worker will taking his annual leave so he can't back me up, and they need me to ensure if I can come to work next week.

542,"Working Christmas Eve, anyone else?","Anyone else working Christmas eve or Christmas day?

I'll be working tomorrow, but not Christmas 

However I will have to work the day after Christmas, a Saturday, why? 

Because that way they don't have to pay us the holiday rate for working Christmas. 

Those cheap fucking bastards, I totally love this wonderful ""Christian"" company I'm working for, they made me work Thanksgiving but are giving us Christmas off, how generous. They also donated our holiday bonuses to charity, how wonderful that they short our bonuses for a tax benefit after making us work nearly every Saturday this year, truly a corporation I should be proud to support. 

I'd actually rather be working Christmas, not only would I be getting double the hourly rate but I'd get my first full weekend free since October, my sister will be working Christmas eve and Christmas day, but that's fine since nothing is happening anyways and she's getting extra pay for it, if there is one year that I wouldn't flip my shit about having to work during holidays it would be this one.

I'm glad to be working from home, I can spend a good chunk of my working hours doing chores, browsing reddit, and listening to podcasts most of the time while I am actually working. However I'm worried that work from home might be used as a trojan horse that will end up changing work culture to make it easier for our employers to work us during weekends and holidays.

 It's a lot less intrusive to incorporate a weekend work shift into your Saturday if you don't have to drive to the office or even get dressed, if my job wasn't work from home I'd have told them to go fuck themselves if they expected me to work on a Saturday, but now it's an expectation that I'd be working on a Saturday, it may make it harder for me to stand up for myself in the future if my next job also expects me to work on Saturdays and during holidays.  Anyways I just wanted to rant, hope work from home continues, this job would be absolutely intolerable if I actually had to be at the office, the second they ask us to return I'm out, or at least I'd give a 6 weeks notice and continue to work on the condition that it's from home.",False,kj2v5l,postedsomethingawful,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kj2v5l/working_christmas_eve_anyone_else/,5,1

545,"Got laid off, 2 months left, stopped caring","This was my first real job out of college. I had always been a hard worker and a people pleaser, and without realizing it, I was working for some pretty toxic people. The company I am working for had to make cuts due to covid, I was one of them. At first I took it really hard. I sobbed, I thought about how I would miss my coworkers. We had worked together for so long and I had bought into the idea that we were “a family”.

I got calls from all my managers/bosses telling me they were there for me and that they were so sorry that this happened and that it was totally unexpected. I appreciated the support. 

I was told my end date was in February and that I would get a severance package after that. I was given all this news on a Friday. The following Monday, I was depressed and my performance dipped. I continued to work, though not at the level I worked before. My managers’ tones quickly changed... they began to question why I had not finished certain projects yet. “Can you speed this up?” “What’s going on?”. I couldn’t quite believe what was happening. 

I realized we were never really family to begin with. I know it was naive to buy into, but it did genuinely seem like we were all friends before I got laid off. Now I was a number, a statistic, and my managers made it very clear.

I was frustrated, I decided I would just take a day off because I felt like it. This is not like me at all. At heart I am a people pleaser and my managers know this. It was like a scene out of office space. I got many messages that day asking what I was doing. Didn’t respond to a single one. 

The next day I got a stern zoom call with my manager about how I cannot be unresponsive or he will have to involve HR “and nobody wants to do that”. Well, asshole, seems like you do since you’re the one making the threat.

Since then I’ve been barely working. I make up excuses like “my internet is down” (I work from home). Or I’ll turn something in that is so bad I get messages saying “how long did it take you to do this?” I just don’t care. Yesterday I didn’t respond to any messages again. At this point I’m just waiting till my end date in the beginning of February. Of course they might get rid of me sooner. I don’t care really.

547,Our two main issues 101,"I was thinking of this since some times, I share with you my thoughts of our two main issues and a way to resolve it.

I'll try to make it short and clear. But if you don't want to read:

tl;dr: our miserable lives are caused by wage labor and property system. Why lot of us need a job? To pay rent. Without rent, I'm not sure we'll spend 7+ hours/day in a (bullshit)job.

#__Introduction__

Life is a struggle. In our modern life, we are most of the time in a hurry, always having something to do, less time for ourselves and other and it's not rare to feel alone.

Tons of people are stressed, on burnout, sad and sometimes want to end their life to end the struggle.

Lot of them think issues and struggle of their lives are caused by immigrants, religion, unions, employees, employers, etc.

We have indeed social and political issues, but some are bigger than other, and paradoxically, it seems that the bigger they are, the lesser we see them.

A question can be now asked: What are our main issues?

#We have two main issues: wage labor and property.

## Concerning wage labor

Why are we working?

First of all, we need to define what is a job. A job is a kind of work, but a work isn't necessary a job.  
When you go shopping, do the cashier yourself to pay your groceries, cook a meal in your apartment, you _work_.
When you raise your child, you _work_.
When you make a YouTube video, learn a new language, draw something you like, read a book to increase your knowledge, etc, you are still _working_.

The work don't need to be paid or be a job, and can be done with total freedom.

_Job_ is a specific kind of work when you accept to submit yourself to another person and give it your life hours in exchange of a salary. We can say it's a contract between a slave and a master. It's an human exploitation by another human being.

Most of us have to be employed because we have no capital, and sometimes we have debts.

People can tell you ""it's not slavery, you're free to accept and contract"". In fact, [you have a choice between starving or selling yourself to a tyranny.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iR1jzExZ9T0)

 _Jobs_ haven't a good pay, we are slaves from others, selling our time to other so they can achieve their dreams. So, why are we still needy to having a job?

Because we need to pay for food and for rent. 

Salaries are low, so sometimes, in worst cases, you don't have enough and need to have loans, generating more slavery in the system.

##Concerning property system

Why do we need to pay rent?

Well, you can say ""because people have some properties and I don't"".
But why you don't have one and other have? Why can't you just take some space of a land and build your house?

Because in this case, you're no longer needy and don't have to spend 7+ hours a day to pay a rent. Of course, you'll have to pay other bills of you want some services (gas, electricity, water, etc) but working few hours can be enough.

Yes, _working_. Because without a Damocles sword, you are free to do what you want. You can work on something you like, spend hours you want and having enough money to pay what you want.

So, property system lead us to live in other property apartment or house, pay a rent for it, need a job to pay the rent, so being slaves.

#What we can do

In my opinion, for now, the best things to do is to read and to learn, understand why we are in this situation, and think about plans to change the system. 

Property system is the main trouble, but it'll be hard to change it. 

In fact, our generation isn't the first one having trouble with this _labor_ system. Mens and women are fighting for centuries.

Here a 101 reading.

Orestes Brownson, _The Laboring Classes_  (1840):

&gt; Wages is a cunning device of the devil for the benefit of tender consciences who would retain all the advantages of the slave system without the expense, trouble and odium of being slaveholders […] They must be no class of our fellow men doomed to toil through life as mere workmen at wages. If wages are tolerated it must be, in the case of the individual operative, only under such conditions that, by the time he is of a proper age to settle in life, he shall have accumulated enough to be an independant laborer on his own capital, on his own farm or in his own shop.

Extract from the _Journal of United Labor_, the official organ of the order of the Knights of Labor (1885):

&gt;The alarming development and aggressiveness of great capitalists and corporations, unless checked, will inevitably lead to the pauperization and hopeless degradation of the toiling masses.It is imperative, if we desire to enjoy the full blessings of life, that a check be placed upon unjust accumulation, and the power for evil of aggregated wealth.This much-desired object can be accomplished only by the united efforts of those who obey the divine injunction, ""In the sweat of they face shalt thou eat bread.""Therefore we have formed the Order of Knights of Labor, for the purpose of organizing and directing the power of the industrial masses, not as a political party, for it is more - in it are crystallized sentiments and measures for the benefit of the whole people, but it should be borne in mind, when exercising the right of suffrage, that most of the objects herein set forth can only be obtained through legislation, and that it is the duty of all to assist in nominating and supporting with their votes only such candidates as will pledge their support to those measures, regardless of party.

Even some [presidents](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k2wr25/few_example_of_people_who_saw_the_wage_labor) so the problem for people.

Bertrand Russell's _In praise of Idleness_  spoke about a [4hour work day/week.](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/kgebd0/in_praise_of_idleness_bertrand_russell_on_leisure)

Paul Lafargue, Karl Marx’s son-in-law, who wrote [_The Right To Be Lazy_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1883/lazy/index.htm) in 1883 go to 3-hour work per day.

He gave some [Greeks views of work labor](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jx6zue/and_nevertheless_the_genius_of_the_great/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share).

Keynes also spoke in 1930 about a 15 hours work a week in his [_Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren_](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/1930/our-grandchildren.htm)

Proudhon said in 1840 that [_property is robbery_.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/kfno4g/nevertheless_i_build_no_system_i_ask_an_end_to

Etienne de La Boétie encourage us to fight tyranny in his [Discourse of Voluntary Servitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ioanwr/resolve_to_serve_no_more_and_you_are_at_once_freed) and we can also read Henry David Thoreau's [_Civil Disobedience_ (1849)](https://xroads.virginia.edu/~Hyper2/thoreau/civil.html) and Benjamin Constant's [_The Liberty of Ancients Compared with that of Moderns_ (1819)](https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/constant-the-liberty-of-ancients-compared-with-that-of-moderns-1819#preview).

After this, we can dig more and speak between us to see how can we change our lives, concretely.

555,"The best and worst supervisor I ever had (or, why I am anti-work)","Years ago, I had a great supervisor. I'll call her Janine. She made sure our workloads were manageable and we grew their skills; she shielded us from company politics; as long as you got your work done, she didn't care what you did, whether you came in late, etc. She wasn't just a team manager, she understood the actual work too, and she was very smart and talented. I really liked her as a person. She was the best supervisor I ever had.

Fast forward a few years. We had both left that company. I wasn't too happy with my new work situation. We happened to catch up and Janine said ""there's an opening at my company, why don't you come work with me again?"" so I did with great excitement.

I was tasked with working on a complex project that was behind schedule and a bit of a disaster. Two weeks in, Janine asked whether I had completed a list of items. I hadn't. ""That's not acceptable,"" she said. I was taken aback and thought, crap, I'm totally dropping the ball here. I worked harder. Every meeting, she made it very clear that I wasn't making enough progress. At one point I said ""can we be honest for a minute? There's a ton of stuff to fix and finish, and you know our team can't move any faster."" She said, ""these are the deadlines. get it done."" I still remember the cold look on her face when she said that to me.

It got so stressful I started keeping a bottle of antacid on my desk and would pop them every few minutes. I talked to HR and the first thing they said was ""let's talk about what you're doing wrong."" (They actually said that.) Turns out Janine had made a lot of promises and was under intense pressure from the head of the company to launch the project by a certain date. She knew there was no way it would happen. So she was throwing me and a few other people under the bus.

People on the team quit. I gave notice soon after. Janine herself left shortly after that.

Months later, I ran into her on the street. I was stunned when she seemed happy to see me and gave me a hug. We made small talk and somehow avoided talking about our last work experience together. She didn't look healthy. Later, I heard from mutual friends that she was on meds and hadn't been doing well. She was in complete denial that she had treated us so badly. She wasn't working regularly. I'd been extremely angry, but after seeing her, I felt deeply sorry for her instead.

The best and worst supervisor I ever had were the same person. The system of wage slavery will turn anyone into a monster. Nowadays I'm glad when I get along with my supervisors, but I never, ever trust them, because I know it just takes the right combination of hierarchy, pressure, and desperation for them to do a 180 and screw people over.

558,I stopped working early!,"Hi!  I only recently discovered this subreddit, and I find myself wanting to speak up and say I DID IT!  Almost six years ago I took “early retirement” from my stressful career, and only one person totally supported my decision. Fortunately that person was just starting a career and genuinely wanted to help me fulfill my dream of not having to work full time ever again.  I couldn’t have made it on my tiny income without help, and I know how lucky I am. 

I was originally raised to believe that I would be a housewife and mother—unless I became a nurse or a teacher. By the time I hit college age, the expectations had changed dramatically and I was led to believe the most important thing I could become was self-supporting. After working for a while, I went back to graduate school and pursued “a real career.”  When I stopped working, I had been with last my employer for 25 years. Others older than I had been there longer and planned to work til 67. They thought I was nuts to cut out without adequate income. 

Making it without enough money has been hard at times, not gonna lie. But what’s been much harder is undoing the link between my self-esteem and that lack of money and identity. I don’t know if I will ever completely overcome my bouts of shame. 

*I am capable of working, but I choose not to* is truly radical in American culture. And me, I’ve always been a bit of a people pleaser. Deciding I would rather pursue learning and doing things that I love but don’t make me money has been both the best and in some ways the hardest thing I’ve done.

563,I'm starting to think some of us here have ADHD.,"Look, I'm not defending the shitty work conditions that people struggle with or trying to blame that on mental illness. So please do not take this the wrong way.

However I was recently diagnosed with ADHD as an adult in his late 20's. I was diagnosed with it as a kid, but I was given one pill of the highest possible dosage of Ritalin, it made me hyper (duh) and ""that was that"". As a result, I neglected my mental health for *years.* 

For many years, I kept asking myself, ""why don't I have any time to do anything?"" I only worked part time. I have a couple hobbies but nothing time consuming, no children to raise. No college to study for. Why are dishes piling up? Why is the laundry not done? 

I look around and think ""how the **FUCK** are people working 40 hours a week, going to college, getting up early to jog, AND raising kids on top of it, when I can't even work 20 hours a week without feeling like every second of my time is occupied with something?"".

Are these people secretly robots? Did they discover a trick to never sleeping? Can they pause time and just get a bunch of shit done without me knowing? 

The answer to that? ADHD. 

I spent sooo much time doing fuck all and not even realizing it. 

It's literally like this ""ya, I need to get up and do the dis-oh wow, this wikipedia article on maritime disasters of the 1700's is pretty awesome, I better check it ou- holy shit a new ask reddit thread with 3900 comments? Better read them all!""

Dishes? Ya..still not done. 

You have no concept of time when you have ADHD. I can spend 6 hours on Reddit and it feels like 6 minutes have passed. As a result, I usually run out of time to get anything else done.

It also makes it very hard to get the things that need to get done and easier to just procrastinate. People with ADHD crave dopamine. You get it by watching YouTube videos, not scrubbing dishes. 

I've been taking Ritalin for a week now and on the very first day, I did probably two weeks worth of chores. Holy shit, I accomplished things! 

Now I have all this extra free time that my brain did not even know existed. My 6 hours of shifts at work don't feel like they take a week to go by. 

Again, work sucks, I know. 

But getting my mental health in check has made is somewhat tolerable. I don't wake up literally dreading going into work, feeling like I'm driving to my own execution, hoping an 18 wheeler pops a tire and drifts into my lane and runs me over. 

So I'm posting this in hopes other people can get the help they need. I obviously can't tell you if you have it, but if you sound like me, you may want to bring it up with your doctor.

I love this sub and I love you cantankerous shitheads.

As a member of the Left, the Left is pathetic. We need to face reality, that we are being *crushed*.

We have had not one major victory in the last half century which has had any significant positive impact on the working class. Too many of us still deceive ourselves into thinking the Democratic party represents us while they deflect responsibility for any measure of competent leadership and push legislation which further marginalizes the *actual* socioeconomic condition of POCs, further strips the working class of what little they have left, gleefully bombs foreigners for no good reason, and further devastates our people with a murderous for-profit ""healthcare system"" which is an utter affront to every positive development in the history of human social thought and ethics. 

We keep having the same dumb. ass. debates. year after year reestablishing established facts ad nauseum because we have substituted action on our problems for cultural signaling and social bickering. Face it: our 'Leftist' party has no sufficient interest to pass M4A during a pandemic when people are going bankrupt and dying at staggering rates, and this policy has the support of the majority of Americans across political lines. 

Wake. Up. I love bread and circuses as much as any of you, but if we do not put the soma down (Netflix, etc.) and collect together, organize, and engage in direct action where they either give us what we want or we take their jobs and throw them on the street...we are not going to see any revival of what is good in the American spirit, and we will, without doubt, watch ourselves continue a collapse more horrific than we can imagine.

I have worked in non-profits for 5 years distributing hundreds of thousands of pounds of food and raising millions for pantries, case managers, and shelters for the homeless, recently incarcerated, raped, abused, and suicidal. I have not made a dent in the systemic problems which contributed to their abject oppression. The non-profit industrial complex is real. There are no major institutions in our society poised to challenge capitalism, no major dissident party to join, no established path within the rules of the bourgeois system to affect change.

Most of our working lives are either non existant or sheer hell. We go from precarious job to job hoping desperately that the next one won't ruin our mental health, have abusive management, or otherwise simply fire us as soon as we aren't producing. People doing things like working Uber 12 hours a day are not human beings, as Vanis Varoufakis once said, but soulless autonomatons, husks of what were once people. I am not religious, but what this is is systemic spiritual devastation.

Chris Hedges' ""Wages of Rebellion"" is an excellent and moving read about the moral imperative of revolt, about stories like those of inmates who commit to protests in jail demanding their rights all while knowing they are going to be thrown in solitary for the rest of their lives. I don't know about all of you, but I can't work, eat takeout, and sit in front of a screen for 50 more years until I die. I can't.

There is no hope for us except to give up our old hopes for political saviors, electoralism, and decrepit institutions, choosing rather to find new hopes in one another, in solidarity, in strike, protest, broken windows and demands. Now.

570,I feel like my idea is impossible to reach...,"I've been thinking of all kinds of ways to try to escape work, or to find a way to both make money and enjoy it at the very least. I don't have a lot of skills since I'm young and haven't had that many jobs. My job that I thought would be a dream come true and a career maker makes my back ache, exhausts me, and has tasks I don't really want to do at all. Yes I'm lazy; I know. The business is literally the kindest, small business ever so it's not about capitalism taking advantage of me. I just hate the role of being a worker, I guess. Anyway, I'm not a skilled writer or artist and I don't have knowledge everyone is begging to know, so I feel like blogging or making something to create passive income is impossible for me. Investing makes sense, however you still have to play the game to get money for investing. That doesn't feel like it solves the problem, or at least quickly enough for someone as impatient as me.

I've recently thought about a concept of getting an apartment building where none of the tenants pay me, and I don't pay the tenants. Instead everyone who lives in the apartment building would work cooperatively together to maintain their homes, whether it be cleaning, making meals, gardening food, maintaining electrical and plumbing, and finding ways to earn income for the apartment's costs. I kind of want to live in this place in my mind myself. Each person would only work one 8 hour day a week to do chores for the apartment. I thought it would be a great way to show the world that people can thrive without fulltime work, or even maybe without part time. Maybe be able to create a change in the world.
But I'm broke... And I'm learning buildings can cost anywhere between $270,000 to $10,000,000... The cheaper buildings obviously only hold a small amount of people and I'd be way happier having each tenant have the support of a larger community instead of putting a ton of responsibilities on a few people... It feels so out of reach and pointless. I don't even know if I'd ever see the price of some of these places in my account for my whole life.

574,AITA? Thoughts on Leftist Anti-Work types in my network asking for money,"I don’t know, this might be unpopular.

Although I started seeing this long before COVID, I have continued to see a large volume of Leftist Anti-work types in my social network taking to Twitter and Instagram to repeatedly ask for large volumes of money (think 4 figures) almost monthly, often times with some flimsy explanation for why they have 2 days or something to come up with an outrageous amount of money.

\*To be clear, I’m not talking about the person who needs a few hundred for their rent and takes to Twitter offering landscaping, art, pet care, car service, etc but people who REPEATEDLY ask for 4 figure “donations” every other month with no offer of reciprocity.

I’m a Leftist/Anti-Work type, and I have a high degree of empathy for working class people. There is something fundamentally wrong with Capitalism, but we all understand that here.  I have lived off of poverty wages in the past- line cook jobs, retail, manual labor, etc- and it isn’t fair, or sustainable.  At the same time, I can’t help but be frustrated by some of these people I see in my circle repeatedly relying on GoFundMe pages or just throwing up a Twitter post with their cashapp, looking for amounts like $500, $1000, $1500 to pay expenses they can foresee- not catastrophic medical expenses- but things like their rent or utilities.  

For context, I live in a highly developed city with over a million people and relatively low COVID rates- our job market has not been absolutely decimated, and the average wage for even retail and restaurant jobs are basically sufficient to cover basic costs of living for individual adults if you’re strategic about it.  As more and more places stabilize operationally, basically every place has a “Now Hiring” sign, not to mention we have a huge gig economy (I’m talking about survival here, not ideal situations).

For additional context, a lot of these people are activist types- not quite organizers- but they spend a lot of time protesting, and some time volunteering. Some work part-time, others do random jobs here and there, others are refusing to work amidst COVID. I think the activism and volunteering is awesome, but at the same time, when I see Anti-Work people \*repeatedly\* relying on their network of sympathetic Leftists to cover expenses they know they have- like food and rent- all the while not taking a step back and maybe strategizing how they’re going to provide for themselves within or in spite of the Capitalist paradigm, it pisses me off for three reasons:

1. It’s bad optics.  Obviously some people in their social network are not going to be Leftist/Anarchist/Anti-Work types, and people already have a hard enough time understanding what we mean when we speak of “abolishing work”.  To have your brand be anti-work/Leftism, and simultaneously be critically unable to provide for yourself in a public way, it totally feeds into the stereotype society constructs of people with our ideology.
2. When you’re constantly looking for ""donations"", you’re effectively saying “Work is bullshit, and I don’t want to do it, but I’ll benefit off of the labor of other people”. And to me, that’s bullshit, and not in accordance with Leftist principals. Mutualism only functions when everyone is acting in good faith and is striving to provide as much value as they take. That’s where the “mutual” part comes in. If you’re anti-work and that leads you to rejecting the wage labor paradigm, that’s great, but you aren’t rejecting the wage labor paradigm by refusing to provide for yourself and then appealing to the sympathies of Leftists who do sell their labor so you can pay your rent while living the Leftist fantasy that our society just can’t support.  You’re quite literally benefiting off of the labor of other people, and to me that’s sort of cringe Leftism.
3. I generally hate the argument like “I saw a guy paying for groceries with food stamps and he took out a brand new iphone”, but I’ve known some of these Leftists for years, and I’ve seen them drink, smoke, and snort up thousands of dollars right in front of my eyes, cover themselves with expensive tattoos (I’m heavily tattooed as well, so i’m not criticizing actually being tattooed, but spending $300 on a tattoo when you don’t have 3 months living expenses saved up is just irresponsible let’s be honest), and buy trendy clothes from online boutiques.  I get that we’re humans and we naturally want some luxuries, but at some point we have to be realistic about the role that our personal choices play in exacerbating our financial problems.  Nobody can plan for a pandemic, but if we're being honest, many of these people ostensibly allowed themselves to be one missed paycheck away from destitution not because they have some outrageous financial obligation like children or a chronic illness, but because pre-COVID they were running up $20 bar tabs 4-5 nights/week, renting trendy apartments in areas of town they could barely afford to live in when there are cheaper neighborhoods, and keeping a half pack a day habit. And that really makes it hard for me to be sympathetic sometimes. I’m not trying to pat myself on the back, but when I was working for terrible wages, I learned how to safely salvage food and supplies from dumpsters (sharing what I couldn't use with friends), wore thrift store clothing until they fell apart, and took every opportunity I could to make an extra buck and stow it away because I appreciated that the world doesn’t accommodate this ideology, and it’s not right to rely on the charity of other people who are out there struggling too when you are a single, able bodied, childless person in an area with relatively stable economic opportunities, and you are capable of keeping a roof over your head and food on your table.

Of course the system should be different, but it isn’t yet, and I just don’t have a ton of sympathy for some of these people.

577,Help with resignation letter needed!,"Good morning all,

I'll be deleting this after a while for obvious reasons but I've been sitting in this for a while and need some outside views:

I've had issues with my boss for a while. When I came back from maternity leave, her daughter wanted my job and they proceeded to bully me 2 years ago. 

Daughter left, boss went on sick, came back and then the pandemic hit and my boss went off shielding for 5 months. I believe she would have gotten me out earlier had she not been away for so long and each time she did I was the back bone of the office despite earning a fraction of what my colleagues earn (most experienced).

My boss found out she was being moved recently to another location and really upped her game, putting me down, lying about my work, overworking me and then calling me for meetings if I dropped the ball at all.

Finally I had enough and took time off sick due to the stress only to find out the most recent meeting was the start of an investigation wherein the next step is disciplinary and probable sacking. I have no prior issues on file. Just the fact that Head Office have taken this seriously has taken away any shred of love I had for the job, especially as they knew about the awful things they put me through when I came back from mat leave and also, the deputy who told me she supported me and that this was bullying and sabotage has backed off and isn't supporting me although now my boss has left, she has taken her position. If I go back, I'll be the backbone of the office again and I feel used and bullied. I also can't face pulling the place through another pandemic as we had an outbreak last time (healthcare). 

I have a meeting tomorrow, but I'm not going. I'm not going to 'defend' myself or explain myself. I don't want to.

So I need to send probably my resignation via email. If I don't attend, a decision may be made in my absence and frankly they can have at it. I'm going to stay at home and take care of my child and be happy.

But I don't know whether to let them make their decision and just tell them I'm not attending or to resign. And if I resign, I don't know whether to address the points in the investigation and that I think it's disgusting that this is way they treat they're 'essential' workers who worked through the first wave of the pandemic, while they're all hiding at home only to come out when it's safe and bully people. That the foundation of the companies values are being mocked with their very actions and inaction against a proven bully. Or just to say, 'I resign and won't be attending the meeting' after which I would like to go no contact.

I work in retail and there haven't been a lot of customers. With our previous manager, we would just think hey this is nice and just stand around and chat until someone came in. Our new manager, however, actively discourages conversations and comes up with inane tasks to keep us occupied, like dusting shelves for the third time that day or finding random things to clean. 

It reminds me so much of school. I would always finish my work quickly and then pull out a book to read for enjoyment or go play with someone else who was finished but the teacher would always swoop in like hey you're all done wow great your reward is this other extra worksheet. 

I feel like we've been raised to work, work, work, even when we're clearly working in excess since there is nothing useful left to do.

My father has been at tyson for over 30 years and he has been nearly deaf as long as i remember because of that plant, and my nights unable to sleep from ringing ears i didnt want to end up like him....

Well long story short, on the hardhats were clips for proper over the ear muffs that u would use at a gun range, so i asked one of my coworkers where he got his and he told me where a spare pair was kept so i used them........ it took my supervisor less than an hour to take them away from me, write me up for using equipment not assigned to me by the company and then had to spend my lunch break being chewed out by the in house nurse about how i can only be issued those earmuffs until after a company appointed dr can prove that not only was i suffering damage to my hearing but that it was caused by my job could i get those muffs back....

It wasnt long until i nearly lost an arm from my supervisor directing me to do something stupid that i finally quit and learned that employers dont give 2 shits about human suffering",False,kg7hzu,FSM_Rabbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kg7hzu/the_moment_i_became_antiwork/,17,13

608,(rant) work culture in japan and corporatism,"Hello, this is my first time posting on this sub so forgive me if i miss any rules etc.

I just really needed to let out some anger on the capitalist systems abusing and exploiting people but dont really have anyone to rant to.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to leave my old job because of covid and havent had to work for a few months, I felt so free but at the same time nervous and anxious about when I had to start working again and going back to those days.  Unlike other countries, 9-6 or 8-5 is the norm here and even that is not enough for the japanese companies. They expect employees to be willing to work overtime for them, it's like the bare minimum requirement. I heard it's been getting better compared to before but i doubt it'll get any better by the time I die at this rate of improvement.  I don't mind working if it's necessary for society to function but to the point that we live and breath work, there's barely any time left to do anything when you're home when you include the time it takes to get there, time to shower, cook and eat etc, then during the weekends you barely have enough time to rest your mind and do all the housework, groceries etc, there's not enough time to do things that I want to do. Not to mention the anxiety and just stress from having to deal with people (co-workers, customers, bosses idk) all the time and constantly under the pressure and expectation to perform pointless tasks. Why do we have so little control over our lives?

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part and what brought me to the boiling point today are the taxes. We have a bunch of different types of taxes and it's confusing for normal people like me. Most of the people here if you are employed full-time (正社員 - seishain), the company takes care of the taxes for you (deducted from your pay) so people don't really pay attention to it. I paid attention to it but it wasn't as bad when I was working (total of about $500-600 every month deducted). So since I quitted my job, i did research on the tax and stuff I had to do after I quit to deal with the taxes, visiting the town hall and doing a bunch of paperwork ( you can get tax reduced for a few months if u lose your job to covid ) and thought I was prepared to deal with the tax problems after I quit.  To help clarify things I've compared the amount of tax I had to pay while I was a full-time employee vs now that I'm out of work.

Full-time employee:

Pension Tax ($150\~), Health Insurance Tax ($150\~), Resident Tax ($120\~), Income Tax ($150\~)

&amp;#x200B;

And here's how much I'm expected to pay as an unemployed

Pension Tax($350\~), Health Insurance Tax($350\~), Resident Tax(???)

I had no idea how much resident tax was until today when an enveloped arrived in my mailbox, the bill wrote $650.. my heart sunk the moment I saw that. And this does not include consumer tax that has been increasing every now and then.

My pension tax and health tax will be temporarily reduced as covid relief, but what about workers who did not leave their work due to covid? how are they supposed to live?

How does it make sense that someone who is working full-time making decent money pay 3-4x less tax than someone who just lost their job? and the worst part is apparently the rich are paying even less? I honestly considered taking my life after seeing that bill how am I supposed to live while being forced to puke out $1400\~\~ every month with 0 income???? I thought I had more time with the money I saved up over the 4 years I worked but this is just retarded. fuck this capitalist bullshit and corporate crap.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a video I found explaining some stupid tax stuff in japan

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnyLO5JdOJM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnyLO5JdOJM)

I've also watched an hour plus documentary about how the national bank of japan and ministry of finance fucked up the economy during the last bubble and even now they are not willing to help fix it and make live better for everyone despite printing money out of thin air. Have you heard of the go to travel campaign in japan where the goverment is paying people to travel? yeah they rather spend that money to help their corporate buddies in the travel business than help out homeless people and salaryman slaving their lives away 20 hours a day 7 days a week

642,What are your strategies to slack off at work,"What are your strategies for slacking off at work without garnering suspicion from management? I figured we can help each other by sharing what we do.

I work in a laboratory, and have access to a laptop. I'm in an open office, with my seat being directly in front of my manager's office. What I do is I'll take my laptop and sit somewhere else (either hidden in the lab or some other part of the site with low human traffic).   
Since I am not sitting at my desk, it makes me look busy.   
If I sit at my desk for 30 - 60 minutes, even if I am doing work, my manager will always come out and check in on me to make sure I am working.   


Other things I do include:  


\- Waiting a while before answering emails to look busy, sometimes missing the deadline for a reply email on purpose. Gives the impression that I don't have much time. 

\- Always delivering my work at the last possible minute. Finishing early just gives me more work without recognition, so why bother. Delivering work at the last moment also sets expectations low, and puts a larger time premium on any work that needs to be complete allowing me to take it easy in the future.

  
\- If I'm chairing meetings, I'll drag them out for as long as I can. Raising pointless details that adds discussion that goes around in circles. Since we have Covid going around, we have social distancing, and I'm able to flick through my phone in a room away from management's eyes as these discussions go on.

\- I'll pretend to do some area audits or engage in other large bureaucratic processes that the business has and encourages. Something that doesn't require me to produce results for a manager, but is just kept for my sake. Makes it easy to fake.

\- I always strive to do the bare minimum and only do what I am told to. I never go above and beyond. If I have no work to do, I will never raise it with my manager. I'd just aim to be out of sight so that I am also out of mind as well until work comes my way due to a customer or logistical emergency.

645,I’m quitting my job and moving to Africa in 25 days.,"I did everything right. I went to college and took out loans. Started working at 16, usually two jobs, and 15 years later I’m now making decent money (at least for my field of social work) and guess what, this sucks and even “meaningful” work is soul-crushingly bureaucratic. To pay off my loans took my entire twenties working 60-70 hours a week. Then I saved to take a break and travel, but covid. So really there’s no way out of the machine and there’s never a good time. Leaving my job right now is suuuuch a bad idea but who cares. 

So I’m taking my savings and fucking off to Africa. Maybe it’ll be a huge mistake, maybe it’ll be cool. Either way, it’ll be different. I should wait til after covid but I got the vaccine and this shit will last forever so fuck it. Plane ticket bought, replaced myself in my apartment, sold the car and everything I own. I’ll get a little apartment and do some freelance work online and make cute little meals and get a dog. Maybe start a journal idk.

654,Quitting soon,"I posted here a little while ago to vent/ask advice, so you can look at that post for context if you want.

Basically, the people I liked working with were being treated like shit, so they left, and now I'm being treated more like shit. Despite my dept constantly asking for my help on things they don't know how to do, they're also clamping down hard on my flexibility and freedom. They don't adhere to mask protocol yet they expect me to spend more time around them, and they now expect me to keep my work phone on outside of work hours. 

My former boss who left says she likes her new office. She offered to hire me at the new place and we are still in touch. But that job would either require me to move, or require 3 hours per day of commuting in the snow. All for a job that's only okay because the boss is decent.

So I'm quitting, I'm going to get the cheapest possible health plan my state offers (they are pretty decent, I've looked into it), and I'm probably going to be roomies with my best friend until one or both of us needs to move again. (We have lived together before and it works great for us.)

Fuck this shit. I have options and I'm not going to put up with this when I don't have to.

655,"I wrote this at 3am while having an existential crisis, tell me what you think."," As humans grow more complex, one can feel more left out. Simplicity allows for inclusion of people from a wide variety of intelligence levels. We can find more common ground among our neighbors and those around us when the understanding of life is more digestible. It is evolutionarily proven that societies and human life itself tends to advance, however it then makes it harder for people to connect when there can be such a wide range in intelligence, understanding of complex items or theories on a local or global level. Can most people understand nuclear physics or string theory? Probably not, but our intellectual jealously can make us feel insignificant and useless. The effect of it is strengthened when you go from people of average intelligence to people with learning disabilities or levels of intellectual disabilities that allow them to co-exist with society but possibly through help of an aide or guardian. If we rewind to a simpler time, before the industrial revolution, or the period of enlightenment to when most people harvested grains, raised livestock, etc., those with learning disabilities would have had a much easier life. They would not have needed to know as much information as required to exist in today’s society. The internet serves as both a blessing and a curse. We now have access to almost all of humanity’s knowledge, and can even walk around with it in our pocket. However, that does that show us? We can go onto YouTube and see people who can do anything better than us. It does not make us feel important, or as if we have a purpose in life. You can work years becoming an expert violinist, and then find someone five years old who can play it better than you. As the population of earth expands, this only worsens. Talent is becoming worthless because more and more people can now do something, something that maybe 50 years ago, only one person could do well. How do you top that? You cannot. So what do we do? Life cannot stop, you cannot go around telling people “ok, that’s it, no more advancing”. How do you deal with the people left in evolution’s dust? Every human life has value and should feel important, but how can they feel accepted? We are a motivated species; we are motivated to do “something”. But you can ask yourself, why bother doing it? What are we all doing here anyway? You can only accomplish so much in life. You probably will not even get recognized for it. But is that the point of life? To have your name engraved on a trophy? To be acknowledged? Life has a start and an end, so what are you supposed to have done by the end? Are you supposed to have things done? People say, “I regret not..”, but what point does it matter if you are dead? About 150,000 people die every day. Did you know any of them? Will anyone remember their name 100 years from now? What did they accomplish? Life places a heavy expectation on us to do something. We have to do at least a few things. We have to work; we need money in order to live. We cannot do nothing; we will die of starvation or be homeless if we just sit absolutely still. We do however feel the need to survive. Otherwise we would feel no fear. We would simply kill ourselves if we felt life was pointless. Some people actually do this, but most people generally are happy and live a long life. So we can at least do the absolute minimum. Go to work, brush our teeth, feed ourselves, put on clothes, listen to music or do something that puts our mind at ease. The other side of this would be being famous, a world leader or a renowned inventor. But even doing the most basic things are more complex now than ever. We need somewhere to live, and that generally requires money. We cannot just put up a hut somewhere and claim that spot as our own. Whoever owns that area of land would have you arrested for trespassing. We have to buy food because the food we eat does not grow in the wild anymore, it is cultivated. We cannot make a spear and hunt wild animals, that requires a license. This is only scratching the surface of all the requirements it takes to be even the most basic person in today’s world. It is no wonder why people have so many issues with mental health. Life is no longer simple. Society itself demands from us and our goal in life is to fill that demand. We cannot even rest anymore without feeling guilty. Those dishes need washed, the trash needs taken out, that new season of your favorite TV show needs watched, you need to buy more food, you need to scroll through your feed. The list goes on and on. How did we get this way? Complexity should be making life easier. We have all sorts of machines and technology and gadgetry at our disposal, yet it now takes more time to exist than it did 300 years ago. There is now more entertainment than ever before and consuming it takes time. We cannot even decide which TV show to watch or podcast to listen to because there are thousands and thousands of them now. It would take your entire lifetime to even consume a tiny fraction of all media content. Deciding which career you wish to pursue can even be a daunting task because who knows if it will be replaced by AI 10 years from now? Even applying for a job can be difficult because there are 100 more people that want your job. You new refrigerator can connect to Wi-Fi. Heck, even your car now can. The people who graduated automotive or refrigeration school 10 years ago would not even know how to fix those complex problems, it would require an electronics engineer. So now there are automotive electronics engineers and refrigeration electronics engineers. But what if we took all this way? Suddenly there would be mass unemployment. Now life is less about doing something and more about making money. Does the need to fill jobs stem innovation, or does innovation find a need to create more and more suddenly useful jobs? Jobs that did not even exist 10 or 20 years ago. You are probably reading this now sitting behind a computer or lying in bed staring at a tiny screen. You would not have been able to do this 50 years ago. Does it make you happy or feel like you are fulfilling some type of need? Why do we feel the need to do any of this? Are we detaching ourselves from life? Do we in this very minute feel less needed to do something? How much more time do we have left to do it? The need to something is chipping away at our time to live. Let us go back to the year 1500, humans did not browse Facebook or post a tweet on Twitter. They did not watch TV or talk to people on the phone. Few people could even read or write. They worked hard yes, they hunted animals and raised crops. But at the end of the hard day they had much more free time. They felt no need to become famous or become much of anything. Why did we suddenly feel such a great need to do this? It is killing us. It stresses us out, makes us depressed and racks us with anxiety and fear that we might not accomplish anything of note before death. We have to keep up with everyone, society tells us so. We are brainwashed into believing we cannot be happy without spending money. People look at you weird if you walk around in torn or stained clothing, they might even think less of you. We are becoming biologically programmed to look down upon others. We look down upon other races, people with less money, people who are ugly or have some kind of physical or mental abnormality. We do this thanks to complexity. If we cannot stand on the backs of other people, we cannot feel like we are getting ahead. So it rewards us mentally to believe we are doing better than other people, but at the same time, it destroys our wellbeing because we still feel like we are still very much behind. But this cannot go on forever because we are still advancing, and we will reach a point where the majority of the things we need to do in life can be put on autopilot. So much of our life will become automated and then what happens? Do we commit genocide against the people who aren’t smart enough to be on the bleeding edge of technology? Does society and civilization as we know it collapse? Do we just pay everyone to not work anymore? At that point, if money comes from labor and labor is reduced exponentially, how are we going to obtain money? We cannot just keep doing more and more things, we will run out of time and then probably develop a way to fool the human body into thinking it slept 8 hours every night. Or humans could possibly merge with machine. Or we could find ways to live much longer than we do now by slowing down aging and eradicating disease. However that does not solve anything. It just gives us more time to consume and to do more work if work still even exists. It would completely eliminate the feeling of needing to be alive. We are put here not to consume media or work; we are put here to enjoy. Enjoy time with our friends, our family and our romantic partners. How often do you hear people say, “I wish we had more time to do things.” or “is it just me, or is time going faster?” No, it’s not. Your time spent enjoying is being stripped away by the second every day, by the minute ever year, and by the hour every decade.

I recently discovered this sub and others like it and find that it lines up a lot with my views and how I’ve been feeling about work and the working world at large lately. 

We’re moving soon for her new job which will be providing us with a place to stay at well below market rent which means we’ll actually be able to survive comfortably off her income alone. I’ve made it clear to her that I need an extended break and that I’m in no rush whatsoever to work but would rather work our own veggie garden, learn to fish, and eventually learn to hunt so that we can be a little more self-sufficient. Long term I’d like a lifestyle block where I can farm more of our own land and raise some livestock. 

She’s concerned about money and how we’ll be able to afford to have kids or buy a property and that it’s not realistic and I’ll have to get a job. And I guess she’s kinda right though because despite the shitshow of a world we live in, we still need money so I’m trying to reconcile how we can work it out.

HOMEPAGE

 

The millionaire investor Will Coman. Like Lake/ Letters

Will Coman, the chief executive of the hedge fund
Pershing Square Capital Management, says the
American dream has become a ""disappointment""
for many because of economic inequality.

In The New Work Times' DealBook, Coman says the
wealth that upper-middle class and rich Americans
generate from equity and other investments has far
outlawed wage growth.

The millionaire is proposing a plan, called
""Birthright,"" where the of government would give
every American a stock investment upon birth.

Birthright funds would be invested at birth in zero-
cost equity index funds, be prohibited from
withdrawal until retirement, and compound tax-free
for 65 years or more.

It historical rates of equity returns of 8% annually,
a $6,750 at-birth retirement account would provide
retirement asset of more than $1 million at age 65,
Coman wrote.

690,"I didn’t go into work today, and I won’t ever again.","I work in a shitty chain supermarket picking online orders for minimum wage, on what was supposed to be an 8 hour a week contract due to being a student, but ended up being 30+ hours with extra guilt put on you if you ask for a reduction.

These changed quick to 4am starts, and then 3am starts last week. Today was supposed to be my first 1am start, the first of 7 IN A ROW, and after only managing 3 hours sleep, I got up and just said fuck it.
I feel so guilty for the other staff there, the amount of orders they have to pack is insane and management refuse to hire more staff, so you end up doing things you’re not paid to do just to help your colleagues out.

They have made an utter killing due to the lockdown, orders going from 20-30 a day to in the 100’s, yet are still opening on Boxing Day despite most other supermarkets giving their staff the day off to spend with family after this horrible year. 

They haven’t paid me right a single week, they stack heavy boxes to the ceiling in the stock room which need just a nudge to pin someone down one day, they have no COVID safety for staff and their cleaners haven’t been there for the last 3 days meaning NOTHING has been sanitised for staff or customers.

699,I actually enjoy being somewhat poor.,"I could go back to college and get farther into debt, for what? Oh, to make more money.

What would I do with this money? I could buy a larger house. For what reason? So I can have more space that would require buying more crap to fill it with? More square footage that takes time to clean?

Or I could buy a newer car. Why? Mine is fine. Sure it's old and it has a lot of miles, but I take care of it and it should last at least 5 more years if well taken care of.

I am a minimalist and very anti-consumerism. I took my stimulus check and paid off debt. I didn't go out and buy an new TV or gaming console. My TV isn't even 4K, and that's fine.

I don't get why people want to earn all this money. I want just enough to pay my bills, have a somewhat decent house or duplex, and drive an older but reliable car.

I don't get why people feel so proud of themselves making a bunch of money and working 45-50 hours a week. ""I can finally afford new and nice stuff"". 

So this stuff is worth slaving over? Going to college for 4 years and then being somewhat middle class and earning just enough to have a little better lifestyle and spend the next 10-20 years paying off these loans? Fuck that!

I'd rather have time to RELAX. Time to work on my hobbies or read about different political or economic theories. Go on a walk and look at nature. 

Maybe it's because I actually grew up poor, I don't feel the need to spend money. Shopping doesn't make me happy. I get my shirts from Sam's club or yard sales. In the summertime I have my wife buzz cut my hair. 

Now I'm just a bit better off. I'm not middle class by any means, but it's nice not having to constantly watch my bank account and panic when I might possibly be nearing an overdraft. 

Who needs all this shit anyway? Oh ya, let me go buy a new $39.99 shirt with some dumb ass logo on it and drip mustard or ketchup on it. I need a 4K TV because for some odd reason I need to see the hair follicles on someone's ass. I need a Mercedes or a BMW because I need all this extra bullshit to pamper me on my commute that is just going to break down anyway past the warranty period. 

I had a few rich neighbors. I knew one that was actually decent and humble. The rest were assholes. They felt the poor were lazy bums that ""just didn't work hard enough"". But they were never home. They were either at work or out gallivanting with their friends at country clubs or other richie-rich places that would throw you out if you walked in dressed in as t-shirt and jeans. People who were proud of their ""success"" but probably never went on a nature walk or read a book in their life.

These people had 5,000 square foot homes but either were spending time sleeping in them or decorating them or some other mundane shit. Some rooms were just for ""guests"". An entire living room and dining room that might see an ass in a chair 2-3 times a year. Fancier plates and silverware for them too. An entire bedroom for them too.

While I don't necessarily hate the rich, I do not understand them. They think being rich is supposed to make them better than other people or make them happy. Some of them I've met are some of the most emotionally devoid or downright unhappy people I've ever met. If you go to a party hosted by Walmart workers, no one is going to give a shit if your clothes are worn. If you go to a rich persons party, they feel ashamed that everyone is wearing a suit that cost $100 more than theirs. 

I do not understand the worship and obsession with money. I think everyone needs to make a living wage and not have to worry about rent or bills or food. But beyond that it becomes pointless. These people make more money but then feel the need to spend it. As if spending it is the answer to all their problems. 

While many people have had this quote attributed to them so I don't know who originally said it, I think about it often. 

&gt;Too many people spend money they don't have to buy things they don't want to impress people they don't like. 

No one gives a shit. It's just imprinted on us by society that somehow it will make us more likeable. No one stands up at a rich persons funeral and goes ""man, he really sure had the nicest Rolex watch I've ever seen"". 

Like I said, you may feel different and that's fine. It's your money and you have the right to spend it how you please. I just live a simple life and don't feel the need to rush out and buy random shit when I get paid.",False,kggoiu,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kggoiu/i_actually_enjoy_being_somewhat_poor/,28,1

They stressed how fast paced it was (80-100 calls a day whilst doing other tasks, such as answering emails, performing searches and other admin tasks and having to hit targets). I had left a my last job because customer service drove my mental health to shit (it’s already pretty bad due to diagnosed prolonged grief) and required a similar amount of work. 

Plus they want to “invest” in people that will stick around for a while. I am not planning to stick around, I’m trying to apply for teacher training next September so I only really want something for the next 9 months. 

They now want me to do a second interview containing tasks that I have to complete, such as call scenarios and emails TOMORROW at 12. 

I feel like I’m gonna have to take it, or pass off my one opportunity to work and look lazy. Money isn’t a huge issue right now, although more would definitely be nice.

But it's like they're the ones that treat you the worst for not wanting to engage in the rat race. Then it's even worse if you're a man, cause our species still holds onto the archaic belief that men are supposed to be steamrollers when it comes to survival. All these unnecessary milestones and impositions that I didn't ask for.




Am I working a 9-5? No. Am I making enough money to be completely self-sufficient? No. Do I feel bad about that? Only when everyone keeps treating me like I'm some sort of failure for not holding up to their expectations. Do you think I wanna be here? Playing these stupid ape games for survival, stepping on everyone else, and struggling with most of the population to make ends meet? No. I didn't ask for any of that. Why is it that everyone just expects you to be born and follow the Lifescript™️ without fail or question? It's always ""What are you doing?"", but never a genuine or concerned ""How are you doing?"". Everyone just expects you to be doing something, regardless of how it makes you feel.




I mean damn, I know freelancing isn't bringing me five figures worth of money every year, but it works for me right now. If I suddenly stop making money, go homeless, and end up under a bridge somewhere, let that be my problem alone, but don't make me feel like shit because I view the alternative as being just as bad.

weakness does more harm than good.

That started out as a push to see people beyond
their shortcomings - whatever they are (physical,
emotional, etc) - came from a place of love and
care. Over time, that push has evolved into an
ideology that encourages groupthink and creates a
shared sense of entitlement. Were is an example.
It work, | manage a team of people. When | hire,

| look for people who | evaluate to be strong and
capable because | need their help to solve problems.
| recently inherited an employee - Employee X - who
is capable but not emotional strong. Is a result, |
am finding myself in conversations with Employee
X about safe spaces and how his feelings get in
the way of the rest of the group's ability to solve
problems. The rest of us suffer because Employee
X is emotional weak. Instead of working on getting
emotional stronger, Employee X feels entitled

in slowing the rest of us down. His is a micro
example of a much bigger micro problem in the
West. Of we don't move beyond this embracing of
collective weakness, our future looks grim.

712,I can't help but feel as though we're wasting our opportunity here,"I mean, we're intelligent people united under a common belief and Reddit is such a useful tool for bringing us together and what do we do? Not nearly enough. We post memes and we complain, and God knows I'm as guilty as anyone else, but Christ shouldn't we be doing more? I feel like we have all the tools we really need to get together and work out some sort of solution, for ourselves if not for society at large, but we don't take any advantage of it. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, maybe we are, maybe there's a discord I've not seen, but I can't shake the feeling that we're not making the most of what we have.

It would be really unproductive of me to post something like this and not offer my own, fairly limited, suggestions. Maybe a commune or some sort. There are parts of the world where property is comparatively cheap; Northern Ireland is a good example, you can buy a decent three bedroom house for less than 70k. We might not be completely work free but good planning and preparation might limit that further. Yes, I know it's a far from perfect suggestion but at least it's something. 

I know it might seem pointless to talk about stuff like this. It might seem that society is so employment-focused that there's no way to escape and the best we can do is vent.

Feeling happy that I had the next two days off to look forward to. On my break I was socializing and it came up how I just got out of picking up said shift.

All I was met with was disdain and shaming.
All of them were older people.
I work just as much as they do.

""You're young, why not just take the shift?, Heavens to Betsy""
Why does being young mean that I should overwork myself and damage my mental health in the process?

""When I was your age...insert irrelevant anecdote about working back when the economy was actually decent""
Cool I don't care.

""Would you be doing anything else important?

If your argument is ""they need to find better work"", then what should happen to all the jobs that pay under $15/hr, which was 42% as of 2019?

Do you honestly believe there are enough ""good paying jobs"" for 42% of those people to obtain? Never mind the economic impact 42% of the workforce moving to higher-paying jobs would have on all those now vacant jobs.

748,Fuck this job,"For context, I work as an overnight security guard at an IT building where there is still \*nothing\* going on. All the overpaid techie douchebros and sis's are still able to safely and comfortably work from home, and it's been this way since I started back in early April.

I walk into the control room tonight, and there's yet another dumbass letter scolding everyone to read and sign over the pettiest of things. While some of it is completely understandable, and shit I wouldn't do at any job (like putting feet up on a desk or fucking with the thermostat), there are some things that are a bit ridiculous considering this is only $12.50/hr and there's no differential for overnights. (Granted, we got a temporary raise when we did temp screenings for a little bit, but that was yanked away with NO communication WHATSOEVER)

""While on duty you must have your shirt tucked in- 100 PERCENT OF THE TIME""

There is literally nobody here. Nobody until I'm about to leave- just me and the other guy or gal I'm on duty with and maybe the snow/salt crew but they don't even come in. If I'm going to work nights in an empty ass building, I'm going to be comfortable. As long as I look presentable in the morning when there's a .1% chance the client's folks could show up for something, why the fuck does it matter?

""Food is not to be eaten here (control room)""

I sort of get it. Some of our subs have been pretty fucking stupid and nasty when it comes to this. Greasy ass hot wings? Take the shit out to the multipurpose room. But if I'm just munching on some chips or cookies or something (especially considering nothing is really open late due to COVID and what I would get, I'd have to pay delivery for. Not on my wage if I can help it.) and clean up after myself (which I have ALWAYS done)- why the fuck does it matter? What the fuck is this? Preschool? I'm not going to pay for somebody else's fuck ups, especially as an overnight. Oh, and even if shit was open, we really only get thirty minutes. How the fuck am I supposed to drive to a burger joint, wait in a drive thru line (or go in, but again, you can't really do that right now), enjoy my food and be back when it takes about half the time just to get there?

""When it is your turn to be in the Control Room, you MUST watch the cameras""

Again, that's fine. But you're fucking crazy if you really think I'm going to sit here and be militant for 4 out of the 8 hours watching an empty lot. Hell, the moment I see ANYTHING, it immediately catches my eye regardless of what I'm doing because as I've stated before, \*nothing\* happens. It's not like this is even the main campus, which would be more of a concern. In the 8 months I've been here, the most action we've seen at night are some stray cats and the occasional raccoon or possum.

I'm at the point where I really don't give a god damn if I get fired or pulled from the post. I started with good intentions, have always been 15 early, always provided detailed notes/DARs and my supervisor even told me I'm ""more diligent than most"" for whatever the hell it's worth, but this is kind of where I have to draw the line. I'm already depressed, burnt out and have thought about killing myself multiple times since the summer. I don't need this. Whatever happens, I'm glad I've been able to save close to 50% of my income and even more than that back when it was $14.50 because I grew up poor and know how to stretch shit when I need to.",False,kerkkb,GarlicOpossum,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kerkkb/fuck_this_job/,15,2

759,Congratulations?!? New Job?!? BEND OVER !!,"AFTER being laid off 10 months ago because of COVID.  I FINALLY GOT A NEW JOB.

This means I have to throw away 12 hours of my personal hours just to follow Rube Goldberg clearance form protocols. 

I have been working on returning background forms since 10am today, so nearly a 12 hour day.

I had to go over to a friends house across town to use their scanner and printer.  Not all of us can afford a scanner, printer, and a legal license for Adobe Acrobat Professional.

The scanner wouldn't scan multiple pages to one document and it would only scan to images (.jpg), not .pdf.  So I had to:

1. Print out each page.
2. Sign and date and fill out the forms with a pen.
3. Scan each of the 8 pages into individual .jpg image files.
4. Reassemble the images into their respective documents in Word (insert &gt; image &gt;etc). 
5. Then have Word save them as .pdf
6. Then had to zip them 
7. Then encrypt the zip file with a password.
8. Send the zip file as an attachment with a special naming convention.
9. Then send a separate email pointing to the zip file email I just sent with the password for the zip file.  

I swear HR of most businesses don't know how to use the tools of the trade.  In this era of Covid/telework, you would think that people would implement full use of .pfx files (personal information exchange) files for certified signatures and digital signing.  I believe the majority of ""HR professionals"" do not know an Adobe Acrobat pdf (portable document format) file from a piece of toilet paper.  AND GOD FORBID they got proper training in the use Adobe Acrobat to make legally acceptable and fillable forms.   So its on the backs of labor and the broke to come up with access to a printer and scanner and an Adobe Acrobat Professional license.  

This is fucking ridiculous.  I don't see how anyone can START a job much less deal with the incompetence of the people who are currently employed and holding the keys to you not being a homeless person!

Seriously...  if this doesn't work... I don't want or will not accept this job.  I've done too much already. 

The way I see it, they owe me fucking 12 hours of pay or leave already! 

This job already smells of me, doing everything the right way by the book and getting raped and fucked over for it.

771,"Venting. My girlfriend's dad and the ""get a job"" shaming.","This is just a vent, but it's the only place that seemed like a good place to post it. Maybe we can have a nice conversation, idk. My girlfriend and I recently graduated with our bachelors' degrees in May. Both of us worked our asses off throughout college - she worked throughout all 4.. and I worked throughout all 7.5.. (I switched majors and universities, took me a while to figure things out)... Anyways..

We were exhausted all the time. I worked more than she did overall and did more labor-intensive work and after a while I just wanted *out*. I developed ""work ptsd"", if you will, and feared having to work as much as I have for even longer. I've luckily found myself in a position where I can breathe for a second before moving forward, or until the following also happens to me. 

So onto my girlfriend. She's been tutoring online for a few months now and, honestly, has been doing pretty well for what it is! She's gotten private clients and it brings in decent extra money, alongside her savings. Unlike me, she has no student loans to pay back and we're both kind of just laying low for now and enjoying life for a minute... just a *minute to breathe*. 

Her dad just shamed her for not having a traditional 9-5 right now. It pissed me off, it gave me anxiety. What's the need? We're moving away soon anyway. We have some savings. There is literally *no* need for us to break our backs right now. I just get so pissed off at this kind of ""pick yourself up by the bootstraps"" mentality and how shockingly inhumane it really is.

Hey, everyone!

I've been unemployed since early May and while I'm looking for a job, I am lucky to not be in dire straits. My family keeps telling me to network, network, network, and I can't help but be annoyed by this.

Last year, I spent almost half a year looking for a job, mainly in Washington, D.C. I had some good contacts--a close family member who works in the field I wanted to pursue; a friend's sister; the son of a family friend; and a few people I had met through my job search who explicitly offered to help me. 

None of this worked in my favor, despite me being assertive yet polite and having a strong resume and experience and Master's degree in the field I was pursuing. I also followed up regularly but wasn't pushy and took the normal advice and added these people on LinkedIn.

At the time, I was desperate to find a job due to student loan debt and recently being kicked off my mom's insurance thanks to turning 26.

I wish more people would realize that while networking can be great to find a job, it can also work against you in allowing people--for whatever reason--to completely shut you out of your desired field.",False,kf96rm,glitter_cat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kf96rm/when_networking_can_work_against_you/,5,5

800,I finally quit.,"My (soon to be former) company was bought out at the start of the year. Mass layoffs happened and we lost our stock options. Then, when lockdown hit, our business jumped 500+%. Of course, staffing didn't grow at all. 

For 10 months, my team and I have been begging for some sort of change, more hiring, or anything to help fix such unsustainable conditions. Instead, the parent company has been slashing more benefits and laying more people off. 

Enough was enough. I put in my two weeks today. (I like my team and I don't want to dump my current workload on them, or else I would not have bothered with the two weeks.) I'm working toward a new thing, but I don't necessarily have anything else lined up. It's scary, yet I have no regrets. My mental health is more important than killing myself to maximize profit for a handful of greedy, evil, pieces of shit.

820,[RANT] I've come to some realisations about my relationship with work and that traditional jobs just don't work for me. I think the world of sex work is going to be a much more liberating and less degrading place.,"I'm sorry for the very long post, I've just got lots of feelings and need to put them out into a group of people who see things somewhat similarly to me. This is also kind of a work biography going through each of my jobs and how they ruined my faith in work.

Sex work has always been the kind of thing I've joked about doing but something that I'd never actually considered doing as a means to actually earn an income. Over the last few weeks though I've actually been thinking about doing it as a living, more specifically escorting.

I've grown up in a fairly middle class household, always having secure housing, parents having work, never needing to worry especially about money as a kid. I even ended up going to a grammar school (not through heavy tutoring or anything, I just showed up and got lucky on the test), I was always seen as a gifted boy. Then things began to not work out as well, I could never concentrate at school, I didn't do homework or anything like that. For GCSEs I did great, got plenty of A*s, but I got kicked out of school after my AS results weren't good enough. I just couldn't work in a classroom environment, I couldn't pay attention, I couldn't absorb information and I couldn't write large amounts. Something was just not right.

I then enrolled in a college to do an IT course, it was a BTEC or something like that, as I'd grown interested in computers and hardware in my time at home. I spent 4 months in that course then came to a realisation, I already knew all of the shit they were teaching, I then looked through the curriculum, I knew all that too (apart from programming but that was never my thing), so I just left the course. I'm not spending 2 years on a course that will teach me nothing of any use. 

I ended up just applying to jobs and apprenticeships, I ended up getting one with a little ISP doing tech support for customers. I actually enjoyed it for the first couple of months, then it went downhill, I on many occasions was the only person with technical knowledge in work at that time, having literally 2 months experience and being the sole tech person for 6,000 customers is not a fun time. I couldn't keep up with ticket writing or form filling, I couldn't pay attention enough, I'd forget customer names, but most of all... I was just so exhausted. I got let go after 4 months for turning up late after working 2 hours unpaid overtime the day before.

I began to think something was wrong with me.

At this point it was late November, so I decided to get a Christmas job in a Sainsbury's. There was basically no interview process or training. I sat in a room and watched a video for 3 hours, most of which was about things completely irrelevant to me. Then I was told to shadow someone for a few hours, they showed me how the till worked and that was it. Next day I was on the till, it was the most stressful job I've ever done. On my third day I had a panic attack on the till because there was a huge queue, I'd given someone the wrong change, I couldn't open the till until I'd finished with the next customer because stupid design, my line manager wasn't responding, the Christmas songs were blaring and the ""PLEASE PREPARE TO PUSH THE TROLLY OFF THE END OF THE CONVEYER"" announcement had been going on for 3 hours. I had a panic attack on the till.  I turned up the next day to resign. I had physical symptoms from that day for nearly an entire year.

I knew something was wrong, I spent ages online looking through things to see what was wrong with me. I found it, autism. It fit perfectly, it explained everything and after a year long process I got a diagnosis. High-functioning ASD. That was it, there was no support, no therapy, no help. Just a piece of paper and an information booklet which was just an NHS website printout. 

During this time period I found another job, working in a little computer repair shop. This was a job I genuinely enjoyed, at least for a while. It started with me just going there for a few Saturdays to see if they liked me and to learn some stuff. After a couple of months I got offered a contract. I worked part time and enjoyed it, problem solving and all that stuff has always been enjoyable. It was still exhausting though, lots of killing time while trying to look busy and all that stupid shit.

(((TW: ABLEIST SLURS, SUICIDE)))

Then one day, the owner didn't come in. After I had said goodbye to him on Saturday, he went home and hung himself. I still don't know why or if I could have helped in any way, but he was a genuinely lovely guy. Then the old owner took back over, the entire atmosphere changed. Imagine a UKIP voter and Del Boy were one person, that was him. One day I took a call from the advocate for an autistic guy, asking if there was any chance of doing some work experience or volunteering at the shop, so I asked the boss, who said ""Tell them I don't want none of those window-lickers in here"". That just hurt me so much, that was literally how I came to work there, just my uncle instead of an advocate. If he knew I was autistic like the old boss did, or the other member of staff did he would treat me exactly the same. Shortly after my contract ended, wasn't renewed and I left. 

The next and longest job I've had was working at a council as a Systems Engineer Apprentice. I have no idea why I still needed to be employed as an apprentice with over a year's experience doing this but that's besides the point, the pay was not that bad. I got paid the over 25s minimum wage, which was definitely an upgrade, although still not really enough to move out. The work was so empty it was crazy, I'd spend entire days sitting at my desk doing absolutely nothing, but still having to pretend to be useful and active. Most of my job was filling out forms, forwarding customer emails to suppliers, vice versa and deleting and undeleting social care records. On top of this, my apprenticeship was in software development, something I didn't do, and no-one on the payroll did, all software development and engineering was handled by external companies, so I couldn't do any paperwork on my apprenticeship. This was the point where my anxiety reached its peak, I'd spend 3 hours a day in the toilet at work trying to keep myself calm, the rest of the day I'd sit at my desk reading confidentiality social care records to give me something to do so I didn't go absolutely crazy. I broke laws on council property and invaded the privacy of vulnerable people so I didn't go mad.

I eventually got some therapy, CBT, which I had applied for before even starting work there. It didn't work for me, which is quite common among autists, so they thought of something which could help. They told me to do something I would never do in a million years, I went to a furry meet in the middle of London with hundreds of complete strangers. I'd never had any friends, no-one really liked me, but in that massive group of people I met some who actually cared about me and that has been the thing that has most changed my life for the better. However, there was still work. Work that exhausted me, meant 10 hour days, not having the energy to do anything on weekends. That was the issue that was holding down everything, my pointless job where I did nothing for 8 hours stressed out of my mind then drove an hour home so tired I regularly fell asleep at the wheel. 

I kept up that job for a year, until I had a complete breakdown when I had a realisation, I was transgender. The day of that, I drove into work, and then just cried in the car for 3 hours, one hour of which was on call to one of my new friends. Then I booked a doctor's appointment and drove home, still crying. I spent 4 months on paid sick leave, until it ran out, then I resigned. The shock of that and the stress of work caused a heavy and suicidal depression.

The depression lasted about a year, I blew through all of the money I'd saved, my parents bailed me out of £1k of credit card debt. But for that time, despite my depression, I had a really good time, I was free, I didn't have to spend the entire week in a shitty office, I could see people, I wasn't locked down to staying at home the entire time, I could spend a day or 3 round a friend's house. It was wonderful. The worst shit my chemically imbalanced brain could throw at me couldn't come close to a desk job.

My favourite times during all of that was being intimate with people, it wasn't even the sex or the sensations or anything like that, it was just being wanted. Having someone find me, attractive and get off and have a good time because of me, is just amazing. There were even times I was with someone who I wasn't even really attracted to or who they were wasn't appealing, but I would still suck them off or have them fuck me because making someone feel that good is beautiful.

Then the lockdown hit, everything stopped, I've seen a friend maybe 5 times since February and that's my ace best friend (love him). There are two good things to have come out of lockdown for me. The first was the extra £20 per week in UC, that's allowed me to start HRT privately and results are beginning to show though very nicely. 8 months in now and I'm so much happier in my own skin. Secondly, time to think, think about what I want to do and where I want to be. I've had an idea for a long time about doing a computer repair business, fixing PCs for old people either in their home or at my home. I'd actually been doing this for a bit before the pandemic, I could never find much work in it though, making under £100 most months and I can't see it getting much better. Even if I did get more work, I would end up spending so much time doing stuff it would just be far too much work for me, I'd get exhausted again.

I then just one day randomly entertained to idea of becoming an escort, and I figured out it would actually suit me very well. I'm pretty attractive, I always have been tall and lean with very clear skin. I'm perfectly okay with weird and wonderful kinks (I've done ABDL and all sorts of other strange crap with people, I like to please :3). I'm a trans woman, that gives me somewhat of a niche (also having a niche as opposed to being denied jobs would be a fucking god send). What I've been doing is literally going round strangers houses when they call me, just with a bag of screwdrivers not a bag of condoms and sex toys. I love to make people feel good and get people off. I love people finding me attractive. I would get to control when I work and with who. I wouldn't have to work extremely long monotonous hours.

I know there are downsides, mainly around safety, but that is just far too many benefits to give up. I just want to be able to live in a house or flat without working stupid hours and having someone else own me and be stressed out at a desk all day.

830,Does anyone else just not care about stopping shoplifters/preventing theft anymore? The real theft is capitalist greed.,"This pandemic has done a number on me and made me see how fucked up the capitalist system is.

I work in a department store and just don't care anymore. I'm expected to be super passionate about catching would be thieves since ""theft has been rising"", but a huge reason theft is rising is because people are fucking desperate right now. Yeah, you still get the well dressed high school girls stealing false eyelashes, but most of the theft I've been turning a blind eye to lately? Things like diapers and kids clothes and office supplies for home schooling. I pretend not to notice anymore. People are fucking desperate. I no longer have any desire to ""catch"" someone concealing a box of diapers in their stroller or only scanning every second notebook while their 3 kids are with them. I don't want to ruin the life of someone with a shoplifting charge for trying to provide for their kids.

The real theft is capitalist greed. The place I work for steals my labor by expecting me to stay back without pay for as long as it takes to work out why there are register variances and tells us to be patient with people still wandering the store 5 minutes after close. I don't get paid for any of that, my wage is shit to begin with, but I'm meant to care when someone steals a $2 notebook for their kid for online schooling?

I'm done with caring. My employer treats me like crap. Take what you want, thieves.",False,kg479x,n0fucksleft2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kg479x/does_anyone_else_just_not_care_about_stopping/,47,22

848,I hope you find the strength to carry on,"I spend some time lurking across different subreddits, mostly by accident, but usually falling under the net of ""ideas I don't agree with."" For the most part, I can often entertain ideas without immediately accepting them, but visiting this sub and seeing the posts and comments gave me a dreadful feeling. I'm terribly sorry for all of you out there who feel like giving up, who hate the products of this world so vehemently that it led you here.   


I know nothing about you all and I know too that I shouldn't be presumptuous. But the posts I've seen have been nothing short of nihilistic doom and gloom, under the facade that this outlook relates to the capitalist system and the bastardization it creates. Now, that much is undeniable, that terrible things have resulted due to the system of wealth and the way it operates, but so too can be said of any system of economics. To work is to produce inequality, and therefore there will **never** be equality, no matter the system or any attempts at abolishing them. It seems to me, and again, **correct me if I am wrong,** that this sub has acted more as an attempt to vent your anger at the world and your own status rather than a legitimate cry to abolish work.

Work has not been an abomination for me personally. My job has been as a self-employed videographer and I've loved every second of it. I get to make my life's work telling the stories of others, and it has been an endlessly enriching experience that I cannot imagine going on without. I don't let my work define me as a human being, because I have other interests outside of what pays the bills.

Perhaps my message may fall on deaf ears, and in truth, I'm not even sure exactly what my message is. It is a combination of pity, sorrow, and optimism in the face of adversity. I know one thing for certain, and that is that if it is true and you are suffering as much as some of these comments have lead me to believe, wallowing with others in pitiful situations will do little to remedy the problem. I am but an internet stranger for whom you'll suffer no real world consequences for lashing out at, however, so deal with me in whatever manner you see fit.

I'm so sorry for the states some of you are in, I cannot imagine what led you here and what you must be going through. The world may be fundamentally broken, but it is worth living in I promise.

I'm not sure). 

With any luck, my friend's dad will be able to beat this and live for many more years. He is also not one of those guys who put off really living waiting for retirement (thank God).

I work for state govt. for a while now as a public servant. When covid shut us down, began working remotely for three months with a week heads up to prepare in a very heavily paper based environment setting us back months more than we already were. Still teleworking 50% of the time, some weeks even more. 

Both supervisors have recently started calling me and another girl (very small unit, the only two below them before the clerks/part time people) out on our work. They are disappointed we are backed up on job duty 1 of 7. But when there’s hundreds of things to process and a million job duties one is BOUND to get pushed to the back burner. Dropping the ball lately on so many things because of being assigned random emergency tasks from them that I can’t even do my own job duties. Been promised for nearly 10 months now it’ll get better and if anything, it’s even worse.

I’m non confrontational normally and over explain myself in normal situations bc I hate being perceived wrong more than anything but now me and the other lady both just... blank. What’s the point. They keep saying they understand it’s crazy but... when there’s more and more snide comments about “this could have been done weeks ago” or “disappointed you haven’t caught up” what’s the point. Like yes, it definitely could have. But it’s so crazy and the caseload is so unmanageable for such few employees things get pushed aside or fall through the cracks. It’s inevitable. 

Going back to the private sector isn’t ideal. Healthcare, time off and union safety here is too ideal. I’d only leave if was self employed and made enough to make all of that worth leaving. Working on it.. but it may be a while. I’d transfer or accept a promotion elsewhere in govt but at this point idek if they’d give me a good review even tho I 100% deserve it.

Long story short, someone give me hope that I should stop dragging my feet and start working towards a happier career.

871,"Deleting LinkedIn as a ""Professional"" is one of the better things I've done this year","Cross posting these thoughts I had on nosurf. 

I was furloughed in April and the company was going through troubles/bankruptcy/turn over, so I was constantly checking for any  news. Then they just dumped a shit ton of us finally the last day of  August.

I kept checking and saw so many people get jobs without what seemed  like any issues. I also saw posts from people at the company who got  lucky enough to keep their job. Hence why it was like borderline  masochistic unhealthy for me. 

Other reasons for deleting is is that it was 100% unhelpful for me.  No connections ever lead to jobs. Nothing ever panned out. Maybe it works for some people.

1) I paid for a year's worth of premium to waste my money on finding  out how many fucking weird guys were just creeping on my profile  MULTIPLE TIMES. I'd message them calling them out professionally and  nicely. Something like Hey, noticed you looking at my profile MULTIPLE  F\*CKING TIMES, is there a position you have open that you think I'd be a good fit for?

I'd never get a response. Lol.

2) I recently tried fooling around with privacy settings and stuff,  which many of the options defeated the point of having linkedin, anyway.  

3) I wasn't comfortable with people being able to know all of my  academic and work history. There was a privacy setting to let people not  see this, but like I said, kind of defeated the purpose.

4) I believe having a portfolio website is a lot better than  LinkedIn. I have control over it, and creating a website can be more  unique and interesting than having a LinkedIn. I also get control over  my privacy... because it's going to go on my business card or my resume.

5) Lastly, the amount of bullshit I see on facebook had stunk up my  entire LinkedIn feed, making me feel like this is literally just  facebook 2.0 with all of my employer and academic history. A crap ton of  Trump, anti-vaxx, COVID is a hoax bullshit. Also really amusing to see  how many older idiots post this stuff WITH ALL OF THEIR WORK HISTORY AND  THEIR ACTUAL COMPANY ON THEIR PROFILE?? LOL.

2. If you took $100 from the cash register of your job, you would be arrested. If your company shorted your check by $100, they would face little to no punishment.

A part of them must know how dangerous the virus is, despite how deeply in denial they may be.

But that's not the point I'm stuck on anymore. Now I'm just sad. Why are so many people willing to die and put others at risk just for one, single holiday? They are willing to DIE for the opportunity to spend some time with family. My SO and I cancelled our holiday plans with his parents and his mom just...deflated. Fought us on it for a little bit. Told us to let her know if we change her mind. I know she's still hoping we will. Even before covid stopped us from seeing them, we could rarely get the time off work to go visit without compromising our jobs, so I can see why Christmas means so much to her.

The only ones left are my sister and I and due to some old family shit , she wanted nothing to do with figuring everything out so it was all left on me. My mom died on a Saturday and I needed to take last week off because I live an hour away and had to go clean out her apartment , go meet with funeral homes in the area , go to her bank to close it out and make endless fucking phone calls. There was maybe one day last week that I was home and it was that following Monday because I was a mess. I had to make a gofundme to even be able to get enough money together to have a small service for her because my sister and I are 30 and 33 years old and don't make enough money for any of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with this job for about 3 years. It's a very small company that does small business loans. I was hired on as my boss's assistant underwriter. Knew nothing about this industry but i'm a quick learner and figured it out. We don't have sick days or vacation days. We just kind of get paid for any days we need. I rarely ever take days off and usually just take a week vacation a year. This year was completely different for me ( just like most other people). Company closed down in the beginning of covid for about 2 months. I took my week vacation in July. Had to have surgery in September which I needed a week off from. Somehow got fucking covid mid November and obviously had to be out for that which technically was only a total of 6 days from actual work days. Everything else landed on the weekends/holiday. And then my mom died. I had last week off and had her services yesterday and Wednesday. Now I understand I had a lot of time off this year , most of which was out of my control but to tell me you can't pay me for a full week after my mom dies and a week before the holiday? That's fucking disgusting. When I first started this job I told him I wanted to be with a company with more opportunity. He told me that would happen. It hasn't. He won't let me get into sales so I can actually make money because "" most people get discouraged by a woman salesmen"" . Yes , i know , he's a sexiest capitalist POS. I stayed with this job for as long as I have because it's close to my apartment and it's easy. I already live paycheck to paycheck and the kicker is he knows that. It's taking everything in me to not walk the fuck out of this place right now. I can't wrap my head around how someone could lack so much compassion. This man not only owns this entire company which makes millions of dollars but he also owns fucking properties and rents them out. There are about 6 total employees that work here.

Your not really allowed to have an opinion at work, or get upset/react/be offended to any frustrating, stressing or otherwise emotion inducing situation.

These places expect you to be happy and smiling 100% of the time.

I look at how there is an issue in the US with drug abuse, alcohol abuse, people needing to smoke weed to feel ""numb"" and spouse or other verbal/physical abuse.

Work requires you to ""keep everything to yourself"" and bottle up your emotions. The issue with that, is that it's downright terrible on your mental health. 

Humans are biologically meant to get angry, upset, sad, etc within reason. We are an emotion drive species.

Keeping all that under your hat at work, blocking out all kinds of bullshit, CAN NOT be good for you.

951,"It sucks when people get mad at me for shit the corporation I work for does, but I get it.","I work for a callcenter through an interimoffice. And that callcenter does, amongst other things, technical support for a major telecom provider.

So when a customer calls me and gets agitated about something, it sucks and it stresses me out. Because I don't even work for the company they're calling me to complain about. There is very little I can do within the software I'm given to help them; if that software works at all, and if our so called ""experts"" I can contact are actually online and give me decent advice.

On top of that, the callcenter only cares about number of calls per day, average time of the call and the amount of sales I do. They don't care about quality help, about actually making the customers happy and helping them out with their internet when they're working from home during a pandemic.  
It's not their customers, and they just want good numbers to show to the telecom provider to keep the contract.

If I spend too much time on calls to try to actually solve the issue, you get scolded for it. I do it anyway because I don't care about the job, nor the companies I work for, but that's gonna cost me my job eventually.

Several times already, people have started breaking down crying from pure stress while they were calling me, because if their internet wasn't fixed, they could lose their jobs or fail their exams.  


So yeah it sucks that people treat me as a proverbial tree to piss against, someone to yell at, but I've started just explaining how I am an external worker, I don't work for the company, and there is not much I can do and that I 100% get their frustration.

Lets say you're making $40/hour and an intern is making nothing and someone else who does about the same job as you is making $30 and yet another is making $50. That intern (please never intern, you're a sucker) is doing a much lesser job probably, but the others just negotiated wrong at the interview, and I want to help the $30 person make more but only if they dont take it from me, if they're doing enough work to pay for that raise, and I wait a raise if I'm doing $50/hour of work. But maybe they can only afford to pay an average of $40/hour for 3 of that thing getting done, so maybe I'm being paid fairly but the $30/hour is being taken advantage of by the $50/hour who are both doing the same work as me, so it seems that the underpaid could negotiate to get some of the money of the overpaid, but the overpaid might just leave the company. Thats not for the company to decide who leaves and stays and who makes what offers to continue working for how much money at what times, unless they've signed a contract to keep their pay constant for a certain time range, and even then it helps to know the market when renegotiation time comes.

975,Why do people accept their exploitation?,"I have to vent about something that happened at work today, and was wondering if someone could help me out with something.  Something set my supervisor off, someone not doing their job right *(for the record it wasn't me - this time).*  And then they went on a mini-rant in front of the dept.  To paraphrase, it went something like this:

*""I was raised with strong work ethics!  I raised my kids that way.  You show up, you work your butt off, you're getting paid to do a job, not screw around.  And if you can't do that, you get the boot and find someone who will.  Unfortunately, not everyone thinks that way.""*

I've gotten to know this supervisor over two years.  She's conservative, authoritarian *(though she tries to hide it behind a cheery demeanor that I see right through*), submissive and deferential to authority.  And loves working for working's sake a little too much.  Why are people so fanatical about their work ethic?

Is it religion?  Is it generational?  Is it a lack of education?  Is it fear?  Is it psychological?  Political? Cultural?

The saddest part is how overworked she is, and how she's been at the company for decades.  Getting to the end of her career.  She'll never break the glass ceiling.  Lives in a small house with a small yard and an above ground pool.  Drives a crappy car.  Never takes a moment for herself (whether because she can't, or to show how strong her work ethic is, could be either.)

Her boss's house looks modest from the street, but then looks like a McMansion from behind (I scoped it out using Google Earth - what can I say, I get easily bored).  In-ground pool.  When she retires, nobody's going to remember she ever worked there in a year.  I've seen it happen to other employees.  They're thrown a retirement party, and no one ever speaks of them again.

It happened today  morning (11 hours ago from the time this is being posted) and lasted  just for a few hours before the protesters blocking the entrances  dispersed. There was no police brutality and no arrests. The protest  generated a huge traffic jam and I'm sure it caused enormous losses for  Amazon, because everything stopped for the workplace for a few hours.  Here's a link to a news site, I'm sorry for it being in Polish not in  English but I'm tired.

993,The end of dreams.,"Wrote a piece of prose. Not quite poetry. 
A collection of thoughts? 

Anyhow I figured the humans here would understand. 


*And that's what adulthood is*


“You can do anything you want to!” they tell their six year old.

But now he’s 30 and crying alone at night.

Cause he’s on EI and running out of weeks.

Exhausted physically.

Exhausted mentally.

Praying for apocalypse--at least then he could do something.

Something with finality, instead of this slow-moving-hell.

 

Shoot, or be shot;

run from the zombies &amp; aliens—or be bitten, captured, or killed.

Yes or no, off or on, dead or alive.

He can deal with those;

It’s the in-between that’s hell.

Where you’re expected to carry on like everything is fine, despite a lack of resources that everyone denies and no one in control chooses to remedy.

 

His parents said he could do whatever he wanted when he grew up.

No one told him how hard it would be, to do what he wanted.

 

They tell you that one day you’ll be able to follow your dreams.

Then you get older,

And they tell you after enough stepping stone jobs you’ll be able to afford to go to school to learn to do what you want for a job.

But then you’ll need to pay off debt.  

And go back to school in 5 years when your field dries up. (If you can afford to go back).

 

Your whole life revolving around that four word question:

What do you do? (to validate your existence, to pay for your housing and food, to earn your place in a world you had no choice in joining).

 

Right now you don’t know what you want to do.

You just know you don’t dream of labour.

You dream of meadows and forests.

Of the woods and lakes and free dental care.

 

It’s a pipe dream, they tell you.

 

They don’t tell you crises can happen at any time.

They don’t tell you paycheques don’t keep up with inflation.

They don’t tell you that you need savings to be able to safely make changes in your life,

so you can leave that job you hate and try something else.

They leave out that to save money; you need to make enough money to cover all your expenses safely, first.

 

They don’t tell you that getting a degree in English doesn’t make you instantly a writer who gets paid enough to survive--- but that sports stars and movie stars will always earn millions.

 

They don’t tell you that movie productions and sports  get cancelled in a global crisis,

but the 28 year old dude working at Walmart is expected to keep working.

That oil companies get billion dollar bail outs and the 16 year old working at Dollarama is expected to get by on $14.25 an hour during a pandemic.

 

They’re so essential, so desperate, we can just exploit them.

There will always be people willing to put up with abuse to earn a roof over their head, so we don’t need to pay them.

But no one says that.

 

They don’t tell you that from the dawn of civilization, suffering has always been here,

And despite ebbing and flowing in amount, type, and quality; it’s never gone away.

 

They just keep telling you that if you try hard enough you’ll succeed.  

 

They don’t tell you that you’ll have to break yourself mentally and physically just to get there.

How much self-brainwashing is needed to “go to work” every day.

They don’t tell you by the time you arrive at “success”—

if you arrive—

you’re so tired and burnt you don’t even care.

You just want to sleep.

 

They tell their kids to dream, but adults who dare to vocalize their dreams,

they tell to sit down,

and shut up

and “just do your job! It was worse when I was younger!”

 

What happened to dreaming?

And when did it become an unreasonable goal to want to actually enjoy your life, sometime before age 45?

 

If life is all hard and terrible, why create children?

And if it has joy, and the children—

or the adults—

say they’re suffering, why do you cycle back to talking about how it’s still not as bad as it used to be?

How does that help them at all?

Don’t you realize that people don’t make up pain for fun?

That we would rather be enjoying existing, than complaining?

 

They tell you success, joy, it’s possible.

 

But when you try so hard to make it happen, and it still isn’t working;

when you can’t force yourself to turn off your brain or heart to pay for the roof over your head,

They blame you.

They call you lazy.

Or liberal.

Or socialist.

Or soft. (“Because “hard” (tough? Good?)  people don’t need free healthcare or a quality life! They just shut up and do what’s asked because….?)

Or whatever other word they turn into a slur to blame you for not being able to cope in an abusive system that depends on division, and depends on people being desperate and tolerating suffering.

 

They make it your fault for thinking differently. Like you’re the bad guy. The odd, unhealthy one.

 

But they told you to dream,

And somehow—despite everything—you never stopped.

 

When you were six, you dreamed of flying,

being a superhero.

Of discovering cool inventions.

 

Now at thirty, you dream of a Monday you don’t cry on your way to work,

a day where you won’t need to apply for more jobs,

a morning where you don’t wake up upset to still be alive,

an afternoon where you don’t wonder if you’ll run out of money before the 30th,

a grocery store trip where you don’t have to calculate the taxes perfectly before you even leave your house.

 

See? You still dream.

 

The difference is, now you know dreams only come true when you’re asleep.

 

And that’s what adulthood is.

I feel guilty for wanting to write because I won't earn money with that

often daydreams about writing novel, have several ideas in my mind, watch video and books about
writing, etc.

That makes me feel guilty, because I know it is not possible of make a living writing books, not even
make a decent side income. To I feel I should be using that time on something that would help me
make money.

Of I didn't had to work or, at least if I was financially independent and owner of my own time, I would
have written a novel.

1004,This stuff actually works if you are stressed out at work.,"I don't smoke, and my family has a history of alcohol abuse, so I only drink maybe once a month.

I've been trying to find something that removes stress without making you drowsy or tired. 

I could be put on something like Xanax, but that makes people drowsy from what I've heard. 

I did some research and got a bottle of this stuff at Walmart. It has a lot of good reviews which is nice, because a lot of this kind of shit does absolutely nothing. However there are plenty of studies on it, and they have used it in India for hundreds of years.

Not only does it relive stress, it also calms you down, which makes you less likely to get pissed off as well.

I'm sure some of you smoke weed, which is fine. However weed is expensive and illegal here, and I've always been the type of person who could be the only one arrested in a room of 100 people smoking from a bong. 

Weed also well..makes you stoned, and where I work that would be extremely obvious.

1018,Cant get myself to do my school work,"Its really hard for me to invest any time into school work. Whenever i try have to think about how fascinating the fact im alive is and how i'm gonna die one day. I cant get myself to sink hours into some assignment supposed to teach me information im not interested in, never gonna be able to apply and will have forgotten in two weeks time. Even if its small things like an essay i usually keep postponing it to later and later, keep doing other things until i get too tired  and just go to sleep. Rinse and repeat daily. Very rarely i can find the motivation to commit to small tasks, and while i do them i feel crushingly depressed all the while. Feeling like a sheep for doing these aimless tasks which aren't really accomplishing anything, so i tend to avoid doing them. This is a huge problem as im in my final year and being peppered with assignments left and right. Multiple teachers have told me they're gonna fail me unless i hand in some work but i cant catch up with a single one.

For some context, i used to be an A student for the largest part of my school career. I used to spend a normal amount of time studying, always tried to do all of my homework, never skipped. During that time i was suffering from severe depression and thought about suicide daily. When i think back to that time, i remember everything being black and white, or in gloomy grayish colors. I woke up no matter how tired i was, usually fell asleep on the bus home. Didnt talk to people, had no sense of hapiness or humor. But it didn't bother me at the time. I had just accepted that that's how it is. I guess thats how depression works, it becomes a part of you and one almost falls in love with it like an abusive relationship to the point where you hide it and reject all help. Thinking back it had never even occurred to me that how i was feeling wasnt normal. I was pretty much blinded by all the ugly and misery, completely covering up everything thats beautiful in life.

Skip forward a couple years i've now discovered psychedelics. Boom, like an explosion of colors holy shit. A series of psychedelic experiences started opening my eyes. Imagine a blind person who wakes up and can see for the first time, feeling like a million bucks that was me. And gradually i shifted into what you'd consider a normal person. Feeling the full range of emotions, making close friends, developing some social skills and humor, the whole thing. So i start skipping school, focus on my passions more, started exploring consciousness and human nature, let go of all my worries and change my entire perspective on life. And that literally cured my depression. I haven't felt it (intense and chronic like i used to) in years now and i dont miss it. Every day now im amazed at how intricate and fascinating our universe and the culture of us humans as one is, it absolutely baffles me. Just wow.

I get that suffering is part of life. In our current system you just have to get a job and put in the work so you can have all the good stuff. But whenever i waste longer amounts of time doing my assignments it feels like the most unnatural thing to me, it kind of goes against my essence. And thats my dilemma im worried ill end up dropping out of high school in final year but i also dont wanna put any effort into it.",False,kd97ep,x_pineapple_pizza_x,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kd97ep/cant_get_myself_to_do_my_school_work/,6,1

'I worked twenty times harder when I was their age!'

'Boohoo I can work three jobs at the same time!'

'Just quit lmao.'

I absolutely cannot wrap my head around this insane boomerific mindset. Why the fuck do people like this need to try and turn 'shitty working conditions' into some kind of stupid competition? Is it just some sort of egotistical backpatting, for some fictitious hardship that they never endured?

Nobody wants to hear it. Nobody needs some self-congratulatory bullshit from someone who bought a three bedroom house for twenty bucks and a bag of onions before the market cratered. And assuming there's even any validity to their horseshit (there isn't), something being easy for an individual doesn't mean everyone can do the same.

And for the 'just quit' crowd, I think it's safe to assume nobody gets into such a dreadful line of work by *choice.* Nobody goes through college thinking 'wow I can't wait to graduate and suffer modern serfdom in a factory.'

[Hi ho hi ho it's off to work we go.](https://youtu.be/HI0x0KYChq4)

And

[Just whistle while you work.](https://youtu.be/mIwa9sPFT5I)

Both of these songs have a particular theme in mind, work and sing while doing it. Work, and have a cheery attitude about it. Like, what is this message? Don't tell me what kind of attitude to have about my work.

The second thing to note about these two songs is that they put the genders in their place. Men make the money, women do the housework. That's a great lesson for the kids.

Another thing to point out is that this is coming from Walt Disney of all places. Walt Disney animation at least from the beginning has been a male dominated field. Men would do the sketching and line work of animation and women would do the coloring. If those women were too old to color in the lines, they would get fired. They were not given the creative work of deciding the movements of the characters but instead had to just color in the lines as they were told to do.

Were they singing while they were working? Or did they have to learn their place as the fairer sex?

**""Are you a team player?""**

Ah yes, let me develop interpersonal relationships with my co-workers, who probably don't give two shits about me and won't be around in 3 months. 

I'm also 100% sure any company that requires you to work with others makes it mandatory, so that's not really even a valid question. 

**""Are you motivated?""**

Yes, I am motivated by the sound of my alarm which indicates I must be exploited for the next eight hours, in order to fulfill my life's goal of having a full stomach and not living in my car. Next question.

**""Why do you want to work here?""**

Because in order to exist, it requires large amounts of currency, which I am trading for in exchange for you presiding over me for 2,000 hours per year. 

**""Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?"".**

This has to be the absolutely DUMBEST question you can ask a candidate. No one is going to admit they are working here until something better comes along.

1069,Time theft: unethical or a way for employees to claim what they’re rightfully owed?,"Time theft occurs when you use company time to handle personal matters. It is considered unethical, but is it? None of us are paid enough, but there is little we can do about it. We have to work to survive, and people love to remind us: “You should be grateful you have a job.”

Should we be, though? Should we be grateful we are worked 8+ hours a day for close to 51 weeks out of the year? Should we be grateful that our lives are slipping away in front of our eyes working for a company that sees us as little more than a number? Can you even put a price on your life?

Now that we’re working from home, it’s easier than ever to steal your employer’s time. I do it every day. I get groceries, smoke weed, clean, do laundry, etc. all during the workday. While nothing can possibly make up for the precious days of my life I’ve lost at a dead-end job, it does give me a little bit of my power back.

1081,Your Mental Health or Access to Health Insurance - Pick Your Own Adventure,"The current organization of labor mandates that people be indentured by their mere material needs for existence, of which for the majority, can only be filled by the wages levied by capital owners. That notion in itself is tantamount to an unspoken hostage-like situation, this context is made all the more egregious being that wages remain largely stagnant, or in some cases decrease in accord to reoccurring downturns in the economic cycle. This puts working people in situations where they must frugally prioritize their needs, being forced to forfeit otherwise vital components of their well-being. It is sickening to me how many people must rely upon their jobs for access to healthcare, or to be specific, access to services that mitigate the debt accrued by being treated here in the U.S. 

Not only does the very basis of this system incur suffering, that suffering is utilized to generate profits - an endless game of creating instability and selling inadequate solutions of which only serve to indebt those they're made to ""help"". This has been on my mind a lot recently as my mother has been going through a lot of unneeded turmoil at her workplace (thanks to trumpers who refuse to take the pandemic seriously), but feels she cannot leave as her job provides our entire family with a health care plan. Just the idea of anyone having to consider this trade off makes me so fucking angry. 

I'll be 26 in two years, its only a matter of time until I feel her struggle, or become massively indebted if I have health issues and cannot afford a plan.

1089,"""Assistance"" programs can, and often are, designed to protect capitalism, not people.","A lot of people, understandably, post from the perspective of either someone in the work force for a while or someone just entering it. I would like to offer my perspective on the assistance programs that are supposed to help people, as I've been on disability for about ten years at this point. (In a country with what most would assume to be a robust and comprehensive social safety net: Canada.)  


They often sound great in theory. Poor or disabled or just having trouble finding a job? Get free money monthly from the guvment! Sounds awesome right? The people on them are typically looked at with either jealousy for not having to work, or more commonly, extreme disdain, for, you guessed it, 'being a lazy leech'.  


Well it would be great system, if helping poor and disabled people was their actual goal, but I'd call any help they give a happy accident of their true goal.  


In reality that stereotype of the 'lazy leech' is often what assistance programs are BUILT on, they are designed to \*preserve the workforce\*, and to encourage work \*REGARDLESS OF HOW ABUSIVE, EXPLOITATIVE, DESTRUCTIVE, OR EVEN DEADLY IT IS\*.   


How do they do that? By building the ENTIRE assistance system around helping as few people as possible, as little as possible. By being SO difficult to both apply for and survive on that even the worst workplace starts to look like an improvement. THAT is their goal. To FORCE people in need to work, as many as they possibly can. 

From the moment you begin the application process for those sort of programs you are treated automatically like you are trying to scam your way through at every possible point (for a whole 12k a year!). If you are trying to apply for disability in addition to basic assistance, they can deny you for virtually any reason they want, and they WILL in the hopes that you simply give up and don't appeal their decision. The only caseworker I've ever met that seemed to genuinely see how fucked up the system is was a trainee who told me to ALWAYS appeal if denied because he had seen people with BRAIN TUMORS be denied disability. 

Those that don't, can't, or won't work are simply made to survive on what little assistance they get as best they can, for as long as they can. I have been at \*significantly\* greater risk of homelessness \*after\* going onto assistance, because they will literally cut off your entire income with NO notice for ANY reason they want. They actively 'suspend' your entire income as a way to control you. The first month that I moved into an apartment, the property management had made a mistake on the copy of the lease I gave to assistance. Assistance suspended my income until the mistake was fixed. The property management took the ENTIRE month to fix their mistake (yet still complained I hadn't paid rent even after I explained I couldn't until THEY fixed THEIR mistake). Instead of my first month on my own being an exciting celebration of my independence, it was a month of extreme stress and hunger as I tried to stretch my fifty dollars over four weeks. Guess who actually showed me some kindness that month.   


The BANK. Seriously. When I finally got my income for the month the teller had told me that it was their policy to put a week long hold on the money so I explained my situation and begged her to release what I needed for rent. I almost cried when she not only agreed to do it but asked me how much I needed for food until the hold ended and I could access the rest of the money.   


I would actually be homeless multiple times over if not for other people stepping in to help where assistance refuses. (You can get assistance to help with a security deposit. Once. They expect you to use that deposit for every apartment you ever apply for forever. But you don't get your security deposit back until after you move out. And you can't move into some place new with out a security deposit. So if you ever have to move at all after the first time, you're fucked (AND even if you COULD access the security deposit before moving, every time a landlord or property management takes a chunk of it, you end up with the less for your next apartment and they pretty much always take a chunk). I've lived in four different apartments over the last ten years ONLY because I was able to get help outside of assistance for the security deposit. With out that help, I would be have been homeless two years into getting on assistance.  


So what if you get approved, then you get enough to get by right? Nope. When I first got on disability ten years ago, I got just barely below 1k a month. Ten years later, I get just barely over 1k. After my rent and bills I have maybe 30% left. Over half goes to rent, and I live in one of the cheapest big cities in the country, in the cheapest apartment I could find (the kind with drafty windows that drip water into the apartment when it rains, leaky pipes, mold, infestations and property management that chooses the cheapest solution to all of those problems, if they ever even fix them at all. I could probably find even cheaper and even worse if I went with a full blown slum lord managed building. I suspect that's my next stop when my rent gets too high yet again.)   


For the program where I live it is OFFICIAL POLICY for caseworkers to NEVER mention ANY available aid for ANYTHING unless DIRECTLY questioned about it. In practice that means I spent YEARS paying for my medications out of pocket before I learned that I could get help paying for them. But did they tell me how when I asked? Nope. They literally sent me in a circle. The person they told me to call only told me to call the person who told me to call them in the first place, and it kept going until I gave up. Turns out literally all I had to do was give my case number to the pharmacists. I found out by asking the pharmacy after getting no useful info from caseworkers for months.  


They are SO actively against actually helping people financially in any meaningful way that they will sacrifice THEIR OWN GOAL of getting people to work. My disability is due to multiple chronic and extreme mental health issues (LONG super depressing story very short: GARBAGE genetics/ GARBAGE birth mother/extreme neglect/regular childhood physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, have all left me MEGA fucked in the head to the point of being genuinely dangerous to those around me during my worst episodes. The last six months I've gone with out an episode is actually a record that I'm extremely proud of). When I tried to get a referral for a psychiatrist from my doctor, I was told he hadn't been able to get one for a patient in five years. When I asked assistance for help for paying for therapy with a non-psychiatrist (aka not covered by government healthcare), which I would need if I was ever going to be able manage my illness well enough to work, they said no. Because psychiatrists are already covered by the government. So I can't  see a psychiatrist, and I can't afford to see a non-psychiatrist, and I can't work with out therapy, and I can't get assistance to help pay for therapy, and I can't get a job to pay for therapy because I need therapy to get and hold a job.  


TL;DR: Universal basic income NEEDS to happen and it NEEDS to be livable. Punishing assistance programs that prioritize work and cost over actually helping people can be extremely damaging in their own right, likely end up costing even more due to constant appeals plus the health issues that come from the extreme stress and poverty they trap people in, and can even be so cost obsessed they become completely ineffective at literally their one and only actual goal of getting people to work.",False,ke0q5r,DIYDesperation,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ke0q5r/assistance_programs_can_and_often_are_designed_to/,9,1

He said that he didn't like living a normal life since you do the same monotonic job for 8-10 hours a day and you get paid for it and then get everything else.  


It got me thinking - could it be that our jobs are so miserable mostly because we're not wired to just sit down and do something for that many hours without a break? It's not only that we work our lives away, but it's about the work we do too. Say you wanted to get food - back in the day you had to go pick berries or hunt, or engage in some craft where you could trade products of the craft to groceries. You had to have farm animals or a garden. For warmth you had to chop logs etc.   


That's a lot of work, but the work is spread out in different sections and intervals and is also seasonal. Also, you used to do it for yourself, mostly, so no one was judging you for the most part, and there were no psychological abuse.

1095,"Thanks to scholarship, I got a bit of a taste of the privileged life in University. But now I'm a miserable tired wage slave who suffers suicidal ideations because she can't take 50 more years of this.","I got to experience a privileged life in college because I had a scholarship that covered my fees and my living expenses. Anything I earned at my part time student jobs was mine to keep and have fun with, and my scholarship didn't precent me from receiving a student allowance from the government.  

I was incredibly lucky during my studies to get various scholarships to study abroad as a student - one summer I went to Mexico, another year I went to Germany but got to travel around Europe with money saved from my part time job, and I also got to go to Korea the last year. I did a semester in England as an undergrad and a semester in Canada during my Master's. I always had something to look forward too and my summer break was always great - I got a few weeks to relax, went somewhere for a few weeks (and the courses were always pretty chill), came home and had a week to sleep and then school started again.

I loved it. I mean, University was always hard around exam time and when I had papers due, but it was only very temporary, and I was at least learning things that were genuinely interesting to me and hard work meant I got the reward of higher grades, not someone else. 

I'm now 2 years into wage slaving and am already nostalgic for a life I will never get to have back. My job is decently paying, but it gets eaten up pretty quickly by living expenses, I'm no longer learning interesting things - I'm basically a robot doing the same thing over and over and over again, I get paid the same whether I am super efficient or not, and while Australia's 4 weeks of annual leave would be a dream for Americans, it doesn't feel like much things like visiting family for a long weekend adds up and when you are used to getting to travel for 2 months of the year. I also resent having to ""fight"" for the time I want off. It's a lot more expensive to travel now I am paying my expenses, and I know I should be grateful for the chances I had in University, but I miss it a lot. I hate that taking a week off to just sleep and chill means a week less for family or a holiday. I miss how as a student, I always had chances to just chill out. 

I used to be able to sleep on the schedule that worked for me (2:30am-10:30am), I used to be able to take a nap if I had a shit night sleep because I wasn't being held hostage in an office for 9 hours a day by the time you add in lunch break. I didn't have to spend 40 hours doing my University work every week if it didn't take me that long. If I was smart and knocked it out in 15 hours, I got to ""log off"" for the rest of the week, not sit there anyway trying to look busy so I don't get given more work to do without getting any kind of payrise. I wasn't too tired to visit my friends on the weekend. I skinnier because I had time to work out.

Now? I'm always tired. I'm always cranky. I never want to do anything because I'm so exhausted and burned out. I have to try and force my body sleep from 10:30pm-6:30am, but even if I take supplements, my body refuses to shit out and use any melatonin until 2am. I'm constantly forced to operate on 4 hours sleep and then sleep all weekend to compensate, and then I feel sad my weekend was wasted. I have piled on weight because I don't have time to work out anymore and look for easy meals.

I hate this so much that I have suicidal ideations where I keep thinking about how I'd honestly just rather die than live the next 40-50 years of my life as a wage slave. If this is ""that's what life is"" as the boomers always say.....I don't want it. I'm fucking miserable and don't want it.

I was enjoying my covid vacations at home, enjoying the fact that my employer failed to find me a client before the pandemics hit and that the french law still protects jobs and I couldn't be laid off without a serious reason, when reality finally called back ...

One of my manager who has been with this client for 3 years called me, telling me he was at his wit's end, that if he did not get help soon he'd have to get a sick note from the doctor and stop working (again we're in France, he's genuinely depressed/anxious and the doctor's note will get him off work but still partially paid and employed). He knew the client wasn't a good fit for me (2-4h commute one way) but still asked me if I would consider coming.

Being the dumbfuck I am, considering a few wfh days a week, I would come and help him out.

Boy do I regret that decision everyday since ... the mission/client is an absolute mess. He's only willing to budget 1.5 full time equivalent, no more, despite clearly having work for some 4+ people easily.

Me being super junior in this job (was doing project management, now doing technical architecture), my colleague took it slow on me so I could learn, it looked promising, ... for a whole 2 weeks ... 

After those 2 weeks, all hell broke loose. I was told I needed to ""gain speed"" as in starting to generate momentum to take more and more projects ... multi million € projects, 2k+ users involved projects

I almost instantly felt overwhelmed, especially seeing my colleague work ridiculours hours, working nights and weekends. I wanted both to protect myself and leave a first written mark so I sent an email to my direct manager telling him that I couldn't see any future with this client, that the conditions were far from optimal to learn and despite the chance I got to see a bunch of shit I couldn't somewhere else it was affecting my health. Being clinically anxious/depressed, I've stopped properly eating and sleeping for a while now ...

Now we're 3 month after I started and boy, has shit turned worse ...

Friday before last I was phoned by the client responsible for reconducting our contract, he asked me what I thought about the performance of my senior, if I thought he could be replaced, if I thought he was at the end of his career here ... mind you it's the client asking me, a green junior, about the performance of my direct colleague, very very inapropriate

I'm in awe listening to him, understanding that they're looking for reasons to remove the dude who is holding the mission on his shoulders for the pettiest reasons, like him not being in the best of moods ... So I told him that it was probably the worst idea I heard in a long long time ... they removed him anywayn never asking one why his mood was this bad.

I haven't heard him so relieved and happy since I've arrived there.

AND HERE COMES THE SUPER PRIVILEGES; I KNOW I'M FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE PROBLEMS I AM ABOUT TO DESCRIBE

I want to leave this mission/client asap, as in yesterday if it was possible.

Trouble is the client is extremly happy with my performance, if you were to believe my manager they're singing anthems in my name, and therefore I have a world of trouble to get out of this situation ...

I called my boss today to ask for an ""amicable agreement"" to end our work relationship. What this kind of agreement would lead to is my employer would have to pay me the equivalent of ""lay off benefits"" (1/4 of monthly salary per year worked there, or about 1k€ in my case, fairly low) but more importantly I could sign up for unemployement benefits allowing me to take my time to find a new job. If I were to just straight up quit, I'd be left with no forms of income whatsoever and my saving aren't they healthiest they've ever been to say the least ...

And I got the answer I expected ""Why would we agree to let you go (and pay you for it) if the client is happy ?"" and no matter how much I explained that the client happiness came at the cost of daily struggles and pain for me it made no difference ... Why do I feel it's relevant here is because to me it yells ""you're still profitable, why would we let you go comfortably. We're going to make life a living hell for you until you got no choice but to quit"".

It's got me super depressed tonight ... having set the whole thing in motion, I need to see it through now. I guess I just hoped that they'd say yes and that both me and them would move on ...

My only choices now are to get up at 5AM to have time to work out (which means to get 8 hours of sleep I'd need to be in bed by 9pm) or wait until I get my kids down and somehow have the energy to start working out at 9pm.  Which after a full day, the last thing I want to do is start working out that late at night.  Plus I have to do all of the other things a normal adult needs to do in terms of responsibilities. 

It's just not fair.  It's not fair that I have to sacrifice something that is so fundamental to your health (i.e. sleep) for another aspect of my health.

I am at my energy peak around 10am.  I wish I could stop what I was doing and exercise then.  But I can't.  

I don't want to eat lunch at 12pm every day, I am hungry at different times depending on the rest of the day.  But that doesn't matter, I'm told when to eat.

We have a forecast of icy weather tomorrow and my kids (been doing part time in person school) have a delayed opening.  With the ""ease' of remote working now, our HR department sent out an email today saying that inclement weather is no longer a reason to delay working, and anyone working from home is expected to clock in first thing.

I'm just tired.  I'm tired of doing ""the right thing"" my whole life of school, college, and job and then reading article after article of athletes getting $100+ million dollar contracts and retiring in their early 30s.  I'm tired of reading about YouTubers making millions of dollars a year playing video games.  I'm just tired of having to sacrifice so many things that would make me happy and healthy just because I have a job that requires me to work 7:30am-6pm, and also be available for ""emergency"" calls/emails after hours and weekends.  We have weekly calls to tell management everything we do during the week, and it's become a badge of honor when someone says they went to customer sites on the weekends, or had an emergency call at 1am on a Saturday night.

Sorry for the rant, I'm just sitting on the couch taking a break because I was supposed to be exercising, but instead of I have more work I was sent that needs to be done by tomorrow morning.

as a child I was told by my parents that if I have good grades at school - I will get a great job and have a great life. 

So I did. 

I always did my homework, I always received good grades, I was the best of my class and then I went to get my degrees. 

I did well - in terms of being an obedient working bee. 

I never liked it. Never had much fun doing it. But I was persistent and had my goal in mind - getting a good job and having a good life. 

Now I am sitting in an office job fulfilling my ""tasks"". Crunching numbers, giving presentations, having meetings, driving long hours. 

Climbing the ladder one more step would make me need to:

- work till late in the evenings
- be available and informed 24/7
- work during weekends 
- work during vacations
- forgetting about mental health

1134,The oppressed end up oppressing,"This sub is a joke, acting like y'all have an ounce of logic. While it's just an echo chamber of ""work is bad"". I have come to realize that people's feelings is more important than facts on reddit. 

I'm asking a question and this random dude goes on about how this sub or whatever he was talking about but did not mention is the BIGGEST SOLUTION TO WORK. pulling feminism into it as well, ok. Nothing was proposed at all. And last time I checked, we're all still working. And someone else just wants to attack my username instead of telling me what is wrong with what I said. Ironically, his name checked out too with his response. And another dude wants to hop on the train before it leaves by commenting on a downvoted post so he can earn some last minute brownie points. ""Look at me and my smart remark, don't leave without me, I'm with you guys!"". What happened to discussing things? It's ridiculous how one question could attract all this and no progress was made at all.

How you wanna complain about being ""oppressed"" by the capitalist system and you end up doing the oppressing by using the votes system on reddit. Effectively manipulating who's wrong and who's right. The irony of reddit in general is too much to handle. The internet was right, people on reddit are fucked up. ""Your opinion is not mine so it's wrong"" ""Downvote him!"". Upvote the other guy even if he's wrong and we might give people the wrong impression and/or spread misinformation. At least he's not a dick like the one we downvoted. It seems like momma did raise a bunch of bitches. 

And you guys think you can come up with a sustainable solution that is supposed to be beneficial to all of us. You selfish validation seeking cunts out here on the internet act like it's for the betterment of the world instead of fullfiling your own selfish needs. You guys really think your way of thinking is revolutionary ""gosh, I don't understand how people can't understand our logic, it's so logical"". Gathering of the pseudo-intellectuals

1135,I constantly feel guilty asking for time/consideration when scheduling.,"Some back story: 

I live in the mountains. In late September to October the rain caused havock on the roads; major breakaways and landslides/blockages ensued at the same time I was starting my new job. 

At first I asked for some consideration regarding night shifts because it was really hard to see the road at night and I didn't want to fall into the river due to a major landslide that resulted in a breakaway. No consideration was given. 

After sometime I got used to the night driving and learned exactly how to maneuver so that I did not fall into the river. Then, more rains came and what started as a landslide that I thought would be blocked for a day turned into a two day block. Further up the road from the block the entire road brokeaway and you can't drive over it to this day. The other route from my house takes about 2 hours so I decided I would just go stay with some family. I get scheduled to work every weekend so I haven't been home since late October.  

Christmas is coming and I want to go home for at least Christmas. I felt like such an asshole asking for the day but I asked and I got that. 

Additionally, my supervisor has this terrible habit of scheduling people to work after a 8 hour break, for example you are scheduled 6am-2pm then 10pm-6am and that's all in the same day. So I jokingly asked her to stop doing that because it's a waste of time and gas and I would rather just double. She still schedules it like this but she also says you should tell her about scheduling needs before she does the schedule because she doesn't like when we switch with each other. 

I'm honestly very tired and I feel very guilty because it feels like I'm asking for so much. I feel like my life is an inconvenience to them and that it will eventually cost me my job if I ask for one more thing. It's so many moving parts and Ive been grinded to a pulp. 

Why is it always the bullshit jobs that give so much headache? This reception job does not need to be 24hrs not does it need to be open on Christmas. I literally spend 75% of my shift watching shows. I actually was able to binge 4 episodes of Walking Dead: World Beyond yesterday and finish up Emily in Paris. 

TLDR: Asked for consideration re night shifts because I have a hard time driving at night due to breakaways, then asked for Christmas and to not be scheduled with a 8 hour break between.

1147,YOU ARE A SLAVE,"Every day our lives get a little worse and we do nothing. Our freedom and life is slowly being chipped away as to not cause notice to most people, akin to a frog slowly being boiled in a pot.

We got rid of slavery 155 years ago, but ask yourself, are we still free today?

We can work or we can starve. The greener grass on the other side is slowly withering and dying. More and more jobs are turning into absolute bullshit.

No real pay, no real benefits, and an endless line of people ready to apply for your spot, ready to take a bite out of a corporate shit sandwich. 

They realize we are week, and we will continue to suffer until we rise up. They know our weakness and exploit it. 

You aren't lazy, or a complainer, you are exploited. You as a person is losing its identity. Your creativity and expression of your very soul is slowly being vacuumed out of you, until you become a husk, a number, a cog in a machine.

The slave was not free. He was bought and sold. You are being bought and sold as well, your life has a price on it, and its being paid for by the hour.

Slaves had owners. You have an owner. You make him rich in exchange for work. The only difference is the owner provided food and housing, yet you pay for those yourself. 

The slave could not leave. Neither can you. Everyone could walk out of Walmart at the same time, or the Amazon warehouse or some other large corporation farming you for your labor. 

But they don't, because if they leave, they are whipped. They are whipped with their need to pay rent or their mortgage, their food, their electricity.

You can tell yourself you are ""free"", but you are not. The shackles that bind you are invisible. But you can still feel them.

It's the dread when your alarm goes off, the feeling of despair when your rent is due and you have to scrape up what few pennies you have left to pay it. The hopelessness of knowing that nothing will change and you as well as everyone else has to accept it.

If you still truly think you are free, then stop going to work, stop paying your bills. 

You are given a very simple illusion of freedom. A small ladder which you can climb.

But you still cannot climb high enough to see over your owners wall, to see the wealth they have accumulated, the wealth your misery and toil provided for them. Wealth that would take you thousands of years to earn. 

You will never be your owner. You will never replace your owner. The illusion is just another whip, designed to keep you going, to trick you into thinking that someday if you work really hard you can be another owner. How very foolish of you to think that.

You are not a person or a human to them. You are a slave. A number. You are given ""benefits"" that only benefit them. They give you a few sick days a year so you don't make the other slaves sick. It's cheaper to do this rather than pay another slave to take your place. 

They don't even give you a pension anymore. The human life expectancy has grown, so they figure you can work for them much longer, up until your death. 

If you are lucky maybe you will get a piss warm slice of pizza on one Friday out of a year. They want you to feel loved you know. So you don't quit and become someone else's slave. 

But at the end of the day, your still a slave. It will only get worse. They don't care. They would gun each and every single one of you down if it added a million dollars to their bank account.",False,kbj6vp,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kbj6vp/you_are_a_slave/,4,1

You get up in the morning and plow through the same bullshit over and over again, day after day, year after year, until you are no longer deemed ""useful"". All for what? Another fancy product you'll be excited about for the next three minutes?

Rarely when I come across like-minded people, they compare it to slavery. I disagree. No slave in history was expected to be grateful for being a slave. What we have today is a modern ball and chain that is expected to be worn as a badge of honor. I refuse to feel lucky for having a soul-sucking, mind dumbing job that gives me no sense of meaning or satisfaction. But I plaster on a fake smile as I kiss the corporate ass or else, I'll spend the next month sleeping on a bench out in the cold. 

And then there are the bootlickers. Love toys of executives. They'd throw themselves out the window if Mr bossman told them so.

I am 20 and had to pick engineering to study, since the job i had a applied for went bankrupt a month before the semester thanks to covid.

I hate math and was never interested in it, i haven't met anyone of my co-students, i have never even been on campus yet because it is all online. I honestly feel like im just watching random youtube videos about engineering, because this sure doesnt feel like uni.

I wanted to study communication and public relations, but unfortunately the only way to study that is while working in a dual- concept. So i need to be hired by a company.

Now it just so happens that out of my 50 applications 25 have ghosted me and the rest was any form of :""we are too afraid to hire this year good luck tho"" 

I feel completely lost and my parents are going to kick me out if i dont have a save plan soon for my career. 

The anxiety about my future is getting really intense. i have no support from my family. I cant sleep, i barely eat, i feel like im shaking constantly and i can never relax.

1188,thoughts on anti-work,"So i’ve just started experimenting with anti work and I wanted to share my feelings.

i was abused as a child and lived in a house with alcoholism present, which later caused me to have depression, anxiety and eating disorder. i didn’t realize i was mentally ill until i was 24 or so which is right after i moved out. i guess you can’t heal in the soil that poisoned you. 

when i was a kid i genuinely loved school. i was the ambitious, tough competitive type who chased excellence and was passionate about the things i was learning. 

i find that my anxiety, fear of authority figures / wanting to people please from abuse and desire to be perfect make me completely stressed out about doing my job. i get so worked up and stressed out over work related things to the point that i just don’t want to work anymore. i am also working crazy long hours in a very fast-paced department. 

i’m also a socialist and i am so bitter and resentful that capitalism would rather see me on this horrible work treadmill than having time to rest and take care of myself. i also recognize that i am extremely privileged, because i do have gainful steady employment.

I remember in school asking the teacher to go over something again or try explaining it a little better so it ""clicks"". Most teachers just thought I wasn't paying attention or was distracted, but that was not true. Some teachers actually gave a shit and allowed me additional times to learn things.

So I've learned to just lie at work when it comes to my mental health. I keep it totally concealed. 

Just like as it was with school, my bosses/supervisors don't seem to care if I'm a little slow. They see it as an excuse, a cop-out to fail more often. 

I do my job well and put a lot of effort into it. I just cannot do it as well as others. If most people can make a 90% metric on something, I might only be 80%. 

Has anyone else here struggled with this? I think its absolutely ridiculous to set a base line for human performance and then anyone who is even just slightly under this, can be labeled as a failure, a reject, a lazy person, etc.",False,kbzf5v,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kbzf5v/has_anyone_had_to_lie_to_cover_up_mental_health/,8,1

1207,Truth!," “I do not particularly like the word 'work.' Human beings are the only animals who have to work, and I think that is the most ridiculous thing in the world. Other animals make their livings by living, but people work like crazy, thinking that they have to in order to stay alive. The bigger the job, the greater the challenge, the more wonderful they think it is. It would be good to give up that way of thinking and live an easy, comfortable life with plenty of free time. I think that the way animals live in the tropics, stepping outside in the morning and evening to see if there is something to eat, and taking a long nap in the afternoon, must be a wonderful life. For human beings, a life of such simplicity would be possible if one worked to produce directly his daily necessities. In such a life, work is not work as people generally think of it, but simply doing what needs to be done.”

As much as I know I need to force myself to sleep at a responsible time, and that if I did so I'd feel better emotionally, there seems to be an overarching anxiety that's preventing me. I've come to realize, I think its a way I cope - its a way of desperately trying to suckle every last second of the free time I have after work even if I'm just sitting in my computer chair on YouTube. Its a response to knowing then when my eyes close, the next time they open I am immediately subject to a 10 hour work day of which I absolutely despise.   


Anyone else ever feel like this? Usually I feel anxiety over not going to sleep early enough, but as of late when I notice the clock is nearing 12 I just don't care, my mind goes ""fuck that, I'm going to enjoy this while I can""

It’s honestly infuriating that people think like that.

And whenever I point it out that people shouldn’t need to work - he says that I’m making a privileged statement because most people can’t just leave their jobs. And I say they should be able to because there is literally enough money for people to do that if it wasn’t being hoarded/spent in excess on shit like the military (US here). 

On top of the fact that it’s all made up. And you shouldn’t have to suffer every minute of your life trying to get enough money just so you can survive until you die.

But I’m not as eloquent. And he’s also one of those people who needs evidence or needs an expert to tell it to him.

1269,"Beware of Amazon, even if they hire you, you might still not have a job","In desperation, I took a job offer from Amazon. This is what happened next:

- I show up to my first day of work, to get my badge and whatnot. No one is there at my location to receive new employees. All doors are locked and no one comes in or out of the building while I'm there. It's 2am and I spent the last few dollars I have on gas money to get there.
- After an hour of wandering around and seeing no one, I'm freezing and decide to head home.
- I call the employee help line the next morning and the operator informs me that Amazon must have made a mistake, as all the people supposed to start on my shift were not processed. He tells me this happens sometimes.
- He tells me I need to reapply to a different position online through their portal. I do so, and am scheduled to start at a new location.
- I keep getting ""you missed your shift"" email notifications so I call the employee line again and explain the situation, they tell me that they fixed the problem on their end.
- Today I go to the online portal again to review my new start date, and it's completely gone from the website! I was already approved and scheduled to start in three days.
- Now if I want to try again, I have to start all over, which means driving an hour away for ANOTHER drug test and badge photo. And even then they might reject me because I have ""missed days"" from the previous position THAT NEVER EXISTED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

I thought, perhaps those who aren't thrown into poverty would take the downtime to realize there's more to life than work - that this restrictive shutting in somehow is better than the unfeeling grind of laboring everyday.

1274,"Money doesn't have value and you should seek happiness, love, fun and wisdom instead.","I don't care what anyone says, if you actually believe money has value and is worth doing anything for you are stupid. It's just pieces of paper and or digital representations of paper. You can kick and scream all you want but this fact will never change. Your currency has no real value. You're spending the one life you get here on earth doing tricks for pieces of paper, and if I was in the same position, I would argue against this fact too. If you willfully do things in exchange for paper at threat of death then you are unintelligent. 

""*Money is the alienated essence of man's work and existence; this essence dominates him and he worships it.*"" - Karl Marx

I understand that most people have no choice, so to be clear, if you understand that money doesn't actually have real value and you're being forced to do things daily against your will then I am not talking about you. I'm talking about people who actually defend this system as being even close to as good as we can do together as a species. If you actually defend this system and think it's a good idea you are delusional, and you will have to face that fact at some point in your life. This is why so many old people will tell you that they wished they spent more time with their loved ones and less time working. Once it's all said and done, and your life is coming to an end, all that time you spent working starts to seem pretty fucking stupid. 

""*You are what you do. If you do boring, stupid monotonous work, chances are you'll end up boring, stupid and monotonous. Work is a much better explanation for the creeping cretinization all around us than even such significant moronizing mechanisms as television and education.*"" - Bob Black, The Abolition of Work

If you can opt out of this outdated rat race you 1000% should. There is so much more to life than waking up everyday to do things against your will. If you're happy working, good for you, I think you should be allowed too, but I and many others are not happy, so just like I stated that I believe you should be allowed to work, I ask the same courtesy to be extended to me and those like me who choose a different path. Telling us we can ""go live in a forest"" just proves how disgusting your system really is. It's your way, or death. Well guess what, fuck that, I would rather die than take part in a system that is so eager to let me. I will not ever be doing anything against my will while I have a heartbeat, and I implore others to do the same. 

""*It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.*"" - Jiddu Krishnamurti

If you value your life, your family and your species then you should not take part in this system. Instead, be yourself, be happy, be loving, be smart and self sacrifice for what is right. This system isn't going to change by us taking part in it. The transition from this system to the next isn't going to be fun or pretty for those who want change, it's going to suck, however it's going to suck a lot more for future generations if we allow this archaic economic system and way of life to continue into the future. It's only going to become more outdated as time goes on, not less. Don't let them rape the future of humanity with their selfish conservative values and stupidity. I know it's cliche, but now is the time to fight every outdated system of the past. People are listening now, they're waking up, and they rightfully want freedom so they can actually enjoy their lives.   

""*The goal of the future is full unemployment, so we can play. That's why we have to destroy the present politico-economic system.*"" - Arthur C. Clarke

Lead by example. Show them that many of us really no longer agree that a lifetime of forced servitude is ""success."" I think servitude should be avoided at all costs as it is giving into authority and it's why stupidity reigns supreme. Most people don't think they have a choice other than to live in a way that they know is wrong, and this needs to change. We need to fight for our collective freedom, we need to fight for the future. Show the younger generations that even some adults are smart enough to recognize that the lifestyle forced upon us by the collective whole of humanity isn't something any of us would actually choose if we weren't being threatened by starvation and forced to live in such relentlessly boring ways against our wills. Show them that deep down, we really want freedom as much as they do. Show them that some of us are going to do whatever it takes to be ourselves, despite what others think or say. 

""*To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.*"" - Ralph Waldo Emerson

Don't let dumb fuck conservatives / liberals bully us into doing things their way any longer. Stop letting them shape the world around us. Show them that we have a voice and we're going to be using it until we make the world a place that is safe and fair for everyone. Stop letting them starve humans to death in a post scarcity society for no reason other than to protect their system and way of life. Our species is too important to let them have their way. Their way is ruining the lives of countless humans and making the majority of us very unhappy and unhealthy. 

""*We are all responsible for our dream of storming the heavens. We cannot turn ourselves into dwarves now, after having dreamed, elbow to elbow, each feeling the others' heartbeats, of attacking and overthrowing the gods. This is the dream that makes power afraid.*"" - Alfredo M. Bonanno

They're forcing everyone to ""take life seriously,"" just to feel like they're accomplishing more than they really are in life. If work was just voluntary, as it should be, then a big chunk of ""life lessons"" they think everyone needs go out the window real quick. This is why so many people react to anti-work views with ""I don't know what I'd do without work!"" or ""Everyone HAS to contribute something!"" They don't know who they are outside of pretending life is serious business that needs their constant attention through working. They actually believe that everyone needs to work or else the world would cease to exist, and they include themselves in this view which in turn makes them delusional about their role in reality. If work isn't something that ""everyone has to do,"" then they'd be forced to actually question their own lifestyles. 

""*Many things can be done ‘playfully’ yet most of the things we do, we do very ‘seriously’ wearing the death mask we have borrowed from capital.*"" - Alfredo M. Bonanno

Fuck their system completely. Fuck money, fuck work, fuck politics, fuck police, fuck judges, fuck bankers, fuck landlords, fuck bosses, fuck all authority. Their system doesn't work, and even they know it now, but are still choosing to defend it because fascists accept that they are the bad guys, but they don't care. They're willing to hurt others if it means getting their way. We need to do to Capitalism and the conservative lifestyle exactly what it does to humanity, leave it behind. 

""*We have deluded ourselves into believing the myth that capitalism grew and prospered out of the Protestant ethic of hard work and sacrifice. The fact is that capitalism was built on the exploitation and suffering of black slaves and continues to thrive on the exploitation of the poor - both black and white, here and abroad.*"" - Martin Luther King, Jr.

1309,Felt like sharing here....,"Quit my job around September end,

Took a full break the immediate month ( unexpected family drama and politics aside), kinda started applying for jobs in the 2nd month and been applying to a lot of places, since the past week.

I've applied to a considerable amount of places via Indeed and Glassdoor and yet, I've gotten no response from any of them.

When I apply directly on the company's official website though, I did get some responses like them giving me some tasks. However, I did not get any follow-ups after that.

Only once did I got a chance to be interviewed and they didn't get back to me, presumably because they felt my salary expectations were a bit much than what they were willing to give.

However, via job portals so far....I've received zero call-backs, after applying. It wasn't this bad last year around the same time, when I was applying to about 4-5 places via Indeed, I was guaranteed to receive a call from atleast one of them. And I was a fresher with no work XP whatsoever, back then.

It's so demotivating.

I'm pretty sure at this rate, I'll never get a job through this. Even if I do get a call-back, they'll ask for my portfolio, and honestly I don't have much to show, as a graphic designer with 10 months of XP.

Sure, I did a projectwork back when I did that course a year back, and I did a considerable amount of work in my previous place of employment - around 90% of the work I've done so far, was when I served there.

Unfortunately, they made it clear that I can't upload those designs on my portfolio as it belongs to the company. Which is understandable, I guess. And they told me they'll give me a good referral instead.

Sure, I need to post my own personal works onto my portfolio but, I'm so demoralised and demotivated to do start working on them.

I get intimidated by others designers, who are way more talented and skilled than I ever could imagine myself to be.

I honestly get an existential dread out of this, asking myself as to what's the point of even trying.

I have almost zero friends thus, I don't have a good network either. I feel, this is crippling me career-wise, as if I had a good network/social circle, I won't be struggling this much.

I get locked out of the loop, as a result, regarding opportunities, due to not knowing a considerable amount of people, if not the right people necessarily.

This can't keep going like this....all this effort and for what? A disappointing pay and work-culture would likely be awaiting me.

I just feel this whole struggle and pursuit is simply not worth it. Maybe, I'm not meant for the corporate world.

I feel, I might be much better off by doing something that I have an interest in. If only I could pick up some momentum, that is.",False,k9h5zs,TheFatherofOwls,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k9h5zs/felt_like_sharing_here/,2,1

1318,The Malaise of the Soul at Work,"I wrote a paper recently on neoliberalism in education and found an article I thought you all would appreciate. Here is the link (if you can't access, I can message you the PDF): https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11217-019-09653-4

Below are some of my favorite parts:

""The Italian political thinker Franco “Bifo” Berardi tells us that the current transformation of every domain of social life into economy has led to “the subjugation of the soul to work processes.” According to Berardi, our current subjection under “semiocapitalism” involves much more than our being rendered into producers of knowledge and consumers of symbols. What is at stake today is a form of cognitive-affective “work,” which, in employing our intellectual capacity, curiosity and desire for learning, makes us believe that, indeed, we can discover our freedom and our true sense of self through doing our job. Implicitly referring to the prevalence of “high tech workers” and the “creative class” in our economy, Berardi assess that today, “workers tend to consider labour as the most essential part in their lives.” Consequently, he goes on, “no desire, no vitality seems to exist anymore outside of the economic enterprise.” The soul, that which Berardi refers to as “the best part of us”—which aspires towards creativity, sensuality, delight and communication—risks being usurped by the incessant compulsion to define ourselves more and more through our functional relations.""

""Moreover, what Berardi’s notion of the soul helps us focus on is the prevailing politics of our time: how it is that semiocapitalism works to exploit, sway, exhaust and mine the soul for its current expansion. Semiocapitalism, understood as the contemporary fusion of media and capitalism, in which informational commodities are received, produced and recombined, relies ever more so on our minds, communication, curiosity and creativity, employing our cognitive-affective labour, or our desire for learning and self-expression. In this way, Berardi gives us an analysis of semiocapitalism’s relentless outward and inward expansion of the economic domain. This is an expansion that does not simply stretch outward, rendering and exploiting nature and the world around us as a resource, but also reaches inward usurping, mining and reaping our interiority (our “soul”), drawing out our passions, desires and creative impulses as a resource itself to be exploited.""

""Berardi’s attention to the soul and what currently ails it signals a shift from industrial capitalism’s exploitation and alienation of bodies to a more contemporary form of capitalism’s exploitation and alienation of bodies and “souls.” Whereas Fordist models reduced worker’s bodies to tools during their working hours, post-Fordist exploitation, moreover mines our interiority so that workers intimately identify with their jobs: today our mental space and feelings are preoccupied with our work all the time and we no longer seem to be able to register the former sense of alienation to work. In this way, semiocapitalism maligns the most valued and significant sense of our subjectivity—our soul—as we have become defined and managed by our work and work defined values. In The Soul at Work, Berardi undertakes a genealogy of alienation tracing how the industrial worker’s antagonism towards work—evidenced in the worker’s refusal, in his or her saying NO to conflating life and work, and in his or her sabotaging and general antipathy towards alienating labour—has given way to our peculiar contemporary situation. Drawing on Italian Workerism, Berardi shows how, previously, the industrial worker’s ability to register his or her alienation opens other possibilities for imagining and safeguarding human togetherness and human self-actualization outside of the valorization of work and capital. He writes, 'It is precisely thanks to the radical inhumanity of the workers’ existence that a human collectivity can be founded, a community no longer dependent on capital. It is indeed the estrangement of the workers from their labor, the feeling of alienation and its refusal, that are the bases for a human collectivity autonomous from capital.' With this background in place, Berardi turns to consider the contemporary psychosocial transformation of the contemporary workers’ stance toward their labour. The refusal to reduce life to work, under the conditions of classical industrial labour, has given way to an enthusiastic embracing of and over-identification with doing one’s job. Today, according to Berardi, we value work so much so that it “has become the central locus of psychic and emotional investment,” effectively channeling our desire for creativity and sociality towards the enterprise of realizing ourselves through our employment.""

""The “creative class” thus born from this channeling of desire is made up of those who cease to see their labour as a necessary drain on their way of life, as something that they must do. Rather, they learn to see their jobs affectionately and intimately as the primary activity for shaping their self-image, and for fully expressing their creative impulses and validating their idiosyncrasies. Motivated by the want of “abundant high-quality experiences, an openness to diversity of all kinds, and above all else the opportunity to validate their identities as creative people,” the creative class no longer contests extending their working day. They no longer say NO to work encroaching on their lives. Instead, they spontaneously choose to increase their hours, informally scheduling more work through digital tasks and even pursuing extra accreditation, courses and workshops during their leisure time so that they can become “better” at their jobs.Footnote 21 The logic seems to propose that the longer they work, and the better they learn to labour, the more chances they have to express themselves, realize their potential, and become self-actualized and fulfilled. Today we thus see the complete conflation between labouring and learning to become an authentic person; this is something that Florida himself assumes when he intones the desires of the creative class as saying, “we want the ability to learn and grow, shape the content of our work, control our schedules and express our identities through work.”

""Berardi himself would see this as expressing the post-industrial turn in which, “capital renews its psychic, ideological and economic energy, specifically thanks to the absorption of creativity, desire, and individualistic, libertarian drives for self-realization.” Footnote 23 For Berardi, the discourse of the “creative class” seems particularly fitting to the type of cognitive-affective labour required in late-stage capitalism. Today we are compelled to hold jobs that cannibalize our lives all day long, as the informal nature of our schedules eludes our control and exposes us to the 24/7 flow of online demands (of the Infosphere). Consequently, we find ourselves constantly learning and adapting to new gadgets and software required for work; collapsing work with managing our social media profiles; always seemingly in need of updating our work-personal mobile devices; always feeling the need to respond to the latest solicitations; or consistently feeling obliged to express our likes and dislikes lest our public-work profile becomes discounted, outdated or on the “wrong side” of a trending “shitstorm.” In blurring the line that distinguishes between work and life we come to feel that we have no time orplace away from work, or any possibility of a kind of learning other than what will afford me an advantage in my work. Such work, today, affectively, creatively and thoroughly binds us to our jobs, so much so that our self-validation, creative expression and enjoyment is only found therein. Unlike workers in the Fordist era of capitalism, whose time after work was theirs (more or less), now, there is no space, time or other ways of thinking that would allow us to register the feelings of dissatisfaction in our needing to labour.""

""In discussing what he terms the “cognitariat,” those flexible labourers performing cognitive piecemeal work under semiocapitalism, Berardi offers us a corrective to the euphemistic term “creative class.” He importantly points out that, “what is involved in the cognitive labor process [what is currently being exploited in the creative economy] is indeed what belongs more essentially to human beings: …communication, the creation of mental states, of feelings and imaginations.” Footnote 24 At stake for Berardi is the question of what is happening to our own most sense of being human under the imperatives of semiocapitalism. The “cognitariat,” or the so called “creative class,” employed by semiocaptialism is constantly cajoled to keep learning, to express themselves, to communicate, to create, to self-actualize, to see themselves reflected in their jobs, to co-operate and even to take pleasure in their function. In short, they are asked to give their bodies and souls wholly over to their work. Whereas this might appear as an improvement and even an enriching non-alienating experience of work, as Florida wants us to believe, in reality it spells an all-out assault and impoverishment of the soul, since all learning, creativity, pleasure, communication and cooperation is already predetermined, calculated and valorized within the logic of economy and utility. Accordingly, as our intellectual and affective expression becomes driven more and more primarily by economic interests, calculation and necessity, it cannot but lose the character of gratuitousness, pleasurableness, and erotic contact that arises when it is freely and spontaneously given.""

""The worldly pleasures of conviviality, friendship, conversation and Eros—the pleasure of freely spending time with and giving time to others—that would nourish and animate us towards the collective dimension of our existence, now seem trivial, perhaps even embarrassing, when undertaken for their own sake outside of the compulsion to “network.” This is especially so when compared to the pressing priorities of my needing to present myself as functional, competitive and self-fulfilled through my constantly performing, and through accumulating “likes” for the sake of managing my profile. To be sure, such a virtual profile is one that we are compelled to constantly update in order to be counted as relevant and desirable, in order to secure and even maintain a job. Our ceaseless worrying and working to maintain our social media profiles belong to a time in which, as Byung-Chul Han notes, “everything is rendered countable so that it can be transformed into the language of performance and efficiency. [For] whatever resists being counted ceases to be.” Semiocapitalism thus solicits an accounting of one’s creativity and self-actualization in a hyper- individualized, pathologically competitive environment that makes one feel that one has never accomplished enough, and that one is in need of proving oneself over and over again, lest one’s profile, membership, worth and survival are put in question or become discounted. As Berardi writes, “survival is no longer based on reaching a position of sufficient preparation and abilities, but it is constantly questioned.”  Today people live out their parts in the “creative class” with the sinking feeling that if they do not keep up—if they do not keep learning, updating their credentials and adapting to the new economy to show how they count—“one can be eliminated in a few days or a few months.” Amidst conditions in which one’s survival is constantly in question or always in need of tweaking, we become attuned to living in a panic stricken and sickening hyperactive state in which we cannot afford to take pleasure and give compassion in collective life. As solidarity and a sense of being able to linger with each other withers away, the soul is no longer just mined for its resources, but begins to work on colonizing itself. The soul forecloses its desire for flight and short-circuits the sensibility animating the body toward what could allow it to appeal to and address others through a world that is more than economy, networking, labour and survival. When the soul is assailed and cajoled by the obscene demand to be creative, fulfilled and self-actualized so that it can survive and justify itself against others, the soul is poisoned and inevitably falls from flight into all sorts of pathologies—alas, a malaise of the soul overtakes our time.""",False,ka2gz9,RedditGrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ka2gz9/the_malaise_of_the_soul_at_work/,0,1

1323,"Great news! Everyone is getting the 24th off - except for you, and you, and you...","I work for a large insurance company. You would think that a company with tens of thousands of employees would know how to communicate effectively with all of them, but they don't (hence this post).

Earlier today, the CEO of my company made a video announcement stating that December 24th was going to be a full holiday, whereas originally the plan was for employees to only work the first half of their shift. The CEO literally and specifically told employees who had submitted time off for that day to cancel their PTO.

Surprisingly, about an hour after this announcement, my team received a message from my supervisor stating to NOT cancel our scheduled time off because we would not be getting December 24th off. Cue general mayhem and confusion. The same supervisor ""reminded"" us that we had ""received"" an email after the video announcement stating that several departments (actually the majority of departments) were still scheduled to work that day.

But employees were never actually sent that email.

As more and more people were given the bad news, negative comments flooded the video announcement's comment section. Employees were pointing out the misleading nature of the video. Some who had actually cancelled their PTO (remember, at the CEO's suggestion) were furious that they weren't able to re-submit their time off requests.

How did our supervisors react?

They told us to stop leaving negative comments on the video.

People were upset, confused, and no one even offered us a fucking apology. We were just told to shut up and sit down.

1329,just venting,"In many ways I'm fortunate, because I live in a country with welfare. Without welfare I'd be either in my mom's basement, on the streets or dead. I'm about to drop out of school for the sixth time in my life. I've a serious anxiety disorder that's only getting worse when I'm in school. I hate trying to explain it to people cause it's like ""well why do you feel anxious"". Like, I can't point out the exact reasons why, at this point my anxiety is constant, physical and triggered by pretty much anything and very few things make me feel happy. I had a nasty panic attack at the start of school and no one from school reached out to me, and I get it, everyone's insecure, tired and frustrated and I feel like actually getting me through school is just asking for too much resources and patience at this point. Somehow I'm still optimistic, I feel like hey either way I'm not going to kill myself and I've been struggling with trauma most of my life so I don't want to dwell forever in guilt for not working and taking welfare. I've done customer service jobs in the past, and I mostly hate them. As I'm quite introverted I've felt like I have to pretend to be a completely different personality and at this point I can't handle it anymore. Currently my plan is to study programming online. I try to let go of this idea of wanting to be a succesful and appreciated person, if I could do a little something that makes me happy and somehow benefits other people then that's enough. I've tried dancing to the society's expectations but so far it's only caused me to spiral into depression. Secretly I feel even happy, I don't want to be a part of this game anymore and I want to dedicate my time towards art and little projects.

I feel like in this system you're not allowed to ask for personal happiness.

HOWEVER, you may not leave the property ever, and will be confined to this luxury prison for the entirety of your natural existence.

1332,"Never thought I would post here, today I am. Work is a joke.","So I want to preface this by saying that I love my job and its great because its what I love to do, its IT, and I grew up wanting to be an IT professional. I make a decent amount of money but I do other work on the side and my biggest side gigs are doing survey sites like usertesting, trymyui, and prolific, this can net me around another 1,000 a month which I use for my hobbies and stuff. These sites basically gather peoples opinions on certain things to see if they want to implement it or not.

I read all of these antiwork posts on the Popular page and some people here seem to hate work, and I never really understood it till right now. I had taken user tests like this in the past, but this was the first time I was concerned. Basically I was taking a test for Starbucks to see if I would like robot baristas to replace human ones, I was like ""okay, that would be a little weird"", I brushed it off for the most part and said I would not like to see this change (I had gotten 3 surveys like this in the past so I actually think they will implement this).

Later I got another survey asking if I was okay being monitored by video and facial recognition?!??! this is crazy! This is what made me start to feel for everyone on this sub and now I understand this. people are being worked and expected to act like robots with no emotion just to be 100% efficient and productive. I was asked questions like ""How would you feel if this was used to determine if you were having a bad day that negatively affected your performance"" and ""How would you feel if this was used to punish employees"" and ""Other people are okay with this, how do you feel about this system""

1337,Boss gets angry about what I'm doing AFTER I leave the company,"I gave 8 weeks' notice at my job 6 weeks ago. Before that, I'd given them verbal notice that I was going to leave to start my own business but that I'd help them get through the holidays. (I only told them that far out because my boss saw my profile on Indeed and cornered me about it. He's done this to several employees in the past few months, and some were fired on the spot. Luckily, I wasn't fired then.)

Yesterday, my boss barged into my office while I was trying up loose ends.

Boss: ""We're going to need you part-time in January. We haven't found a replacement so you'll probably need to train them then.""

Me: ""As I wrote in my notice, I'm happy to help part-time in January, but only virtually. The new hire can call me if they have questions. And I'll be unavailable until January 9th. I'm visiting family.""

Boss: ""The ninth? That's a huge chunk of time.""

Me: ""I know. I'm excited.""

Boss: ""Well, that's going to be really inconvenient for us. We'll talk more later."" 

Cue him storming out of my office.

So yeah, my boss got upset about how long of a vacation I'm taking AFTER I NO LONGER WORK FOR HIM. These employers have pulled some stunts in the past, but they continue to surprise me.

1338,Reduced Work Week,"Hello, I’ve been a lurker on this sub for about a year now, and while I feel similarly to many of you who post, I’m trying to figure out what can be done to impact change. I actually don’t hate my job, or mind working in general, I just think work outbalances the rest of life and is generally just too long/ too much time. With the growth of AI and technology it feels like we are seriously missing out or not prioritizing the relieving effects this could have on our way of life as humans. 

So what actions can be made? No work is a bit too utopian for reality in my opinion, but are there resources supporting reduced work weeks? Is there a movement to support? 

In this last election cycle I was a big Yang supporter, mostly because I believe that he thinks outside of the box with ideas like UBI, which seem like a pathway to reduced work weeks, but clearly that is still considered too radical to be palatable for the voting population (as surprising as that is to me personally). It seems to me that people like him are at the cusp of starting a larger movement, so I’m interested to learn more about who is trying to make this idea reality, and what organizations support this.

1339,I had to learn how to think of work strictly as a way to get by and not an extension of myself and my worth as a person... and I'm still learning.,"I've spent most of my teenagehood working part-time, trying to prove to myself and to others that I was smart, capable and sociable in a work setting. I wanted to grind my way up the corporate ladder and eventually get my own freelance business teaching English to second language learners. I got a university degree, got my own apartment, got a full-time job for the first time and...

Had a depression. I started spiraling **bad**. I realized I hated every job I ever had and I began to hate people because of how mistreated I've been in every workplace. I also realized I was way too optimistic about myself and my own abilities and that I could never get where I wanted to be. I have really bad anxiety and it's only gotten worse once I got out of college. I don't care about (most of) my coworkers (some are good eggs) and I'm absolutely okay with that. I did teach English right before the pandemic hit and it was the most fulfilling and rewarding job I've ever had, but my anxiety absolutely ruined it for me. I know I'm never going to be able to move past it, so forget the idea that I could ever have my own business. 

So... what now?

Well, I've been a data-entry specialist since may 2019. I don't care anymore. I have enough money to sustain myself and let's just say that I'm not a good consumer, so my money is good, fortunately. Food is my biggest expense and I don't eat much. I play video games in the evening, I play the guitar whenever I can. I'm just a human being and I've got nothing to prove to anybody. I'm done comparing myself. I'm done aiming higher, career-wise. I'm smart. I'm unique. I'm good enough. 

It shouldn't be this hard to get to this point, but it is. I'm still not where I want to be and there are a lot of things I'm not satisfied with, but I hope I get to be in a more comfortable position someday, working as little as possible.

1345,I have a Christmas retail job and the way my manager acts like it is the only thing happening in my life is fucking ridiculous.,"Pretty self explanatory, but I'm a grad student and picked up a job as a Christmas temp in a store over the University vacation period here in Melbourne now that shops are open back up after lockdown.

I'm working about 12 hours a week, basically the shitty 10:30am-2:30pm lunch cover shifts that basically eat up an entire day, but whatever, I get $100 for each one and am only a 10 minute walk from the shopping centre the store is in. 

But the manager is starting to piss me off with the way she expects to have total control over my scheduled. She tried to call me in today and I politely wrote back informing her that I could not work the shift as I had an appointment in the afternoon. She called me back and passively aggressively asked me if it was in the unavailability book. I calmly informed her that she gave me a roster and I then scheduled some necessary appointments around that roster. She had a long pause (that one people give when they realise a fair point was just made) and then acted like she was doing me a huge favour by taking me off the shift but then again ""but for future reference, rosters are always subject to change"". Ok? If you need to change the rosters, that is one thing, but that is also dependent on **my** availability. 

I also have the roster for the next two weeks, and she expects me to be ""on call"" multiple days over the next two weeks, meaning that. I'm expected to block out my days, keep my phone on me and drop everything and race into the store if they are busy and she needs me. 

Fuck. Off.

If you want me to black out my schedule for you, you are going to need to pay me for that. 

I have better things to do with my life than sit at home waiting on you. I'll go in for the money if I am genuinely not doing something, but one of the days she has me ""on call"" for, I want to do something, and I'm going to put my phone on ""do not disturb"" and ignore them because I'm fucking sick of it. I'm not spending my ***weekend*** at home to be at your beck and call. 

I don't even know if I will survive the next 2 weeks because she keeps making us do shit with little concern for our comfort, like forcing us to wear embarrassing tacky Christmas headbands even though headbands give me a massive migraine (12 year old me *wanted* to have a Blair Waldorf phase in 2008 but didn't get to because I can't do headbands) and standing up on a step and doing ""shout outs"" by memorising a script of lame jokes to talk about the special offers in store. She gets mad at me because my anxiety means I'm terrible at it, but she refuses to do it herself.  

Honestly..... I am living with my parents and my student payment has been higher because of the Covid Supplement. I don't really need the job, I just wanted the extra money because I just wanted to get some extra savings because I want to do some travelling after the world opens back up after the pandemic and to just have on hand for a rainy day. If she pushes my buttons too hard over the next couple of weeks......I'll honestly just walk out mid shift. 

I just wanted to vent to people who will understand rather than thinking it is the norm and OK for a job to think it is entitled to get mad at you for daring to schedule things in your down time, getting headaches from wearing fucking reindeer ears, and wanting to own your weekend without any promise or guarantee of pay.",False,kb1zti,TheBadHedgehog,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kb1zti/i_have_a_christmas_retail_job_and_the_way_my/,11,1

So you always have to “work”.

1389,"Just started working full-time this year, already dreading the rest of my life at 23","Sorry if this post ends up being super long, I've been doing too much thinking these past few months.

I have hated being a part of this system that we humans have created since I was a kid. At school, I would always think ""what am I *really* doing here?"" Of course every kid dislikes school to some extent, but I absolutely cherished whenever there was a snow day, I would count down the days until summer or winter break, etc. In high school it got worse. Literally the only thing getting me through the years were the days off- again snow days, breaks, and the like. Every day my mind was filled with thoughts like ""how can anybody go to school 7+ hours a day for 5 days a week and enjoy it?"" ""I can be at home right now doing things that I actually enjoy."" Whenever I heard the question ""what do you want to be when you grow up?"" I was always changing my answer. I would decide a career path, research it, then think ""I can't see myself doing this 8 hours or more a day, 5 days a week for the rest of my life."" I would also think ""once I get to college things will be better and I'll have more freedom."" Ultimately I decided I really enjoy spending time with children, so i went to college to be a teacher. After my first semester I thought ""I can't see myself doing this everyday"" yada yada, same thing. So i changed my major to psychology so that there was a broader range of options for me and I could figure it out later. Again, the only thing getting me through college, while it was better than high school, were the breaks. Also I would think to myself ""I cannot wait to be done and have a full-time job so that I can finally provide for myself and I will have more freedom."" LOL

So I graduated college in May with my psychology degree. I was so nervous everyday that I was not going to able to find a job, with being in the middle of a pandemic. ""Luckily,"" at the end of July I was hired full-time by a company that normally works in an office, but right now is fully remote until at least March. I started my training in August...and that is when all of the thoughts, the realizations, the absolute *dread* started. The company is actually good, the work is easy once you get used to it, but I just absolutely *hate* working. HOW did I not see this coming? I've always known that I've hated giving up my time to this ""system,"" so WHY did I think that getting a full-time job would magically make me okay with it? I don't think I can quite put into words how hard it hit me that *this is it*, but I'm sure people in this sub will understand. I have cried almost everyday since august. After work, I would spend the rest of the day just looking up other options so I could quit. I *fucking* hate capitalism with every fiber of my being. 5 days a week 8 hours a day is bullshit, especially dealing with places that only treat you like a number. Personally, I think 4 days a week, 5 hours a day (with no change in pay) should be the standard for everybody. Nobody likes working, so why the fuck did we let it go on for this long? (Don't even get me started on people who brag that they break their backs working 60+ hours a week, I never understood them). Before this job, even though i was nervous about finding a job and stressed because of the pandemic, I was genuinely enjoying life and relaxing. I woke up when i wanted (I need about 10 hours of sleep to feel refreshed, I didn't even feel the need to nap at all during this time!), i played animal crossing, read, wrote, did whatever i wanted whenever i wanted. THAT is all i want out of this life, but even that is too much to ask for.

I forgot to mention that through college I had a part-time job at a grocery store. Even though I also hated going there, it wasn't too bad because it was only 20 hours a week, and halfway through the shifts the store would be dead so you could just sit around or work on homework, which was nice. I couldn't wait to get out of there and find something better, but now I find myself longing to go back. This time last year I never would have said that in one million years.

Also, I have pretty bad social anxiety and the pandemic has made it much worse. In the past, going to work would kind of prepare my anxiety for work for the day, and coming home felt so refreshing because it was my safe space and I didn't experience social anxiety here. Now that I'm working at home, it kind of messed up that process that worked so well for me and I get anxious even if I step away from my work, and after work it takes a long time to actually wind down. Much longer than it took when i would physically drive home from work.

There are more things i can talk about here, but this post is probably already too long. I just feel trapped. I really just want to quit because technically I don't *need* the money right now as I still live with my parents, but student loans will kick in before I know it and my boyfriend and I want to move in together soon and this job would help speed the process up.

Your workplace literally does not care if you died right now unless they were involved and their insurance had to pay out for it. They do not care.

Humans are animals. Our central concern is survival. It is to compete. That is the truth. Your neighbour will not hesitate to eliminate you if you came between them and survival.

This is a bit of a rant so if you don’t wanna stick around, I understand, but I hope you have a great day! 💙

So ever since I’ve had two jobs I knew working wasn’t for me but I feel like I’ve been in a work environment well enough. My first job was at a movie theater and I told myself that it’s okay if I didn’t become friends with my coworkers, but at least be friendly enough. I tried so hard to be positive yet my coworkers gossiped, kept to their own cliques, didn’t add me to any group chats or didn’t even give me phone numbers until maybe 6 months or more after working there. I even was cornered and cussed out by a coworker in front of my friends, it being slipped under the rug. The job made me question my self worth so I was happy to quit when the pandemic came around. But now I was stuck without a job, so about a month ago I got a job as a cocktail waitress. It’s been better, better pay (plus tips) , easier job, nice customers...until one of our bartenders has started to snap at me about rolling my eyes or walking away when I’m talking to her. She’s been a total queen bee, bossing me around and yelling at me like I’m one of her kids. It’s been small stuff like this until today when my boss pulled me aside and listed off these CRAZY things that has “happened.” Like that I had a confrontation with a girl in the cage (vault)/ tried to process my tips first instead of the casinos money (no one knows the true story, everyone I’ve asked has heard different stories), that I’ve been lazy, charging people for sodas and tea (which we ruled out so that parts fine), that im not multitasking because on rare occasions I don’t take every drink on my tray at once because I’m clumsy and have spilt drinks cause I’ve had too many on my tray. But in short, the jobs I’ve had have made me feel like I’m being told I’m a different person. Like I’m being told I did horrible things but I know aren’t true at all. I’m shy, introverted, never insulted someone to their face, I’ve never fought/punched/slapped, you name it, I’ve never done it. I hate confrontation. On top of it all I have depression and suicidal thoughts, so having all this stuff happen again, it makes me wonder if I’ll ever even be in a work environment that doesn’t make me question everything about myself.
When I don’t do things, I get yelled at and judged, if I DO do things, I get yelled at and judged. It makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me...what would you guys do?

1399,"What are some simple, low-hour, mental-illness-friendly jobs?","Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this. I feel like people in this community might know about minimal-effort/stress jobs.

**tl;dr: My partner is very physically weak and depressed and I'd like some suggestions for low-hour jobs that would let him make some money without killing him.**

My partner and I both live with family and would like to finally move in together, but I do not make enough money to support us both. I freelance write and make usually $800/month.

We are both depressed and have ADHD. We're both physically weak and sick (he weighs 105 pounds and struggles to get out of bed in the morning, feels weak and ill all day). Basically, we're both mentally disabled and physically disabled to some extent, but likely not enough so to get benefits. Holding down a typical full-time job would be very difficult for either of us.

But to live together he has to earn at least a little money, since I'm at my limit. He struggles enough to pursue his creative hobbies even without a job, and it would break my heart if he never had the energy to write again. So I'm looking for suggestions for something that doesn't take all day and won't suck the life and creative energy out of him.

He has interest in computers (one thing I thought of is part-time computer tech or something since it doesn't require a degree and he may at least enjoy it). He has helped me with my articles, but finds it miserable, so freelance writing is a last resort.

Any other suggestions would be really appreciated.",False,k9ivac,throwaway21345312357,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k9ivac/what_are_some_simple_lowhour/,8,1

1402,Worker’s Paradox... We Gotta Tear It All Down,"Humans evolved contributing what they could and having a place to live, with food to eat, in a space with close ones. Oh, and not working nearly as much as we do now (lots of good reads on this, we work more than our tribal ancestors did). It’s literally a part of our nature, since it is what we evolved to do. 

Well, I think I partially figured out why this feels so close and yet so far...

Because of where things are at now, we can’t help but 

A) care about the suffering and reduced freedoms we see caused by greedy governments and corporations, despite us not being directly responsible for it and having no immediate power to fix it while...

B) working at least 40+ hours a week at a job just to have shelter (no even nice shelter, just bare minimum shelter), food, and some amount of quality of life.

So you tell me how we are supposed to be relaxed while stressed because of the state of the world, and have a quality of life while being forced to do something that prohibits that, like working crappy jobs for 40+ hours a week.

Humans are not supposed to be in a constant state of worry for how bad things are. If someone was sick or injured, we could directly help. We needed a break to ourselves, we had access to land, somewhere we could go without having to exchange all the hours in our day just to pay to be there. 

Tell me how we are not trapped? How are we free while being forced to give all our time to a company? How can you relax and #grind while turning a blind eye to the suffering around you? If you aren’t anti-capitalist, you are pro suffering. 

But most people reading this already know all this, so what are we going to do about it? How are we going to go from being really good at recognizing issues, to changing our problems? 

When lockdowns are over with, we have got to start linking up and getting community organizations started. And we have to be proud to be leftist, socialist, antiwork... and not be afraid to say that when asked. We are never going to change anything if we don’t spread our message to people who aren’t already a part of the massively left (myself included) community on Reddit. 

Before anyone says it, I work at least 40 hours a week, assuming I don’t do overtime. Which I do. 

I know we can’t stand to see the injustices we see. I know I am fed up with watching right-wing authoritarianism rise all over the globe. We have GOT to not be afraid to wear who we are as a badge of honor, the same way propagandists wear “work hard” and “don’t take hands outs, it’s lazy” as badges of honor.

1408,For those of you who think self-employment is a dream...,"It's really not.  Being self employed does have its benefits, but it has major drawbacks too.  #1 is you are 100% responsible for your own paycheck.  You can't be lazy or put in minimal effort because if you do, you sink.  #2 is much higher taxes.  Including taxes and expenses, I make about 40% of my gross revenue in profit.  So out of every $100 I make, I only get to keep $40 of it.  #3 is discipline.  Sure, nobody is calling you if you don't show up to work, but it's so easy to get off track.  You can't relax for an instant.  #4 is customers.  If you can find a job that isn't customer-facing, then consider yourself lucky.  You think you need a thick skin to deal with dickwads in retail?  Imagine if those dickwads were literally trying to take the money out of YOUR wallet.  It becomes a LOT more personal when they're devaluing your work and time and not just being dicks about the situation.  

Here's an example.  I do freelance computer work on the side.  A guy came in to have me upgrade his graphics card.  The card was $429.99.  I bought the card and charged him $459.99 and $29 to install it - so $60 over what the card costs on Amazon.  The dude flips out when he gets home and realizes he could have gotten it for $429.99 and demands that I price match.  Like, dude, $429.99 is my cost.  So I should just sell something to you at my cost and install it for free?  How about you go to work tomorrow and work for free?  Does that sound good to you?  It's true that I made $60 for about 30 minutes of actual work, but after taxes and expenses it's more like $25.  Okay, so $50/hour, right?  Hold it right there, buster.  I don't have a guaranteed job with a guaranteed 8 hours of work a day.  I get 2-3 clients a day.  I'm a SMALL business working from home.  I barely make $15/hour when you divide what I make in a day by 8 hours.  If you think I should make less than McDonalds worker for a skilled trade, then fuck you.  I'm not Amazon.  I can't afford to make $0.25 profit on a $400+ part.  And Amazon's not installing it for you.

Do you like paying $400-$700/month for shitty health insurance with a $13,000 deductible where the only place that will take it is downtown where if I go to the doctor I risk getting shot?  Then become self employed!  I went to the hospital for an MRI and with insurance it was like $6,000.  They didn't even DO anything!  How is it that they can charge $6,000 for pushing a button, but I'm demonized for making $15/hour?

Don't get me wrong, I've got good clients.  Old people who will pay me just to sit there and help them use the computer, some rich people who give me tips and say I should charge more, etc. but the bad clients are really freaking bad!  This all lands on you.  They can write a bad Google review and cost you tens of thousands of dollars in revenue over the next 5 years (in lost business) because they don't feel like you're worth $15/hour.

Small businesses are not your enemy.  Most small businesses have 1 employee - the owner - just a regular guy trying to make it when big companies like Amazon are selling stuff for $0.25 above cost to squeeze everyone else out.

As much as I hate working for someone, I'm thinking about going back (to a NON-customer facing position, mind you!).  Shouldering all the burden is really difficult and you're shit on constantly by people who think you don't deserve to earn a living wage.  Sound familiar?  Yeah, it's just like a job!

There's no ethical way to escape this bullshit.  The 1% have found the only way to escape this nightmare - by acquiring income-producing assets and enslaving others with their wealth.  I can't do it, guys.  I can't hire some guy and pay him shit wages, but I can't afford to pay anything else (honestly I can't even afford to pay myself a non-shit wage).  The other option is I can start ripping customers off to get more money, but I can't do that either.  This world is literally set up so the only way you can get ahead is to fuck people over.

Got a remote job and I know society would say I should be grateful. I had been unemployed for over a year and my benefits had run out.  This job is lower pay than my old job, no benefits, temporary office-drone stuff.

My last two jobs were also office jobs and were nothing short of toxic. Even after being unemployed for just over a year I still was feeling burnt out and having nightmares about work and my old boss being horrible to me.

Two days into this new job and I just want to fucking die. I cry multiple times a day, sometimes at random.  I have nearly constant and disturbingly vivid intrusive thoughts of self-harm.  Like, I'll pick up a glass to drink some water and have a vision of shattering it and slashing myself with the broken glass.  If I handle a knife in the kitchen I picture turning it on myself.  This morning I had to suppress the urge to just start bashing my head on the wall in the shower and then while I was making my morning coffee I envisioned just laying my face onto the burner.   I'm constantly fighting my own mind.

I don't have health insurance (lost it when I lost my old job, and the new one doesn't have benefits and I can't afford to just buy it out of pocket).  There's no one I can talk to besides my partner (who lives with me) and he's worried about me and I know it upsets him to hear me talk about hurting myself.

The mental fatique and long hours makes it actually worse proposition overall. The way human brain works... it cannot stop thinking about that problem you were unable to solve while on clock. Look at [indeed.com](https://indeed.com) and other places that are littered with grotesquely low paying dev jobs pilling on each other.

Dev career is a very short one. Not only because of severe mental fatique the job entails (brain constantly works on overdrive, projects are terribly planned, long hours, crunch times) but also due to the fact the older you are the more likely you are getting replaced by a fresh graduate. The thing is... Apple and Google employ only a miniscule amount of devs worldwide. Most software written today is just rehash of old stuff and reinventing wheel. It's a mundane work with no creativity or high mental acuity required. Senior devs can just as easily be replaced with young graduates for fraction of cost. And that's what's happening.

Do not fall into ""older devs move into managerial roles"" trap. There is barely any room there in the first place. And being a good dev says absolutely nothing about one's predisposition's to become a manager.

Very low entry barrier. Experience means almost nothing as most devs are expected to learn specific language or framework to solve a specific problem and then move onto the next thing. Most devs will never posses any industry secret or anything really that would make them irreplaceable. You may luck out by digging yourself a deep legacy ditch or build a vast amount of undocumented project know-how but that's only possible with terrible project management and with luck.

Software engineering/development is a dead end career no matter how hard the capitalist spin it. The golden age is over. Dev wages will only get depressed further on.",False,kame5i,HustleInMuhBlood,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kame5i/coding_wont_free_you_from_capitalist_slavery/,28,1

1436,Can I get a 101 on how does abolishment of work make labour not suck? How can socialistic doctrines make it true? Eg. what would make my job in mutualist or communist economy not suck?,"I'm no stranger to anarchism but it's hard for me to imagine not hating work. I just wanna work as little as possible and maybe a bit more if I feel the need for luxury. But in the end I'm still likely to learn a trade and do it for someone else in exchange for something else, either money or just access to all of social production. That means I'll be forced either by market's supply &amp; demand to do x amount of labour or maybe communes/collectives accessible to me will insist on longer workdays?

Of course some minimal amount of work has to be done to keep society going but I guess it's not that much in 21st century. I'm just not sure it would be more pleasurable or if society would require only that minimum.

1440,YSK about the historic Paycheck Protection Plan (PPP) Loans scheme implemented by the US Government,"This subreddit is mostly memes I know, but I feel like there's not enough outrage around the [PPP Loan program.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paycheck_Protection_Program)

The US government printed 2/3 of a trillion dollars to subsidize the payrolls of private companies...  Let the magnitude of what I just said sink in.  They paid for-profit businesses to employ people.   

Rather than directly transfer that money to people struggling, rather than create the jobs themselves and employ people like we did in the wake of the Great Depression, they transferred it directly to the business class when wealth inequality is at the highest it has been in over a century...  

These loans were available to any business with less than 500 employees with a few exceptions for businesses with even more employees than that.  As long as the business had payroll to offset the loan, then it will be 100% forgiven in almost all cases.  

There was no need assessment in either the loan application or its forgiveness other than having the requisite payroll.  

In other words, the government literally wrote paychecks to the tune of $669 billion for private business.  They paid the masters to keep us working and coming to the office during a fucking global pandemic.  

Many companies will pull obscene profits this year as a result while we all remain struggling with our stagnant wages which will absolutely not go up ""because COVID"" and on the verge of unemployment once these loans run out and we are of no use to the employer as a source of subsidy.   

There's not nearly enough outrage over the bullshit.  It seems we've just come to accept our place and we'll take anything.",False,kaq4nn,Rookwood,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/kaq4nn/ysk_about_the_historic_paycheck_protection_plan/,4,1

1444,Join the Dark Side?,"I can't take this slow, methodical, bi-weekly ration that we call a paycheck anymore. It's driving me absolutely insane. It feels like some sick form of water torture. DRIP. DRIP. DRIP. Every other Friday into the infinite void. Its rhythmic nature hypnotizes and tranquilizes me, like how the lines painted in the middle of a highway can put a truck driver in a trance. There you go, slave. There's another tiny ration. Now go and spend it all quickly so that you have no choice but to come back and serve us. 

There is no point to any of this. I spend my days selling useless, toxic shit to people for poverty wages. Not only does my job not benefit or advance humanity in any way, it completely destroys the environment and accelerates us towards catastrophe.

Some people are benefitting and profiting from all of this. Very few people. I have tried to alert my co-workers to these things, but to no avail. They defend their capitalism vehemently and with fervor. Class consciousness is lost on them. I am at the end of trying. They do not care or are even aware of the 1% juicing them for all they're worth. They do not care about the egregious, disgusting amounts of wealth inequality blatantly happening right in front of their faces. They do not care about their surplus value being outright stolen from them. They are more concerned with the beggar stealing a candy bar. That is true theft to them, not oligarchs taking everything from us in the open. They sweat and shake with anger when you force them to question their reality with words and logic. Their eyes are closed, and they do not wish to open them. Embarrassed, but only temporarily, one day they too will be rich.

I don't know what the future holds for me, but I know that I cannot be a slave anymore. I cannot exist on other people's terms anymore. I must free myself from this existential nightmare. 

I am considering trying to just become a fucking capitalist myself. My rationale is that I have observed, first hand, many times, that most people want to be exploited. They not only want to be exploited, they are proud of being exploited and ask for more. They wear their wage slavery like a badge of honor. With many attempts and failures at trying to alert people to the absurdity of this, I have deduced that I most likely wouldn't even need to feel bad or guilty about exploiting people that willingly want to be exploited. Are chains immoral if someone places them on themselves?

I know that the chances of me even succeeding as a startup (especially B&amp;M) are extremely slim, especially during COVID. I also know that I'd probably have to live in a car or something and eat nothing but rice and beans for years while saving money to invest in a company. I have no capital and make $10 an hour. It would take a really, really long time to even get to a starting point. 

My options seem to be just keep doing what I'm doing, vote and wait for revolution (lmfao good luck), disappear into the woods/join a hippie commune, or try to join the capitalist class since I can't fucking beat them. I really don't want to do that and would highly prefer a complete overhaul of the economic system, but I don't think that is going to happen in my lifetime and I have legitimately entered into an existential crisis that seems to be pointing towards make or break time for me.",False,ka53cq,dubspace,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ka53cq/join_the_dark_side/,6,1

1447,I feel like I need to vent. I am so...so....sick of everything.,"I work about 50 hours a week including 20 or so hours selling on eBay and 30 hours a week at my regular job.

The company I work for is pretty much punishing me and not allowing me to change my schedule. 

I just cannot work so much anymore. My wife works full time as well and nothing gets done around the house, I have no time to even have a hobby, work out, anything.

I am not even 30 and my hair is starting to turn grey. 

Apparently my company has a policy that you cannot change your schedule unless you are meeting your ""metrics"" which are a nice set of numbers that keep the carrot of homelessness and starvation in front of you at all times.

This is the most bullshit thing I've heard of. How the fuck does how well I do my job, supposed to have any correlation to how many LESS hours I want to work.

I would actually do better at my job if I worked less hours. I have never, ever been able to sleep correctly. Some nights I can sleep 5 hours and I am fine. Other nights I need to sleep 8-10 and feel absolutely exhausted the next day. I also cannot function as a morning person.

Because of this, sometimes I go to work on 3-4 hours of sleep and half-ass do my job because I cannot mentally perform any better. I've almost drifted off at the wheel before. 

Work does not give a shit. Even though I am ""part time"", I have to work a minimum of four days per week. This is done on purpose so you cannot have a second job.

There really isn't any job in the area that pays as well without a degree, unless of course I want to get into something like a trade, but I'm not going to risk running tools or machinery on 3 hours of sleep.

I've tried to turn my self employment into a full time gig but there is just no competition any more. It's also a pain in the ass when you have to do all the finances and taxes yourself. 

Self-employment also has too many peaks and valleys of income and I got a part time job to fill any gaps. Trust me, I've been doing this about 10 years and cannot make anymore money no matter how hard I've tried. 

I also would have to start paying back my student loans and pay for health insurance out of pocket, which means I'd need to make an extra $1,000 per month just to pay an extra $800 per month. How ridiculous is this? It's a trap called the poverty trap, designed to keep people poor. 

Due to the pandemic, it's hard to get another job right now, and a lot of them pay only half of what mine does. 

So I pretty much have to Stockholm syndrome myself and take a giant pill called bullshit every single morning I wake up. 

Employers don't like people like me. If you have mental issues (no, not depression) or health issues, you are pretty much worthless to them. 

Employers don't like people who can think for themselves and stand up. They want cogs who can't see past the smoke that is coming from a burning pile of bullshit..

They want people who can just bend over and accept it. This is why a lot of people smoke week, drink or take Xanax, because they need to space themselves out from how shitty the reality of the situation is.  

I have no idea what to do. I can quit my current job but then my family sees me a as a failure. I then might have to go a week eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches until I earn another decent lump of money being self employed. Or I can quit being self employed, and then I'd need to work full time, which would be next to impossible given my health issues.",False,katzhx,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/katzhx/i_feel_like_i_need_to_vent_i_am_sososick_of/,8,1

1454,Top 21 Best Comfortable Computer Chairs For Long Hours in 2021,"Choosing to work long hours is a mixed bag. Sometimes, it’s not up to you, but your boss. Working hard can contribute to your success. You gain skills and experience fast, and you develop your grit. Working hard can also feel very rewarding if you value and enjoy your work. On the flip side, you can also burn out, harm your relationships, and make poor decisions in your work because you’re not giving yourself a chance to step back and see the big picture. Prioritizing work often means de-prioritizing other areas, including health. Many people still look at long hour hours on the job as proof of their work ethic. Some historians trace the work ethic to the Protestant Reformation in the 1500s, when working hard was thought to align with the values of their faith.

## Long Work Hours? An advice for your Long Day at a Desk

14,000 hours. If you have a full-time desk job, that’s the minimum amount of time you’ll spend sitting over the next 10 years. Add the nights you have to work late, the weekends you’re called into the office, and those unexpected occasions you end up scarfing down lunch in front of your computer, and the hour count only goes up from there

Americans who work full time log an average of 47 hours a week, according to a 2014 Gallup poll, and some, of course, put in many more hours. While Americans like to pride themselves on being the hardest workers around, it’s not necessarily true, according to global statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Its 2014 report found that overall, Mexicans average 43 hours a week, compared with U.S. workers’ 34.2 hours. But in recent years, researchers have found that working long hours is linked with a variety of health issues. Among the ailments linked with long work, hours are a stroke, heart disease, mental health problems, diabetes, and abnormal heart rhythms. Experts don’t agree on whether all workaholics or workers who put in long hours are cut from the same cloth. The debate: Is it the long work hours or the mentality of the workers that affect health? Some say those who work long hours by choice because they are “engaged” in work but not compulsive may escape the health consequences. And some people, of course, must work long hours just to make ends meet.

## An Office Chair Might Save your Life

If you spend a lot of time at your desk, you know first-hand that an office job can take a toll on both your mind and your body. Whether you work in a medical clinic, at home, or financial institution, any office job requires long hours in uncomfortable positions. As a result, many people experience posture-related back and neck problems. At the root of this problem is the quality of an individual’s office chair. Without a good office chair, you risk not only daily discomfort but the possibility of facing permanent damage to your back and/or neck. It’s no surprise to those that work in an office how important a high-quality office chair is. The difficulty can be knowing which one will work best for you.  

An ideal office chair is one that will not just keep you comfortable all day, but for years at a time. Given the extensive negative impact a poor office chair can have on your overall health, the importance of owning the right one is difficult to understate. Office chairs are not like a pair of shoes; you can’t try it out for a minute or two and know for sure if it fits. To combat this issue, it’s important to have a chair that you can customize and adjust to your liking. You need your chair to work for you, not the other way around

The need for comfortable office chairs that can reliably provide high levels of comfort for long hours has grown tremendously over the past few years. That’s because, today, a huge chunk of our time is spent in the stuck in our chairs. Given that you are forced to sit for about 6 to 8 hours a day at work, a great way to maintain proper health is to invest in an ergonomic computer chair.

1460,Welp.......I’m not getting fired :(,"I have been on a PIP for three months. It was supposed to end this Friday with the understanding/hope of me getting fired (I honestly need a fucking break). My boss said I am a great employee and I am very detailed. I thanked him for the compliment and he basically told me my job is safe. I feel conflicted as I was hoping to be fired. My workload has tripled, no overtime, I have to train a new employee, and I am getting more responsibilities soon. I honestly don’t know how much more I can take. I want to quit but I feel like my measly six months of living expenses is not enough. 

I know that I have to work for now but damn I was hoping to get out of this place. My health is declining and my mental state has suffered. I haven’t taken a vacation since March of 2019, and I am drowning here. My boss just keep piling it on. Everyone on the team is feeling the pressure. We are all snappy, on some type of anxiety medication (we all have a group phone call every week to just chat), and some are talking about retiring earlier than expected. 

With this pandemic going on, companies really have the upper hand and they know it. I made a vow to myself that I will never work for another company after my current role. I just have to hold on a bit more until I have the money I need to just hunker down and work on what I want to do.

1465,Insanity of work during COVID,"Almost everywhere hospitals are getting full of covid-patients. In many countries, hospitals don't even take in people with other diseases and injuries. People are dying. 

But still, normal people have to go to work. In many work places, this means getting exposed to the virus. Workplaces are some of the worst places during pandemic. Even bars or gyms aren't often that bad. If you spend 8 hours/day in a crowded office space and someone there is infected, everybody there is at risk. It's like getting thrown into a pool filled with virus. 

Thanks to capitalism and it's fundamental laws of profit, many of us can't escape that. Not going to work can mean starvation. And the more people go to work, the worse pandemic gets. See the pattern here?

For the greater good, people shouldn't work now. Anybody who isn't doing the most necessary work (for example being a nurse) should stay mostly home for next few months. Only insanity of capitalism demands work now. Reason doesn't. We are living in a system that puts the whole world in serious danger now. And everybody can see the results in the number of dead people. Millions die. It could be stopped if capitalist system is stopped.

1484,Has anyone noticed how some people put on a total show at work?,"The most recent job I have has a close environment with a few other people. One in particular is a younger guy who is either a total dork, putting on an act or both. Hired by from what I can tell either an acquaintance situation or a family friend situation, who’s family owns the company. 

This person desperately wants to play the part of a boss. Embellished their linked in to give them a title they don’t seem to act out at work. What I’ve noticed is a super over the top outgoing personality. I feel like I’m watching a tone downed Michael Scott character in real life. 

Every once in awhile they randomly announce to the rest of us how much they love another coworker after getting off the phone with them. Why? I have no idea because I’ve barely seen them interact with said people. Ive never heard anyone else here do that. When in meetings most of the time you can hear a huge fake laugh whenever the boss says something. When on the phone with other people they talk to them about what he “needs them to do” as if he’s in a position where they need to do anything for him. It’s like he’s engaging in subtle manager speak. There are probably a million other attributes like this I can’t think of yet.

The theres a more insidious side, which is likely not so embellished.  When they interact with offices outside of our area they make very personal paternalistic comments about how people should live their lives, budget their money, and they make jokes about disciplining people or if it was up to them “that employee would be gone”. The best part is that they hardly do anything and will come in towards the end of the day and go “‘Man, what a CRAZY day”

I suppose all this alongside the ass kissing, which the higher ups seem to love, is just to convince everyone else that they’re very important and deserve a leadership position. However despite the act, This is also the same person who cut holes in their mask “to let the hot air out.”

I personally cannot stand the massive level of douche vibes I get from the guy. I suppose it’s their personal goal to ass kiss their way to the top of the ladder and it seems to work, at least here. The higher ups love the guy. It actually seems like they prefer you act the part, because some of the management have been so incompetent about covid. I can only assume they put on that “professional mask” without actually being smart of professional themselves.

Anyway I got a job offer this morning so I quit today using the ""at will"" jargon of my contract. I offered another week notice out of good faith, but my boss was offended that I was even applying to job doing this notice period, so today was my last day. He didn't even have the guts to tell me he had my coworker call to let me know.

1489,Read my post and tell me if this sounds like a dream job.,"I got into this job because I thought it would be a nice break from retail. How very wrong I was.

$15/hr to sit on my ass and answer phone calls, sounds sweet! Yes it sounds nice until you actually do it.

I'm coming up on my 1 year and I am already getting burned out.

I hate how every minute of my time is tracked. People used to go to the bathroom if they got an upsetting call, well now if you go to the bathroom longer than 5 minutes, your time isn't paid. Sounds like wage theft to me, as it takes a minimum of 2 minutes just to walk to the bathroom and back.

I actually got coached ""for using the bathroom too much"". I guess twice in 6 hours is too much. I have to drink a ton of water otherwise my mouth dries out from speaking.

Speaking of speaking, the calls are back to back. Your allowed about 8 minutes in your entirety of a six hour shift to do the following:

\- Log into your computer.

\- Check your emails, which includes a bunch of pointless fucking memos.

\- Punch in.

\- Take the daily health survey for covid-19.

\- Fart, burp, hiccup and take a few seconds to collect your thoughts after someone screams at you.

\- Request any time off. But you will probably run out of your five minutes before this.

Did I forget to mention our computers aren't even really computers, but ""thin clients"", so every thing takes about five times as long to do than using a regular computer.

Your calls are back to back, and everything is scripted. There is nothing new, you say the same sentences over and over and over again. Some of them you have to read verbatim or you get in trouble.

I thought maybe I could just reduce my shift to allow some time for mental health. Nope! If your not meeting your metrics (aka, KPI's) you cannot make any modifications to your shift. Even if your in college. You have to work a minimum of four days a week, so good luck having a second job. Did I mention this is only part time? So I guess you have to spend a required amount of hell er I mean time with them, even though they supposedly offer ""flexible scheduling"".

Your allowed 8 ""occurrences"" a year. This includes calling off OR being late. Did I mention your ""late"" if your one minute over your start time?

They also don't show your number of occurrences anyway. So you just have to guess if your gonna get shit-canned or not.

Did you trip and fall on the way inside and need to get a band aid? TOO FUCKING BAD, your now late.

Your allowed 20 hours a year of UNPAID time off. Did I mention this has to be put in two weeks ahead of time? So you can't use it for any kind of appointments.

So you get eight whole days a year of being sick or needing to see the doctor or anything really. Getting any kind of day off beyond this is like pulling teeth, I've had to submit emergency room paperwork before in order not to get fired.

I've had to put off important health issues because I could not get the day off, and that was the last appointment they had for a whole month.

Communication is absolutely abysmal. Literally every other day there is a new policy and your expected to use those precious 5 extra minutes to read the memo and understand it. You also get coached if you did something wrong because a week later they change the policy again and screw you for going over your allotted five minutes to read the new policy.

Everyone above me has absolutely no clue on procedure because of how often it changes. You can be told one one thing by one supervisor and something totally different by another and if one of them is wrong, guess who gets left holding the bag? YOU.

I'm getting to the point where I dread going in. We are constantly hiring because either the people at the top don't understand that being a being a literal human computer is not an optimal job for many, many people, or they just don't give a shit.

It would be so much better if you could take a very small break of even 60 seconds in between calls, but having any time that deviates from being a biological supercomputer is totally frowned upon.

1498,I've been pro-capitalist all my life and strongly believed in the contribution/reward element of society. That is... until I started my first full-time job.,"It's only been 3 weeks but by god, how I've struggled. This cannot be it for me and the rest of my years. I have just started doing electrical work on a construction site.

I'm not getting into too much details, but I really, really struggle to understand how people can accept the '40 hour' work week (more like 45 with commutes) so willingly.

I can't even unwind when I get home. I'm constantly clock-watching until I need to sleep and realize I've accomplished nothing. Oh, and of course 6 hours pass by so effortlessly when you're relaxing but at work they honestly feel like 2 days have passed.

I'm planning on becoming self-employed sometime, to help alleviate this miserable darkness.

This is the worst I've ever felt... because this is the conventional way people live.

I'm really in a haze right now. My whole political world has been thrown into a tornado.

My pay isn't horrible compared to other places, and the fact that they pay weekly has made it easier to live paycheck to paycheck, but even so the fact that i sell my time for $13/hr is painful. And the amount of people in my life who have told me ""thats just how life is"" is depressing.

1538,Should i just quit?,"So i started at this company a month ago. The manager was gone for that month and i wasnt really formally trained or anything but even then i thought i was doing well, all things considering. No complaints from coworkers or the occasional fill in manager. 

 Then the manager came back 4 days  ago and she is....difficult to say the least. 0 soft skills, rude,lazy, and places her work load on others.  Always on her phone. She is so overly rude/aggressive when instructing me to do tasks i get nervous and mess up even more. If i ask her a question she rolls her eyes or acts frustrated. She literally talks to me like im some lowly servant. Today she told me if i dont improve within a week im basically gone, despite the fact ive had almost 0 formal training from a manager.  I told her this but apparantly that doesn't matter. She also mentioned i should not be asking coworkers for help, that i should be able to do eveything on my own. Um how when one one formally taught me how to do things????

Im feeling escpecially triggered because my last job ( that i was at for 3 yrs) was so incredibly toxic. It was so bad i became suicidal and would binge drink every night.

1540,Control through requirement.,"Why do they ask about your gaps in employment? Why do they ask where you envision yourself when they already have an answer of ideal rather than expecting to hear the truth. They ask a question to hear the answer they've pushed through generation and brainwash. This is control.

It's not enough you come to work for some company doing something that does nothing, you need to think the way they want you to think outside of work. You're controlled and manipulated in just accepting things should continue the way they are, because you're comfortable and have never heard otherwise, or worse, otherwise is met with distain and disgust. 
Everybody doesn't need to be working. Everyone doesn't need to believe the way we've been doing things isn't wrong. We don't need 6 supermarkets in every town of 15,000 people. We don't need however many thousands of mcdonald's there are everywhere. We don't need to be this spineless and unquestioning.

Sure, working is hard and a challenge. But it's not the real challenge, the real challenge is fighting to do what's really in your heart, and actually follow your wisdom and grow and be self sufficient yet ingrained enough in society to be content. The real challenge is harder. But the challenge of work is saturated with actual suffering, without end. Except a retirement, when you're finally ""free"" and unhealthy and crippled, and empty because you spent your whole life doing a repeat of the day before. Those final days where you're finally free, after you've lived so long that time is perceived so quickly because you've existed so long, that one day you'll wake up on your last day, surprised and in the worst possible existential pain.",False,k9adzg,BodieChaulkerson,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k9adzg/control_through_requirement/,19,1

Millions and millions of people are going hungry and losing their homes, and this is in the U.S. - so many other countries are so much worse off. 

Famine is expected to spread across 12 countries. California has had the most active wildfire season on record. This year has seen the most Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded since the 1850s. 

My almost every waking moment is plagued by anxiety. My heart is constantly pounding, and that can’t be good for my health. Every day at work I’m expected to complete a task list of 80-100+ items long while taking 90+ percent of 50+ inbound phone calls. I don’t get assistance and the workload grows. I cry at my desk as I am hounded by calls, emails, reprimanded for not filling out spreadsheets correctly. Left and right being cursed at by customers for being behind while management just shrugs their shoulders and says “it is what it is.” It’s like Groundhog Day. Every day is the fucking same. I wake up, sit at my desk for 9 hours, then go downstairs and sit on the couch for 5 hours until I shower and go to bed. Rinse and repeat. While outside my office window, as I stress over the most unimaginably mundane bullshit possible, the world spirals further and further downwards. 

Last night I thought to myself, what the fuck am I even doing here? I do this job while my life and everything else wastes away. I sit in a position of relative privilege (job security + WFH) and yet I still feel powerless. I feel like I must do something but I can’t. I’m a drop in the ocean. The world is so big but I’m so small. Why does it matter how I fucking feel? 

I’m being driven up the fucking wall. Maybe this fits better in the offmychest sub, I don’t know.

Of you work from home where there's even less of a

When I asked months ago if we could commit to no layoffs during the pandemic like other companies have, I was met with blank Zoom stares and then promptly dismissed. Now when I asked why we can’t just wait until after the holidays, the response was they want to log the savings in the books by year end for tax purposes.

1563,"""just make money from your hobbies bro!""","This is something that gets said a lot to me. So i looked into it. The problem is, everyone else is in the exact same position: even good wages are no longer enough to have a life worth living. We are all trying to side hustle, so much that it's impossible to compete. Every single possible market is absolutely oversaturated by 10.000 competitors, half of which are better/more established than you, half of which undercut the point where you make any profit. I just cannot do marketing effectively either, it  just does not click with me. 

Everything I can do/is a hobby listed below. I tried all of these, multiple times.:

\- Personal training certificate? Nobody has time and energy to workout cause we're all side hustling. You need to get your own clients somehow, somewhere, just like every other sporty type in the area that had the same idea.

\- 3D printing/designing? every other guy with half a brain can work a 3D printer and does so. Even if you have 10+ years experience, people go for the cheapest option, businesses go for the professional facility startups from rich guys. Printing to sell on etsy is what everyone does. True CAD designs are done by people on websites like fiverr for prices that will barely pay for your electricity.

\- Engineering freelancing? see above, cheaper to outsource it to India. I also have a non-competing clause in my current job (it's either  sign that or you don't have a tech job at all these days).

\- Leatherworking? I got all the tools for it, also 10+ years experience, but so does every other guy from the ren faires. Making fashion stuff is completely oversaturated between the big brands already, nevermind smaller starters.

\-Entertaining/fire breathing at festivals? Corona killed that, quite effectively.

1564,Your loss is your employers gain,"I’ve heard a lot of employers are moving their employees to 100% remote and shutting down their offices. In my opinions this is a gain on the employer and a loss on the employee. The employer saves in excess of 10 grand or more a month in utilities, heating and AC, and building/office rent and that cost is passed down to the employee since all of those costs are now moved to their home. There isn’t really a benefit to working from home unless you’re getting paid out the money you’re losing using for your AC/Heat, electricity and water all day.

I started working for a call center when I was pregnant. Training was okay, we weren't doing much customer interaction and I could take as many bathroom breaks as needed. Having a bowling ball sitting on your bladder + constant morning sickness was the worst, but I managed to keep it somewhat under control.

Cut to actually working and suddenly I'm being bombarded with calls from extremely negative people, on top of phone anxiety, on top of not really knowing what I'm doing because there's only so much training can prepare you for ...

My nausea got worse, as did my overall health because my anxiety was severely messing with my stomach. I would take a few calls then have to run to the bathroom to either throw up or spend at least 30 minutes on the toilet.

My boss pulled me aside after a few days and was like, ""Hey, I've noticed that you've been taking frequent breaks and I wanted to know if you were dodging phone calls?"" I just stared at him for a minute and said, ""In case you hadn't noticed, I'm pregnant.

It's been a month since I moved into the new apartment. It's being really great. More space for myself and more conforts. Despite having less time to spend at home, it's quality time. Especially now that I hired a cleaning lady, that stops by three times a week, I didn't have time to keep the house in good shape. And the new gardener is helping too. He's keeping the lawn in good shape. Worth every penny.

Work is also going OK. It's being pretty grueling some days, and three times a week I'm having dinner at the office, which is provided by the company. Not bad to finish some reports with pizzas and beers for free, right?

Actually, it feels good to be at work, you're always with company there. At home I feel a bit lonesome. I've been thinking of signing up for some kind of activity where I can meet some people, but I cannot find the time. This quarter is going to be impossible, given the company targets we have. I'm also traveling a lot for work, mostly national travel by road, but that has implied sleeping fewer hours than usual. It's really worth the effort, I'm learning a lot. Last week I arrived early at the office and the director of my division was at the office, and we had a chat. I shared ideas about potential clients I had in mind and he seemed to like them. He seemed quite charming. That's the good thing of showing up earlier at the office.

One of the realizations I had meeting him was  that he was wearing a quite good-looking suit. I haven't thought about this before. My two piece is from Walmart. How do I want to be like this guy if look like shit? 

I stopped by a place of tailored suits after work, and was really surprised to know how expensive those things are! Lucky me of having a good APR on the credit card. I bought five new ones so I can have spares while some others are drycleaning. They offer, for a subscription, a service to pick up your suits from home, and delivered them clean. I really deserve this treat after all the long hours. This will definitely make me look better, and surely make me happier, right?

I hate wage slavery, but I am always punctual, do my job well, and the only thing that she has to hate me for is that I told her that I can't do the stupid thing where I stand on a huge step and welcome people to the store by shouting out lame jokes and promotions because I get anxiety attacks from shit like that (I am working on my anxiety but part of it is that I feel like a twit because I can see people laughing at me).

1591,"I don’t know where to post this, but I want feedback on this idea. A more reasonable approach to wealth redistribution.","So we all know the biggest issue facing America (and really the entire world) is growing wealth inequality, shrinking middle class and stagnant wages. Right-wing media would have you tremble in your boots at the sound of those dreaded words “wealth redistribution”, but no matter how you slice it, that is what needs to happen to stop us from sliding further into a disgusting dystopia where all is run by mega-corporations, where the only question society tries to answer is how much profit can be squeezed from a single human life. 

So the question really becomes how do you make wealth redistribution palatable? You’ll never get right-wingers to agree to just tax the rich fairly and implement universal basic income, we’re a LONG way off from that. So here is another idea: we completely change the corporate structure, make corporations legally obligated to split a certain percentage of profits with all employees. For example, 50% of net profit goes to “lower-level” employees, then the remaining 50% can be split at the corporation’s discretion between middle management, executives, and reinvestment into R&amp;D and expansion.

I’m not saying this solution would be any easier to implement than UBI and a wealth tax, but I believe it would be far more palatable to the right-wing. Another problem of course is if we don’t close tax loopholes for corporations, this scheme will fail miserably. But on a fundamental level, what are your thoughts? This is a way to achieve wealth redistribution by simply acknowledging that the workers who produce the products deserve more credit for their work! This scheme directly ties workers’ wages to the corporation’s profits, fixing the problem of stagnant wages and shrinking middle class.",False,k781vg,Butt-Pirate-Yarrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k781vg/i_dont_know_where_to_post_this_but_i_want/,3,2

1593,"Company mistreats and takes advantage of us, Now they have no one left to do all the heavy lifting because most of us now have covid.","I work the night shift for a LA mattress company staging trucks to go out for the next day. These trucks can have anywhere between $40,000 to $100,000 worth of merchandise. Each person on average will stage 3-4 trucks a night by themselves, and that includes 300-pound adjustable bases.

Before covid, the job was very hard but paid just enough to stick around for a while. After we got back was when the shit really hit the fan. Our crew was pretty short staffed from having a few people quitting right before covid hit, and them not hiring any new guys (8 people left in a 12 man crew). 

Past 9 months I've seen 5 guys get injured and put on light duty from the extra work of being short staffed(and guys being on light duty). The people above my managers will tell us things like ""We know what a hard job you guys have, we really appreciate it"" and then not give us a raise in July when the Los Angeles minimum went up, while also bragging about how great business is right now.

I got a $1 raise because I'd ruffled some feathers with HR, I'm pretty sure it was cheaper to throw me a dollar than risk me leaving. The People in our first shift are no joke getting paid minimum wage to unload and put away trailers full of mattresses and adjustable bases.

Also, there was a gas leak and both crews had to work a full shift while that was going on, at the time people that worked in the office got to go home. My understanding it was the mercaptan that lacked from the oil pump outside the warehouse, but it was still very unpleasant and I felt very Ill after working through that.

There's some more shit I could say about the company like how there trying to squeeze us like lemons for every drop of productivity now, or the stuff the people in first shift tell me. But I'm going to try and get off this rant and get to the main topic.

So a few days ago one of our leads got covid. He's also roommates with another guy that works with us, and it turns out he also had it. I had to come in on my day off to get tested when I came back after getting the results, I was the only one there on Friday night. Had to help pull 15 trucks with just me and my supervisor. 

They told me to stay home today, I'm pretty sure there are at least 5-6 people now that are going to be staying home for the next 2 weeks. I'm hoping all my co-workers are ok, but it's kind of fucked up that karma is punishing the company for mistreating their employees by giving all their employees covid. 

On the bright side, they can't hire temps to do are jobs. It takes a few months to learn how to operate the order pickers and how to pull the product. The thought of them having no one being able to show up and do the job makes me feel a little better.",False,k7xbpd,rothmal,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k7xbpd/company_mistreats_and_takes_advantage_of_us_now/,12,1

1595,No Training?,"I have posted some of my story here before so this may sound familiar. I quit my tech job a year ago but I'm still struggling to process some of my experience. I guess I'm looking for some insight from others who have been in similar situations.

I worked for a software company that made a cloud-based product used by many well known companies. I started out as a technical support engineer and eventually moved to a different role that was essentially onboarding new customers who purchased the software. At no point during over 2 years working for them did I ever recieve any formal training. We occasionally had meetings here and there that were called ""training"" but it never really helped. The software is incredibly intricate and understanding how it is used and functions on the backend it absolutely essential to do tech support. But the company never really seemed to make any effort to teach employees before putting them to work. 

Is it common for tech companies to provide no training? Or ""training"" that doesn't fully prepare an employee for the work they are expected to do? From the job I had and several interviews I've had with other companies I get the impression that this is the case. The attitude seems to be ""just get your hands dirty with it and you'll eventually learn it.""

I've had some people in my life (Boomers) with the attitude that I ""wasn't trying hard enough"" or ""just don't understand how working is"" which hasn't had a great effect on my mental health. This just seems to be the attitude of society in general.

I eventually quit that job on the spot one day after reaching my breaking point. My experiences have soured my desire to work in the tech industry and although I am currently working toward self-employment I'm feeling a bit lost.",False,k7x2zj,-DoublePlusGood-,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k7x2zj/no_training/,4,1

1612,What's a solution?,"Can we brainstorm together and try to find a solution for me and others?

In my case, I'd love to quit working but that is not feasible for me. I hate working so much that I've even been homeless, and that is also not a good alternative. 

I despise working. I hate everything about it - the concept of it, actually doing it, everything. I've had like a dozen different jobs, and I've hated every single one of them. Even jobs I thought would be OK and tolerable, I ended up hating. 

I don't know what it is, working makes me feel physically and mentally sick. When working I feel like a mixture of: anxiety, stress, tiredness, depression, desperation, sense of being trapped, sense of being fucked, mental turmoil, disorientation, sense of being a slave. 

I often ask, if I have some sort of illness or if working causes or exacerbates any sickness I may have. I'm not the healthiest person. I experience daily a lack of energy, back pain, stomach discomfort, and generally don't feel energetic or strong. I've gone to a dozen doctors, and they all say I'm fine. Heck, they say I'm in great health. I don't feel it though. I wonder if it's a mental issue I have, or a combination with physical health problems. 

When working, I often just want to stop whatever bullshit I'm doing, run away and escape. I start thinking, for how many more years will I have to continue doing this shit? 

I've been thinking of how not to work or how to work as little as possible for over 10 years. I knew I hated and would hate working from an early age. Maybe I'm not a good thinker, but I've come up with no real or good options for me. 

At this point, I'm tired of life and everything. Every day is a struggle. I just want to make a compromise. Find a job that complements my personality and doesn't make me feel like complete shit. 

I'm still relatively young, unfortunately (I wish I was on the way out). Probably many more decades of suffering (life itself and working). I'm getting older, and with age come more health problems and a decrease in vitality. So, I want to position myself accordingly. I'm willing to go back to college, training, whatever if something promising exists. 

Help me find a job, career, something with these characteristics: 

1) Little to no social interaction. 

2) ""Mechanistic."" By this, I mean something where I follow a clear, straightforward script, and do it. Day after day. Little to no room for making mistakes. Something simple, clear, predictable, organized, structured. 

Little to no need to use mental brainpower, be creative, find solutions, think outside the box, etc. I don't want to use my brain or body at work (I know, silly me, that's what work is about-exploiting what you've got). I don't want to spend myself at work, in any way. 

This is a big one for me. After working, I'm so exhausted that I cannot have a life. For example, in a typical job work from 8-4. But in the morning wake up at 6am to get ready, shower, fight traffic, force eat and shit, etc. Finish work at 4pm, get home at 5pm after fighting traffic.  I got no energy after this to do anything except sit down on the couch. Which is not even relaxing or reenergizing, since I've only got 5 measly hours left before heading to sleep at 10pm. Pretty much spend those 5 hours trying not to think about work tomorrow. 

3) No requirement to please people. Especially in-person. No need to fake conversations, smile, etc. No need to kiss anyone's ass. 

4) Not physically or mentally demanding. Not stress-inducing. No hard physical labor. 

5) Decent pay $15+/hour. Hopefully benefits and retirement.

1619,Something I realized,"Last night before going to bed, I was thinking about how in the past before modern day capitalism there were roles created for everyone automatically, and for the benefit of the community. Fathers would teach sons how to hunt, mothers would teach daughters how to cook, and everyone had a role. Nobody was homeless, and nobody was overworked. And this is what struck me - only under this modern economic system is homelessness possible, or dying of a heart attack from being overworked, or having health complications from undue stress via financial hardship. On top of that, most of the work is meaningless and unneeded and excessive, designed to only benefit the few instead of the entire community. The fact that we have to compete for jobs at all is ass backwards. There aren't enough jobs to go around, and most of the jobs that exist are either underpaid, unnecessary, or both. In the past, there was no anxiety of having to find a job, no anxiety of worrying if the next paycheck will cover your living expenses, no depression generated from the feeling that you don't fit into this hellworld. The anxiety, the stress, the depression - these all exist PRECISELY because people are having a healthy and natural response to the environmental conditions they find themselves in. These feelings of dread we all have is our body YELLING at us that something is terribly wrong.

1626,Anyone else depressed from the idea that you'd have to work FOREVER?,"I'm not against working, don't get me wrong. I like working on projects, etc. and by no means I want to just sit and have all the luxuries. 

It's just that the idea that if you stop working, you could literally risk basic needs such as food, shelter, etc. Sure you can work part time but considering the covid situation, the inflation, etc. it's very tough for someone to even survive on a part-time gig. You'd barely be able to afford very basic stuff if anything. Meaning forget about any saving for future. Some people struggle with that even with a full-time job. 

So a full-time gig is required just to keep afloat RIGHT NOW. Meaning you'd have to keep doing it forever if you want to keep afloat.

1632,Someone stab me so I can leave for a few days at work,"Two years ago I started working at a grocery store as a part time gig while in college. My first day the center store manager pulled me into her bosses office and told me if I heard anything in appropriate about her I needed to report it straight to her. That's a huge red flag. Especially on my first day. Turns out what people were saying about her were true. She goes out of her way to bust people's asses over the smallest of things. You can't drink water outside of the break room. If you're two minutes late she will try to get you written up. Must be total black shoes no white logos or anything. The normal crazy shit. Fast forward two years and we are in an international pandemic. I'm one class away from my degree and my job is pressuring me as an ""essential employee"" to work more. I end up working 40 hour weeks minimum. And I'm like ok I like the money and the hazard pay is kinda nice. Well over the summer the night guy they hired called out. Twice. And guess which poor sucker had to deal with it? See since I was the ""newest hire with the least time restrictions"" (bullshit but ok) I was scheduled swing shift. So when the night guy didn't show up at midnight, I was the only one awake to work that shift. So I worked two fifteen hour shifts. Still once again not too bad I got a massive pay bump and overtime on top of that for those shifts. But here's my favorite part. See the first time the center store wasn't there the next day so no problems. The second time she was the only one in charge. And I left at 6am that morning (started at 3pm) and had to be back that same day at 3pm since you know that's my scheduled shift and nobody is going to cover it other than me I guess. The center store gets there at 7 and looks at the one thing I didn't know I was supposed to do (make a peanut butter shelf look nice) and immediately thinks ""that kid did nothing last night and stole massive amounts of time"". So she spends four hours that day watching the security footage trying to find any reason to write me up and get me in trouble. She found nothing except me dancing at 3am working the entire frozen delivery we received late, and working backstock for three aisles until the morning supervisor arrives and that's when I leave since it's already me making $37.50 an hour for the last few six hours. I don't find out that she was watching security cameras for the next two weeks mind you. But one of the other supervisors does. And he hates the center store. So he files a report to HR saying she did this. And HR informs her that this was filed but also informs her she technically did nothing wrong and to keep in touch with them in case something happens as they can offer legal assistance. So one month after finding out that all of this went down because I got told to work overtime overnight and come back later that day you can imagine I'm pissed beyond belief and also seriously burnt out. Because as you know, it's the middle of a fucking pandemic. So my burnt out dumbass starts getting sloppy and I show up to work three minutes late a couple days a week. Well time clock rounds that up to five minutes late. Center store thinks I'm trying to report her to HR and get her fired so she jumps on this opportunity and pressures the store manager who's been an absolutely awesome person to me and everyone else so far into trying to write me up. He sits me down and we talk and I explain I'm burning out I want to finish my degree but I need money to afford the rent because my rent is getting up there in the country as terrible rent. So he gives me a warning and pushes me to finish my degree and asks to not be late. And I try and do ok for a while. We hit Thanksgiving season and we start having people getting sick and calling out normally they get told no doctor's note and no covid symptoms means they need to show up. But one guy gets a letter in the mail from the state health department that says he is required to self quarantine due to his roommate being positive. So he can't show up until he gets some test results. My ass gets roped into working twelve days straight. Only two days of overtime mind you because they stacked the schedule to make sure they pay me as little overtime as possible. So I work it. And I slip up and am late a few times. Just three minutes twice. I get four days off. My first day back after that time off they ask me to work another six day week the next week. At this point I tried to say no but they told me how desperate they were and how grateful they were that I was putting so much time in and I felt bad about the late things so I said yes. I find out I have ten days to finish my last class to get my degree so I start busting my ass off trying to catch up. I take the first test of six I need to finish (this professor is an angel from the heavens if those exist I swear) and lose track of time so I'm  seven minutes late (rounds up to ten on the time clock) yesterday. Center store sees this. I get pulled into store managers office with the center store on his side and get asked why I'm late. And my dumb ass stops for a minute and says honestly I just want to finish my degree and leave this job I don't want to be here anymore. Store manager cuts me off and scribbles on paper ""reason employee says he's late: he doesn't want to be here"" says that he hopes I can get my act together and he doesn't want to see me late again otherwise he's going to write me up and suspend me again. At this point I'm done. I'm tired. I hate this job. I hate the idea that I'm ""essential"" and yet I could still be fired today and replaced tomorrow. I was supposed to graduate last spring. Now I have one week to finish this class so I can get a degree and hopefully do something a bit better than trying to be the reliable guy in a grocery store who always shows up even if it's a little late. My back is in constant pain. My hands are cracked dry and ready to bleed. Customers say things like ""at least you have a job"" and then ""when did grocery's get so high"" and I reply ""at least you have money for food"" and then I get in trouble. I've tried giving myself vitamin c poisoning to induce vomiting and other food poisoning symptoms just to claim it might be covid but at work so they don't doubt me. That's the most fucked up part. I'm trying to self harm just so I can get away. Just for a few days. I worked every major holiday this year. And the only thing stopping me from getting fired is that Christmas is right around the corner. I want to quit but I can't walk out. I'm only working so much so I can stay in the same city as my girlfriend. She wouldn't leave her mom to move in with my parents.  Well. She would actually. But she won't be happy. If someone can come to my work and stab me with a small little knife in the side that would be perfect. I can't take it anymore and I have nobody to talk to.

1633,Studying is slowly driving me crazy,"This is a vent/rant.
I'm in my final year of my law degree in France.I hate it.Its so stressful and I don't have any interest at all in working in this field. But like most middle class french kids after high school we go into law school thinking we are going to get a great job,because it's ~~law school ~~ but that's total bullshit. The market is saturated. And now at 23 the idea of having "" a great job"" is just not interesting to me anymore.
I feel defeated. What's the point of studying and then working ? We're born study and work and die that's it ? I don't plan on finishing this degree it's making me sick with stress. My boyfriend and I are planning on working part time and turning to permaculture for our food with chickens. We are lucky we don't have any debt.we already have land.
Before starting studying I was very creative happy open minded.The idea of not finishing my degree  ( because I can't it's so stressful and making me feel sick) is also making me sick with worry. Our teachers are pretentious pricks,one of them at the beginning of the year said that people who work as secretaries are worthless (??). They act like the only way to be fulfilled and have any worth in life is to be a lawyer or a judge.
I'm sick of feeling like my worth is determined by studies and my job. All I want to do is grow vegetables have chickens and just have a simple life. When you say that to most people they are horrified.

1634,Two weeks of work requiring a MONTH notice. Feel like they own me,"I worked in a job for two weeks and handed my notice in. They told me I had to give a months notice. 

This is nothing but clownery because in my country the Gov website states that if you’ve worked somewhere less than a month you are legally not required to give ANY notice. However, I signed a contract which has tied me into doing a whole month as they clearly realise trapping people is the only way they’ll stay working at that miserable place. They are severely understaffed and since I’ve been there four people have handed in their notice so they wouldn’t budge on letting me go earlier. 

So, I have been trapped doing this for the past month and can finally leave on Thursday. I was actually ill for several days last week so can’t really tell them I’m sick to get out of the remaining days.

Super disorganised, high turnover, i was kinda thrown in with 0 training, told i would be quizzed but never was, etc. The pay is crap, 0 benefits but at the time of accepting the job i was like whatever, itll get me out of the house/i can find something better later. I literally had 2 hrs of formal training but that was only focusing on a very small portion of the job. I still tried my best and kind of went with things. My coworker (who has literally been there only a month longer than me and informally trained me on what she knew) said i was doing well.

Then the manager came back after a month of being gone. I have NEVER met someone as lazy and rude as she is. Rolls her eyes if i ask a question, orders everyone around in a super rude manner, mood swings, 0 soft skills, will just sit there on her phone instead of helping and will complain constantly. She will humilate me in front of customers by pointing out my mistakes/rudley order me to do something (""get this. Do that now.  Come here."") My schedule went from 9-5 to tues-sat to working all evenings and weekends. 
Ive worked with her a week and i already dread going to work. 
Yesterday she loudly said she needed to talk me and then proceeded to tell me if i didnt improve in the next 2 shifts she would get rid of me. I told her id never been formally trained and she said that wasnt her problem, she wasnt here.

1653,This restaurant is open 24 hours!,"I don't think the modern trend of shops and restaurants being open for 24 hours (or very long hours) is good for business.

The majority of those hours run at a loss (late nights are always loss except bars on big party weekends). Most restaurants only make profit a few hours a day of lunch and dinner.

It's horrible for workers because they work longer hours and there's less of them in every shift, so more work per person and less money your boss has available to pay you.

I delivered food in different types of restaurants for several years and online orders didn't care about hours. It didn't matter what time you closed.

It would take the one driver who is still working another 2 hours to deliver everything, and then the next morning, broke students would call demanding refunds because the food was too cold.

Some restaurants experimented with different opening and closing times and it really didn't matter. 10:30-11 am open and 10:00 pm close (stop online orders at 9:30) are like the most optimal for restaurants. Being open later means those people who would have ordered the food earlier would rather get it delivered at the last possible minute.

Chinese restaurants usually close between 10-12 and pizza places sometimes as late as 1-2 am and some restaurants specifically cater to bar customers and stay open 3-4 am (Jimmy John's, McDonald's). They would make money for like 2 hours at night and they couldn't find employees to work just for a couple night hours. So it was always horrible for the few drug addicts who had nowhere else to work. And if you were a student, good luck not failing your classes.

In the old days, it was better because all restaurants would stay open at the same times (very few exceptions like some bars). Most countries that are not USA are still like this. People would only go out to eat at specific times and staff would be plentiful and all hours would be profitable. Pay and employee morale was better.

Corporate managers or even small family restaurant owners don't understand the concept of diminishing returns. They think they can make more money if they stay open longer hours and overwork and underpay their staff, and that doesn't work in real life.

..................

TLDR: a restaurant that's open 8 hours or 24 hours makes the same amount of money per day for the owners. More hours=more overworked and underpaid staff. Online delivery orders will always get submitted on GrubHub 10 minutes before you close.",False,k8ejd9,InMooseWeTrust,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k8ejd9/this_restaurant_is_open_24_hours/,7,1

The amount of heartless soulless calls you have to make for business needs... By the way fuck that expression, as if a business needs something.

I had to fire a woman today because an accountant somewhere decided we were overstaffed watching his excel spreadsheet and now this poor woman has to find another job 3 weeks from christmas and yea just not proud of myself right now. No idea if I am on the right sub for this but man I have been reading and agreeing with the posts on this sub but I could always find a way to reconcile my work and the message in this sub. Today though, knowing I just cost someone their christmas and probably their kids christmas too. Man gotta feed my family but fuck this system where all we are is cogs in a machine replaceable and disposable.

The worst is that this employee has been working there longer than I. Always defending the company and finding excuses for the company's shortcomings... Man ejected like that because there was a redundancy in one of our processes, she became redundant as the finance guys said.

Yea not gonna lie, I played the game and worked my ass off wasting hours in unpaid OT. I was proud of myself when I got that promotion and played by the new set of rules. Just today was unnecessary, this was done to save a few cents down the line. I feel disgusted with myself and the fact I played along. I don't know, I can't look myself in the mirror.

1673,Direction of the Antiwork movement - how not to appear stupid and lazy in r/all and having more people to join,"Hi all. I would preface by saying this- we all hate wage-slavery. We seek to obliterate (or diminish) the opression by corporate entities who seek to maximize stealing the value of labour. Over time we have incorporated various flavors into our movement. Anti consumerism, unionization, etc. We simply seek to make the world a better, liveable place for everyone.

We have grown. Branched out. Our demands haven't been excessive. It's just a slight redistribution of wealth by implementing policies like UBI, universal health care, basic housing space for all and various other feasible, humanitarian policies. But to actually improve society, we need people to advocate for the change. We need to advertise. To show that change is possible.

However, the prospects of a complete systematic overhaul could be... daunting to many. My own opinion is irrelevant. But I just want to ask this. Are we biting off more than we can chew? Is advocating for communism really the direction we want to go, given that many Americans could be... skeptical about it. Why can't we develop the existing system by implementing the aforementioned policies?

Also, recently I have observed that some of the comments and posts are rather... extremist. Do we really want to start advocating for rights of drug dealers, prisoners, etc at this very moment- when our movement is at it's infancy?

Let me know your thoughts regarding the direction this movement is heading towards or what steps should be taken to improve it.",False,k8ezaw,Azuron96,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k8ezaw/direction_of_the_antiwork_movement_how_not_to/,19,1

Basically my situation is this: I'm living in Finland on unemployment benefits (+some inheritance money). I spend money very frugally, just on essential things, a bit of candy or chocolate now and then. 

My life revolves around self-discipline, a daily routine and a self-improvement mindset. I'm practicing saxophone, guitar + singing and juggling daily. I watch a lot of motivation videos and I'm inspired by the likes of Dave Goggins and Jocko Willink. My core values are faith, duty, discipline, humility and hard work. I wish to remain umemployed for the rest of my life, practicing an ascetic ethic and devoting myself to artistic pursuits. I want to volunteer in a multitude of ways, all of which I've done before(can't right now cause of corona): teach juggling for children, teach guitar as a volunteer, do gigs for elders as volunteer, perform as a juggler voluntarily, juggle on the street, perform music on the street.  

I generally prefer performing voluntarily even when offered pay because there's less expectations and I feel much better about it when it comes from a place of generosity anyway.

I've been at my job for a year and a half. At first it was fine because my boss was decent and the money was good. But the overall dynamic of the workplace was shit, and my boss got sick of it and left. Now that she's not shielding me from the shitstorm anymore, I have anxiety about work and a constant urge to quit. Even before that, I was starting to get bored and frustrated that I didn't have the energy to do creative projects.

My former boss offered to hire me at her new workplace, but they don't do WFH, which is bullshit during the pandemic.

Health insurance is an issue, but I'm relatively young and should be okay from now until fall.

But I'm scared to quit. I'm comfortable having reliable income, health insurance, socking away money every month, and thinking about the things I'll do ""someday."" But I feel depressed, anxious, sick, and tired almost all the time. So logically, quitting probably makes more sense than not.

A. John is horrible for this job, not qualified to lead a team

B. He's only getting the promoted because he's been here the longest and no one else here wants the job.

C. The company would have done better if they had hired from outside to fill the role.

In the end, John caused 8 people to quit. It was a rotating door of people would would get hired to work under John, and then quit after 1.5 years. The team never grew and always had a big backlog of work.

Two of the people planned to quit on the same day, just to fuck over John.

I basically have a 70k/yr job waiting, and they think I graduate in may. 

I have around 25k saved up from the internship, and I don’t mind spending all of it.

1695,Christian boss keeps calling my mom.,"I feel like no one is listening to me. Especially people in my life. So here I am, my first post on Reddit. 

My boss is a controlling freak. She wanted everyone to work in her way. We cant use other method for that one solution. We only can use one method for that solution and that's her method. The classic boomer stuff. 

I suffered from depression. I thought she was a compassionate Christian at first. But then she keep asking me to convert into Christian because medication won't help depression only jesus will help. I get that Jesus helped you been through depression, even though I don't agree with, don't force it on me, even asking me to join her church. When I trusted her the most and showed her my self harm scar, she told me to believe in Christ. 

That's not even the best part. She has my mom contact number. Whenever anything happened, she will contact my mom. Like underperformed and stuff like that. But I feel like she never appreciate when I try my 100 percent doing my stuff. She just thought it was normal. But when comes down to small mistake, everything became my fault. She contacted my mom but she ask my mom not to tell me just not letting me know that she has been contacting with my mom. She like to contact my mom a lot just because I did bad at work but actually I was actually very tired. 

My pay is not even high. It's super low. Oh yea. She's also a Karen. Whenever anything goes wrong, she will fight and speak to the management. Whenever things went wrong with me, she will contact my mom. Jeez I'm not a child. 

I used to be a neet, before my mom introduce me to this fucking job. I found myself unhappy and upset everyday. Not even me, my colleague and I felt stressed out because the workload is a lot. And being a kind and compassionate boss she is, she said we don't have many jobs. 

Bonus. I remember when my colleague take leave for her holidays celebration, she messaged my colleague and said the mistake she made before the holiday made her disappointed. She even compare me with my colleague about how ""good"" I am. When my colleague lost her baby and have to take leave for one month, my boss show no compassion. She is like ""I lost a baby before, so what's makes you don't want to work."" Gurl, she just lost a fucking baby and my colleague doesn't want that.

1709,my dream job ruined me,"Disclaimer! Is this a pity rant? Yes! Is my English broken? Yes! (Spare me, I’m learning this language)

When I graduated I was pretty naive. I wanted to work for a small company, where everyone’s like a big family; flexible hours and all that jazz. Yep I know right, but I was young and ignorant...

After 4 years and a few boring jobs later, I finally found That Dream job. The company was new and small, everyone working there were independent contractors (not sure if it’s a correct term in English) and there was a “my own boss” vibe even though we technically had a boss.

The first few months I lived a dream. I had a big ego and a lot of confidence because I had the highest education in that field and the most experience too. For me it was the recipe for success - of course it will be a piece of cake to climb that ladder!

A few years flew by and I was starting to notice red flags. Did I ignore them? Yes! A lot of my colleagues who I thought to be great specialist left the company and new young, freshly graduated faces started appearing in the office. 
Our boss always emphasized our independence even though we had a lot of restrictions and were constantly criticized by some random hired “specialist” with no education (mostly friends of our boss)

Years passed but I haven’t climbed a single stair. I was sometimes working for 12 hours a day with a tiny lunch break in-between, I would constantly do extra work to help the company and... nothing.
I guess my breaking point was when all new young faces got promoted and I found out why I wasn’t. I didn’t care much at first, but then I found out that those people were less experienced in the field and had no/little education. I got curious and indirectly brought this up in a meeting. The answer shook me. My then boss has basically said that they need “representative young faces” to represent their company. Oh, by the way, I was 26 years old then, I looked like an average woman and our jobs had nothing to do with our looks.

For the next year or so, I was so depressed and did my bare minimum for the company. 

Quarantine has opened my eyes. By accident I got in touch with my colleagues who had left the company years ago and I heard very similar stories. I quit that job and started actually freelancing, it’s pretty difficult and I still have to deal with intrusive thoughts of not being good enough.
Anyways, I’m glad I got out anyways.",False,k6kvf4,neuroticandok,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k6kvf4/my_dream_job_ruined_me/,6,1

1717,Just got fired today (Call center),"So after 5 months at a call center ive been layed off.


... And to be honest I feel like just ranting:

I fired due to not meeting standard required statistics which really pissed me off as i did so well... My customer responses was very high 4/5 - 5/5, i only ever had one escelation in my entire stay with this company, when everyone else gets on average 4 a day (escelations is when a customer wants to complain about the service and take it to a higher authority). My overall performance was GREAT. But the business told me i needed shorter phone calls, less gossip on the phone, basically rush calls and get more work done... Quantity not quality here for sure, and what do you know ever since i tried doing what they demanded my customer responses went to 2/5 and none of them enjoyed the call 

I was also fired for having 3 separate illnesses in 5 months.. with the 3rd illness being 2-3 hours long, i returned to work after my pain had gone but they saw this as if i had 1 week off... Fucking 3 hours illness yet its still classed as one that is 1 week. An absence is an absence i guess. 
Stupid thing is i told work that i was getting ill and needed support, yet I was penalised for taking any support (extra breaks etc) 
I had to go hospital today to get treatment for the pain as work made it worse and worse and now all is well and am receiving treatment. I literally told work if i can get time off for medical treatment I wouldn't get anymore illnesses due to being better but no help there...they saw it as another illness and SACKED. 

SUPPORT?! HAHAHAHA. 

Im not so surprised as a few classic red flags appeared during my first weeks
1. Majorly high staff turnover rate (60 people started with me, 45 left/fired.
2. 6 month probationary period (for a fucking call center agent... Um what the fuck? 
3. Couldn't book any holiday in my entire time here (no one could) 

Some extra to rant about includes the fact I'd have inbound calla, spend on average 40 minutes dealing with a case for a customer, phone call ends and not 10 seconds after I'd have management calling asking why i was not taking another call yet... The fuck give me a break... 

I was micromanaged extremely closely. Every day my manager would call me for up to 1 hour a day to ask why this and that happened and why its not ""sustainable for the business"" 
The amount of times my manager would say this along with other micromanaging techniques began to feel almost harassing and made me feel as if there is no reward, only punishment. 
Infact there was no reward working here, not once did i get someone say ""You did good"" or ""Well done"" 

Lastly the old ""Tell me if anything is troubling you and we can see what we can do a a business to support you"" 

Ugh I'm annoyed as hell but relieved too. Working 9-5.30 is soul crushing, i feel i can rebuild what has been lost and damaged now.

For some background, I've been working remotely for a small company in my country for around 2 years. 

So as the title says, I've just declined a new role at my job. It involves remote customer support and I just don't feel like I'm cut out for it. I didn't even think of asking my employer if it'll mean a raise in my salary. I just told her that I'm sorry and I'm not in the best position to do that job right now, which is true to a certain extent due to personal reasons. I thought if I take this on, I'll have to spend a lot of time dealing with people, which I really don't like. Since the interactions are online in social media, my first thought was it means that they most likely will expect to reach me at any time, despite my employer saying I won't be needed all the time. I declined the offer, but I did ask if there are any other roles I can take. She hasn't replied to me yet. My current roles allow me to work on my own most of the time. The pay isn't grand, just slightly above minimum wage in my country. 

I thought I should feel good for taking care of my own mental well-being first, but I really don't.

1720,"""it is what it is"" and ""we're all in the same boat"" are becoming my new triggers","After almost two months of not really making an effort to get new project work, my supervisor finally scolded me.

He's actually quite a decent guy, only a decade older than me and at least tries to seem like he cares. He's gone up to bat for me a couple times now so I can trust him to at least listen to my side of any story. Even though he approached this conversation is a more ""what's going on?"" type of way, it still feels bad man.

I've been doing not-so-well lately (depression and anxiety, lots of executive dysfunction, lack of motivation etc etc. Not caused by working but it certainly is a big trigger and enabler of both of them). It's definitely been effecting my work, from turning things in late to just not making any effort to really find new billable hours (three cheers for the horrid model of work that is consulting). In some of our catch up meetings I've told him how I'm not really into this industry anymore and am looking to go to a new path, maybe grad school or another position in our company if one pops up (huge corporate company, so lots of varying opportunities). He's been very understanding so far but doesn't seem to grasp how my mental health issues are contributing to my lack of quality work.

As for the ""we're all the same boat"" comment, its just patently untrue. The rest of the team is not in the same boat, most of them are usually neurotypical individuals who may be going through a hard time now but understand how to get through it and how to get their mind to a better place. I do not have that same luxury, a lot of times I'm using half my energy to stop myself from having an anxiety attack every few hours, or I'm disassociating from the work stress completely as hours slip by.

1731,If you ever wonder what the big wigs are really like I'll tell you.,"I use to work at a small local bank. It was very family oriented. When you got hired the big boss would meet you personally, learn your name, and welcome you.

Eventually he retired and the second in line took over. I always had a bad feeling about him. The big boss was old school but the new guy felt 'shallow.' Unfortunately I was right about the new top boss. He brought in a guy from a big bank. Changes started happening fast. The branches had to be uniformed. The crews there would do their own decorations to reflect the area before. We had to sell accounts, cards, etc. before we didn't sell at all. You used to have a nice motivational quote when you started your computer, that was taken out. We would get monthly mail from that big bank guy about how to be better employees. Which was just about selling more and liking it.

Then one day one of the new district managers came. I thought he visited our branch to get to know the team. The very first thing he asked me was how many transactions I did so far. He asked that to everyone. Then asked the manager of the branch how many sales they did that day. That was it. This new district manager was young, early twenties, but his demeanor made him seem much older. Like he was already a corrupt business man. I heard through the grape vine that he was from a wealthy family, went to a big name college, and right out of school he got a job as the district manager for our bank cause he knew the big bank guy personally.

1741,A thought occurred to me.,"Automation could replace so many jobs. So many jobs on top of that are bullshit middle management jobs. 

Hell they experimented with working fully-automated restaurants in the 1960's. I'm quite surprised a company like McDonald's hasn't said ""fuck you"" to workers and fully automated. 

The government wants people working and not thinking. Work stresses people out and the healthcare system makes millions off it. Stress is one of the leading causes of death.

People mention the removal of leaded gas heavily reduced violence in the US. I disagree, and think it was the sending of factory jobs to place like China in the 70's and the growth of cushy office and corporate jobs. There really needs to be some mental studies on what 40-50 hours of weekly factory work does to the human body. Hint..it's also why people used to smoke and drink so much and why a good chunk of people are on anti-depressants today. 

Less people working, means more people thinking, and the government does not want thinkers. If more people ""woke up"" and realized just how bullshit everything is, there would be a revolution overnight, especially since we outnumber the 1% 10,000 to 1. 

There is no reason for a lot of jobs to exist other than to print out pictures of slave owners on fancy paper and allocate most of it to a small group of people who can con the general population into thinking ""if you work really hard, you can be just like us!"". 

I can't get over how people can look at someone like Jeff Bezos, who if you earned over $150,000 PER DAY since the birth of fucking Jesus Christ, would not be as rich as him, and then someone on the sidewalk begging for change and go ""well, I guess that's how it has to be"".

Boss tells me that I have nothing to worry about, and what a great opportunity this actually is for *me*.

I felt like an absolute shitheel for even listening to it, and much worse for having to make my mouth say words to my boss that sounded like I didn't mind doing this.

I do mind. This place has always made me feel extreme anxiety about job security, precisely because I know they do things like this. I wonder when it's my turn in the barrel, and I desperately need this health insurance/steady paycheck, so it's a mortal fear. The owner knows this but threatens to fire us at every meeting.

So, the thing is, this co-worker is a crappy person. I'm not sorry they aren't ""part of the team"" anymore, because they always made things stupidly difficult by playing power games. However, 2 things:

1. This person has kids. It's almost Christmas. That just *suuuucks.* Especially for a single parent.
2. I feel like I'm one of those characters in Kill Bill who beat up Beatrix... you know... a bad guy... because I have to do this sneaky shit to protect the company in order to keep my job.

I don't actually give a shit about the company. It's mostly just a way to vacuum up lots of money to the owner while we kill ourselves in fear. COVID has been *great* for ""reducing turnover"" and ""increasing productivity"". But I do give a shit about my co-workers, even when they are assholes who I would have fired way before the pandemic.

They knew this person was a problem for over a year. But suddenly now? They can't wait until after the holidays? They had to get me to unplug my co-worker's access at night when I'm technically not supposed to have to work anyway? Also, this is not at all my job?

Yeah, I didn't like working with this person, but I would rather someone like that be given UBI to stay home and not have to be part of a team of people. Driving them into poverty right before the holidays? Nah fam... I feel terrible about that.

All this stuff is fucking bullshit that no one believes.

**No bullying, anti harassment, fair treatment, standing up for core values, no discrimination, making worker's lives comfortable, respect, meritocracy, whistleblowers, standing up for yourself etc etc.**

Its all fucking bullshit that no one deep down believes. The funny thing is many companies all said the same shit. And surprise the most established firm I worked for ironically did the complete opposite of those values.

Even if they don't directly bully like calling you a names, what's to simply stop them from giving you a hard time by overworking you, saying you make tons of mistakes and finally in your end review, saying how shit you were? After all if they say you were a crappy performer, then clearly you're in the wrong and therefore its you who's failing these values. Think about it, all these values and support are given to workers assuming they are good performers and therefore deserving of it.

Also another thing, you report me to HR. But do you have any direct proof of me doing anything against you? If not then you're just a damn troublemaker. A low performing one too! Do you think the firm will take the side of a low performing troublemaker over me?

People know all these rules or values ain't gonna stop them from being assholes. They'll just work around it. For example they say you should discriminate against some older lady who's going to be on maternity leave for promotion? Ok then I just say the other person has done a better job and he should get it. Since reviews are subjective or different metrics are arbitrarily given more importance, the boss has done nothing wrong to snub that lady. After all we hire and promote the best people right?

1758,"Ethics, Covid-19, Corporate greed + deliberate overcrowded indoor Funerals at mortuaries: Creating more business.","R/antiwork,

I'm a mortuary assistant.  Lowly, underpaid, no benefits, my primary gig is making sure funeral services run according to families wishes. 

Since the pandemic, the Corporate mortuary I work for in a major US city, has bare minimum--ignored CDC guidelines.  The management ""say"" they follow guidelines/reccomend less than 50 attendees but ""cannot enforce it"".  Meaning, everything has been business as usual the whole time unless a family self-imposes C19 restrictions.  Masks are required in the building, that's about it.  We do traditional services with 4 hour wakes.  People sing, hug, lean, blow noses, sob.  It is hard to distance when you are a pallbearer.

This week I've seen gravesides with 250 people with no distancing, limited mask use.  There's chapel services with 100+.  Management is pushing CATERING packages to be held in a windowless, interior room.  A lot of the families we see are not out of the incubation period from being present with their loved ones who DIED of Covid.  We are doing double 'couple's' services, business is booming with Covid cases.  

Other mortuaries in the same corporate DO restrict how many are present.  The manager at my location won't budge on making it safer for employees, some who have cancer or are elderly.  We all need the income to get by right now.  

The State Funeral Board where I am virtually has no power unless the governor makes firm mandates (A spineless loser this whole thing).  

Who do I go to to petition for some goddamn sanity here?  If I quit, my coworkers are still trapped in this nightmare and will lose health insurance or homes if they quit.   People 100% have to be getting and spreading Covid at these funerals.

While this may not be the right sub perhaps, those at r/askfuneraldirectors have been modestly helpful or outright resistant to acknowledging this fucking attendance problem.

Onboarding was basically nonexistent, partly because of COVID, but even before that, it was like I wasn’t even working there, I got so little training. The straw that broke the camel’s back was when I wanted to take time off when our family dog died, and my boss said “I’m sorry but that’s not our culture.” What the fuck? 

My last day is next week and I have *completely* checked out. I feel bad for leaving my coworkers/peers in the lurch, because they were kind and hardworking and they don’t deserve the extra work that will be piled on in my absence. My clients/customers/whatever you want to call them are similarly left behind. But I can’t bring myself to do anything for this company anymore. Why should I help when I feel like leadership has gone out of their way to treat me like shit? It feels like so much of my energy was put into trying to be a good employee and now, it didn’t matter, it never would have mattered, and now I’m too burned out to care. 

If I were talking to someone, and they told me all of this, I would tell them to spend their last few days on the job surfing the web and day drinking. I think I need someone to do that for me. Tell me I’m not defined by my job.",False,k6n34v,Reputable_Sorcerer,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k6n34v/i_quit_my_job_im_checked_out_tell_me_thats_okay/,6,1

1774,Is there a solution? Symbolic exchanges with loved ones,"I've been following this sub for a little while now, and while I agree with the sentiment, it feels a bit like we're using work as a punching bag rather than find solutions to find meaning and fulfillment in our lives. I was watching [an overview of Baudrillard's philosophy](https://youtu.be/1Yxg2_6_YLs) after reading this week's pinned post about the Society of the Spectacle, and I thought maybe I saw a glimpse of a solution.

If we spend more of our time focused on exchanging symbolic value with the people we are close to rather than amassing commodities, we might end up with a more content mind. For example, I DM some D&amp;D games for some friends, and I find that producing this to them is very fulfilling because the quality of the work is not a great factor in the symbolic value of the product. Rather, the value comes from the apparent sacrifice of my time and energy to my friends, and the ability to create these good times with them.

I guess my point is, perhaps the sort of 'work' that is important to do in this day and age when we have enough resources for everybody is the symbolic kind rather than the larger societal utility kind. We don't need everyone to work wage jobs, but we do want everyone to feel like they belong and can connect with others. Once we're able to get something like UBI, a 4 day weekend, or a base wage that is high enough to survive with much less work than we are currently enslaved to, we'll still have the symbolic work left to humans, which no machine will ever be able to replicate, by definition.",False,k6kcwg,kogsworth,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k6kcwg/is_there_a_solution_symbolic_exchanges_with_loved/,2,1

The startup responded that same day and we scheduled an interview. And I landed the job! 

However, the salary is about 25% less than my current pay - but will grow as my time with the agency does. I dont get health insurance, but I do get vacation days and sick days (which is a dream come true!)

1778,I lasted 3 years at a popular retail place," 

I lasted 3 years for retail and never again. At first it was a ok job but it kept getting repetitive everyday stocking the same stuff over and over. Then i moved to asset protection as a customer host. I was shocked on how much people stole and how bad customers and associates acted. I was so good at spotting theft that i almost got to be a apa (asset protection associate) then my manager quit a year later.

She was the best manager i ever had. She encouraged me to be a apa before she quit. When she left things went downhill from there. The apa position i tried to get got taken by a mcdonalds manager and she didn't know anything about security and shrink. So then i moved to sporting goods position.

They made me cover half the store with no help. I had to do automotive, hardware, food, and pets returns. The returns was fine is just i was one person and i was expected to get the returns done before my shift ends. Now i can sell firearms, fishing and hunting licenses. This company has a bad system for checking backgrounds to sell firearms.

We were taught if a customer wants to buy a firearm we would have to make sure they aren't scamming the system or for nice terms (not a crazy person). Here is where i quit. A customer wanted to buy a firearm. He was already angry and yelling at me from the start. Immediately thats a red flag and no sale. It got so bad when i told the customer no i can't sell you a firearm right now.

He got really pissed and caused a scene by my area. (note this was a week after when there was a shooting on the news from these stores.) So i was still really freaked out because of that. So the customer wanted to speak to a manager. I called my manager and told him what's going on. The customer was extremely nice to the manager while smiling behind his back at me.

So i talked to my manager and told him i'm not selling this customer a firearm. Then he said if you don't sell this customer a firearm i will write you up. So i walked out and quit. I will not be responsible for another shooting.

1797,Fuck the United States of America. Working here is bullshit.,"Income tax is theft. The very concept of the taxation that we face today would have sent our forefathers reeling. The process by which certain taxation regulations even got passed has been shrouded in illegal deception and manipulation.

Today I was reading about the extent and level to which the United States government is trying to regulate cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was created as the antithesis of this. All of this.

The manipulation and deceit surrounding the federal reserve has been astounding. It admittedly caused the Great Depression. We have layers upon layers upon layers over this stinking onion of people's greedy little hands just trying to get any piece of the pie that they can. Banks provide a service in lending, but why are we subject to seizure in our personal accounts from an entity that is so intertwined and incestuous with the government that they both might as well be called Big Brother?? 

At 18 I had a bank account that I accidentally overdrafted getting gas - the charge did not show up until later and I did not know I was over by $2. Two. Dollars. My bank charged me an overdraft fee every single day. At the time I was working 30 hours a week in a minimum wage job while in college full time. I did not have a dime to my name. Without the college meal plan I would not have eaten. And believe me I'm paying that college meal plan back a decade and a half later in interest charges alone. I have not even touched the principal. Anyways, I went into the bank to plead with them to stop the charges. I begged. I cried. Nothing could be done. It hit $200 and the only reason it stopped was because thankfully there was a cap for student checking. I had to pay it off because if I did not I was told it would ruin my credit.

Speaking of credit - everything we purchase in the US is based on owing someone something. We own nothing here. Every asset can be seized by our government at any time, for any number of reasons which may or may not be valid. Who cares? Who is going to protest when there are a number of ongoing protests already happening with no one even blinking an eye? We might as well just put our heads under water and scream into nothingness.

Banks own us. And by proxy the government owns us. The way the government regulates inflation is through the banking system. It's a joke. We are all slaves to an agenda and a system that is milking us for all it can. We eat the preservative encrusted food it pushes at us (I'm looking at you sugar industry), and we get fat on the thought that we are free. We must be anyways because we are allowed to say that.

But are we really? Anything we say can and will be used against us by a court of our peers. People lose their jobs over something stupid they said on a social media platform. Yeah, I get it, racists shouldn't be allowed to be employed in a role where their disgusting personal beliefs might affect their service. But it's a slippery slope. Motive in the eyes of the law holds an utmost importance. But in the eyes of the cancel culture judge and jury ignorance is no excuse. Even if what you meant to say was taken out of context entirely. So how are we free when something that is harmlessly said might cause you to lose a job - which in this country might mean the difference between a roof over our heads or sleeping on cardboard outside? I get it, ostracization as a social reinforcement for behavior and a culture that is against what we as a people want, is a necessary tool. It's been used for biological and evolutionary reasons by all species. But what happens when the lines between what you are ostracized for blur, and it starts to feel like you can't say, do, be anything other than what you are told you are allowed to think, believe, and feel?

We are 27 trillion dollars in debt. An unfathomable sum. By a country that states a reason for the federal reserve is to help control inflation? Why are our justifications swallowed like a spoonful of sugar when they constitute excessive and inexcusable hypocrisy?

Just today, reading about the crackdown on cryptocurrency. The US said it needed to do so under the excuse that cryptocurrency funnels illicit activity. WHAT ABOUT THE 400 BILLION DOLLARS WACHOVIA BANK FUNNELED FOR THE CARTEL??? Those were United States dollars motherfuckers. Everything is just swept under the rug.

The middle and lower socioeconomic classes received next to nothing in terms of relief during the pandemic. While evil corp Walmart who feeds every dollar it can into third worlds regimes to get bottom of the barrel prices in roundabout ways (through the companies who own the products they sell), is allowed to up and up their GPM's while paying their employees so low a bulk majority of people have no choice but to get food stamps. People who wake up and breathe and work their asses off only to be told they need ""government hand outs"" to survive. Let alone thrive. Let alone wake up and have a hope and a prayer on formulating a plan for a different life that does not involve entities exerting their power, keeping it looming over everyone's heads. People who were forced to work during the pandemic, people who remain the most at risk population for getting sick and ending up on the streets because of it.

One time I overhead two judges talking about how the fines for someone driving with a suspended license were not high enough, and that $200 was nothing. But if you've ever been there, you know that to some people $200 is everything. The mindsets and the understanding in this country is so fucked from individual to individual. The people making the rules can never fathom the day to day of the vast majority of the population. And this is a democracy?

We're in the matrix, an ever-spinning web of officials and laws and regulations and backdoor agendas, draining each and every one of us in this country from every orifice they can until we're old useless turnips, and then we're tossed onto the heap pile. Work, work, work. You can reward yourself with a McDonald's burger. An ice cold coca-cola. Six hours of TV a night until you're bleary eyed and useless, and maybe on drugs to numb the grey of monotony and shackles.

Human sovereignty is not this. Education is at an all time low. Family values are even lower. Both parents in the rat race, barely affording the cost of keeping the kids in daycare. Who can buy a house without a leg up from mom and dad? Commercials about medicines who side effects cause more symptoms than the illness itself. Yet we go into doctor's offices and ask for them by name. Our meat factories are places of actual evil, what we allow each other to put into our mouths to make a bigger profit margin is poison.

What is lower than this? In my opinion we are reaching the depths of the degradation of society?

1801,"Wage slavery, but for my family","I work for minimum wage, for my family. The context of as to why differs from the greed of successful corporations - I'll explain. Firstly, the reason I'm paid such a low wage is due to the size of our business, only 3 employees and have only been in motion for about 3 years now. Secondly, the profits go directly to my family, which ultimately benefits me as I'm lucky to have supportive parents, in that sense.   
However, it seems my father (owner of the biz) has diluted himself into thinking this will turn into some turn-key capital acquiring powerhouse of which will support my entire family, the REALITY is we are grinding our fingers to the bone for rich people (luxury automotive repair, I'm the service writer) and the only reason we have a decent clientele base of affluent people is 1. they are the only ones who can afford, and who are stupid enough to buy these luxury vehicles 2. they know we are a very small business and take constant advantage of that fact, both in the sense that they use their economic position (and its perceived importance)  to bargain and take total advantage of my father, who unfortunately bends over backwards at their beckoning request.   
Its painful for me to see how incredibly hard my father works trying to appease these people, the majority of which are alarmingly stereotypical in terms of their unfeeling class awareness. I work on the east end of Long Island, and I want to stress that I work for **literal** billionaires. We started out by doing auto repair on site at the estate of a billionaire with an absurd collection of multi million, yes, million, dollar vintage Ferraris. His influence has since led us to acquire tons of affluent clients and once we could no longer facilitate traveling to each estate for service my father decided to rent a building and take out loans to set up a proper shop. My  family has been, and still is in a state of literal paycheck to paycheck living, the business has not at all helped in terms of financial mobility and now thanks to this venture we are in much more debt than before.   
I started helping my father when I was about 14, seeing the estate of a billionaire up close at that age was the catalyst for my largely anticapitalistic views. Hard to describe how impactful it was to watch another man of my fathers generation treat him and us like shit whilst standing on the polished porcelain floor of one of his 6 garages, knowing I had to hold my tongue as our income depends on it. At that moment any positive sentiments I had about rich people flew right out the door and I began taking serious interest in these dynamics.   
Anyone who idolizes the rich or the pursuit of capital in general has not dealt with rich people on a regular basis, and if they have and still do idolize these things - they are either lost in the myth of meritocracy, or they're a sociopath. 

To summarize, my father like the majority of people idolizes these positions of affluence and genuinely believes with enough ""hard work"" the we too can join them and separate ourselves from financial anxiety. Its blatantly obvious to me that we are being taken advantage of, and at best our business will continue to provide the base level ""sustenance"" which can be provided by wage slaving for a cooperation. None of us have ""business"" experience and have very little ""financial education"" - in short, we are honest people. We don't have health care, we don't have retirement accounts or the ability to save money, my father is 60 and will likely have to work until the day he passes along with the rest of us.   
I wish my family could come to the same conclusions I do - it would be a large source of comfort as I feel ""guilty' for not being stoked to eat the crumbs of billionaires. Above all I wish my family and the millions of others who are in similar economic gridlock could simply exist without this anxiety and struggle over basic needs permeating throughout every aspect of our lives.   


Never let someone tell you wealth isnt immoral. Civility has no bearing on the inherent immoral nature of wealth, and the personal characteristics of someone who holds said wealth are largely unimportant. Although I'd like to add that from my personal experience, most of these people are of astonishingly low personal character.

1807,"It's ridiculous that society is willing to tell us that we don't deserve food, water, shelter, education, comfort or happiness but then act dramatic when we say we're suicidal","I just don't get it. People will tell those of us who don't work that we don't deserve to be treated like adults, and yet they still get dramatic when we become suicidal and then want to know ""whats wrong?"" I hate when people ask me what's wrong, because being treated like a child as an adult is what's making me sad, it's not some other underlying cause. 

I just don't think it's fair to expect people in my position to want life. I'm 26 and I still don't know what it's like to have my own place. I don't know what it's like to be in a relationship or have friends. I don't get to make decisions on what I eat or what I wear. I don't get to decide what I do on any given day aside from what I choose to browse on the internet. I can't participate in family functions or even simple things like going out to lunch with them because I don't have any money. I'm not even in a position to be able to do my own laundry because I don't have a car or money, so I'll sometimes be forced to wear the same clothes for weeks, which believe me I know, is disgusting. 

Not being able to make decisions on my own lifestyle is probably the worst part though. I'd be a vegan if I had a choice, but I've learned that having preferences when you're in a position that you can be kicked out of is a really bad idea, so I eat meat everyday even though it goes against what I believe. I'm in my mid 20's and I'm not even allowed to drink because my Dad won't allow it in his home. Knowing that I have the same rule's teenagers have over them is just so depressing. I'm soon going to be in my 30's and I'll still be treated the same way I was when I was a 13 year old, just because I don't agree to give up 5/7ths of my life to a system I don't agree with. Capitalism really is a cult in my opinion. It's either do it their way or you will be tortured in some form. Whether it be living with someone against your will or being homeless, you **will** suffer. 

I know things could be worse, and I'm thankful I'm not homeless, but I feel like I have the bare minimum of what can be considered ""a life,"" and I don't feel like it's fair to expect people in this position to be happy. I just want to be treated like an adult, not because I take part in Capitalism, but because *I am one.* Until that happens, and believe me when I say I know it won't happen, I reserve the right to want out of this world. 

If pain free methods out were legal I wouldn't even exist right now. I don't get how society as a whole can agree that euthanasia should be illegal and then complain about having to take care of people like me, when I'm literally asking them for a pain free method out. You can't call someone who is asking to leave the world a burden to the world. The people forcing us to be here are the ones creating the burden. I wake up everyday and think to myself, ""I just want a pain free method out."" That's all I want, that's all I'll ever want. I've had this same exact thought every single day since I was 18. I do not want to be a burden on anyone, but I'm here against my own will. You can't force someone to live and then complain that they exist. I'm only here because enough people in the world believe that people like me don't deserve to choose for ourselves if we live or not. I'm only here because of the beliefs of *other* people.

When people tell me to ""get my life together,"" what they don't understand is that on a scale from 1-100, living with my Dad is about a 2 in terms of overall happiness, but when I was working, doing things against my will and being forced to be around others, I was at a solid 0. People don't understand that not all brains work the same way. Some of us really would rather die than be around other humans all the time, but it does not follow that I enjoy living at home. Society isn't offering me a way to ""get it together"" because I'm not a person who can be around others everyday of the week and be happy. My brain doesn't work like theirs, and it never will. I would never choose to work with, or live with people, and as long as those are my only 2 choices I'm going to be suicidal. 

At one point my Dad did kick me out of the house (for a day,) and I can honestly say that even though it was the most terrifying moment of my life, it was also one of the happiest, because even though I was homeless, it was the first and only time in my life where I could call it my own. I realize I would have probably hated it very soon once hunger set in, but really think about how much a person has to 
hate the choice between Capitalism or living at home to actually get excited to be homeless. I'm so desperate to be treated like an adult that being homeless for a day... felt good.

It's too late to get help because I don't even want to be a part of this system that is willing to do this to people. Even if there was a magic button that would make me a normal, functioning member of society, I wouldn't press it. As long as society think treating people this way is okay, I refuse to be on their team. I just want to do everything I can to push towards a world where everyone is treated with respect and kindness, regardless of how their brain works. 

Some humans are just not willing or able to take part in Capitalism, and we're going to suffer endlessly and relentlessly for it. Doesn't matter if you're a good person, doesn't matter what you know, doesn't matter what you do, if you don't have money, it's game over. Capitalists really do believe our suffering is justified, and yet they expect us to not be suicidal? Sorry but that's not going to happen. If they expect to live in a world where they can set certain standards for who should and who should not be treated like an adult, then some people like me aren't going to meet those standards. As long as I'm being treated so badly, just for being myself, I reserve the right to be suicidal. My brain is reacting exactly how it should to being treated like a child despite being an adult. I would honestly question my sanity if I was not suicidal under Capitalism.

1823,"Working doesn't cure depression, and can in fact make it worse","When I was in my 20s I used to be unemployed and to suffer from crippling depression. Desperate for a solution, I allowed myself to be convinced by some friends that I was depressed because I was unemployed. One of them (a very conservative Christian) even implied that mental illness was an imaginary concept, just an excuse of the lazy to refuse to work. So, partly to shut their mouths, I searched for a job and eventually landed one. It was a job with nice pay and benefits. I considered myself lucky and felt happy at first.

The first few weeks went fine, sometimes I couldn't focus very well and I sensed my motivation dwindling but the rhythm was slow and it felt good to be contributing to society in some way. I also liked the change in my lifestyle, it felt more structured and I could enjoy my leisurely time more because I had worked hard before; it made for a nice contrast and a guilt-free enjoyment. At least that's what I was telling myself, in retrospect to reassure myself. 

But then things went south pretty fast. My manager was intent on squeezing me like a lemon (welcome to capitalism), and when I had mastered a task she immediately piled one more on me. Soon I had 7 different jobs to do, daily, in the office. It became a non-stop grind, stopping only for the midday lunch. I began to crack under the pressure and to make mistakes, which added even more stress because there was an extremely low tolerance for failure and ""unmaking"" the mistakes was a a hard job in itself. The constant stress compounded my untreated depression and, despite trying hard to be a good worker, I became a wreck. I dreaded going to work. When I came home, I never managed to practice any hobby because I was too exhausted, and I just ended up in my bed, browsing Reddit on my smartphone, or watching TV series, until the night came. I began to suffer from severe insomnia because I think my brain wanted to delay as much as possible the moment I would be waken up for work. When the week-ends came I slept until the afternoon to recover some sleep. Then I would try to play videogames but my brain was obsessed by the coming Monday, so much that I couldn't enjoy my gaming. I thought that things would eventually improve with everything becoming more routine, but it never really improved; the time just passed a bit faster. The only moments I felt happy were during vacations. Otherwise, I was more unhappy than I had ever been. I began to take antidepressants but they didn't help.

I wanted to go part-time (working only the mornings, or working only 4 days a week would have ironically made me a far more productive worker) but I couldn't. So after a year, I sent my resignation letter. 

My depression is now cured. It was caused by childhood trauma and toxic mental schemas. Working a 9-5 job (which in my case turned out to be a 8-6) was just making it worse.",False,k5qz37,trexanill,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k5qz37/working_doesnt_cure_depression_and_can_in_fact/,7,1

1829,Discussion: What do people here think about the military?,"First of all, please forgive my English. I am from India, and English is not my first language.  
I want to see what people here think about the military, working as a soldier. I myself never was in the military, but know people who did join the military, including my family relations, I have uncles and cousins who were and are soldiers. I have great respect for all soldiers and I admit that military is necessary, but that does not stop me from realizing how terrible the military cultures is.  
Basic Military training feels like brainwashing to me, and military culture itself is borderline cultish. Everyone is made to dress same, have same hair, told they are worthless, denied much privacy, insulted, made to self-blame and broken down before being built back up as a 'soldier'. I have been told that the training is challenging and fun, but at the same time being yelled at for no real reason and group punishments degrade you. It might be necessary to 'create a warrior', it might useful in preparing the soldier to face the stress of combat, but you can not deny how degrading and insulting it is.  
Once you are done with everything and are finally a soldier, good. All those childhood dreams of being a badass warrior fighting for God, people and country quickly shatter, you realize it is all working for some powerful big fat people to be cannon fodder for their dirty work. You are treated terribly and quickly realize that being a soldier is not what you imagined it to be, fighting like rambo all the time, you may never see combat, and do boring tablework mostly.

So, you get brainwashed, get degraded and humiliated as a part of your training and your job, you can  possibly get traumatized from seeing combat and get mental problems, possibly get permanently injured, and possibly even die serving the big guys' interests. You will be worked like an ox, paid terrible wages, have a chance of facing discrimination and harassment at work, you might get bullied. And things do not improve once your service ends, there exists enough studies on how much veterans suffer, and how they have increased chances of getting anxiety and depression and are more likely to commit suicide.

1830,Our CEO is kind of a dick,"I won't go too much into details or mention which company I work for but it's a big company. Several months ago our CEO invited the whole company to a zoom meeting talking about how if we aren't able to get to a certain market share then he can't guarantee that we will all have jobs by the end of this year. We worked hard and were worried about what might happen if we can't hit that goal. A lot of us would be screwed considering we are in the middle of a pandemic and good jobs can be scarce so we did our best.

Fast forward to now and it looks like we hit ""our"" goal but I found out about something concerning. Now, this was never announced to us obviously but a co-worker of mine happened to come across an article with his name in it. When I read it I didn't know if I should be pissed or happy. Our CEO's name was on it mentioning how he broke the record for purchasing the most expensive mansion (within that county but trust me, it's worth a lot) a few months ago. This was shortly after our little company-wide ""zoom"" meeting and happened before December.

Like dude....What the fuck? He threatens our livelihood and brings up how if we can't do our job correctly (he cursed while talking to all of us too) then he might have to lay us off but then goes and buys the most expensive fucking house during a pandemic?

&amp;#x200B;

For a better understanding: my company recently announced that everyone from every department has to start working half-day Saturdays (with no salary increment). For me and my department, this is ridiculous because we usually get our tasks and deliverables completed by 5pm (we work 9am to 6pm). So logically there's no need for us to come back on Saturdays be it for half-days or full-days.

&amp;#x200B;

We actually voiced out our concerns like why not have the affected departments come back to work Saturdays instead and get paid OT for it. And just please don't drag the rest into it with those departments. But nope, our boss threw a full-on adult tantrum. My entire department got a stupid warning letter just for voicing out our opinions like what the fuck even. Thanks for making an enjoyable job into one that we so fucking hate!

1847,Frustrated with my friend,"So, my best friend is a libertarian conservative and is very pro-work (in the capitalist context). He was the one that pushed me to get a job (as opposed to trying for disability again). I eventually landed a job I could handle and don’t completely hate (though it’s been bad for my mental health, my body can take it). Anyway, at one point I asked him why he was encouraging me to work, he said he felt like it was his job to “lead me down the right path” 

He and I have been trying to convert each other for a long time, I’m a communist so we are pretty much polar opposites. However, I don’t like being manipulated. He went on about how I should be trying to “get ahead” and that will make me happy. I told him if it wasn’t for him or my boyfriend, I’d definitely have chosen death over working for the rest of my life in the capitalist system. 

I’m not interested in “getting ahead” the very idea is exhausted to me, I just wanna have a good life, and none of that involves selling my soul to a corporation or having power over others. 

He doesn’t believe in universal healthcare (despite the fact that I would have died without medicaid, which is tax funded healthcare for low income people in America). He also doesn’t believe in covid *bangs head against a wall*

Whenever my boyfriend and I are having financial problems he asks “what are we spending on that we don’t need” and we’re out here living out of our 30 year old truck in the middle of winter. 

I should mention that his family is owner class and he’s relatively privileged

My company finally had to let us start working from home after resisting people begging for the chance to do so, hours got cut until at least March next year, I no longer had to spend 2+ hours of my free time commuting and I get to sleep in more, and even though I can't travel, I'm loving that I am actually spending quality time with my family (live in a multi-generational house because it is normal in my culture) and have time to do hobbies at home and facetime my friends and visit them now that lockdown has been lifted. I no longer sleep half the weekend away because I'm forced to wake up at fuck o'clock and commute and am exhausted from wage slaving. 

But I know this won't last forever..........and I don't know how I will ever be happy again living the 40 hour a week wage slave life now I have had a very good taste of life without it. There is no anti depressant in the world that will make me OK with going back to the old normal of my life revolving around work, and having almost no free time out side of work. 

And what is scary is that I am still a racial for wanting to keep a work/life balance and not being desperate to return to wage slavery. I am only in my mid 30s.

1. When you recruit a candidate you are not only recruiting them, but their
families too.

2. Please keep in mind that the best candidate may not have the best resume
writing skill. Always look beyond those 2 pages.

3. Most of the job seekers don’t need a bungalow, Errare, or a 6-digit salary. All
they need is a quality Good to survive.

1859,"“You’re not essential so we will cut your hours this year to save money, and then tell you you’re a bad worker because you’re not getting as much work done as you were before”","I make the least in my small organisation and only a few of us had our hours reduced when covid hit because we are the “least essential”. We are the lowest paid in the organisation so this will barely make a dent in the organisation’s bottom line but has caused me to now frequently use my overdraft because it’s just not enough. My workload didn’t decrease at all, so it’s just more stress for a fewer amount of days and there’s a silent expectation that I’ll still working 5 days a week, which I refuse to do without being paid for that much, and I can tell I am being resented for that as my other coworkers who had cuts keep doing the same amount of work without pay. 

I’ve been dealing with intense depression because of covid and the stress of making less money becomes harder and harder every month this goes on and my bosses seem completely out of touch as to why my work isn’t as great as it was pre-pandemic. I’ve been called up on every mistake and now have the “big boss” cc’d in every interaction with my manager but nobody has once asked me if I’m ok. I can’t even get a new job because I’m an immigrant on an employer-specific visa and I need my permanent residency to be approved before I can work anywhere else and covid has slowed the process down. 

I have been so depressed, I’ve been to the hospital twice for severe depression and only took one sick day, and I told my work I’d been to hospital and provided doctors notes and yet received no empathy. I can’t even recover from this depression and try to heal because all my energy needs to go into my job. I was studying part time to try and improve my future prospects and I had to drop out because I had such limited capacity for anything and I needed to keep my job. To have so little emotional resources and use them all to continue a job where I am told I am not doing enough in return is so degrading and if this was a romantic relationship I would be told to leave because this person is abusive, whereas for jobs it’s just part of the way the world works and I better just get used to it. 

To add insult to injury my boss who knows how much I’m currently getting paid (which is barely enough to live in this city even with roommates) asked me if I’m flying home for Christmas as if that’s something I could even dream of affording this year. And I had to smile and say “no, not with everything going on” to be polite while thinking about how I can’t remember the last time I didn’t need my overdraft to get through the month. 

To make these financial decisions for other people in their lives and then be so oblivious or out of touch that you don’t even consider the impact, and then to scold them for being emotionally impacted by that decision as it makes them less productive, or to not continue to work full time hours after a pay cut is so repulsive to me and the prospect of having to be treated like this for the rest of my life makes me feel suicidal. 

I work for a non-profit lol, and everyone acts like non-profits are so much better at treating their staff well but it’s all still the same old bullshit but with lower wages because “we’re a non-profit!” 

This year has just solidified my already growing views that this whole system is just a giant joke and you are entirely set up to fail unless you’re born into wealth or make some incredibly lucky choices when choosing what you want to do with your life before you’re even old enough to drink. I’ve become an angry, jaded person and I hate it. And people say this shit is beneficial because it gives us “purpose” lmao. If this is what purpose feels like then I don’t want it.",False,k5w49e,apostatehobo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k5w49e/youre_not_essential_so_we_will_cut_your_hours/,2,1

- identified public sources of water, electricity and WiFi
- put $40k in a mutual fund (which I should theoretically be able to draw $1600 a year from) and planned how I'm going to eat for no more than $1600 a year. (Even if the stock market ends up being shitty, it still should be enough to last me 25 years, which should be enough time to get my passion projects off the ground since I can work on them full time. If push comes to shove, I also know how to dumpster dive.)
- had a few ""trial runs"" of not living in a house, and learned what to avoid

Has anyone else done this or is thinking about doing this? I'm not sure if I should tell my parents about my plans. I'm 100% sure at least one of them would freak out if they knew.

I could lie to them, but I'm afraid they'll find out eventually since I want to stay in my current area where all my friends are. If they do, it might be worse than if I'd just been upfront with them to begin with. Maybe they'll understand if I explained all the precautions I'm taking?

1887,Cameras at work,"Is it just me and my line of work or is everyone relentlessly watched at work on the cameras? I've had multiple jobs in the past few years where we've been watched 24\7 on the security cameras, and threatened that our managers and bosses can see when we're not being productive.

My first job at a retail store had cameras in the store obviously to catch shoplifters, but I heard that after I left they added a camera under the counter where the girls worked at crotch and butt height, and the husband of the owner would watch daily.

My next job at a doggy daycare, my manager would watch the cameras religiously and confront you if she saw you on your phone or speaking too long to a coworker. Then she would go home after her shift and continue to watch all of the cameras for the rest of the night.

My current job has cameras everywhere. My boss's husband watches the cameras every hour of every day. He keeps them on at home, when traveling, while working. According to my manager one of the cameras records audio and they regularly listen, so we have to be careful with what we say. (I'm pretty sure this is illegal?) I didn't find this out until I had been working here for three months. (I'm currently trying to leave because there's no masks, social distancing, or covid protocols at all.) 

It puts me on edge every single day I'm at work and I'm positive this is affecting me negatively in the long run. My paranoia is leaking into my everyday life. I'm always on edge. I don't have any trust in my bosses, coworkers, or their family members apparently. Knowing I'm being watched by my boss's weird husband is anxiety-inducing and makes me extremely conscious of what I'm wearing daily. 

This sucks. Is this a commin thing? Or and I just extremely unlucky about being watched at my jobs?",False,k4oln8,firesidepoet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k4oln8/cameras_at_work/,10,1

1891,"Being fired for not giving 100%, while giving 100%","I'm gonna tell you about what happened last time I had a job.

In April I was employed at the post office (mostly sorting letter formats, stamping, etc.). I probably had some more luck getting the job, because I have a certificate about disability due to my severe mental illness and where I live companies must have a certain percentage of workers with disability (to help inclusion). Everything worked fine for months, even if it was quite hard for me because of my mental struggles.

Then one day there were a lot of factors influencing negatively the particular task I do, for example I got boxes of letters not neatly arrayed, but all over the place, which meant I needed to arrange them myself. Also the machine I was working on had a lot of problems and I had to call the mechanic several times.

So of course the carts with workload accumulated at my work area and the shift supervisor came over to me and asked me why I don't give 100%. I tried to explain the factors making it hard that day, but she interrupted me, starting to get personal, implying that I'm worse than anyone else on this planet.

Not only did I do as fast as I could, I was also one of the few workers staying longer when asked and helping others, when I had completed all my tasks.

The next day I was called by the staff manager. She wanted to push me into quitting on my own (which would bring me more problems in the future than if they just fired me), but for a solid 45 minutes of discussing I refused to quit.

I brought in the employee representative and the commissioner for the disabled and they were appalled by the way I was treated. They worked out quite a good deal for me. They couldn't change that I was being fired, but the post office company had to pay me for another 1 1/2 months on leave.

This wasn't the first time the shift supervisor fucked up that hard and from what I heard she got into trouble because of this. I guess this is a perfect story on how to lose hard working employees by demanding perfection in an imperfect system. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I was fired for supposedly being too slow, while there were other factors making my workload aggregate. After involving the employee organization, quite a good deal was worked out.",False,k4j7e5,TrapaNillaf666,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k4j7e5/being_fired_for_not_giving_100_while_giving_100/,22,1
1892,Is it just me or recent interviewers are getting worse and meaner (rant/vent),"Hi, I usually would post these kind of rants under the monthly thread but I couldn't find one.

Anyway, I have reached a few final stage interviews over the past few months. Every one was outright horrible/ made me eyeroll. If I keep on doing interviews, I might end up getting PTSD from the humiliation and debasement. 

In the end, I accepted the offer from the interviewer who wasn't snobbish. He was genuinely curious about my past experience without being condescending. 

I have met interviewers who probed about my privacy. They want to know my educational history down to elementary school, why I didn't stay in the States post-graduation to work (I'm non-American) and also wanted to dig deeper into the health issue (which is depression that I'd rather not reveal).

There were also two guy interviewers who made sure to put me in a tight spot. One of them made a snide remark when I was elaborating on my skillset. He probably was not impressed that I would choose to talk about such a ""basic"" skill. Honestly, if employers did not turn interviews into hunger games, we didn't have to bullshit them all the time. 

One interviewer wanted to know my passion and specified that he didn't want textbook answers. I already knew by then that the work must be demanding and exploitative. I hate it when people glorify their jobs and the hustle. If he wants a ""passionate"" worker, I'm sorry to say that I'm not one. I won't do a sloppy job either, just don't use those buzzwords that make me want to puke.

The most horrible experience must be the ""I want to know all"" interviewer, asking irrelevant questions and invading my privacy. I hated that dude to the core so when their HR extended an offer, I turned it down without a second thought.

I have learned from experience\* that if you hate the people who interview you, it's likely that you'll hate the job. Being antiwork + bad work environment is a devastating combo.

\*My ex-boss was my final interviewer. He spent an hour to tear apart my resume and acted all snobbish. as if  should be grateful that they were giving me an offer. Hated that dude too.",False,k4jhox,themajesticfox5315,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k4jhox/is_it_just_me_or_recent_interviewers_are_getting/,13,1

Basically, you don't give a shit anymore. Your hopes and dreams have vanished and the only possible relief would be just not working anymore. I don't know how much this sub comes in contact with the NEET sub, but I think this has happened to me. 

My current job isn't even too horrible. It's a chill night shift at a medical facility, and despite COVID, it's been calm on my unit. I'm a front desk clerk, and even though it's extremely low physical effort, I'm always tired. Ofc, this is because I have no fulfillment outside of work.

1895,I really hate those Online Training Programs you need to do every year and try my best to rush through them,"Yeah. I know whats the purpose of them. Heck as someone who was in audit I know the importance of ensuring employee's adequate training and familiarization with the firm.

But its all just a rubber stamp process at the end of the day. To say hey we did out job and told our staff about what they should know so you can't blame us!

All this stuff is fucking bullshit that no one believes.

No bullying, anti harassment, fair treatment, standing up for core values, no discrimination, making worker's lives comfortable, respect, meritocracy, whistleblowers, standing up for yourself etc etc.

Its all fucking bullshit that no one deep down believes. The funny thing is many companies all said the same shit. And surprise the most established firm I worked for ironically did the complete opposite of those values.

Even if they don't directly bully like calling you a names, what's to simply stop them from giving you a hard time by overworking you, saying you make tons of mistakes and finally in your end review, saying how shit you were? After all if they say you were a crappy performer, then clearly you're in the wrong and therefore its you who's failing these values. 

Also another thing, you report me to HR. But do you have any direct proof of me doing anything against you? If not then you're just a damn troublemaker. A low performing one too! Do you think the firm will take the side of a low performing troublemaker over me? 

People know all these rules or values ain't gonna stop them from being assholes. They'll just work around it. For example they say you should discriminate against some older lady who's going to be on maternity leave for promotion? Ok then I just say the other person has done a better job and he should get it. Since reviews are subjective or different metrics are arbitrarily given more importance, the boss has done nothing wrong to snub that lady. After all we hire and promote the best people right?

In short all this stuff they preach in training doesn't really work. No one really takes it seriously or even if they do on the surface, they'll just work around it.

I’ve never been scheduled for a 9 hour shift usually it’s 8 hours. 

But I don’t know what to do, it’s already difficult for me to get through 8 hours of retail work (mentally and physically, which is why I prefer 6 hours or less), I don’t know how I’m expected to get through these long shifts. Also is it even legal?? Like I’m expected to work 9 hours and only get a 30 minute lunch? I don’t understand. I’m trying so hard not to storm to my manager and ask what in their right mind made them schedule someone for 9 freaking hours!

Side note: I really don’t want to hear people saying “well I work 10+ hours so this is nbd” the whole idea of this group is to point out BS work policies in our capitalist society, so you working 10+ hrs and me working 9 shouldn’t be the norm.",False,k4ipes,extracaramelfrap,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k4ipes/scheduled_for_9_hour_shifts/,19,1

Which, in my opinion, is toxic as fuck.  Who is going to bring you the food? Someone working, perhaps? Someone else should work so you have shelter, right?

Or to barter your time selling apples, getting currency to then trade for someone's efforts laying brick to build you a house.

1927,This is what I wanted to be when I was a kid.,"Mind Pathway Foster
21 November at 03:41 - @

| remember watching a YouTube video about a fera lady who
built her own home in nature and lived on her own, using fresh
spring for water and cooking on the floor of her house (which
looked beautiful), and a guy was intervening her and went
“Isn't this inconvenient though? To have to light a fire every day,
before you can even make tea?” and she shot back “Isn't it
inconvenient for you to work 8 hours a day just so you don't
have to light a fire?” and | was shook. His lady knew what's up
while we were still babies. Legendary savage.

The only way I feel to get out of this mess is to study to get such jobs wherein you find a meaning to your life. It's a tough take, i know, but I can try atleast.

1931,Left my job today.,"I am 20 and I live with my girlfriends parents, have been for the last year. I am in college and this semester due to COVID it was all online. I decided since I had the opportunity I could make some extra money from working. I aged out of foster care so I get a government stipend every month and my college tuition waived. I started working at a cell phone repair store with not much experience. I learned how to do it from ifixit.com. Where I worked is kind of like a small booth in walmart all by myself. They had me doing 40+ hours a week. The pay was 9 base up to 13 and hour if I made 1000 in sales that day, also I received 3 dollars for every phone case I sold, they went for 45 each. 
I told them several times I can only work around 25 hours a week due to my school but they were understaffed and always had a hiring sign up. I gave them a two week notice that I needed at least 3 days off to catch up on my math homework but they only gave me one day off. I was at the point where I was bringing my iPad to work to do my homework there. 
I have been considering leaving and just doing repairs on my own because I think I would make more. I was pretty much there 5-6 days a week all alone in the store  getting 300-400 a week. If I wasn’t in school I wouldn’t mind it that much but I have finals coming soon. 
Last night my laptop became water damaged. It was my day off and the store closed at 8pm and I came in with my work uniform around 9pm. I took off the bottom of the laptop to get the the electronics inside it and heated it up with a heat gun after disconnecting the battery, my experience is in iphones so I did not know much about laptops. After trying to get it to work for 30 minutes I gave up and pack up to go home, I took off my work shirt and left it on the desk and sent a picture of it to my work chat. I thanked them for the employment and apologized for resigning suddenly left the chat then deleted the app.",False,k4q914,Zuglaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k4q914/left_my_job_today/,2,1
