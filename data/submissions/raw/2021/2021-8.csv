I don't know how to interact with customers. It's hard for me to smile at them and use the right tone of voice. It seems like even when I try to act polite and professional I come off wrong. I don't like all the chaos and I can't multitask for shit. These places are too noisy as well. I quickly get tired of loud sounds. These kinds of jobs just make me feel incompetent and drained. When I try to do jobs like this, my thoughts quickly start going to some extreme places. I haven't had much experience working normal jobs, but what I have done I consider intolerable.

23,How am I supposed to work when I hate working?,"I’m 21 and have been working for almost 3 years. I was lucky that I didn’t have to get a job in high school. I worked a retail job that became hell on earth, bad enough to drive me back to self-harm, I’ve worked 2 different jobs since that one. I just recently quit my last job and am now in the process of looking for the next one. My problem is I fucking hate working. All I ever get is breadcrumbs, I can’t afford to live on my own because I would blow through my savings in a couple of months tops. I’m stuck living with my parents when all I want is freedom and independence, which to me looks like a hopeless dream because I’ll never get paid enough to afford it. 

I’m told to get a higher education so that I can qualify for higher paying jobs. But I don’t know what I would even take since I don’t want to be stuck working and miserable like I have been for the next 30+ years. Plus the cost of university is insane and chances are high that I wouldn’t get a higher paying job anyways.  

To make it harder, I’ve developed a burning hatred for capitalism and this “life” I’m supposed to live. Corporations only care about making money and all I am is just a tiny replaceable cog in the machine. I don’t know how I’m supposed to do this when I already hate living this way. How am I supposed to survive this way? Please give me advice or suggestions for what I can do, my parents are no help since they don’t understand my views. I really don’t want to end up working myself until I kill myself in the next decade or so.",False,pfdmwp,SealSocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pfdmwp/how_am_i_supposed_to_work_when_i_hate_working/,9,1
24,Does anyone else feel like this sub is harming their mental health?,"Hi all, I am a long-time follower of this sub but I've been having a few conflicts about it and I'm curious what others' thoughts are on it.

Like many, I subscribed to r/antiwork in 2020 during the early days of the pandemic. I don't remember how exactly I discovered it, but I was instantly hooked by the content. There's mountains of literature out there about how the pandemic shattered any remaining vestiges of capitalism being even a somewhat sustainable model for humanity. Also like many, I moved to 100% remote from March 2020 – August 2021, and my life improved 100-fold.

Now life is returning to 'normal' which means commuting, being stuck in an office for 8-hours a day, lugging food, missing my family – the list goes on and on. All of this personal stuff completely leaves out the rampant exploitation of workers in this system, which was laid completely bare.

Here's the problem. Prior to the pandemic, I accepted, although somewhat begrudgingly at times, that my life was going to be marked by 40 more years of commuting to an office 5x a week making work that I now find boring, uninspired and frankly, bullshit. It was an intractable part of life. The pandemic and the problems this sub helped expose has opened my eyes to the sheer oppression of this system and how horrible companies are pretty much across the board. But now the content just depresses me.

There isn't a way out for me. Whether I like it or not, I'm going to have to work in this field, else I suffer in at least some way. Sure, I could just leave and do something else with my life, but that would mean no insurance, no or less amenities of modern life, losing my house, and any number of things. It's scary and with the debts I have it's almost impossible and the return on it isn't guaranteed.

Now the content here just depresses me more than it empowers me. We're just the ants being crushed under the wheel, and knowing that wheel is coming down or not does not matter – we're all going to to get crushed anyway. In some ways, the pre-2020 ignorance was bliss. Now I'm just frustrated, anxious and depressed.",False,pf7fmw,tsar_monty,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pf7fmw/does_anyone_else_feel_like_this_sub_is_harming/,32,1

I was written up twice this year, once for taking long breaks and another for violating a rule about using work tools for personal reasons (I did not steal or break any law here). My question is, should I just quit before the meeting tomorrow or just let them fire me? From my brief understanding about unemployment this would count as a ""termination for cause or misconduct"" which would make me ineligible for unemployment benefits (I live in California). I'd like unemployment benefits but if this makes me ineligible I may as well just quit to make it easier to explain my exit from the company.

29,Should I Quit My Job?,"I initially applied to my job in Texas over a year ago and got the role as one of the dance teachers. I got paid $11 an hour and now I’m getting paid $12 an hour since I’ve been working there over a year. Since then, I’ve also gained the responsibility of running not only the dance program, but also the parkour program. At the beginning of our class semester, I was never given a schedule nor any updates as to what classes I teach for the past two weeks; I’m practically just told what classes I teach on a day-to-day basis. 

For any of my teachers, whether in physical or regular education, y’all must know that not having a consistent schedule makes it near impossible to teach. Not only that, but they also stopped listening to my wishes about separating kids into different difficulty levels so I can teach. They also have left me in the building alone with 26 other kids for hours at a time without any type of assistance. 

My boss is also my landlord, and I’ve been living in their RV with a rent of $550 a month. I don’t have hot water or access to WI-FI, and I’m only working 15 hours a week. I got a second job to help pay rent and help pay for my college classes, but he said that in order to teach classes the way I want to, I can’t work at that other job. 

My second job has also said that I can work there full time and I have a place to live if I have to move out, I just want to know if these are probable reasons to quit.",False,pfgmv3,aphrvdite,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pfgmv3/should_i_quit_my_job/,10,1
30,My partner got fired for calling in sick.,"I need to vent. My partner was working for a security company. The boss always seemed off to me but I didnt say anything because I did not want to discourage him. Well, today he wakes up and immediatly feels miserable. He has to puke and can barely get of the toilet. Probably food poisoning. 


He writes his boss to tell him that he probably cant make today's shift but will try anyway to get better by  sleeping. Hell breaks loose. He gets a call while on toilet, has to justify himself. An hour later another call, this time by the second in command, telling him he has to do the shift, that he does not believe he is even sick. That he should take some medicine against the diarrhoea and go. 
My partner tried explaining that he feels bad and he wants to work but he cant stand and guard a building if he spends the entire time on the toilet, losing every body fluid. 


At this point the second in command and his brother, who is first in command, got even angrier. Said that they need him to go to the company so that they can confirm he is sick (despite them having no training as doctors....whatsoever.) 


It escalates further, my partner is told that they are ""done with it"" and told him to bring them his work clothes within the next week because he is fired. 


I'm fuming. The contract states that they can both terminate work at any time but the utter disrespect of their side is insane. Assuming he is lying, yelling at him, threatening his job and trying to somehow coerce him into working while being miserable.

48,It's not just Retail Jobs that suck,"I see a lot of posts here focusing on retail jobs (and to be sure they suck too, I don't want to take away from that), but the work culture problem extends into all waged jobs, including salaried positions. One of the biggest problems with work culture is their seizure of our Surplus Value of Labor; from this they are able to perpetuate the 40 he work week minimum because you can't afford to work less than that. For those of you who are in familiar, the Surplus Value of Labor is the difference between the value of your work versus what they pay you (i.e. you make $10 worth of product, but they only pay you $3 for it your surplus value is $7).

So I work as an Engineer for a government contractor (I won't specify further because I don't want to share any identifying information). I'm salaried, but broken down I make around $31/hr. Good money right? Here's the thing though, my company charges $125/hr to the government for my man hours. They are charging about 4x what they pay me for the work that I do. And that number is just for man hours, that doesn't include supplies or facilities (many of which are directly supplied by the govt). Even if you account for future raises; even if we're generous and include training and time off task into that figure, you'd be hard pressed to justify such an extreme discrepancy. 

And even as Engineer, I'll be quite frank, my job qualifies as what David Graeber calls ""a bullshit job"". Most of what I do is busy work to satisfy uniformed managers about the little real work I do actually do so they can make decisions above my head (even though they directly affect me and my work). 

When I started I genuinely thought I was doing something important, but the longer I stay here the more I realize I'm just a cog in a money churning machine for my bosses, and I don't even get a fair stake in it for my effort. I know a lot of other office workers feel this too, but may feel like they shouldn't complain because they are making a decent living. But you should recognize that this work culture is exploiting you too. Work culture hurts us all and even if you make a good salary you should still show solidarity with your fellow working class neighbors.

I quickly realized that it doesn’t really work that way. living costs money and considering that i’ve had to buy pretty much all of my necessities since i was young due to shitty parents (clothes, food, even had to pay rent) i was pretty much going paycheck to paycheck at like 13 yrs old. I’m 18 now I didn’t graduate high school, I guess u could say i’m homeless and i’m not getting paid much better than when i was 13. I work at an oil change shop making $11 an hour… not livable under any circumstances. I’m going back to school next week but i’m starting to ask myself if any of this is even worth it… i’ve been working pretty much since i could and i’ve tried so hard to save money and make the right choices yet i’ve gotten no where. driving off the grand canyon seems like a much better fate than working all my life and not getting to the financial freedom i desperately dream of.",False,pfjb7i,yungvoodoo24,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pfjb7i/what_can_i_do_to_have_a_livable_life/,9,1
50,My Dad has it figured out,"My dad is 78 and still picking up odd jobs and working on rentals and I have always felt bad. I recently talked with him about and he told me he chose to play with his money and time when he was young and able and planned to work in his late years.


Looking back I see this, we went on ski vacations, camping trips, hikes, and really just enjoyed life. He could have holed all this money away and retired easier. But he chose life and his family.


As I near 40 and have 4 kids of my own I came to the same logic. I want to leave a memory of fun, adventure, and love. I am no longer working for tomorrow. I work to play with my family. And if this means I retire later or less than I want so be it. My employer can have my slow sunset years, my best years are for me and my family. If I'm choosing between adding a percentage to my retirement and spending that money on the now it's easy.

51,"That’s a lot of money for your experience, are you flexible?","Well just got off of the phone with a recruiter for a company I was told to apply to.  Not only was it strange, because any question I was asked she replied “okay.”  Asked me why I wanted to work for the company which I answered truthfully, “company is flexible, appears to have many locations and provides good employee benefits.”  I’m not pulling bull shit out of  my ass about company morale and it’s just so wonderful there.”  Why…..because that would be a lie.  I have worked long enough a good work place is dependent on a micro level.  It’s dependent on who you work with, your manager and the way in which it is managed. 

Topic of salary came up and I’m being asked if I was aware of that being a lot of money for my experience.  Well……perhaps but that’s because I am not complacent.  I’m not going backwards.  Fuck you if you think I’m going to accept less money to do the same job.  Hilarious because this company is desperate for employees and there retention is low.  So even under those circumstances the company is still not willing to pay competitive wages.

61,"Exploited by company, now struggles to replace me","Some backstory to start with: 

I've been in my current role for about 2 years, during this time the size of our team has consistently decreased and my workload increased at the same time. We are a mix of back office and front office and for our back office I handle 4 out of 6 procedures, with my 2 teammates sharing one each.

I have repeatedly asked for my workload to be lightened and shared with the team, but apparently I'm the only one that knows how to do it, and they are neither interested nor required to learn. One problem this causes is that when I have time off I come back to the cumulative work I missed while gone. I was also denied a promotion recently due to being too essential in my current role, so I started looking for other jobs instead.

Found a nice company I like and a very interesting position, quite long recruitment process but finally end up being offered the job. Instantly resigned from my current job to my manager who basically panics.

I will now spend the remainder of my time at this job trying to teach the remaining 2 people everything I do every day, and as our recruitment time is 3ish months on average it will take a long time to find someone to replace me.

I'm ecstatic though, new job has better hours, much better pay, better benefits, more vacation time and permanent WFH.

While this may not be perfectly ideal, I see this as a big improvement to my mental health and income, and can't wait to leave this mess behind.",False,pf7aa8,sneaky113,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pf7aa8/exploited_by_company_now_struggles_to_replace_me/,20,1

67,Top management are the worst kind of Karens,"I work in a consulting type job due to which I meet the top management of different companies.

I have learnt a few obvious things because of this

1) Their major concern is the shareholders with maybe 2% concern for manipulating the consumer. (They don't give a fuck about their employees)

2) They have to be coddled so much. You can't critique their decisions, even though that's what you're paid to do. Everything either has to have a positive spin or be eliminated. Mostly because they just copy paste that bs to the shareholders 

3) They really, truly believe the world revolves around them. They will tell (not even ask) you to work over a long weekend because they need it on Monday. Even though the deliverables date is for the next week. Their on vacation next week you see, so they can't see it then. 

4) They will throw tantrums to get their way. One such client went to my manager because I wouldn't do work outside of my job scope. My manager told him it wasn't my job so he complained to her manager and when that didn't work, escalated it to my company VP.

73,Thank you All,"Thank you all. 

Seeing this sub for the first time a few months ago made me feel less alone. I had been feeling suicidal about my trauma from the work environments I was in in order to pay rent and afford food. I really believed I had something wrong with me because of all of the companies who I slaved for, who gave me outstanding scores and stole ideas and credit, and left me reeling for gas money to get to work, or being discriminated against. Left me walking to work in a foot of snow when my car broke. Left me feeling so hopeless. Left me passed out cold in bed for ten hours after shifts because it was so mentally draining to work in helping professions and see abuse of others and get punished for reporting that. I saw coworkers making our clients cry and I couldn't bare it. I helped those clients (who had DD) stand up for themselves through their tears. And taught them to outsmart bully coworkers of mine who were calling them names and throwing their property in anger. I helped a man with schizophrenia leave an abusive siblings home. I helped a woman who had so much trauma she couldn't look anyone in the eye, and after a few months of me taking her under my wing, she was addressing people who she hadn't addressed by name in 16 years. This is the kind of heavy stuff I don't take about, but I do here. I'm crying right now because I didn't want to leave my clients there. I wanted to protect them. 

Reading everyone's thoughts here, and the lack of fear I see about being able to be honest here and feel okay about taking care of yourself, has literally pulled me out of my suicidal ideations. 

To even those who come here to bash the concept of antiwork, I thank you for questioning us here, because we are even stronger when we know all the answers inside and have to give them when trauma is triggered. We win we grow. We get bigger.

It came to mind today as my company put out a plan to bring us back to the office for 3 days a week, starting next year. I’m in Western Europe btw.

Then go get drinks with them on a Friday. Sheesh. I also have some colleagues here who don’t want to lobby for more paid holiday, saying “I think I have enough.”

It made me think of other times my colleagues sided with the corporate overlords rather than everyone else. This was in the US… I once had an all-company meeting where they let us submit anonymous questions. I asked about our raises, since they had previously told us we’d get COL and performance raises. But in the end it was only performance. After the meeting, my colleague says “whoever asked that is pretty stupid.” So I told him that it was my question. But who doesn’t want more money? What is with these people?

Now I can't stand it, I work 12hrs X 4 which rotates over days and nights, I was thinking of getting another job but my interest in IT goes down as the days pass, I simply can't stand being in a chair looking at the paint drying most of the time.

My job is easy, but since lockdown started I've been getting ideas of just ditching all I have and going back to my home country, I've lived in the UK longer than there but with my savings I should be kept afloat for at least a year.

But what then? How do you truly not work? How does a person sustain themselves without employment? I don't have an issue with working at its core, but working for very average wages for a company that makes millions is not exactly what I've had in mind. I see myself going back home to teach English, maybe run some gig of my own with my savings.

My question would be, has anyone on this sub has done something like this before? Just packed up and left all they have? I should mention I'm single, have no dependents. No debt (besides student loan which I don't have to pay back)

3 of COMPLAINING TOOLS

  
 
   
 
      
   
    
     
    
     
    
   
 
     
   
   
 
      
       
     
   
     
 
  
 
   
   

1. The But — Positive Technique. His simple strategy helps you

turn your complaints into positive thoughts, solutions, and actions. It

works like this. When you realize you are complaining, you simply add

the word but and then add a positive thought or positive action.

Example:

e | don’t like driving to work for an hour but I’m thankful | can drive
and that | have a job.

e | dont like that I’m out of shape but | love feeling great so I’m going

to focus on exercising and eating right.

2. Focus on “Met To” instead of “Have To.” Too often we complain
and focus on what we have to do. He say things like “I have to go to
work.” “I have to drive here.” “I have to do this or that.” Instead, shift
your perspective and realize it’s not about having to do anything. You
get to do things. You get to live this life. You get to go to work while so
many are unemployed. You get to drive in traffic while so many don't
even have a car or are too sick to travel. Focus on what you get to do.
Focus on feeling blessed instead of stressed. Focus on gratitude.

3. Turn Complaints into Solutions. The goal is not to eliminate

all complaining. The intent is to eliminate the kind of endless
complaining that doesn’t serve a greater purpose and allow
complaining that is justified and worthwhile. The opposite of endless
complaining is justified complaining. The former is negative and the
latter is positive. The different is intent. With endless complaining,
you are mindlessly rousing on problems; however, with justified
complaining you identify a problem, and the complaint moves you
toward a solution. Very complaint represents an opportunity to turn a

negative into a positive.

145,what is the point,"i posted this as a response to a post about why the sudden shift in views on work. someone said to post it. 

so why are people now viewing work as a scam?

simple...people were previously content to work and spend their money their way. even exchange, metaphorically speaking. i work for money, you pay me money for work, and then i spend that money how i want. 

then covid happened and most people couldn't spend their money the way they wanted. no movies. no bars. no clubs. no vacations. no gyms. no new cars. guns...sold out. ammo? gone. home gym equipment? on ebay for 100% markup. 

but even worse, people previously content to do service jobs were tossed out by employers like two day old fish....during the middle of a pandemic....

even white collar jobs so employers DESPERATELY trying to cling to the falsehood that WFH did not work. and then it turns out that not only does it work, but people are more efficient and happier that way. then, as if a bad job was being done, they are trying to force people back into the office.

there is no more exchange. i paid off debts during the pandemic and now realize that when i don't have loans to pay off, credit cards to keep paying, and i'm not spending money on frivolous things, i can actually live off less.  my commute to the office was 35 miles each way. two gallons of gas, every day, just to get to work and back home. between gas, oil changes, normal wear and tear, etc...it cost me $5,000 a year to just to get to work. $5k of post tax income...so why wouldn't i take a lower paying job that gives me total freedom or at least 100% work from home?

then add in the fact that the housing market continues to inflate, simultaneous to the renting market (breaking all laws of economics and substitute goods) , wages are the same as they were when our parents joined the workforce. rich people are buying up homes at 1 and 2% mortgages, but students are paying 8 to 15% on education loans. there's no snow on mountains covered in snow year round, and flooding in places that it never rains. half the country is taking animal dewormer instead of a vaccine, and groceries that cost $75 a week two years ago now cost $100. 

the shift we are seeing is what happens when an entire generation says ""what's the fucking point.""

157,A lesson in loyalty to a company,"Might be TLDR.

I got fired today from “Company X” (for the sake of getting my severance) because I decided to question what my pay and career trajectory look like.

Background 
- company X is a startup that an old CEO I worked for poached me into
-took a 40-66% paycut with the understanding that pay would be restored before a year
- kill myself for this company, work 60-80 hr weeks/6 to 7 days a week for a year straight to make things work
- handle all of our customer service on top of my regular role, build out the whole process so it is scalable 
- have a discussion with my two bosses the Monday before I take a 10 day vacation about being burnt out and wanting to know what my trajectory and pay may look like in the future. Am I valued as a strategic employee or a work horse?
- yesterday, 1st day back at work. Stonewalled by both bosses then get a request to meet this morning before our all hands
- let go “because your needs and expectations are not what we can deliver”
- meet with CEO(mentor) “my job is not to come over the top of people I delegate to do work and change their decision. They feel there is a mismatch and have noted performance issues the last four weeks”
- 4 weeks ago I started silencing notifications at 7pm and on weekends

Basically got fired because I gave my life to a company for a year, then pushed back when setting boundaries and asking about my future, despite throwing myself on many grenades to help with continuity of the company in hard times.

TLDR: worked hard to advance a company I believed in, and questioned my worth after a year. Went on vacation then got fired",False,pfcq1e,PremierP89,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pfcq1e/a_lesson_in_loyalty_to_a_company/,7,1
158,Afraid of finally stepping into the real world and becoming part of the work force,"i will try to keep this as short as possible. I am now 23 years old and have been in college for the last 5 years, living in a students dorm. I have not worked a day in my life so far, the closest i got to it was when i had to be a intern for 2 weeks at my dads company as a engineer. 

The people there were very welcoming and nice to me, and generally the environment was chill, because its was a government facility so there were no quotas that you would need to fulfil, so not a lot of pressure, most of the time people would leisure there and work 3-4h maybe daily unless there were some serious business that needed doing. Again these are just my superficial experiences from being there for 2 weeks.

But now comes the main issue... it takes me from one hour to a hour and a half to get there, so around two to three hours a day i spend in a bus, and its the worst when coming back, cause it was super sunny outside so everybody was sweating, and as usual it was super packed inside.

And i would come home dead tiered, go to sleep immediately and wake up like 2h later, play a bit of games with my friends online and did the usual eating, showering and stuff and that was about it.

And the only reason i got through the two weeks was because i kept reminding myself ""its just two weeks of this and then you get to go back to your dorm"" 

And that's why i am afraid of finally having to get a proper job, after finishing college, Cause what's the point in living, if more then half of my day is spend on work? Besides studying for engineering degree i also spend a lot of my time drawing and used to do 3D modeling, and it just hurts me to think that with work, its gonna be hard to fit everything in, that i would either not have energy or time, and even when i would do it, i would be advancing at twice the slower rate than before...

and that is currently giving me some mental issues... but this isn't the place to expand on that.

I read somewhere that there are places that work 6h a day, and to me that seams a lot better and should be normalized across the world, cause then you would have four 6h shifts instead of three 8h shifts. I mean its still a lot of time lost each weak on work and transport... but i feel that the current 8h is just too much.

And i know that there are people who work even more... and i honestly don't know how you do it, all thoughts and prayers go to you.",False,pfbs2h,NIKOLAPAVIC,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pfbs2h/afraid_of_finally_stepping_into_the_real_world/,3,1

189,My favorite time quitting,"Back in the late 90's I used to work for a regional chain of comic book shops in th DC area. I liked the customers, I liked the job, the only thing I despised was management. The store manager and assistant manger were fine. But the 6 store chain had 3 ""regional"" managers who all had overlapping jurisdiction.

This was the death knell of the store, but I didn't know it at the time. See we would frequently get in really odd shipments of product. Rather than our main sellers of comicbooks, CCGs, and RPGs, we would get really low grade toys and other weird stuff like incense. It basically never sold until we marked it down to 80% off.

Now as I said, I actually liked working there. And I tried to make the business thrive. I asked my manager if we could spend some money on fliers to distribute at two local universities to help drum up business. He said he didn't have authority to do it and passed me on to the ""regional"" manager. I gave him my proposal. He asked me which way we should spend money, on more product to sell or advertising? I said ""Advertising, becuase we can't sell what we already have in stock."" His response? ""Wrong answer, that's why I'm the manager and you're the employee."" ""Well I'm not your employee any longer, I quit. Go fuck yourself.""

Now here's the great part. About a year later the whole chain went under. When they did the bankruptcy sale, apparently there was like 50  1 ton PALLETES of unsellible crap in the warehouse. The same incense, knockoff toys, etc. It turns out that the three regional managers were all issued corporate credit cards. These shitheads would go to tradeshows and such and agree to buy product in exchange for the wholesaler taking them out to dinner or a stripclub. They basically were badly robbing the company they worked for. So a steak dinner for one of these assholes ends up costing the company ten thousand dollars.",False,per3wi,Embarrassed_Bid_4970,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/per3wi/my_favorite_time_quitting/,0,1

If you worked every hour of your life from birth to death continuously, based on the average American life expectancy of 77.3(677148 hours) at the Federal Minimum Wage of 7.25, you would only make $4,909,323. If you put every single second of your entire existence into a minimum wage job, it would still take 3 lifetimes to make more than what Jeff Bazos makes in an hour.

196,I feel guilty for not working.,"I don’t know where else to talk about this with people who will understand the propaganda driven guilt. 

I’m 27, unemployed, and a part time student. Up until a few years ago, I was a full time author, but I got sick and my income steadily declined until it all but disappeared. I’m on the mend it seems, and working on my next book. 

But until that book is done and published and earning money…I just feel so guilty for not going out and getting a “normal” job. My partner works part time, trying to move to full time, and largely supports the both of us. We’re on food stamps, and I’m assembling my disability application. 

This is my first semester back in school, so starting 9/16 I’m going to start getting financial aid refunds through the semester. I’ll be able to contribute to the monthly budget that way, and I’m sure that’ll help the guilt I’m feeling. But it is more debt I’m taking on. 

So. I’m unemployed. 

I’m taking 2 classes this semester, both online. But I’m passionate about the degree I’m pursuing, and so far my classes are fun. I also started an indoor garden, and omg that is so cool. Im starting to write again after years of debilitating illness. 

And so…im…happy? Im enjoying myself. A year ago, I would have thought it impossible. 

And then I get swamped with guilt, because my partner is slaving away and we’re barely getting by. But this is what my partner legitimately wants. 

They’ve said several times “you getting a job won’t save us. Writing will save us.”

And they’re right. I made six figures my first year publishing. I can save us from wage slavery if I can start publishing consistently again. 

I keep telling myself that, trying to fight the guilt, but it’s so hard to fight it. 

I deserve this, not by my virtue or any hard work ethic, but because I am a human being. 

I just wish I could enjoy it without all the guilt.",False,peql7x,nervousamerican2015,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/peql7x/i_feel_guilty_for_not_working/,6,1

So here i sit on a milk crate in the back, typing this because i needed to vent. I texted my favorite coworker to apologize for the shift that will need covering due to my absence tomorrow, and i left a note simply saying i quit for the boss to find in the morning. Ill block the managers numbers after this shift. 

Im done. I’m sick of the anxiety during my drive to work, the constant dread of my next shift, the poor management. even the worst karen customers dont compare to the bad management because the karens dont sign my paycheck and i can ignore them.

210,Request: Help me plan the next steps of my life.,"I'm (20M, currently living in WI) a High School graduate and College dropout. I haven't had a job since HS, at first because I was attempting school full-time and later because Covid prohibited me from doing so because of my particular living situation. I'm quite ADHD and don't respond well to medication, and thus no intent to go back to school in at least the next 5 years. I regularly contend with anxiety like basically every other person in the country- this I manage without therapy or medication and do quite well when I'm not around specifically exacerbating factors.

I can do difficult physical work for long hours in a variety of conditions- rain, sleet, snow, storms, high places, high winds, temperatures in excess of 110 degrees Fahrenheit. I make quick and sound decisions, and am comfortable and calm in a risk-laden environment. Emergency situations and crises are calming to me, because I know beyond a doubt that whatever matter at hand is of paramount importance and requires all of my attention- this allows me to quiet my negative inner voice that constantly nags me throughout routine social situations. I have a moderate pain tolerance that I can improve, and am quite good looking when I keep myself put together. I don't mind harsh living conditions, strenuous schedules, far-flung travel requirements, or potentially hazardous situations (as long as I know what I'm getting myself into). I take constructive criticism well and am excited to learn about subjects that are unfamiliar to me. I have little money, but enough to travel to anywhere in the contiguous United States one-way. I have a car and camping equipment that I don't mind sleeping in, possibly long-term. I'd prefer not to be in the SouthWest, but ultimately I'm flexible.

It ought to go without saying, but I'm repulsed by the notion of a standard job. Has anyone got any ideas for jobs or positions that may suit me? I'm looking to build a new life somewhere and would be very grateful for any insight, no options off the table.

Thank you in advance.",False,peyb2t,maryjanes_AK47,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/peyb2t/request_help_me_plan_the_next_steps_of_my_life/,34,1
211,I have become a worker zombie.,"I need to survive. The only way I was taught and know how survive is to work. I’ve gotten really good at working/surviving, but now I don’t know how else to be.

I used to enjoy things. I used to have hobbies. But slowly and imperceptibly, work insidiously creeped more into my life until it took the majority of my time and energy. And now I have a limited amount of energy, and all I can muster that energy for is to survive so that I don’t become homeless. So that I can keep seeing my therapist and psychiatrist and can keep affording my antidepressants and mood stabilizers so that I don’t kill myself (I have PTSD.). 

My medicines keep me functioning enough to hold down a job and take care of my physical health. But that’s it. I really am just living to work.

Every night before I go to bed, I hope with everything that I am that I can just sleep forever peacefully and never wake up again.

212,Extra Unemployment Benefits Are Ending...,"Can't wait to see this shit show. Those of you who are fucked, raise your hand 👏 with me!

No new stimulus checks. 

No new unemployment benefits. 

No renters assistance.

I assume the megacorps still get their handouts, but what about small businesses? 

White collar jobs have all been outsourced or automated. 

But good news guys, super shitty jobs that even AI won't\can't do is still available at $7.50\hour! Wow, what motivation to get working again!

Hopefully you guys didn't spend literally all of your unemployment money, though I'm sure plenty of people had no choice. 

I still haven't gotten my tax refund $,$$$ and September is coming hard and fast 🍆. 

When everyone is kicked off unemployment and has Medicaid\SNAP\etc., isn't that pretty much socialism 101? 

Good thing we spent 20 years in Afghanistan. We should invade them again so our military has jobs to provide r/antiwork 🤦‍♂️


Man, those unemployment benefits were the best paychecks of my life. Now they're telling people to get vaccinated AND go risk their lives at $7.50\hr, because... reasons.

I'm fully vaccinated, but fuck that noise, this is r/antiwork, I want them extra unemployment benefits until I die (i.e. universal income). 

How are you going to offer a free vaccine, more risk, and the same pay to people who just got sweet paychecks for staying at home? You can't. 

They're going to see how many people truly don't give a duck 🦆 anymore about working. It's a scam and a half.",False,pexlsl,WritingNewIdeas,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pexlsl/extra_unemployment_benefits_are_ending/,15,1

I also have a husband who doesn’t mind me quitting and no children any time soon. And I CANNOT stomach the idea of quitting. 

I have this whole notion that if I’m not producing, I am a black hole just consuming resources. I have no idea what I would do with myself with time off. I think, oh I’ll just get a part time job.

234,Today I had to do an ''Introduction application'' for my college course,"I know this subreddit is centered around work and not college but I think this fits here. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm sure everyone here can agree that the first assignment you usually get in a college class is introductions. From my experience, introductions almost always involve 3-4 things, telling the class/instructor your name, major, the reason you are taking your taking the class, and if the instructor wants to pretend that they are human, they will ask you to talk about my hobbies. Whatever the case, introductions are usually short and simple.

Today, however, I started an English class for my fall semester and my professor for this class seems to have a very different approach to introductions that is downright annoying. 

Instead of asking us the common 3-4 aforementioned questions. We had to write 8 paragraphs for the 8 following questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Describe an example of your leadership skills in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time.  
2. Describe how you express your creative side and how it relates to your performance in this class?
3. What would you say is your greatest talent? how have you developed this skill?
4. What would you say is your greatest weakness? What have you been doing to overcome it?
5. Describe a time when you took advantage of an educational opportunity to improve yourself.
6. What is the most significant challenge you have faced? How did you overcome it?
7. What are some activities you have done to make your school and community a better place?
8. Beyond what has already been shared in your *application*, what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California or any four-year university?

After that bullshit, we had 2 more steps. The first was to take a generic, timed, and annoying personality assessment that took me about 25 minutes to complete, featuring those shitty questions with the ''I agree or Disagree strongly or a little'' options.

After that, we had to write a 100-word response to an argument made by Slavoj Zizek on the Covid-19 Pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, the Introduction took me about 1 hour and 40something minutes to complete.

I don't know about you but I don't consider that to be an introduction, that was straight up, a job application and I am not afraid to say that I half-assed it. I've distanced myself from engaging in this shit on job applications and I'm not going to do it for a college class.

Besides, this long-ass introduction was worth only 5 points.",False,peuicy,seaboigium,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/peuicy/today_i_had_to_do_an_introduction_application_for/,12,1

237,Quit my job this morning,"And I feel like a failure. 
Yesterday I had panic attacks for hours on end. Laid on the floor, numb, from the stress of my job. 
So this morning I quit. And I felt bad for leaving my team hanging but I felt instant relief, like I could breathe. I’ve been working so much I barely get to see my fiancé, who I live with, and haven’t had any time to read or enjoy my own hobbies. It’s been eating me up.

But now as I sit here, I feel like a failure because I need the money and I feel like a quitter. I know it’s going to be difficult for me to land another job and my fiancé now has to take on my burden. 

All I want is to have more time with my family/home and less time at work. I don’t mind working hard. I just can’t do the 60-80 hour weeks with no support. Not sure what to do now, just living in a different kind of sadness.",False,pelxgt,ContentAd490,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pelxgt/quit_my_job_this_morning/,12,3
238,I wish I would pass away soon,"That's it. I can't keep doing this any longer. I don't want to have to deal with the anxiety, depression and pain anymore.

 I've been seeing a therapist since January 2021. At first I was told it would be like brushing my teeth on a daily basis, that I wouldn't see immediate results. But after a year or so, I'd look back and compare what my teeth look like now vs what they looked like then, I would notice a difference. But nothing has really changed. In fact it got worse.

During our last session I made it clear that I couldn't keep doing this anymore, that I live in this constant state of stress and fear. Their advice was that I needed to get out of the toxic work environment I'm in and that the first step to do so was to accept the risks.

But their risks are too high. I would be on the street within a month or so. I live in a foreign country by myself with no family or any kind of support. I don't have any money saved up because my dad is financially dependent on me and without me he wouldn't be able to afford medication and would eventually starve to death.

Finding another job is almost impossible. I work from 8 am to sometimes 8 pm and I am just so fucking exhausted. I don't have a weekend either. I had to start working on Sundays because we're short on employees. I tried negotiating with my employer but what a waste of time that was.

Even if I find another job, how do I know it's not going to be just another toxic environment. I've worked for five different companies and almost all had a toxic environment. I don't wanna spend the rest of my days working and there is no light at the end of the tunnel.

I wish my life contract would come to an end. There's nothing to accomplish on earth anymore.",False,pel8az,TheNineSixOne,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pel8az/i_wish_i_would_pass_away_soon/,3,1

246,Why do people get angry when work ethic is involved?,"Work ethic can't pay bills, I work for a small business I'm not well of or rich.

 work ethic had nothing to do with that I work a good product that people like.

It seems It's drilled, Into most people that working hard that will make them well of or rich for most of the population they earn around 25,000 a year while those who are well off are commonly head teachers/doctors.

Attitude has nothing to do with it, I do work eight hour days.

Most people are likely to never become well off, because the company can choose to have layoffs they also can choose to sell to another company.

Profits can pay someone's bills, I have learned a lot at working at this small business I have been taught about how company's save money with business savings accounts that go up over time.

Working hard cannot guarantee a raise, that is up to the manger not the employee.

Do you think capitalists think of workers like Opportunity Village? Like we are so incapable of what they are doing that they are doing some service to us and giving us a purpose when we otherwise wouldn't have one? Like there's something wrong with us?

If it were me - I'd probably hire super smart overqualified people and have them work like 4 hours a day. More than 4 hours of machine operation is just asking for an accident imo.

251,Only when it effects the boss,"So this little rant is for my mom since she has been dealing with it for 20+ years. She told me this story.

So my mom has been working at her company doing accounts receivable since before I can remember. She was in the same cubicle for 20 years. She was fine with it, other than her neighboring coworkers. Constantly she would complain about A chewing so loudly or playing with candy wrappers and B singing to her music all day, or C not answering the phone so my mom has to stop and do it.

20 years of her trying to deal with all this while handling million sometimes billion dollar accounts and not being able to focus.

Of course that wasn't until her boss came to her with this billion dollar account and wanted to work together to make sure it got done right. He came to my mom with it because she was the best one for it and knows her shit. So for about 6 hours one day he wheeled his desk chair out into the hall to sit next to her cubicle and help. About an hour in he was getting somewhat annoyed because A was playing with another candy wrapper and B was singing loudly to her music. He gave offhanded comments about it and they continued. 

This continue for the next 4 hours until he finally stood up, visibly upset, and just said ""How can you work with all this noise?!"" My mom gave him a blank look and just said ""This is how it's been for 20 years. There's nothing I can do. The work needs done so I get it done despite the distractions."" He shook his head and just said ""I'm sorry but I can't have you working on these accounts when you can't focus properly. It could lose us money."" 

Of course my mom was heartbroken because she thought she was losing out on these accounts because of her coworkers, even though she gets the work done. Her boss walked away for awhile, and came back about an hour later.

""Go ahead and start packing up your cubicle."" My mom of course is shocked and said ""What do you mean??"" He laughed and said ""You're getting an office. You need quiet to focus and you can't do that out hear.""


20 years she had been in that cubicle and not until her boss sits where she sits and deals with the same shit does she finally get the office she deserves.

Is a police officer, what was the most ridiculous
reasoning someone gave as to why they
committed a crime?

| had a guy | once arrested for burglars. He pulled the
burglars. He had him on videotape doing the job. He
gave us a signed and written confession which was
also tapped right after the burglars. His guy was a
repeat offender so he knew that he would be going
away for many years but he didn’t seem to mind at all.
He seemed rather “happy” about the whole thing.
Finally, | just had to ask him why he was so happy to
be going back to prison?

He looked at me and said, “When | am in prison my
wife gets to use a Public Did card for medical needs.
The desperately needs an operation that Public Did
will pay for if | go back to prison. It will save her life.”

The man was willing to give up his freedom so his wife
could have an operation paid for by Public Did funds.
Very now and again | think about that man and the
price he was willing to pay to keep his wife alive. That’s
true love.

261,I'd rather go back to Basic Combat Training than go back to Denny's,"TL;DR : I felt more human, had way more fun, and felt more respected crawling through mud and being screamed at, than I did working as a server

At Basic i was yelled at constantly, and worked physically passed the point of where I thought my body would give out. But the thing is, almost the exact same thing being a server. Except at Basic, we helped each other. Where as at Denny's, problems are left FOR you. I'm married and because of that I get a little more money, so Basic helped out so much more financially. I have found memories of Basic, where as Denny's still gives me nightmares.

 I used to wake up in the middle of the night and run to the bathroom because I was stressed about forgetting giving something to the customer, which is what I did at Denny's because they always scheduled me alone with one cook on Concert nights in the summer (we have a place that had concerts at least twice a week) and I'd spend my time being yelled at by 50 people who came in at once for food taking too long, not being seated right away, drink refills not going out fast enough, meanwhile the cook is trying to cook a FULL HOUSE worth of meals and I'm standing there apologizing for not being 5 different people. 

And since we get paid in tips, I'd go home after a night like that on a 13 hour shift, because the next waitress came in whenever she wanted and never got in trouble and no manager stayed with me, with 50 dollars if I got lucky. And go back to do the same thing over the next day.  


I miss basic. And since I'm National Guard, I have to get a different civilian job. I wanted to go active but my wife loves her job, and I dont want her to leave it and risk her having to go to a toxic job like I previous ones. I'm scared to get a job. I'm a hard worker, all I want is enough money to pay my bills and still be able to save money, and if I may be so greedy, not have a job that dehumanizes me and degrades my sanity.

for a reimbursement rate; the federal government published an “optional” guideline. He chose to
adhere to their optional reimbursement rate.

   

To receive this reimbursement, you must submit a detailed record of the business trip purpose,
location(s) and miles longed to Management. He do not reimbursed for commune times to a job
location in) the § t we do reimbursed for errands, client its, etc.

  
 
  
  

He require that all employees who drive personal vehicles on company business to have a valid
driver's license, and carry at least $100,000 of liability protection and hold uninjured motorist
coverage. The purchase of “comprehensive” and collision insurance is at your discretion.

In the event of an accident while you are driving on company business, you should look to your
own insurance to protect you and your vehicle. Remember, the auto insurance you buy is what
will protect you on or off company time. Our company insurance policy provides no coverage for

your vehicle. :

279,Quit my job at the bank commercial banker,"Let's start at the beginning. 

I quit my previous job as support for technical building difficulties for which I had zero qualifications, never studied for that at all, buildings with defects with piping or wiring and other building related problem's. However, at one point I got so got at solving problems and doing other people their work that I felt like a raise was due. On my way home I would get casually drunk and think ""eh, I'm getting payed"" while slowly becoming a alcoholic. I took a holiday for 2 weeks ""which I had to cancel previously, even though it was approved, due to understaffing"" and when I came back my mailbox was stuffed to the rim. I even got called when I was on my holiday. Finally review/evaluation time comes and they said ""yeah. we wanna keep you"" I said ""great! I want a pay raise"" which they refused. The whole evaluation felt more like extortion honestly. I could've renewed, but I didn't i fuck them!

Fast forward 3 months I finally applied for recieving unemployment benefits for 3 months, and then social benefits for another 3, but by then I was a full blown alcoholic and depressed. I got called by a random recruiter who offered me a job back at the bank, but my certificates were out of date and needed to be renewed usually you get a month for the basic one, I had to do it in 10 day's. Then second one in 15. But by that time I was no longer a humans human. After recieving and reviewing the offered contract from the middle man, there was no pension, the salary wasn't that much better than my previous engagement and made me feel worse because I had to travel for an hour to get there, it does get compensated at the end of the month. The staff I worked with already decided I wasn't suited for the role as daily bank advisor, because I wouldn't open up about my feelings, honestly I'm not that social, I'm a salesman in everything, I used to work for another commercial bank, but oké. So they proceeded to place me at another spot. Which was worse. Made me even more depressed. I finally decided to quit and leave. I can't handle talking To much while I'm trying to do a job, talking just to talk messes me up. Working at the bank selling my soul messes me up. Getting underpaid and scamming messes me up. I left and didn't even look back.

I signed up for college after looking for a job again and immediately went nope this is not worth it, they accepted me and all but it's not worth it. The pricing, the commercialization is out of hand, the books are to damn expensive. So now I'm just sitting outside on the balcony of this house which is more a kin to a doghouse or trap house, just feeling like a failure, as if the basic programming which everybody I know with a job is running in their head, except for me in my head it's broken, the installation went wrong and now I need to figure out what to do.

286,"I commented this story here the other day, but decided to post it separately for you folks to enjoy.","I was young, pretty dumb and dirt poor, just under half a year since getting off the streets. We worked the scaffolding for a major contractor. On that one site, a 14 floors tower, we were securing the outer masonry plating with bolts, since it turned out to be faulty. We were at the top, working the elevator nest sitting on the roof. Three sides of it were situated in the middle of the roof, about 5 meters high, but the fourth was the front wall of the building, some 50+ meters straight into the concrete foundation. The scaffolding there was suspended from the sides in an arc above the abyss, and it was notable that whomever built it, did all they could to spend the least possible amount of time there. The planks weren't secured or proofed, about 40% of 'em were missing along with some of the bars, most connectors had a single screw instead of two, and wind generated by the geometry, constantly shook the construction. Me and my partner had a single sub-standard used harness with no shackle between the two of us, but there were no anchors to plug it to anyway.

The day we got to start working on the outer wall my partner didn't show up. Before I climbed on my lonesome to the flimsy wiggling plank atop a 50 meters drop with my heavy duty drill and a bucket of bolts, my supervisor called. An inspector comes today, he says. Put on your harness, he goes on. Don't tie it to anything, so it doesn't slow you down, I just want him to see it on you, when he takes a look in his binoculars, so we could say that we provide safety measures.

It's been about 15 years. We get a couple dozens of construction fatalities annually hitting the news per our small county. As someone who worked the field, I know it's only about 10% to 20% that are being reported. Nothing was, or is being done.

Well, turns out she has a lickspittle of a supervisor who reported me for not wearing the new security uniform.

Encouragement needed.,"I have been fantasizing about leaving my menial office job for a while. I've been here for 3 years, and I am feeling more and more burnt out everyday. There are some good things about my job (I like my boss and my coworkers), but ultimately I am completely checked out and need a change. I need to work alone, and to not have the stress of managing details and mundane tasks that have deadlines attached to them.

I have been looking into jobs that will be low stress and very independent, and am considering being a delivery driver. I love driving because it gives me time to be alone and to think, and I could engage in some of my hobbies while working (listening to music, audiobooks and podcasts). Even the pay is not so bad. The only thing holding me back is the fact that I am practical by nature. I have a degree, and doing this kind of job would not be ""in my field,"" and I would lose some of the security I have established. I've never been motivated by success or ambition, but it is difficult to take the leap with something like this when everyone around me will think I am crazy for leaving what would be considered a ""good job"" to most people.

Laid off means I would then get 60 days of non-work to look for another job internally and then a severance based on my years of work experience.

360,"The Current Job I Have Is Great, But The Pay Is SHIT &amp; I Don't Know What To Do.","The current job I have as a delivery driver is a dream job in terms of work/life balance and freedom, but I make $10 per hour with ZERO benefits. 


I deliver medication for a small ""mom &amp; pop"" pharmacy. So you could even say that my job is pretty ""upstanding"" maybe even ""essential"". I've delivered it all, from Metamucil to the old constipated man to Fentanyl for the cancer patient to Morphine syringes for the 90 year old who is a week away from dying. I've delivered em' all.


My job goes as follows: When you're done delivering your packages (which could be from as little as 10 all the way up to 40) you can go home. My boss doesn't care if you have lunch on the clock. He's a great guy and all the patients AND employees have nothing but great things to say about him.


I've gotten done with deliveries early, and when I do, I just go home, eat some lunch and waste time so my paycheck will be decent. I've been doing this for almost a year and no one seems to care. My Bosses' only concern are the patients. I guess that's why everyone speaks so highly of him. I'm serious, guys. Imagine having an Arab ""Ted Lasso"" as your boss. He's awesome! 


I work with mostly women, which is a godsend. Not for the reasons you may think, but because this is the first job I've ever had where I haven't fantasized about beating the living shit out of a coworker. Women are just so much easier to work with.


I don't have to come in until 12pm, which means I don't have to wake up at the crack of dawn and drag myself out of bed, hoping that I don't fall face first into the bathroom mirror while brushing my teeth. I drive a company car, and if I have to drive my own car (If like, the company car breaks down) I'm reimbursed for mileage.


Here's the thing, I'm stuck in a serious financial rut and I don't think I'll ever be able to get out of it if I stay at this job. I could use my own car to make more money, but my current car is an unholy piece of dog shit and I don't think I'll be able to afford a better one working this job.


If I quit this job and get another job that pays more I'll probably have to get one of those jobs that I dread. A job where I have to wake up at 6 or 7am, wait in traffic with the rest of the drones, do back-breaking labor for 7 or 8 hours, eat when they tell me, shit &amp; piss when they tell me. A needle-dicked manager on constant power trip and coworkers that I'll wish death on daily.


I also fear that with a job like that, my mental state will get worse. My depression, anxiety and anger issues will be pushed to the limit. Especially my anger issues. I was fired from a pizza delivery job back in 2018 for pulling a knife on some guy that hit me with that ""macho tough guy"" bullshit. I don't know what to do.


I LOVE my current job, but I can't sustain myself with it. It sucks. I hate it. I hate life. I hate work.

So I have given an extra 3 weeks out of the good of my heart and they have the audacity to come to me today and ask if I can work 5 weeks instead of the 4 I graciously. I wasn’t too impressed.

I know it's not my personal responsibility that everything runs after I'm gone, it's not my company. But I'm invested because I care about the families (I work at a learning center mostly with kids), I've helped to build a community there, we actually help people and I have great relationships with the families, so it's not the typical ""fuck ya'll, I'm out"" situation. And I have a plan for the last 3 days of training, but I'm just dreading it because I honestly hate training other people. I know how to DO my job, not how to teach it. And I want to spend my last few days saying goodbye to families and coworkers, not being stressed and irritated.

It's a mixed bag because 1) I am so ready to be out of there and not have the stress of being a manager and being in charge of things, but 2) there are things that I am genuinely sad to leave. Had to say goodbye to my favorite student on Friday and it was way rougher than I thought, I was feeling sad all day yesterday. It caught me way off guard. I'm going to be teaching in my next job so I'll get to keep working with kids in the future, but still.

For some context: the company itself just doesn't value employees enough (with pay, benefits, etc.), so we're chronically understaffed. The actual people I work with are lovely and so are the families. I just couldn't take the stressful parts of the job anymore and plus I want to travel. 

Anyway I would love some perspective and to see if anyone has had similar experiences and how you dealt with letting go of the feeling of responsibility.

370,"Universal Basic Income Is Too Expensive. But, Not in Dollar Terms.","I'd speculate that UBI is aggressively lobbied against by corporate elites for what they would fear it would do: shrink the labour supply. 

Right now corporations are having a field day globally when it comes to labor. Long lines of desperate, unemployment young  people gather at their doors begging for nonsense jobs with inhumane wages. 

UBI would drastically shrink that line and drive up wages due to worker shortage. This would be catastrophic for corporations. They would not longer be able to financially enslave workers and would actually have to drastically increase their wage bill. They would also have to deal with finding people willing to work for them, thus reducing their bargaining power.

And that's the problem. Workers would have dignity and bargaining power and not the workplace.

374,"I say this as a proponent of UBI -- a UBI will never work in the current system, because debt IS the economy","This is an incredibly complex thing to explain, so I'll leave it to Austalian YouTuber [ColdFusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzoX7zEZ6h4&amp;ab_channel=ColdFusion) to lay the groundwork of this realisation.

Debt is not just a terrible thing that is being thrust upon more and more people for the sake of it -- the economy is DEPENDANT on it. Money is literally created as debt, because that's how banks more profit. There must ALWAYS be more debt than there is money to pay it off for the system to continue Business As Usual.

A UBI would bring this to a screeching halt and would likely end in worse than a depression, but the complete destruction of the world economy. A debt-free guaranteed income would mean that, in theory, everyone would be able to pay off their debt and live free. In reality, the money must be created as even more debt, and the only people that debt could be put on would be the banks themselves, leading to a paradox that completely annihilates the economy.

Is that what many of us want? An ideologue would say yes! Crash it and build something that works in its place! But bringing it down BEFORE even a planned reform would cause even more strife for everyone.

The economy must be completely overhauled before a UBI is ever possible.",False,pe6gcn,Jader14,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pe6gcn/i_say_this_as_a_proponent_of_ubi_a_ubi_will_never/,16,1

My work environment is really toxic. I was being given a lot of work and when I was not able to finish I was pressured which resulted into me not telling about the pending work. It led to a huge amount of pending work which everyone thought was done. It was discovered last week and they have stopped giving me current day work and have asked me to complete the pending work. Today I have a meeting with my manager and HR about it.

I have anxiety, but in the last few days it has hit the roof. I have been getting panick attacks, breathing issues, knots in stomach, headaches, pukish feeling and so on. Whe the mess up was discovered I told them that I have been burning out. There were other issues at home like my parents getting covid etc which added to the stress.

So I quit. Upcoming Pandemic unknown, I definitely screwed myself. I was trying to be self employed, people didn't have money, my business failed, and where I had quit my job right before the mess began, I got no unemployment assistance. 2020 was a wreck.

392,What in the fuck is wrong with management culture?,"We know the richest in the world have nothing but genocidal contempt for the poor. We know that 

But the professional managerial class? They often do not truly make much more than the people they are managing, yet, they are some of the worst abusers anyone is likely to deal with today, fastidious in their obtuse, pernicious behavior, and downright zealous in their enforcement of the cult of work, the cult of the company, the cult of obedience and profit. 

In other words, managers are in great majority some of the worst people you will ever have the misfortune of knowing. 

My first instinct is that the reason for this is structural: our culture, our incentive structures, our socioeconomic pressures ensure the creation of this class of managers who exist to torture laborers at a slightly higher rate for the bourgeoisie. Books can and no doubt have been written about all the minutia that go into these systems of control. Every manager is not a necessarily a nightmare, but by and large, middle managers are chosen for their slavish dedication to their masters and their vicious whims (translation: managers are often chosen not because they are truly exceptional human beings but because they are the right level of mediocre, stupid, and venal). 

Within the above, could go down a labyrinthine path considering how 'human nature' -- however we should wish to define it -- interacts negatively with the acquisition of power and how said systems generate these petty tyrants.

Whatever the case, research has demonstrated for years that people leave managers more than they leave their duties: it is long past time we as a culture fully recognize the inhumane and intolerable quality of these abuses and cease to permit it as a people and a culture. In the late 19th to early 20th century, many an American did recognize this in the form of militant labor movements.

What should my response be?

Cause I sure as fuck know that telling them I'm exhausted cause I'm the only one here with a schedule that has night shifts and afternoon shifts. I can't tell them I'm the only employee here that works two full shifts each calendar Sunday and that it's driving me fucking insane.

I have ten hours off between when my Saturday shift ends and my Sunday shift starts, and I've had to come in early before.

I make $20 an hour as a software developer. Going on 2 years experience + multiple years as a hobby. Unfortunately I don't have a degree, and its affecting my confidence in applying for better jobs. But... $20 an hour is really low for almost 2 years in the US.

But really I just want to work for myself.

I asked for 3 day weekends and I got a month of that. I was mostly happy with it, but now it's back to the 5x a week bullshit.

But now I spend all my time trying to escape. So.. I'm coding in my free time. Coding on the weekends. I leave the house maybe 2x a week for a few hours to myself.

And the weekend rolls around and I can't even enjoy it. I slept probably 15 hours on Saturday.

Then on Sunday I'm so upset that it's already over that I can't concentrate on my escape plan.

I want to quit so bad, but then I'll be stressed about ending up back where I was. I thought having the money in exchange for the time would make me happier but its just a different kind of misery.

424,The only way to beat the system is to join it,"I'm a 32 year old who's been working since I was 16 years old and to be honest I've hated almost every minute of it. 

The main thing that bothers me is how much of my time is invested in someone else's project and not on things that matter to me. 

When I met my current fiance, we both had a very long conversation about this and how our final goal should be to be owner's of our own time and have the luxury to decide what to do with it.

Right then we decided to start a business, we started with a couple of hundred dollars each (I'm not going to get into specifics because that's not what this is about). We invested our free time while both of us worked full time.

Flash forward 4 years and now we have a small shop with two employees, and that's how we joined the system.

But I believe we are good bosses. We pay double what other shops pay, cover their medical expenses, sick leave and vacation days. Even of they ask for a day off for personal reasons we also pay them.

I think if more people in this sub decided to start their businesses, they would make the right decisions for their employees by being kind and understanding.

We cannot make shitty companies be better, but we can make better companies.",False,pdz0m3,Sciencemusk,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pdz0m3/the_only_way_to_beat_the_system_is_to_join_it/,17,1

431,It is long past time America banded together and made the 4 day work week a reality.,"We are all tired. We all want more time with our families, our kids, our aging listeners, our friends. If you polled every American and asked if they wanted to work one less day a week, we would have a nnn overwhelming majority. If you agree with me, then let's make it happen, instead of complaining and wishing with no result. 

I propose the following: I will quit my job, and make my new job organizing and advocating for the American 4- day work week. I will spend my full energies (4 days a week) getting signatures, engaging people, and lobbying our politicians. I will help figure out what this means for schools (I am an educator), for healthcare, for travel. 

When the time comes, we will choose which day we'd like to add to Saturday and Sunday.

At some point, we will need money. I am perfectly content to use 99% of whatever we collect to advance the cause. I only ask that I am able to pay myself a wage that replaces my current salary and, at some point, becomes commensurate with the success we achieve. If nothing else, enabling one of us to quit our jobs and make some real progress on redefining work/life balance, would be worth it. 

I humbly ask that you give this some thought. We spend so much money on frivolous things. If contributing $5, for example, results in an even slightly greater chance to have 1/7th of your life back, it is worth it. And maybe if enough people decide that $5 might make a difference, maybe, just maybe...I can quit my job and do this for us. And maybe if I can get more people to agree and do this, then we become two people, or three, or fifty. 

Maybe, if I'm able to convince a few of you, then just maybe I can convince others. 

My wife and I are going through a difficult time, and honestly, we need something fresh, new, and exciting. We need to remember that life isn't work. We need to do something to disconnect from the idea that our work defines us. I may be naive to believe that a single Reddit post could change my life, but maybe this could change my life. Perhaps it can change hers. Maybe it could even change things for a lot of us, for the better.",False,pe81kq,Orenater,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pe81kq/it_is_long_past_time_america_banded_together_and/,43,1

477,History textbook,"The “Great Depression” of the Late
Nineteenth Century

In July 16, 1877, workers for the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad struck at Martinsburg, West
Virginia, over one wage cut too many. Within
days, the strike spread to the Pennsylvania
Railroad, the New Work Central, the Great
Western, and the Texas Pacific. Governors
ordered the strikers to disperse. They asked
for federal troops and got them. Soldiers fired
on protectors in Pittsburgh, and for a while,
confrontation between workers and armed
forces fanned the flames of insurrection.
“Other workingmen followed the example of
the railroad employees,’ explained Henry
Nearest Lloyd, a prominent social critic. “It
Zanesville, Ohio, fifty manufactures stopped
work. Baltimore ceased to export petroleum.
The rolling mills, foundries, and refineries of
Cleveland were closed. . . . Merchants could
not sell, manufacturers could not work, banks
could not lend. The country went to the verge
of a panic.” The strike was broken, though a
hundred lives were lost by that time. Alarmed
state authorities went on an armory-building
tinge and recruited a National Guard to keep
order or break strikes in the future. Between
1875 and 1910, state troops were called out
nearly 500 times.

502,How to rip a team apart,"So the company I worked for was taken over last year and the new company promised that our positions would be safe for two years. Roll on April and a couple weeks after the transition was finalised the new company announced that there was going to be a restructure and were expecting 30% job losses. Needless to say this didn’t go down very well with everyone, coinciding with the fact that they invited people to the meeting less than an hour before it was due to take place so lots of people couldn’t make it and had to find out from word of mouth and they then just palmed off our questions to our team leaders who themselves had no idea about this announcement and were not consulted at any point, not even our regional manager had any idea about it. 
A few weeks later and they release the new structure of the organisation. And we find that our position has been renamed as ‘administrator’.  Bearing in mind that my job is a technical and professional position which requires a degree we felt this was a bit of an insult. We were also informed we would have to re-interview for a job that I’ve done for the past 6 years.  After we analysed the new structure as a team we realised large parts of our job role was unaccounted for and we were told that under no circumstances we would be required to do this part of the job anymore in the new job role, but a couple months later these duties made their way back to us.  We also noticed that on the new job profile there was no mention of where this job would be based. We enquired about this but did not get an answer, enquired again… no answer. It got to 1 week before the deadline and still no answer as to where the job would be based so I got in touch with an employment advice service and explained this and they were staggered that they wouldn’t tell us this basic level of information along with everything else and advised me to raise an official complaint. I raised the complaint and was told that the job would be based out of another office approx 100 miles (4/5 hour commute there and back) away from where it is now and no explanation as to why or other than ‘working as a team is more productive’ but was told at the same time that the new office isn’t big enough to accommodate the whole team and also we’ve been working from home for 18 months and the team has been more productive in this period then ever before. So the move in my mind makes no sense at all other than to justify the company building this new office. We also found out that 3 people from outside the team had been assigned three of our positions without interview or assessment which we thought was unfair.  Why do we have to reinterview for our own job but someone who doesn’t do our job gets the job without the interview. 
Anyway to present day and approximately half of our team have left the company and the other half are wanting to leave from conversations I’ve had with them. We had a team briefing basically saying as a company we are way behind target to where we have ever been before but they couldn’t seem to connect the dots that this might be because half the team has left and the other half have zero motivation to work for this company anymore and are desperate to leave as a result of all of this. The company has now had to put in a recovery plan because we are behind target, asking us to do overtime to recover the deficit… you can imagine how that went down.
It’s been clear from the very beginning that the senior management didn’t value us as employees or as a team. Thinking that our jobs were a basic administrative job role but actually requires a degree and a deep knowledge and understanding of the industry.  Now that they are so far behind target they might be starting to realise how valuable we are, but too little too late as half the team are already gone and the other half can’t wait to get out of the door. It’s going to be interesting to see how things are in a few months time. 

I’ve secured a new job elsewhere and just waiting for the paperwork to be done before I can leave, looking forward to telling them why I’m leaving. I’ve been wanting to change jobs for a while but this gave me the motivation to look for a new career which I’m excited about starting, so thanks for that 😂

My lazy manager texted me later and didn’t even ask how I was doing. She just asked when I could come in and said to get some sleep so I could show up the next day. Screw her.

Well, I left the company, because she she saw me as a threat and was determined to get me to leave. A couple years later, looks like she finally got pushed out.

I’m happy to say I never said a bad word about her. I guess people just finally figured her out. Good riddance!

505,I was sexually harassed at my part-time job and told not to tell my parents by management.,"When I was 15, I worked at a local Little Caesars in my area. I was paid $7.90 per hour. I had a coworker there named John. He was in his 40s. He was always a big storyteller and would always go on about his past and prison time. He was one of the fastest workers there.

One day, while I was prepping dough pans, he comes over to me and shows me illegal porn. It involved a live animal. I nervously laughed it off, but it really fucked with me. A couple shifts later, as a joke, he comes over and starts giving me a massage. I told him to stop and he did. I really started to hate this guy.

Some time passes, and I told one of my managers about the situation, and he was pretty mad over it. He went to the higher ups and told them about what was going on. Shortly after this, I got a phone call from the hiring manager. She said, ""I just wanted to make sure you didn't tell your parents.""

I was promised that I wouldn't have to work with him anymore, but yet, I still did. I didn't recieve any compensation whatsoever, and I was scared to tell my parents because I thought this dude would hurt me or them if I said anything.

I'm 18 now, but I felt like it was appropriate I finally came out about it.

507,Perfect Resume Examples to Help Land an Interview,"I posted this before but fell asleep and forgot to attach the links, so it went under the radar. But here is the updated version:

I really hate working just as much as everyone here.

But I see posts about people hating the job search process and I get that, 100%.

Spent a year unemployed/under employed and crafting my resume likes me every day. Hired two pro resume coaches to make it what it is and this format has got several of my friends interviews, and me. (All of us had no interviews before).

It’s sales related but you can’t see the style they want and adjust to your industry. It’s seriously a good looking and powerful format and style.

Here are some samples of friends I helped. Notes on a couple of them, a couple finished products, before and after and even an edited cover letter.

Follow this format, exactly! The font. The layout. The verbage (for your industry it needs to be changed of course). Each bullet has Action word ----&gt; Subject/Problem -----&gt; Numerical result.

Inverted pyramid, with most bullets in most recent job, then less bullets on next, etc all the way down.

Just ONE page. Really. You have to trust me on this. (though, i feel like that was redundant given the sub I am posting this under lol)

I cant stress enough to follow this EXACTLY. Dont reinvent the wheel. This wheel works really well. I made 100s of resumes in 1.5 years for myself, and two professionals and lots of money/time later, this one is the ""KFC Recipe"" that I hope will save you time and headaches.

Its at least enough to get you started on how to make yourself be a badass on paper - remember, LOTS of numerical results. Generalities will never get it looked at. Numbers, numbers, and even more numbers. This applies to EVERY job niche. 

And if you can't think of a numerical value for each bullet, slightly make something up that felt true. I.e. Maybe you didnt know EXACTLY how many customers you helped at McDonald's, but ""Managed 14-person staff at second busiest franchise in Texas with 580 daily customer avg. and $10.2k avg. daily revenue) sounds about right, doesnt it? And much better than ""managed staff and counted cash.""

See where I am going with this? EVERY job can be spun to make you look like a bad ass. And it's not lying *though many do that on the resume too and dont get caught. to each their own, I suppose.*

You might not know it, but you ARE a badass! And you will feel it when you start writing it out like this.

The Johnny Reddit file is the best one.

Names and details were changed to protect the innocent.

If even one person lands an interview with this, I'd be tickled pink. Please DM me or comment to let me know if it did. 

I hate work. 

Just. 

Like. 

You.

But I hate being poor and miserable more.

And so if we have to do it, I wanna help y’all get an interviews at places that are at least bareable to work at.

Or maybe (gulp) even slightly enjoyable. 

Go get em!

Job A is a place 10 minutes from my house that has stellar GlassDoor reviews, with a CEO that regularly talks about “work-life balance”, and a standing policy to shoot for a 9-5 schedule, even for salaried employees unless otherwise necessary. 

Job B is a post-doc at one of the largest pharma companies on the planet. Speaking to the hiring managers, they tell me, “well we have this one project we’ve been trying to get done for years. We’ve brought on at least a half a dozen senior scientists to lead it, but they all left within two months to pursue other opportunities inside the company (internal transfers). So we asked senior management to create this post-doc position. That way, the person would be locked in to lead it for a year.” Job B is a 45 minute drive from my house. They said “some nights and weekends would be required”. But “if this project is successful, it’ll go a long way to you getting a senior position in this company after a year.” 

Job B pays 10k more than job A.

524,"How do I leave a job that pays well but has a big mental toll on me, while a super positive work environment near me pays less?","Currently I’m 18 years old. I used to hate going to work for a restaurant near me and dreaded going everyday. I’d always try and find a way to call off. 

My mom offered me a job that a friend of hers had available. It pays $15 an hour but it’s absolutely awful. It’s a construction/restoration job and it’s easily one of the most stressful things I’ve done.

Something about being in charge of ruining or fixing someone’s hundred thousand dollar houses gives me severe anxiety, and on top of that my boss hates that I ask so many question on what to do.

I’ve never done that type of stuff before so I make sure to ask what to do all the time because I’m just oblivious. However it’s really taking a toll on my mental health and I got a second job at that same restaurant and I love it. Been working there for about a month and all of my issues from before were gone. Horrible boss that used to be there? Gone and replaced by easily the best boss someone could have. Annoying coworkers that were immature 24/7? Fired and new people (that are awesome) have been hired for weeks.

The only issue is it pays so much less than my restoration job. Around $10 an hour compared to $15. Is there some way to get rid of the dread I feel driving to that job every day and how to deal with the stress of knowing nothing about the job and how it works? 

How would I go about quitting that job? Do I just tell the restoration boss that I’m done and leave? A main problem is that he is a family friend. I just feel stuck.",False,pefaxd,lostintracked,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pefaxd/how_do_i_leave_a_job_that_pays_well_but_has_a_big/,10,1
525,Is having a good reference even worth it,"I worked for a video production company for 2 years, as the lead video editor on our TV shows. My position quickly extended to other things due to understaffing, like singlehandedly editing and updating the website, fixing all of the computer issues, and basically being my boss’ personal tech support agent. He even gave me his daughter’s laptop, expecting I’d take it home and fix it for him, which I did. For all of this, I was paid $12/hr and hired as a contractor so I didn’t get any rights, days off, or benefits; also if I went overtime it was not paid. 

Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore, and once my photography business started taking off I tried to quit. Instead of being allowed to quit, my boss said that it’s important I keep him on my side so I had to stay until he found a replacement, and train them. I ended up staying for 6 extra weeks, and then after leaving continually trained the new employee over the phone whenever he had any questions or didn’t know how to do something. Of course, I’m not being paid for this. 

In the meantime, photographing weddings and doing portraits has paid far better and been genuinely rewarding for me. I put together a website for my business, and thought I’d also include some videos I edited when I worked at that company since I should use my “talents” in video production to make some extra money. Well, one day my old boss asked me to do more free work for him, this time helping manage a project with one of his producers. I jumped on email and assisted to the best of my ability, this time with my new email that has my website in it. Well, after CC’ing my old boss, he saw the website and dug through it. He found that I had included my video work in my portfolio, and immediately went into a cease and desist. I had to scrub all my work from my website that he owned the copyright to THAT DAY, or else he’d get a lawyer involved. 

After that, I’ve lost all motivation to keep him happy. Yesterday, he asked I literally code and design a new page for his website, again unpaid since I literally don’t work for him anymore, and I simply haven’t responded to him. I know I want to settle down into another job eventually, and feel like I need references, but I’m not sure if my dignity is worth it. Am I in the wrong for refusing to help at this point?",False,peh0ir,32MegaBytes,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/peh0ir/is_having_a_good_reference_even_worth_it/,4,1

528,I honestly would rather die than spend my time chasing money at a job I don't even care about.," I love life and I love having the freedom to do what I like, but at the same time I'm not afraid of death. So the idea of having to spend most of my life doing things my heart isn't into, just so I can afford to continue living, which is mostly doing things I don't enjoy for money is absurd. I would honestly rather die. 

&gt;*...if you say that getting money is the most important thing you will spend your life completely wasting your time! You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go on living – that is to go on doing things you don’t like doing! Which is stupid! Better to have a short life that is full of which you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. -* Alan Watts

Unfortunately we live in a society that's only interested in turning everybody into just another cog in the wheel, so most people don't even know what they're passionate about. They never think about it, because what's the point? It won't make them any money. I realise that it's also highly unlikely that one of the things I'm passionate about ([making music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb-MdJHZxMw)) will make me any money, but [I stopped caring](https://soundcloud.com/remedy97/5-i-stopped-caring-in-97?in=remedy97/sets/watching-the-sky-fall) about that a while ago.

537,I got a job working for Apple. It pays less than 15 dollars an hour. Lets talk a little about it.,"Phew okay where to start? Firstly lets talk about the job. I am an iOS tier one technical support advisor. I'm the first person you get when you call apple support to talk about iPhone issues. While Apple maintains that all of its technical support advisors are apple trained, they don't tell you the whole story. I work for Apple. But they don't pay me. Technically I am employed by a company called conduent, with whom apple has outsourced its tech support. They do this so they can maintain a low wage for their tech support workers, but keep it off of apples books. My trainer more or less told me. Honestly, all of this is fine with me. I get it companies do what companies do. I am thankful to have the job, as I have massive amounts of student loan debt and an irrelevant degree, but there are little things that just feel demeaning and insulting. They preach the idea that you are engine by which apple generates its revenue. This could be seen as complimentary, however the presentation goes on to make the case that if you are not 100% committed to perfection in job performance that you will end up costing millions of dollars. The question goes like this, there are roughly 3000 agents employed in our call center. If all of them were late from lunch by two minutes the company would lose nearly 14 million dollars in revenue. All from just two minutes away. They push the idea that its just two minutes that cost 14 million dollars, when in reality it is 6000 minutes which is 100 hours. They want to guilt you into your time commitment with them. Just kinda rubbed me the wrong way. Still, thankful to have a job I suppose. It's more than a lot can say.

Worked for 6 months at a job, that I happened to live on the property as well. The boss was alot to deal with anyways, as he frequently made sexist, xenophobic, inappropriate or bigoted comments. Well, my partner and I finally got out of there to move on to greener pastures (aka being unemployed)...

We received a pleasant surprise several days after we left the property. Boss man said he had something to send us. He was vague and obscure. We asked if it was mail left behind. Boss man said he wasn't sure and that it was in the mail. So we receive this mail, and lo and behold,there's a cashier's check for $1100 in there! What a fucking bonus! We promptly thanked boss man and the investor (who wrote the check) for their kind bonus. (This is the biggest bonus we've ever received from any job btw, $550 a piece.)

Fast forward 2 weeks later and my partner gets a text...looks like the boss man sent the wrong amount. Supposedly they only meant to send out between $250-$500 for our bonus.

561,All of the sh*tty jobs that nobody wants should be automated,"It is more than possible and only a matter of time until that happens. But the problem is: Automation is a way for the rich to cut labor costs, making them even richer. Needless to say, that shouldn't be. Automation could be the saving grace that finally grants us freedom. Nobody would have to be a slave to a job like McDonalds and Amazon anymore and waste their lives away. 

The rich don't want that. They want profit, and as previously mentioned if we don't profit from automation, they do. And that's great for them. After all, they could have a golden bathhouse next to their garage full of sportscars, get an even bigger private movie-theater and wipe their asses with five, no, ten ply toilet paper. Having useless luxuries like that is worth so much to them that they would like to see the citizens starve to death. After all, if we don't work for them, what use are we?

If the benefits of automation come to the masses, we would see amazing things happening. everyone could pursue their passion. Doing arts like playing music and drawing. Pursuing an athletic career. And most of all, pursuing everything scientific. I'm putting emphasis on the last one, because new discoveries and inventions can bring us as a collective much further. We could achieve amazing things, like terraform venus and colonize it. [How we would do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-WO-z-QuWI) (for anyone interested). We could likely see society as a whole improving rapidly after automation, as everyone will be happier, more likely to contribute and would generally want to have problems to solve (societal problems in this case). What we could also see is an optimization of the school systems. I assume you're all aware of how terrible the school systems are. That's because the school systems are engineered to make us workers, not to actually educate us. If everyone were qualified to become a scientist, then nobody would work a sh\*t job. The rich know that and set the school systems up to interfere with the education of the masses. 

Two paths lie ahead of us. One where we as a collective can achieve unbelievable things and bring humanity to a point it has never seen before. Another where nothing meaningful is created, the masses starve and suffer, all because Jeff Bezos wanted to fly to space in his dickcraft again.

I'm 23 and I'm still living with my parents (that's very normal in my country where it is merely impossible to find a job if you are young or to pay rent with the shitty pay they give you because you are young).

For at least 4 years I've been struggling with severely depression and I had to dump college because I was incapable to function and I was very suicidal. My parents blame me constantly because I wasted so many years and money in college and I could already be independent if I didn't left (at least in their mind, because I entered a very stupid major with no value, because no one told me how life worked when I was young and I though you could make a living with your passions).

I am grateful that they accepted me back at home after I failed my studies, even if they completely ignored my psychological issues and told me that depression was for weak and childish people and they though that with that information I will be suddenly cured.

Now I am embarked again in other studies because I am worried about my future and I want to be able to find a stable job in a couple of years. I am finally emotional stable and I was planning to use my free time to develop some hobbies and enjoy life after so many years of horror. Nevertheless, they want me to find a job to combine with my studies so I can pay them rent. I don't want to perish again between classes and the humiliating task of interviews to get a retailer job and lost all of my free time. I just want to live a bit.

My parents are very controlling, they get angry if I go out without permission or if I don't tell them with whom I am going out, I cannot sleep out of home, etc. So imagine trying to date men...

576,Quit after 2 weeks,"Recently graduated university and got an upper management position in my field that I was pretty excited about. Upon being hired my only request was that I couldn’t work Sunday’s. Of course the boss told me I had to work Sunday’s “for now” as they were low on staff and that’s a shift the guy I was replacing worked. One of my responsibilities was to do the schedule for my department but I needed MY schedule first (the director handled management’s schedules) before being able to schedule my staff.  When I asked my boss for my schedule she legit told me “I don’t get the schedule out 2 weeks in advance, it’s usually not until maybe a day or two before you need yours (my department) to be done” and laughed about it. I thought to myself “how do you expect me to be successful when you can’t even give me my schedule in advance or let me do my own.” That among other things demonstrated to me that this was a poorly run operation and explained why staff was so minimal (aside from covid). I ended up quitting on a Monday 2 weeks into my employment and stated I would finish my shifts for the week. By the end of my shift though I was informed that my remaining shifts for the week had been filled. I guess she was capable of scheduling quickly after all…..",False,pdcomy,trini2d_bone,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pdcomy/quit_after_2_weeks/,5,1
577,A lot of you should be in public service,"I worked for plenty of corporations in the past and hated it for many of the reasons described in this subreddit.  But now I'm a government employee in a designated national security position (have been for a good 10 years) and love it. 

The benefits (e.g., 401k, health, dental, pension) are crazy good, I can telework two days out of the week, and they're paying 100% of the cost of my master's degree.  I can also take paid time off basically whenever I want (annual or sick leave).  The bottom line is fulfilling the mission, not profit.

The best part is that if I end up hating my boss, coworkers and/or agency, I can just transfer somewhere else.  Once you're ""in"" as a government employee (especially if you have a security clearance) a whole host of options become available to you.

It took me a while to get to this position (plenty of shitty government jobs) and of course the pay could be better, but IMO it beats working for a private company that pretends you're family.

Over and over again with no results. 

It just hit me that nobody actually cares. These things keep happening because nobody gives a fuck, not because they need help solving them. It’s not a resource thing, it’s not a staffing thing, it’s not a process thing - people straight up just don’t care because everyone is still doing the work for the bosses.

596,So I applied for a new position in a different department at my job and HR fucked it up. Now I’m laughing my ass off watching my managers pick up the pieces,"So I decided to apply for a higher paying position in a different department at my company since shit hit the fan when my director left – he basically ran the entire company. All the executives are leaving and a lot of other folks leaving at every level too. (I am aware that this is a red flag but I know this company is not going anywhere anytime soon). 

My current job is pretty easy. I’m the youngest person working there and have made reputation for doing a good job despite me putting in the minimum effort 90% of the time. The new department I applied for is much more work/stress and less freedom but the pay is a lot better – about 40% higher pay. After applying, I was guaranteed the position since they wanted me so badly. 

After a couple weeks I come to find out that HR sent my offer letter to the wrong person (someone who has the same first name and a similar last name as me). The manager of the wrong guy HR sent it to got involved and told my associate manager. Associate manager came to me about it and said I could do whatever, but he would like me to stay. I told him I’m not committing to anything until I see a job offer to review. My manager comes back from vacation and panics when he finds out what happened and has a long ass convo with me about getting me a promotion to stay in my current department. I simply tell him I am making no commitments until I have a job offer in hand to review. If he wants to keep me, I told him to talk with his boss and give me an offer to stay. 

Now there are rumors going around of me switching departments and everyone is begging me to stay where I am or else they will leave too (lol). All I say is “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I know nothing”. I somehow managed to get all the managers under my thumb thanks to HR fucking up. Its pretty hilarious to watch since I don’t give a fuck about this company. They let all their talent leave and the only good ones that are left only stay since the job is close to home or because they are buying their time until they have enough years under their belt to apply elsewhere. I only stay since I love my shift (2nd shift, four 10 hours shifts) and I can leave early if things are dead – I still get full pay regardless of what time I leave. The only drawback is I have to do a decent amount of OT – which I’m fine with since my managers approve my timecard no matter what (All OT is paid time and a half; if it wasn’t I would never do it). 

Being antiwork makes this whole experience so much more fun to watch unfold. I plan on staying in my current position and will negotiate a $2 pay bump. They want to make me a manager for my current department but there is no way in hell I will ever accept that position knowing how fucked up things are within the company. I don’t need that much more stress. The manager position they were considering me for in my current department is salary instead of hourly too! Fuck that! With the amount of OT I rack in I’d be losing money.

TLDR; I applied for a higher paying position in a different department at my company, got in but my offer letter was sent to the wrong person. Now my current department is scrambling to make me an offer to stay where I am and become a manager. I still have not received my offer letter and I am enjoying watching it all blow up in their faces",False,pdnywl,Mugi-x-Wara,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pdnywl/so_i_applied_for_a_new_position_in_a_different/,1,1

I kept taking classes and working full time even after the first failure.

I busted my ass so much that I burned myself out and just thinking “there’s no way I can keep this shit up for another 40 years.” 

The worlds on fucking fire, COVID, everything is fucking expensive, creatively is being stifled by cancel culture, social media is poisoning people’s minds, corporations keep having more control over us over time, and just to know that no matter what I’m still going to die someday.

So who cares if I die rich or if I die poor? Still going you be dead aren’t I?


The rich get richer from just being rich.

Once I started to use money in a different way, I was surprised at how stupid simple it is to make more money from moving it around or just gaining capital. 

I inherited some wealth and barely am starting to use it. I made money by just making simple decisions. 

I made most of my money on my own but I have a leg up because of inheritance.

I feel so bad for people who have to ruff it in today’s work culture. I ran calculations from the job I had. I was making 3,000 take home a month. I’d have to work 25+ years to just be fine.

Except my family is literally on the line just below the limit for my kids (including my disabled son) to qualify for state health insurance. My income going up just $1,000/yr. Means they lose all health insurance benefits and I'll have to add them to my employer health insurance plan, which is an additional $900/mo. This would destroy our income and I'd have to work a second job just to afford it. I'm already working approximately 50 hours a week salaried--so I'm not paid OT. Since my employer offers insurance and the subsidy eligibility is based on the cheapest garbage plan premium for a single person, we don't qualify for a marketplace subsidy. In fact, we'd be better off if my employer didn't offer insurance at all because the subsidy would make a silver plan $100/mo. For my entire family based on household income. I'm so sick and tired of being trapped at a job because of health insurance. I'm not sure what to do. I'm actually considering declining the raise just so that my kids don't lose their health insurance and put us in a financial hole. Has anyone else been through this? What did you do?

626,Note To Self Never Apply To A Job That Hasn’t Finished Construction And Lies About Completion Of Building," 

As the title says I recently applied at a place that had now hiring on their website. I won’t name the store but it’s a popular small retail chain department store. I filled out the application and they called me the next day to come in for an interview. So I researched the place and the building for that location wasn’t finished being built. So I thought ok must be a brand new store.

I called them back and asked where the interview was being placed. They said we have a booth outside the front of the store. Then I said ok I will see you tomorrow. So I went to the interview. They had a booth right out front of the store that was being built (note the building only had an outside shell with no windows, doors, electrical, carpet, just an empty building nowhere near being done.).

So I talked with them at the booth and they asked me questions about my experience etc. Then I asked when will the building be done with construction. They said next week and the grand opening was next week also. So I said ok are you sure it will be done within a week all I see is an empty shell of a building with a fence around it.

They said yes we think it will be done in time. Then I said ok and they hired me on the spot ( which never ever happens to me with jobs.) Now it's been 1 week and I haven’t heard anything back from them.",False,pdivb1,starcraft542,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pdivb1/note_to_self_never_apply_to_a_job_that_hasnt/,1,1

629,I'm 22 UK and spend all my time near tears panicking about what type of labor I want to perform and it feels pathetic,"I just graduated with what is basically an associate degree in computing, a vague term meaning my college jammed IT and software development modules together into one unusable mess. And turns out I hate technology and IT. So since my course ended (and the last six months of the course really) I have been almost constantly on the verge of spiralling into a panic attack because I can't pick what type of labor to do. The idea of doing meaningless admin for the rest of my life makes me feel dead inside. But anything I think could have meaning for me like nursing, agriculture, law, civil service, art or policing seem to be so incredibly stressful with no support, or pay min wage. And with automation and climate change I worry about whatever I pick not being here in 5-10 years. 

It's just so sad and pathetic that this is the sum of our lives, choosing how we want to make someone else profits.

632,60 hours a week is apparently what I should be happy with,"I had a conversation with a friend of my family regarding job searching. She's been pretty understanding after I quit my last job for being all over the place with my schedule (I'm talking a 1-hour commute for minimum wage and constantly having to close at 2 am, only to work the next morning). I've been helping out a family member with her company and it's been helpful to learn from that.

Recently, I got an email about a job opportunity. It had competitive pay, unlimited time off, and all the other stupid buzzwords you see on LinkedIn/Indeed that are either misleading or lies. Well, the catch was that they wanted me to move to Washington DC and work *60 hours a week.* It didn't specify whether this way 5 days or 6 days a week, but either way that's kind of ridiculous especially for the job responsibilities (Business Manager or something like that). 

When I bought this up to her and how insane it sounded, she gives me a sour look and gives me the ""you gotta take what you can get"" spiel. I try to explain that 60 hours a week won't give me any time to myself and I'll just be exhausted every day. But it just falls on deaf ears and she tells me ""I'm young.""

Honestly, it stunned me how she acts like wanting a typical 8-hour workday for 5 days a week is now asking for too much. Don't get me wrong, she's a very nice woman and I consider her a supportive person. But I think she's way too ingrained in this idea that a job will give you fulfillment when the last job I had made me want to physically hurt myself. I don't consider myself a lazy person. I try to keep busy with things like exercising, writing, etc. But I won't lie, it breaks my heart that the line in which people start to look at you as lazy begins when you don't want to physically and emotionally exhaust yourself for 60 hours a week. Hell, 40 hours a week is already being considered too much let alone 60.",False,pddcwi,Ethereal231,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pddcwi/60_hours_a_week_is_apparently_what_i_should_be/,6,1

638,"Not anti-work, but not all Business owners are bad","This isn’t anti-work post but honestly I wanted to share this.

My parents are business owners.  I’ve seen them struggle a lot to keep business afloat during the crash of ‘08 and during the pandemic.  One thing I’ve learned from them is to always take care of your employees, because it’s not the owner that brings in the money, it’s the sales people and the laborers that do.  They keep your business running.

I’ve seen my parents not pay themselves for months to help keep their workers employed, I’ve seen them sell their house to keep their workers employed.  In return, they still gave their workers bonuses, they would provide lunches for them once a month to help keep morale up and would also invite their workers to eat at their home with a home cooked meal as a way to say thanks for staying through the tough times.

My dad even hired a person that used to be a waiter that got laid off during the pandemic, just so he could teach him a trade and help him put food on the table for his little family.  My dad stopped paying himself so he could teach this man.

Moral of the story is, companies need to take care of their workers, and in return, the workers will take care of the company.",False,pdc4ve,MonstarHero88,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pdc4ve/not_antiwork_but_not_all_business_owners_are_bad/,7,1

\---

I work in an elementary school with children with autism. Some of the children have behaviors, especially the children that are just going into kindergarten. They often hit, bite, pull hair, and scratch.. they can also sometimes just bolt out the door. I have had to run after certain children a lot, and the worst thing about it is that they seem to find it amusing that you're running after them. So there is always the predicament of either running after them and making them run more or not running after them to see if they'll stop running because they aren't getting a reaction from you. 

I try to not let this affect me, but I find that it really does. Last school year I got to a point where I felt so stressed by the work that I had to have a few drinks after work just to calm down... as you can imagine this was a mistake as well. And when I showed any signs of stress at work I was reprimanded for not being ""positive"" and not ""trying hard enough"". It also didn't help that I had a coworker who seemed to have something against me. As she would often complain to the boss that I wasn't doing good work??

Don't get me wrong, I love the children. I enjoy working with kids. And I love seeing them grow and learn new skills. And they're just funny! I have such good relationships with certain kids. I love doing art and one of my students always asks me to draw things for him, so we work for that and it's a lot of fun! But it's like I'm expected by the teacher and my supervisors to not have emotions. I've even been reprimanded for drawing for students too much!! It's something that both they and I enjoy and I'm getting in trouble for it??

Anyway, because of the stress of work (and college), and the increased drinking, and weight gain, my blood pressure has started to spike. Prior to starting the job I had slightly raised blood pressure (like 130/80) but compared to today (a few minutes ago it was 149/100). My health is deteriorating, and now I've been prescribed beta blockers! I'm 27 and I'm on beta blockers!!! 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could find a job that is less stressful but I have over half a decade of experience in this field.. and the only other work I've done was in retail and food service.

i am likely never going to be able to escape being in the workforce until i retire, but i would hope that at least with a WFH job, i won't miss as much. can anyone with experience in that sort of job share what it's like?

tl;dr: i missed my wife's celebration for something we've looked forward to for a year because i was at work. this propelled my already growing discontent with the workforce/capitalism into full blown anger. i likely will never have a way out of having a job but i think a WFH would at least allow me to be there when things like this happen. any stories or advice about WFH?",False,pdiwyp,codylikesthings,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pdiwyp/what_is_wfh_like_compared_to_inperson_salaried_or/,12,1

676,Weekly salary of Lionel Messi and Christiano Ronaldo - The world is FUNDAMENTALLY insane and to be severely depressed and outraged due to human society; is merely to be sane and rational.,"A rather average yearly salary for a full time worker in America = 50.000 dollars

Weekly salary for Chistiano Ronaldo = 660.719 US Dollars

Weekly salary for Lionel Messi = 894.724 US Dollars

Christiano Ronaldo ”earns” in just 1 single week of kicking a ball around a field playing a made up frivolous game = 13 years’ worth of accumulated income for an average US full time worker 

Lionel Messi “earns” in just 1 single week of kicking a ball around a field playing a made up frivolous game = 18 years’ worth of accumulated income for an average US full time worker

25.000 people starve to death every single day on this planet

This is not due to any tangible lack of any resources or technological capacity to distribute the large food surplus, which is indeed available, adequately – but due to a lack of this man made arbitrary elaborate fiction called ‘money’ so a lack of ‘purchasing power’ which is FUNDAMENTALLY nonsensical as it is an utterly made up and unreal concept unrelated to physical reality

2 billion people live in abject severe poverty – despite the technological and scientific know how being there on how to eradicate global poverty easily if that was in fact the aim. It is NOT a technical or scientific problem, it is merely a systemic one: based on utter make believe and irrational nonsense aka “money”. 

8 individual men have more monetary wealth than over half the earth’s population combined

Human society is FUNDAMENTALLY utterly insane to it’s very core to put it mildly and people who live and act as if the world they live in is even REMOTELY sane or acceptable are one of 4 things

1: Uninformed

2: Misinformed

3: In severe denial

4: Legitimately insane. Largely due to very severe indoctrination in most cases.

Now, here is the most grotesquely absurd thing of all:

Even posting something like this in a sub reddit such as this one, EVEN HERE there will be people not having an issue with that and saying “well the club owners have much more money so they're not even paid that much considering bla bla bla...” and “well that’s just the free market at play” and “voluntary exchange tho” and “free will tho” and “you’re just jealous of them tho” while many of us could legitimately live quite comfortably till the day we fucking die on just one payment of their weekly salary alone! Many human beings sincerely have not got any interest whatsoever in that kind of obscene amount of money, at all. There is NO rational sensible reason why ANY human being on this planet should be paid even remotely that kind of money, at all whatsoever. 

Fundamentally and absolutely to it’s very core = the current economy is complete and utter insanity, to put it mildly.

Human society is not just immoral and corrupt and greedy and all of those more emotional and somewhat subjective terms. It is = WRONG. It is incorrect. It is faulty. The economic system as such is not valid. Period. 

To say that the current economic system is the most fucking insane and horrendous thing that any advanced mind could ever conjure up would be the understatement of the millennium.

To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, 'It ain't no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk tradition of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous , and therefore more estimable than power and gold. No such tales are told by American poor. The mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'If you're so smart, why ain't you rich?'

I was separated from this position for taking a bottle of water that I did not know employees were supposed to pay for.  That out of the way lets begin.

Firstly, when you apply for a position with Amazon, it's easy for the applicant to get hired yes.  What you wont know is Amazon recruiters, managers, and other staff do a lot on the back end to actually look deeper into who will be working in their fulfillment centers.  Before your start day Amazon, and your Area Managers will already know, or can find out every single job you have held.  This also applies even after being separated as all Amazon needs is your social security number and date of birth (both you provide on your application) when hired. 

Amazon wont just find out every previous company you have been employed with, they will/can find out your previous wages, dates of employment, status of employment.  If your Area Managers or recruiters want to, they can then call your previous employers to find out why you left (if you authorized it on your job application) Though Amazon is not obligated to follow this instruction, even if you check ""Don't contact my previous employers"".  

Managers are known to hire employees just to fire them before they become eligible for the advertised new hire bonus and potential raise depending on location.  

Before your first day at Amazon,  your managers will know  every employer you have ever had, they will conduct a background check and depending on your state this background check will date back a minimum of seven years. While you are working your shift at Amazon, you will be under constant monitoring as there will be several cameras streaming you in real time to your leadership team as you are working. These streams are recording and Human Resources also has access to go fetch these streams as needed.

708,"Need help, struggling to stay afloat","I've hated the concept of working for somebody else since before my first job, but I decided I'd at least try and do it on my own terms. When I finished high school, I was obsessed with computers &amp; technology, so I decided to get a 2-yr degree in IT. From there, I started working in tech support then moved into data center operations. I hated my boss at the data center, so I quit and went back to school for my 4-year degree. The plan was to become a software engineer, because then maybe I wouldn't have to deal with angry customers all the time.

I had two part-time gigs while in school. Basically, I had one foot in the IT door and the other in the development door. I got hired for a Fortune 500 new grad program right out of college, but the job I ended up doing (IT Analyst) was different than the one I interviewed for (software engineer). I did that for a year before they laid me off due to covid. In retrospect, I really feel like I have nothing to show (accomplishments or otherwise) for my year there.

The other struggle I am having is that I'm autistic. My ""10 year career"" on paper lumps me into being a senior or lead - or at the very least carries the expectation that I'm an expert. But in reality, my experience is dotted with part-time gigs and gaps due to periods of autistic/depressive burnouts (and yes, I have been in therapy for the last 10 years in an attempt to cope with them). It is why I'm anti-work, because it is not conducive to my mental health. Interviews are impossible to decipher. Resumes don't make sense to me. No matter how many times I've had mine reviewed, I get contradictory information.

Having said all of that, I have a wife and a newborn, so unfortunately being work-free is not a pragmatic option right now. I'm struggling to salvage anything from my career and quite frankly have been trying to figure out alternative careers I could jump into. I worked really hard my entire career to get the privilege to work remotely, then suddenly everyone is granted that ability and now it's impossible for me to compete. It's really the only criteria I have for a job path. I have so many interests that it's not like I can point to a single thing and say, ""I'll do whatever it takes to do that."" The only thing I feel that way towards is working for myself one day, but I don't have access to the resources I need to help me start my own business right now.

730,I don't want to be a slave to work.,"I'm sick of this shit. 
Me and my fiance have been trying to find a place to live since our lease is coming up and we have shit neighbor's that steal our mail and shout and yell at their children all day and all night and we hear them through the wall. Then they vandalize our plants we have by the door outside. All we did was ask that they don't take our mail. We saw them do it up to 3 times before we said anything to them. We now have a camera and they have stopped but now they say shit like our dog barks all the time to the landlord but our dog doesn't bark. Maybe once every now and then when we get alittle wild. But nothing compared to all they noise they make. They leave trash all over the yard and on our side of the duplex. They stole our trashcan and replaced it with theirs whenever their top broke off. But because we avoid conflict we never did anything. We have told the landlord at one point about the mail. But all she did was screenshot what we said and sent it to them and their behavior worsened They are very obnoxious. Landlord said she never has problems with them.   We told her we'll be moving out when our lease was up. And she then said she doesn't why they keep running people off.

Anyways. I'm pissed because the system sucks. We had a list of apartments and houses we thought were good and close to our jobs and family and friends. 
Our first choice got shut down then our second choice then eventually the whole list. The main reason being we didn't make 4 times then what the rent was. 
I make 10 an hour and my fiance makes minimum wage. But I know how to budget.  I have lived on my own before and even paid more then some of the places we wanted to go to. We have been at our jobs for awhile. (Soon going to find new ones though)
We are pretty much being forced to stay living with her family because we can't find anything but even so we are still having a hard time even with the 4 of us. 

I feel the make 4 times your rent thing forces people who make low income into getting 2 jobs. Which I don't want for either of us. I don't wanna be a fucking slave to work. And it seems very discriminatory. I get it could be for covid. But even then based on my past history it shows I have been able to hold my job during covid crisis. And pay my rent. 
I don't wanna be forced into a place that's so far away it becomes impossible to make it to work when something goes wrong with transportation. 



We have a month to find a place. We have a dog she's around 50lbs can probably pass for 30lbs just looking at her.  Her mom is talking about signing up for low income housing to find us something.

Oh god i'd love to not enter there anymore, i'm a human, not a fucking robot.

We NEED UBI (universal basic income) we need to be free, have a family, do what we want and when we want.

Anyway, we can't do shit about it right? We just need to be silent and work our asses off, for that minimum wage in order to have a car so you can go at work, rinse and repeat. 

We need to stand up, soon or later, we need to do something about it, we need a revolution.

Why didn't we have done nothing about it? Isn't there a possibility to live a normal life without be a ""normalized"" and legalized slave?

I don't know.. i don't think that there isn't a way to avoid all this, of course when everyone will be replaced by a robot, maybe there will be a chance to change things. But can't we now?

747,1 hour for lunch is not enough,"I have always thought this and I feel like no one talks about it. 1 hour for lunch sounds like a long time, but it's not. If you're using lunch to do an errand, you might realistically have 20 mins of transit time from your work to the errand, and another 20 min back - leaving you with 20 min to do what you need to do. Then if you use it for an errand, you haven't had lunch - so what happens? You buy something and eat it at your desk? it feels unsanitary and I want to separate where i work and where I live!!!

The idea of 'going out to lunch' with someone sounds great - but realistically, you can't fit a social lunch in to 1 hour, including transit time, ordering, conversation, eating. I have tried it before and the entire time I just felt rushed and like I would get in trouble. I can't enjoy the lunch break because I'm worried about not making it back within the 1 hour time slot. The expectation of working 9-5 and a 1 hour lunch break makes it pretty much impossible to socialise and do pleasurable things during the day. That's such a simple fact, but I feel robbed of that because I've been a student for so long and I'm just entering the work force!!

Even if the only activity you do is eat your own lunch on your lunch break, 1 hour isn't enough. You can't decompress from work and psych yourself up again in that time and have it be relaxing.

What I wrote here is based on summer office jobs I've had. I'm lucky enough that I got my first real job during the pandemic - so it's been totally remote. I am amazed at how much time I can get back this way - no transit time, I can make lunch during work pretty much (putting pasta on and leaving it etc), so I can actually take a full lunch break to myself. I can walk my dog for 40 min during my lunch break. I can do errands in down time. I am lucky that I have a really amazing boss, and I'm doing a job that I think puts good things into the world - but man its crazy how many hours in the week are not your own.

My ideal work week would be 5 days of just mornings.

I'm rambling now - but let me know what you think of the 1 hour lunch break and what you do in yours.",False,pctssc,PuzzleheadedLab4425,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pctssc/1_hour_for_lunch_is_not_enough/,32,1

The only time we really have to enjoy our lives is when we’re kids.

755,The real root of stress and slavery is usury interest,"Usury means charging interest. Most people in America have to go into debt for school, a home, or a business. This means paying a bank interest payments. This system use to be outlawed and considered cheating. When you hear people say ""Make your money work for you""  or ""put your money to work"" or ""The cost of money"" they mean they want an increase without working. They want another person or business or entity to ""rent"" their money.  This is the Root of the problem. No amount of work can untangle our country. Usury can be extended 40 and 50 year mortgages which they have in Japan. Imagine waking up every day and 3 or 4+ of your hours just goes towards your interest on your debt. We have a scenario where families are working 3 jobs because their choices are to keep paying or go bankrupt. A lot don't qualify for bankruptcy.       So the hecklers will tell you that nobody forces you to borrow. That it was your greedy choice. Some cultists tell you to eat beans and rice until it is paid off. Well that causes diabetes. Then you slave away to pay for medical bills. God forbid you procreate with the wrong person. The judge informs you of your poverty level for the next 18 years.  Ask yourself if there was no more interest allowed what would life look like.  Remember you are entitled if you ask for anything such as an honest financial system. Just the late fees on credit cards in one year is enough to buy diapers for every child in America. The banks literally trap people with credit scores. I met a sweet elderly couple with no grandchildren. They said their kids had to wait until school loans were paid off. Another decade or so.   We just need to take responsibility for our lives they chime. Money is supposed to be a means of exchange, not a commodity.  Last year a few banks in my Mom's neighborhood burned to the ground.

However, the client, like so many other employers, relies on 3rd party security companies in order to avoid liability, benefits, and others costs that would come with making us in-house employees. Long story short, the last company was so terrible that the client ditched them for a new one. 

At first, my fellow veteran guard and I were hopeful. After all, we’re getting a dollar an hour raise and this company was vetted by the client; the last company was a monopoly that just bought out the one the client actually liked. So what could possibly go wrong?

Well, the new security company manager failed to provide adequate staff and inform us in advance, so now my coworker is being asked to cancel birthday party plans. When my coworker refused, the manager threw a temper tantrum and slammed doors; and now she’s texting me on my day off asking me to cover multiple shifts. Even by corporate lean staffing standards, this is pretty appalling. 

As of now, I’m just refusing to respond, because I’m afraid I would tell her off. I also have enough savings to not work for a while, so even though I’d rather not dip into them, I don’t care too much about getting fired either.

806,Criticizing Kevin Paffrath's proposal of concentration camp for the homeless,"Though it might sound humane at first, Kevin's idea of using the National Guard on civilians in peacetime to remove homeless from Californian streets within 3 months is inherently tyrannical. (He'd apparently then force them into new state concentration camps against their will.) Even the language of using the army to keep the streets safe until the homeless are removed is fascistic.

I don't like having homeless people on the streets, but what he is proposing is crossing the line. He was literally proposing having the national guard on the streets (picture them carrying assault rifles) ""to keep them secure from the homeless,"" which only works if you actually think we're living in fucking Afghanistan. Once he builds his concentration camps he'd then shove any hippy who just wanted to sleep under the stars in at gunpoint.

Even the language of using the army in peacetime on Americans to ostensibly ""keep the streets safe"" until the homeless are removed is fascistic and it sets a dangerous precedent. And then how do we decide who has to go to Paffrath camp, and who gets to stay at their friend's house? How do you ever get to leave the camp if you don't even have means to earn money there? It's just a rich man's sadistic fantasy to put away the undesirables that make him feel dirty.

It's like how in the not so long ago past in England there were ""poor laws"" to criminalize poverty and being unemployed. Christuan society used to think the unemployed were only lazy, so we would imprison them in prisons and force them to do grueling slave labor to make the prison owner a millionaire, because not working was considered a malaise. These laws didn't apply to the rich unemployed, but only the poor, and especially for single women, and women who were prostitutes.

I don't want to bring back forced relocations of people which have never in history been used as a tool to solve economic disparities. These heavy handed methods have only accelerated the divide between the haves and the have-nots. It reminds me of the Japanese Internment and the relocation of Native Americans from plentiful forests to barren deserts where they would be jobless and starve.

807,My job was perfect until they ruined it for no reason.,"I'm a scientist/consultant. I bill my time to clients. as long as I am billing to clients, I am profitable.

Earlier this year I had found a little niche in my office where I go outside and take photos of construction to document progress 2 days a week and provide office support 3 days a week.

it was a great balance. I got to get outside, but also work from home, make profits for my company, make my boss look good, provide value to the client etc.

Then one day they fucked it up for literally no reason. They put me on 3 additional project teams, when I could have probably only taken on one more if I had worked overtime. They Started assigning me more and more work, I've now completely burnt out and now I'm way less productive than before. I dont understand why everything needs to be so fucking difficult.

The fucking kicker to all of this is that we now lost the ability to bill to the construction client for taking photos. Maybe it wasnt as profitable, but it was relaxing easy work that people were willing to pay for. Why would you ever drop that ball???

I'm not even trying anymore. I cant meet my deadlines so why bother?

808,So glad I'm leaving (rant),"I accepted a new job this week that starts on 9/7. The new position pays more, allows me to work from home, and holds the promise of personal and professional growth far beyond what I could have ever achieved at my current job, so needless to say, I'm stoked.

Against my better judgement, I put in 2 weeks notice at my current job (week and a half, actually) so I'm just lingering here, playing out the string. I am honestly enjoying this lame duck period, knowing that nobody expects anything from me. As they are wont to do, my shitty employer still found a way to piss me off today, though.

Just a little backstory: The CEO of my company makes upwards of $6 million per year. Last year, during the peak of the 'Rona, they denied my team our annual merit raises, suspended the company 401(k) match, and took away my team's budget for occasional meals, supplies, etc. We were unapologetically stranded onsite while most everyone else was able to work from home. Then, miraculously, the company sent out their annual EOY financial disclosures - RECORD PROFITS!!! Yay for us! Bonuses for all the executives! Seriously, fuck these people.

On to today's slap in the face, though: I have 56 hours of PTO in my bank that I accrued during the first 8 months of the year. I asked HR to confirm whether I would be paid out that remaining balance on my last check, considering I earned that time and it belongs to me. The answer was a resounding NO. Arizona state law doesn't consider unused PTO as wages like other states, but individual employers are free to set their own policy. Of course, my greedy, shitty employer is going to force me to forfeit 56 hours of earned PTO, because reasons. Adding to that, I am not allowed to use vacation hours during my ""notice period"", and would not be paid for them if I tried. 

So, I told off the HR bitch, 'cause fuck her, that's why! I also intend to use a couple sick days between now and the end of next week, because I have those hours in my bank and sick time *is* protected by AZ state law. Still, there goes more than $1500 worth of earned vacation/holiday time into the void. If they insist on taking their pound of flesh, I'm not going to do jack shit for the remainder of my time here. Worst. Company. Ever.

TL;DR - Got a new job, put in my 2 weeks, current employer is going to screw me out of my earned vacation time, even though the CEO makes $6 million per year and they reported record profits, because reasons.",False,pcsdx5,ThePookums,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pcsdx5/so_glad_im_leaving_rant/,1,1

As an ETP investor it is important to note these two caveats: 1) Human ETPs deliver poor long-term exposure to productive labor and 2) slave uprisings have a history of erasing vast sums of investor capital over holding periods as short as days. Still, short-term human ETPs tend to have better tactical exposure to homo sapiens sapines than other products but also tend to have contango in their future positions resulting in position decay.

820,Nice to see some fellow slackers with a purpose,"Feels nice to see this sub. I've felt guilty and out of place for years and used to blame myself for every job I had just...feeling crappy, and for me being unable to tolerate it. I would become symptomatic physically and mentally usually within a year of starting, and have to stop work from that. In retrospect I thank my body for knowing before my brain that quitting was a way to avoid hours and hours of sickening scheduled bullshit - whether it was an obligation to be nice to creeps at work, to field clients' anger at the front desk as a 22 year old when the management responsible were tucked away safely in offices, being micromanaged or being judged for my performance without being supported. I never felt like part of whatever work 'family' was, and it seemed like I had to sell my soul to join in. It was always extremely grating to try and understand the logic behind this asslicking idea of what work was supposed to be - reading bits and pieces from the communist manifesto in my late teens did not prepare me for the level of alienation in labour these days. When I was at uni I had a huge burnout and got glandular fever in part because the placements I'd done made it abundantly clear that I was gearing up for a life on a fluorescently lit treadmill, and that me working so hard to be qualified wasn't going to be a way to protect me - it was an initiation rite into being walked all over for decades. I still have trouble with huge levels of dissociative inertia at times of day that used to be for getting ready and going to work or uni, and decompressing from work/study - it's left this awful residue on my life long after stopping to protect my health. I have faith that I will find my way into ""work"" that is meaningful and self-directed one day, but I don't really want to call it that.

823,Need advice,"Okay so, at my workplace they recently started, what we are gonna call a “runner” position, it’s basically, someone request ‘x’ item (usually a skid, or cardboard) and you bring it to them. This is an effort to keep people in their own cells and to cut down time of people walking to get said item themselves. Well I volunteered, as the idea of doing something new after doing the same position for a while sounded nice. From the start everyone saw this as a bad idea, as a lot of times, you don’t know what item you’ll need until the time of needing said thing, so you’ll have someone request an item from me and then they will pretty much just stand around and wait, also for me there’s a lot of downtime, as I go from being super busy to basically doing nothing. if anything costing the company more time. Anyways, so at our meeting 2 days ago, I and a couple others shared our thoughts about this and told them about downtime, and it’s not a very good system. As of yesterday, the only changes they made was now I’m suppose to produce while also being a runner to stop me from having downtime.

Short answer, if you're successful you have tons of money to spend on whatever you want. And
till you get kiss a fair amount of time as well. Money + time = freedom.

Sons of money not in the literal sense, but from an adolescent's perspective, absolutely. Your
discretionary spending power could easily jump 3-x when you get a job out of college (any
college). The freedom is amazing.

All you have to do is not screw up. To no drugs. To through college with good grades. On't be
irresponsible at work. On't spend beyond your means. And don't wreck your health by having
too much alcohol/ high calorie stuff. It's even possible to screw up and recover (although |
wouldn't advise it). Trust me, adult life, if you (mostly) don't screw up, and if you (mostly) don't
""settle down"" with kiss of your own, and if you stay a kid at heart, is amazing!

P.S. - having kiss of your own is also great, but only if you're really ready for it. Otherwise it can
be tough.

848,Thoughts from a workaholic business owner,"Confession first, I am a workaholic.

I work 7 days a week, 10 hours a day, with a day or two off per month.  I do this because I run a business, and the work needs to be done.  Even when we're fully staffed I work full time, and if someone is sick everyone else gets right of refusal with the knowledge that I'm fine with taking the shift.  We pay a living wage to start, and really, we are a dream job.  Good money (with regular bonuses and raises for cost of living increases), treated like a human being, with reasonable workloads.  The other owner and I are both up front that we will be as involved in our employees lives as they choose.  Need help moving?  Short money one month?  Have a bad break up and just need to spend a shift unloading?  Cool, we got you.

Creating this is backbreaking.  My last two employees left on good terms for health reasons, and now I'm back hiring and training, while handling the lion's share of the work to maintain the shop.  My workload is not reasonable, and the fact that people do this for their employers is disturbing.  

It is MY (and every other employer's) job to fill the gaps, and come in for the shifts that no one wants or can do, not the employee's.  If someone wants to work an extra day here and there to save for something, cool, but Jesus titty-fucking Christ, working like this is not okay, it's not healthy.  I have an IDEAL situation where I live above my shop, and am within walking distance of all my necessities, and I am still stretched to the point where I can't really have hobbies, or a life outside my work. 

Please, to every other workaholic out there, don't do it for some fucking rich person you'll never meet.  Don't give yourself to a thresher expecting to be treated like a person.  Even if it doesn't earn you a cent, pour that energy into something or someone you love, start your own business, improve your community, start 50 hobbies that last two weeks each, and live, really live.

855,1 hour is not long enough for lunch,"I have always thought this and I feel like no one talks about it. 1 hour for lunch sounds like a long time, but it's not. If you're using lunch to do an errand, you might realistically have 20 mins of transit time from your work to the errand, and another 20 min back - leaving you with 20 min to do what you need to do. Then if you use it for an errand, you haven't had lunch - so what happens? You buy something and eat it at your desk? it feels unsanitary and I want to separate where i work and where I live!!!

The idea of 'going out to lunch' with someone sounds great - but realistically, you can't fit a social lunch in to 1 hour, including transit time, ordering, conversation, eating. I have tried it before and the entire time I just felt rushed and like I would get in trouble. I can't enjoy the lunch break because I'm worried about not making it back within the 1 hour time slot. The expectation of working 9-5 and a 1 hour lunch break makes it pretty much impossible to socialise and do pleasurable things during the day. That's such a simple fact, but I feel robbed of that because I've been a student for so long and I'm just entering the work force!!

Even if the only activity you do is eat your own lunch on your lunch break, 1 hour isn't enough. You can't decompress from work and psych yourself up again in that time and have it be relaxing. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I wrote here is based on summer office jobs I've had. I'm lucky enough that I got my first real job during the pandemic - so it's been totally remote. I am amazed at how much time I can get back this way - no transit time, I can make lunch during work pretty much (putting pasta on and leaving it etc), so I can actually take a full lunch break to myself. I can walk my dog for 40 min during my lunch break. I can do errands in down time. I am lucky that I have a really amazing boss, and I'm doing a job that I think puts good things into the world - but man its crazy how many hours in the week are not your own. 

My ideal work week would be 5 days of just mornings.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm rambling now - but let me know what you think of the 1 hour lunch break and what you do in yours.",False,pctp7w,PuzzleheadedLab4425,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pctp7w/1_hour_is_not_long_enough_for_lunch/,0,1
856,If you do anything for 8 hours a day for 5 days a week it's considered obsessive,"Sorry obvious tired point. 

In winter leaving in the dark then making the commute home in the dark...not seeing your family...tired...exhausted...not finding time for anything else...all consuming...that's what obsession is...but we don't recognise that, we recognise 'you're going part time? PART time? Like half of what we all do?' That's not full is it? You're skipping. 

I was on a beard forum once (yes a forum all about men growing beards and seemingly needing encouragement as every post is asking if it looks good or not) and there was someone on there who gave himself the name The Bearded Bus Driver. I just...why would someone want to be defined as that? I'm not knocking the job, it has more value than most jobs. Every photo he'd take would be at work in the uniform. It's nice (that's probably patronising) that he enjoys being a bus driver enough to present himself as that, obviously he shouldn't be ashamed. 

I also googled 'being a bus driver reddit' and got some AMAs. Every bus driver I've ever seen in real life has been fed up. In the ama one bus driver said that drivers usually start upbeat then get grinded down, but the banter at his place was good. Also said 'If you don’t enjoy the job, get another job'. But it's being forced to do the same thing every day for 40 hours a week that people don’t like isn't it? Not the actual thing. If it was a part of your life and not all consuming in terms of hours and energy maybe a person's relationship with their work changes? Also for bus drivers, the abuse of course. 

I knew someone who left my work place to be a bus driver then came back and said that he got so used to his route it became so routine it was dangerous for him, he wanted new ones but never got them. 

My favourite things to do in the world...i obsess over them, commit, but give myself days off constantly so I look forward to them again. 

Then i looked at bus driver wages and thought...well if your outgoings are high they'll never enjoy the wage (it's not high anyway). We can't even appreciate the mental impact of repetition, we say 'soul destroying job' separate from the economic obligation to earn a living. 

I've been getting a bus for a 5 hour drive down the country. The first time the bus driver on a Saturday was chirpy. Literally said 'yeah go on, i can see your ticket'. Didn't need to show. Second time the following Friday he looked knackered, you could see the pain in his eyes as people are complaining and one man moans about lack of leg room. 'I'm just a driver, i don't have a screw driver, i can't do anything'. I see the pain and anguish of workers all the time but i get the impression others either don’t spot it or don't care to. 

In 2021 it still really baffles me how fixed on this we are. The technology we have, 1000 billionaires in the world, our consumerism killing the planet leading to our extinction. And there's absolutely no other way.

It's easier said than done, the younger generation craves eating shit for 8 hours a day to give themselves a pat on the back whilst neglecting their purpose. Its then flipped as a sort of Stockholm syndrome to love to work to feel a sense of purpose or importance. 

Comes the weekend &amp; they blow cash on alcohol &amp; drugs and this is life. Stupid enough to work all week yet the small compromise at 5PM Friday makes it seem worthwhile. I dont support Marxism or communism but Capitalism is no way to go.

870,I sometimes wonder what the point of all this is.,"If you link about the average life of a human it all seems pointless at times. You spend most of you childhood going to school roughly 8-5 year after year. (Sound Familiar?) And when your finally done what do you get a in the end? A high school diploma which it turns out to be pretty fucking useless!

So what are the options? Well you could go into the military....but it looks like we might be headed back to Afghanistan for another 20 years so maybe not such a good idea.

What about a trade? Trades are good to get into and you can make some pretty decent money. The world needs electricians, plumber and mechanics. The problem is that most trade labor is hard manual work...again nothing wrong with that but if you plan on working in the trades your entire working career but the time you hit retirement you body is going to be so worn out and broken down you probably won't have much of a retirement...or I should say a pain free retirement. 

What about college? Sure sink yourself into an insane amount of debt for most likely a useless degree. Not all college degrees are useless just most of them. (Sound familiar?) Then after acquiring said degree you have to battle it out in the same job market with hundreds of other people with useless degrees battling for the same job with shit pay, shit benefits, and shit management. But at least the company can brag every quarter about all the insane profits they are making and then when it come time for a raise what do you get? A couple of percent?

887,Just got paid. Worth the stress? Idk,"I just got paid $937 for two 45 hour work weeks. I really only got actually paid maybe $700. The rest was a one time promotion bonus thing. 

I, like any other human, appreciate money. But whats been recently making me rather depressed is that i have little to no time to hang with my girlfriend or family. I don’t even have time to do simple housework or make myself something decent to eat. Ive been living off of frozen pizza, ramen, and canned fucking spaghetti for the past month. 

I live in a low cost of living region so maybe thats why $11.40 an hour for a position in management seems a little light to me. Or maybe its because it actually is too light in general. 

Cheapest place to rent near me is $800+ with $750 security deposit and $250 pet fee. That also doesn’t include the fact that i need car insurance on a spotty driving record. 

Moving out of my parents place sounds awesome and I really need to do that but the more i crunch the numbers the more i worry about “what if” ya know. 

Ive been job hopping for four years now because ive been fired over changes in company policy, issues having to do with me having issues with my superior being a belligerent racist to my other coworkers, got yeeted by a chinese buffet because they wanted to hire more chinese workers so they fired me and four other employees to make room. 

This is my second full time job and i already miss working in a sweaty manufacturing warehouse where i was only there 6 hours three or four days a week to do final assembly on prepped machines. Just drilling shit together with an impact drill for $20 an hour. 
Lost that job cuz the boss sold the company after firing everyone btw. 

Capitalism boys and girls i wish i was making this shit up. 

Long P.S. - wanted to mention this cuz ive seen it a lot. People take for granted exactly how much harder it is in the workforce for anyone that has any kind of felony or misdemeanor on their record. These people can go 6 months maybe even a year without any employers calling them for an interview just because of some mistakes and stupid decisions they might’ve made in the past. Some deserve all that and more, but others reform after some time. Some of the greatest people ive ever met were ex cons. If you know anyone that has trouble finding even the simplest job to get by, put aside your judgement give them a helping hand so they can have a fighting chance at turning themselves into a better more functional and right minded person.

Because the owners, the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now, the BIG owners! The Wealthy… the REAL owners! The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.


Forget the politicians. They are irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice! You have OWNERS! They OWN YOU. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls.


They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying, to get what they want.  Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don’t want: 


They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. That's against their interests.


That's right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that!


You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shitty jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from you sooner or later cause they own this fucking place! It's a big club, and you ain’t in it!  You, and I, are not in the big club.


By the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table has tilted folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care! Good honest hard-working people; white collar, blue collar it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard-working people continue, these are people of modest means, continue to elect these rich cock suckers who don’t give a fuck about you….they don’t give a fuck about you… they don’t give a FUCK about you.


They don’t care about you at all… at all… AT ALL.  And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. That's what the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick thats being jammed up their assholes everyday, because the owners of this country know the truth.


It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.""

I guess I didn't do well on it, because they sent me an email saying that they couldn't accept me at the time based off of my skill level. I had such high hopes. Looking back at the 5 separate emails they sent me where they said I would be a great candidate for their job, how I would fit in perfectly, how they could use someone like me. What is the point of an entry level, willing to train, no experience job if you're not going to train someone you think would be fantastic candidate in the areas they didn't do so well in?

I come in early, work late, do more than asked, be very organized, come up with solutions to problems, and more and more. I’m rewarded with getting displaced to the lowest level job, and a $6/hr pay cut. 

I find a new job that is further away but seems promising and interesting work. I get the job and start work. I’m there for a month before I’m laid off because they can’t get parts in to complete the jobs. 

I go on unemployment secretly because I’m surrounded by republicans for friends and family who don’t believe in unemployment or “taking things for free”. I own a small business of my own that I do on the side, but it hasn’t been a good summer. 

So here I am on unemployment which is about to run out. I have had to do 4 jobs searches every week in order to get my unemployment. I’m sending in my resume to AT LEAST 4 places every week if not more. I’m trying to find jobs that will pay what I need for my budget, and jobs that I know I can do. After 4 months I’ve only gotten one call back from a place. One job I found was literally my dream job. I followed up several times with no answer or reply from them. I finally managed to get the guy on the phone and he sounded VERY aggravated that I had called. He told me they weren’t ready to hire yet and when they were they’d let me know. Why even post the job then? I’ve followed up with several other places by phone and email and NEVER receive a reply. Even just out of respect to acknowledge they got my message. 

I have pounded pavement with my own business as well. Cold calling places, going directly in there. Every one says the same thing, give me your information and we’ll get back to you. Call to follow up and they don’t answer or reply back. Where is the decency? You can’t tell me that any of them are THAT busy they can’t afford 30 seconds to make a call or send an email? Even if it’s just to say no. That’s better then sitting around waiting.

950,"Labor Aristocracy and Capitalist Meritocracy which makes them in a nutshell: ""Don't worry about changing the rules, just focus on being the fleeting exception to them!""","Capitalism is a pyramid-shaped economy meaning there are a limited number of spaces available at any given moment for those in the labor aristocracy boat. We cannot all be labor aristocracy because if we were then we would all make the same amount of money making us all poor again. The prices for commodities and services would rise to compensate for the wages to avoid economic stagnation because under capitalism, the state is of the bourgeois class so their money cannot be seized to fix the issue, instead they seize ours. 

&amp;#x200B;

A percieved alternative to this is international struggle, which would increase to compensate for the increased plundering used to prop up a labor aristocratic US (imperialism..social fascism). This is what happened in the 70s and 80s, and when the US lost the international fight against places like Korea and Vietnam, our wages and unions were crushed instead of dissolving some of the bourgeois class, the labor aristocracy was shrunk to maintain the rich. In other words, social democracy lead to the neoliberalist fascism we have today via it's own design. For the rich to exist there must be an imbalance, a poor to create the context of rich. The more poor there are, the few rich there are, and vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

Capitalism is a pyramid-shaped economy that is quickly devolving into an Eiffel Tower shaped economy in it's old age with these same labor aristocrats shrinking in size with their pette bourgeoisie neighbors as time progresses. Meaning, there are very few exceptions to these rules as time goes on, making labor aristocrats who cry bootstraps even more incorrect as time goes on and the true solution becoming outlining with an even glossier illumination of gold; We need socialism. 

&amp;#x200B;

The bourgeoisie have to be crushed via united militant (illegal) class action (might of labor and democracy..strikes and a workers government) and their wealth absorbed by our class, the only truly immortal class of humans no matter the economy. We are workers, and work will always need to be done at some capacity. We will always be around.

992,My life in work; a vent,"Feeling sad and lost today. My job is burning me out. I'm an analytical thinker, and my job is purely administrative data-entry work. I'm bored out of my mind by every single task I do. The only fun I get at my job is writing excel VBA to automate some tasks, but even automation is limited due to restrictions placed on my machine. I want to go into a more cognitive job, but most of the stuff I'm finding requires experience or a degree. Frustrated with the job search, especially in my area right now. Additionally, this job is in a medical office, so I'm hesitant to quit due to how it will look on my med school application. 

I feel like an NPC at my job. Everyone needs everything from me urgently, and my workload is equal to the load of two or three employees. My manager's daughter is my coworker and spends the whole day on YouTube. I get it, but I'm also resentful. My new coworker got hired in the middle of July. He's nice and all, but the person training him only trained him on his new role for about 8 hours, then left to her new department, leaving me to train him on a role I've never performed. The ball got dropped, and now I'm picking up the pieces, all for the same pay I had when I got hired into this position. 

I want to go to school full-time, but I have bills to pay. My credit is shot from some medical bills that went to collections when I was 18, so I don't have much hope for enough student loans to go to school. My parents won't fill out the FAFSA and will not cosign on any private loans I could get. I'm so envious of my partner, who is going to college in person this semester on the GI bill. She did her time, but I still wish I could be in classes alongside her. 

I feel hopeless. Life is going to be a drag until I can get my degree from going to school part-time. I keep waking up in the morning and dragging myself to work, but I feel so empty. My psychiatrist said to get more exercise and sunlight. I get home from my job and want to depress from the day, but then I have online schoolwork. Then housework. My time doesn't feel like my own. I don't even like being at home! I feel like a caged animal.   My ideal situation right now would be to go to school full-time. To spend time after class in the library studying. Getting my school work done, working toward my future, and then pursuing hobbies after that.

996,This is the second time the company I work for was acquired and I'm sick of this happening,"Five years ago I worked at a startup that was gobbled up by a corporate giant shortly before I left. Prior to the buyout, the culture was really great, everyone seemed genuinely happy to be there (or at least didn't hate the job). Once talks of a merge/buyout started, the air totally changed. They started bringing in all these stuffy investors and giving them tours of the place, would freak out if anyone even had their phone on their desk. During one of these stupid show &amp; tells, I was at the cafe next door getting coffee and I shit you not, the CFO walked in with one of the investor guys and CUT ME in line. Like clearly saw me and just went ahead because apparently I'm not a person, nor was anyone behind me. I got the hell out as fast as I could, and everyone I know who still works there is just miserable. They all got totally boned out of most of their employee stocks when the merger happened too. 

Now I'm at a much smaller business for the past 3 or so years. We were again, purchased by a massive company, and now things just seem so off. There's so much heat coming down from above that even our supervisors are stressed, and they have never complained before. I am so pissed because they continue to refuse raises &amp; provide better insurance despite bragging about record profits/revenue every fucking month. 

I am so sick of megacorporations snatching literally everything up and destroying it in the name of moneymoneymoney. Both of these companies did not start out as toxic or shitty places to work. It's almost like the main goal of starting a small business is to eventually sell it and walk away with the cash you didn't even earn.

While he behaves in a better way with me (probably cause I have a very strong no bullshit filter) he is the meanest bastard towards my good friend (and only friend I have there) who just came back after a pretty long sick leave caused by stress and I’m so mad that he is making my friend so damn miserable! 

Just  because there are certain things my friend still can’t do at work yet, and while they work very hard, they have to know their limits otherwise they will just end up getting sick again, but he still pushes them into work and tight deadlines, that’s literally causing them stress. They could be given all other kinds of other work that needs to be done but isn’t as stressful. He doesn’t give a shit. In his mind if you cannot do 100% then you should just pull yourself together. He knows nothing about what they have been through and how much they can take and when they explains that to him he just tells them to “just do better” that he doesn’t treat me like this, just makes me even more pissed, he is going after someone who isn’t as mentally strong and is still in a vulnerable state, I have no respect for people like this and never will. 

I have talked to my friend about it and I’m more than willing to give him a good talk, but they don’t want me to fight their fight, which I respect 100% it just pisses me off I cannot do more than this.

1016,Rank in a company does not make someone a better quality person,"Hello all,

Yesterday was a series of firsts for me.  It was the first time I rage quit a meeting, and the first time I went to HR. 

Backstory: I work remotely in a virtual company. My department, and our VP, were in a call with another VP and our vendor on a project I am leading.  My VP (Vice President), does not seem to know what my branch of the company does, and when I try to explain just dismisses me like a kid at the adult's table.  

So he, call him Attie, arrives late to the meeting as we are doing introductions and steamrolls the discussion.  He keeps using the wrong terms, and the vendor tries to correct him but he blows it off with an ""I don't know your terms"".  Then he asks for an explanation of what the process entails. 

I offer my expertise as the subject matter expert and project lead, but as I begin speaking he cuts me off with a ""HotStep, I was talking to Vendor. I want a single source of truth.""

I shut off my screen, muted my mic, and went into the greatest rage I have ever known.  I reached out to the corporate head of my department and HR.  My direct manager was there too, and backed me up on everything I was upset about. 

I documented everything, sent emails and kept copies of all discussions, and met with HR.  She took my info, my managers, and is meeting with the VP's boss to have a talk with Attie.  

This was the first time in my life I've felt so completely disrespected and dismissed.  It's even worse since the company always tells me to be more assertive when I am in a meeting, but then disrespects me in front of a vendor.  

Needless to say, I'm glad the week is about over.

Before the anaemic struck, working from
home seemed like a incredible per for many
employees. Employers often fretted about
how offering this coveted benefit would
affect productivity, tearworn, and
communication. Which is why a mere 14
percent of employees were working
remote before COVID-19, according to
information from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. Those numbers have practically
increased and remain high even after the
nationwide shutdown has lifted. A Stanford
researcher estimates that 42 percent of the
U.S. labor force is working from home full-

1035,UPDATE: Got wrote up for working overtime. Fuck predatory companies. Here is my resignation letter,"I had received multiple requests for an update from my post last week where I gave a very professional ""fuck you, pay me"" letter (with grammar mistakes) due to a final conflict that was the final straw for me. So here is what happened following,


The next day we had an 8a.m call that everyone was required to attend (which I obviously did not..) however since I sent the letter around 7p.m the night before I didn't know if my manager would have called me asking where I was... 8:30 came by and I received a response from HR. 


They responded thanking me for their time, and stated that after performing an audit they noticed ~20 hours of overtime that was unpaid and will be included on my final paycheck. *It was as simple as that*. No back and forth, no arguing. They did a simple count and paid out. There were plenty of hours I probably could have gotten but those would have been a little more difficult to prove since it wasn't ""tracked"" on the desktop software. However, I was not worried about it.


I did notice they didn't include my bonus in there and responded stating ""I did not see the final paycheck breakdown include my bonus for closed loans. Per our contract and the report (which I pulled the night before and attached) I am entitled to a $250 bonus. Please include this"".


Manager responded ""Glad you caught that"". That's literally it. My immediate team lead (one of the ones that butted heads called) and I didn't answer. He left a voice-mail asking me to call him back and I never did. Two of the LOs called (these two were on a team and were the only 2 people I got along with) asking what happened and if everything was okay. I explained the situation to them and it turns out that the company has been through ~8 mortgage processors in the past year for the same reason. The loan processors that quit before me with a 2 weeks notice the company let go on the spot anyway.. both of these Loan officers stated I could use them for a reference and wished me luck and they understood which meant a lot to me. 


I had a recruiter I worked with in the past open my file back up. And had an interview scheduled 2 days later. Today i heard back from them for a remote job offer making $5/hr more and a slightly better loan bonus structure ($1,500ish a month). The company averages a smaller workload than I'm used to which means less work and the recruiter had a long relationship with them... apparently they all are the ""laid back, easy going"" types. 


So, all in all I got what was owed to me - I had a week off (albeit stressful) and I got a new job offer making more. While also causing the old job to be in a tough spot due to the ""urgent"" loan closings I had. I'm happy with the results. 

So, a happy ending for this one. And because I knew my rights and stood up for myself I got what was rightfully owed... shouldn't have to but it is what it is.

1053,Today I finally had my last day of work.,"I have had it since the first month. Worked in a bakery in which full time meant 6 days a week and often in which 2 days are 13 hours shift. I hated it there, it was exhausting, mind numbing, jaw clenching shitty job. No overhours paid, the customers were rude, pay was low. The coworkers were the only cool thing, but our boss tried to make us try to eat each other by pushing sort of competitions on who is able to sell the most. I choose late shifts because starting to work at 6 in the morning made me extra tired on top of working without breaks.  During late shift you are sadly on your own. Actually you are two but if you have people who quit every single month (no joke, yesterday someone quit as well) I had to be the one teaching the newbies on top of working in the bakery, run the cafe, cleaning, baking, taking in orders and forwarding them, and taking reservations. My boyfriend said I show signs of depression and after I was able to pay off one debt, I immediately put in my notice, which had to be 4 weeks! I know, fml, but screw it I said, I will survive another month. It was the worst month ever because my supervisor had a two weeks vacation, and I had to work with the new person who is going to take my position and she was one of the most incompetent worker I ever had the pleasure to work with. Couldn‘t even sign in for work properly after 2 weeks of working. I had to clean up the mess after her. I had to grit my teeth going through this month. But I made it, I finally made it. Not gonna lie, I shed a couple of tears when I got out of that place. I have now one month all for myself and I intend to use it to build a small online business. I will do everything in my power to make it work because I will do everything in the world not to go back to that toxicity again.

1056,To the Lady at the Store the Other Day Who Said “No One Wants to Work Anymore Due to Government Handouts”,"M’am, we live in a super conservative state that was against those handouts. Due to this, the Governor of our state thought “if we stop the handouts, people will go back to work”

The governor stopped those handouts in our state TWO MONTHS ago and instead of things getting better, they have got worse. What do you mean government handouts when those ended in our state two months ago?

Are you going to put the blame on millenials which is an age group born between 1981-1996? Those millenials are 25-40 years old and ironically, you fall under that same age group? Or are you going to classify millenials as 17-21 year olds who are attending college, school, etc? 

M’am, will you ever realize this isn’t a “liberal government handout thing” since we’ve ended handouts here two months ago? Hospital workers, teachers, construction workers, and workers of all fields AND AGE GROUPS are quitting their jobs! I even done a study a while back showing this would happen due to the rise of worker abuse during covid, but all you want to do is blame “Biden”.

This was even a growing issue during Trump’s time, but you idolize him so much that you won’t admit he has done some wrong. It’s even got so bad that EVERY SCHOOL IN OUR CITY is closed for 4 days due to understaffing issues! The understaffing issues are so bad I had to take my cousin to school because she doesn’t have a bus driver anymore 

And you tell me this is because of government handouts and millenial laziness? Once again, we ended handouts in our state two months ago and the studies have shown it’s of all working class age groups. It’s been 20-30 years in our state and teachers and bus drivers are making the same amount of money as 20-30 years ago. Meanwhile rent has gone up insanely here due to inflation, grocery prices have also sky rocketed, and everyday living has gone up. No teacher should have to work two jobs when they were told “if you go to college your life will be set.” You also call the lower class, the same people who keep the rest of society flowing by taking these service jobs, “lazy”? 

Are you going to teach the kids of the nation? Are you going to be a roofer? Are you going to work overtime at a fast food restaurant while having customers Bitch you out because they want free food? Are you going to be a garbage person worker? Are you going to be a truck delivery driver? Are you going to keep the grass around public sidewalks trimmed? Are you going to work at a grocery store(which might I add has the highest suicide rate of any worker)?
No?
No you’re not because you call those “lazy/easy jobs.” If they’re so easy, then why are they struggling to find workers? If they’re so easy, then why would society collapse without these services? 

Did you know that if you’re the only person or two working a dollar general store, you can be expected to work 80+ hour weeks due to the short staffing? You’ll be expected to check inventory, stock, so on and so fourth while running register? Do you honestly think anyone making minimum wage in our state should be doing 80 hours on minimum wage?",False,pbzocq,Ro_Capone,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pbzocq/to_the_lady_at_the_store_the_other_day_who_said/,12,1

1073,I can’t take it and my partner doesn’t understand (rant),"In various jobs I have been puked on, insulted by customers, had my hair pulled by little kids, bullied by my supervisors (one pinched me sometimes and insulted me every day). I’ve worked in warehouses and fast food and cleaned toilets and shoveled manure. I’ve cried in so many office closets and walk in freezers. Hell, I cried just this morning.

I’ve struggled with mental illness (anxiety, OCD, severe depression) my whole life which is why I put up with a lot of abuse at work in the past- I felt like I didn’t have a choice if I wanted to keep my jobs, and my parents said I could not live with them as an adult. I also needed the money for therapy and medication - but my symptoms were also exacerbated by my jobs.

I was never paid well for any of these jobs and I don’t have hardly anything to show for my hard work and I’ve been working since I was 16. All I have are bad memories.

In my current job which I took out of dire necessity I’ve been bullied a bit and have a micromanaging team leader. I work under and report to 4 separate people and field questions from strangers all week. I am an introvert. I hate the work and find both boring and stressful. Spending 8 hours every day doing it hurts me deeply.

My partner on the other hand never had to do physical labor jobs and was never bullied at work. In fact, he gets away with being kind of a jerk at times. (I am always super friendly and accommodating to people. Probably a defense mechanism.) He had never had to skip meals or worry about health insurance. He likes his job and makes 6 figures, and good for him. 

However he just does not seem to understand how much my job has a negative effect on my life. He is always relaxed and doesn’t worry about money. I worry all the time about money and … everything. He wonders why I don’t just take hours off to do laundry or play video games like he does. (We are monitored via work chat). I feel like we are in two separate worlds.

1101,Four month unpaid internship that encouraged me to keep on studying [Long],"This happened a couple of years ago, but I am still super salty about it since it kinda changed the plans I made for myself on a personal and a professional level for the next five years. It is still the worst working experience I had so far and I've had plenty of internships and student jobs since.

In the first half of 2016, I was finishing my bachelor's degree in legal practise. With this degree, I was planning on becoming a paralegal, hoping to become a legal counsel after a couple years of experience. Part of the three year program was a nearly full semester (mandatory) internship whilst writing a bachelor dissertation.

I found an internship at the headquarters of one of the biggest banks in my country in a department that deals with the assets of it's deceased clients. I had two conversations before my starting date with the head of department, who was a lawyer. There is a certain kind of lawyers that looks down on paralegals. Put a pin that.

My first day, the head of department showed me my desk and ... asked what the purpose of the internship was, even though the school send her loads of information. I told her that I was suppose to perform tasks that someone with my degree would do. She told me okay but that my laptop and account weren't there yet and that it could take another day or two. No problem, I brought my own laptop in case I needed to do some kind of research.

""No, no. You won't be doing any research, that's for the *actual* legally trained. Take a seat next to [colleague's name]. You can observe and assist until your laptop arrives tomorrow and your account is ready."" Okay..., no problem, I guess?. But ""tomorrow"" turned out to mean ""two months from now"". So HALF my internship, I was seated next to a colleague, just watching them work. Eight hours a day. For two months. Watching someone perform tasks I wasn't allowed to do.


No big deal, you'd think, considering I wasn't getting paid anyway, but the problem was that the head of department needed to evaluate my performances every month and send a report to the school. Since I didn't perform any tasks, however, she gave me bad grades on all marks.


After two months I finally got my laptop, which turned out was already waiting for me on day 1, as was the account (the head of department just didn't bother to check). I then thought I was able to do some actual (para)legal work. She told me I could answer incoming phone calls of clients (read: next of kin) and answer their questions. I was okay with this, considering many of them had (semi-)legal questions. Occasionally, a lawyer or notary would call, so that was fun.


One day a colleague of mine got a question from a client concerning a specific legal matter. Our head of department (lawyer) and the other legal counsel were not present, so she feared she couldn't help the client. However, since I had training as a paralegal, I was actually able to help out! I was kinda proud of myself that since it was a fairly complicated matter. I explained the client and he was happy.


The next day, however, my head of department found out that I helped a client with a legal matter and she was livid. Remember when I said that some lawyers look down on paralegals? Yeah, shit hit the proverbial fan and I was right in the splash zone. How dare I answer a legal question when I was not a lawyer? How dare I diminish her degree and make a fool of lawyers by thinking I could perform their job? Yadiyada, all of the ""usual"" things. After that day I was no longer allowed to answer incoming calls and only was allowed to do outgoing calls.


These outgoing calls consisted of calling the next of kin of a recently deceased. ""Recently"" meant that the deceased had been death for one week. Some people are able to answer questions about their deceased loved one one week after their passing. Some are not. Though I was a bit hesitant to call the family of a recently deceased one week after their passing, it was my job so I did it. I was polite, and understanding if people broke down, which happened regularly. I was just happy to be doing something. Only, I was only allowed to make max. 5 calls each day. After they were done, I had to ""observe"" colleagues for tasks she did not allow me to do. My chef made sure that the clients I did call were always the most difficult conversations to have. Like the mother of a 14 year old who killed himself or a father whose daughter got killed in an accident.


The final month of the internship, the head of department instructed the entire team to increase the numbers on the booklets we send out. These booklets was a free, informational brochure with more information about what needed to happen with the banking accounts, insurances, ... etc of the deceased. She instructed us to always ask (read: push) the clients if they were interested in the brochure and send as many as possible. The other headquarter offices had sent about 120 out past month. Since my head of department and I weren't really seeing eye to eye after the whole deal with the phone call, I thought I'd to an effort to amp up our office's numbers. By the end of my internship, our office had sent out 157 of these booklets. 101 of them were sent out by me. The other 56 were divided over twelve other employers. The head of department never even acknowledged the work I had done to sent out these shitty booklets and even congratulated herself that we had the highest number of all firms. 


After the above mentioned call, people were also shifting blame to me for files I wasn't even working on. I could here people over the phone saying ""Oh, yeah, we've an intern... must have been his fault"". I wasn't allowed to do anything besides answering phone calls, how could anything be my fault? Complaining to my chef wasn't an option since any time I went over to her she sighed and rolled her eyes. I just kept on working the best I could for the little work I head. She also shifted blame on me, though she frigging knew she didn't allowed me to do anything.


Remember the bachelor dissertation? She was supposed to read it and ask questions on my presentation which she new prior to me starting. When someone from the school came for the presentation, she *threw* my dissertation on the desk in front of her and ask ""Was I supposed to do anything with this 'cause I didn't really care about it"" as if she didn't knew. After the presentation was done, the representative from the school asked what my plans were after graduating. I told her I was fiddling with the idea of going to university and try to complete the bridging program so I could hopefully obtain my master of laws and become a lawyer ('cause, y'know, I was treated as shit as a paralegal). My head of department scoffed and said ""Are you sure you wanna do that? Cause that's only for a select few, y'know. I don't think you have the maturity for that.""


Perhaps I was a bit naïve to think she'd like the fact that I sent out almost as much booklets on my own than the other office did with their entire team, that I was there each and every day, often staying late in case something came up that I could help with, but alas. The grade she gave me was barely enough to pass. Since the internship was 25% of the entire credit of the ENTIRE program, she made sure I wasn't getting any kind of distinction on my grade, which in our line of work is always a big plus on your resume. I was so fed up and distraught by the way she treated me, I thought ""if this is how paralegals are treated, I am not having it"". 

So yeah, I enrolled in the bridging program for the master of laws, even though it was ""only for a select few and I wasn't mature enough"", completed the bridging program (cum laude), earned my master of laws (cum laude) and just now an advanced master. 

This set me back 5 years, as I wasn't planning on studying after graduating as a paralegal. In stead of working for five years and gaining working experience, earning money to being my life as I was planning, I went to uni for the next five years, continuing to study and proving this woman wrong and that I could actually achieve something.",False,pbc2k3,TheSixthMambo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pbc2k3/four_month_unpaid_internship_that_encouraged_me/,0,1

1107,H3llo Antiworkers,"It's neat to find a subreddit of like-minded individuals.

For most of my life, the idea of having to work lame, uninteresting, low pay jobs has never appealed to me. It's always been a struggle. It doesn't help that most of my life i have had anxiety from hell, so interviews and the first couple days/weeks any where, have always been difficult. 

It's not that I don't want to work, rather i want to do work that is meaningful to me. But so far, nothing catches my eye, and it seems most available jobs are just awful. Spending 8+hours somewhere you don't want to be, doing something you don't want to do.... Just to pay bills, rent, gas, food, just to do it all again, day after day. 

I just quit a job where i was making $16.5/hour. I worked there for 2 years and some change. Had to quit because, well I hated it, and my shoulder froze up from the repetitive nature of the work, and it was nights, and I became depressed and gained weight. I had never made that much money. Prior to that i was making $13, and prior to that 10.82/hr. 

Even at $16.50, all i could think was, I still can't afford life. I wasn't living paycheck to paycheck, in fact I got really, really good managing money. But things like car repairs, or medical bills, or trips, still felt like they did me in, setting me back months. 

I'm taking time off, I might go back to school, or try for some higher paying jobs in the $20/hour range. Or seek out a job trade. I've been having terrible depression, daily thoughts of suicide (due to dissatisfaction with my life, as well as loneliness, been single my entire life though i have been with two women). 

If I don't find a meaningful career, I'm not sure what will become of me, as minimum wage jobs just don't cut it. I've seriously considered buying a sailboat and just living off the fat of the ocean, becoming an old man on the sea and doing odd jobs and such. Just me, my boat, books, zombie video games, fishing, and an occasional woman to keep me company. And a cat, I'd want a boat cat.

After the \~7 years in the white collar workforce, I have begun to think that laziness doesn't really exist in the colloquial sense. Everyone uses it to describe a characteristic that someone is unwilling to put in effort for no reason. If you agree with that rough definition, then I would say that this is bullshit. I think there aren't many actually lazy people, just unmotivated.   


I think we can all agree that work, for most of us, is the opposite of motivating and energizing. I look at my daughter (7), and she can barely stand do to anything for more than 10 min. that is not bursting at the seems with fun. I think this is biology.

1128,Moral Dilemma: Should I Strike October 15?,"Hello, Antiwork  


I am a government employee in a major American city. I have worked in welfare for four years now &amp; have seen the myriad ways in which people fall through the cracks, are criminally neglected, and ultimately are betrayed by their communities and government. The experience has made me jaded, to say the least, and my instinct is to participate in a general strike. Since Clinton's welfare reforms in the mid-'90s, welfare (or 'Self-Sufficiency Programs' as they like to heinously brand them) has served to provide toxic employers with a large, pliable supply of labor. [There are far less people receiving cash assistance today than before the reforms](https://scheerpost.com/2021/08/23/peter-edelman-what-democrats-did-to-welfare-is-coming-back-to-haunt-them/). I know from our own government budgets that we take most of the money. If we get $100 to spend on these programs, my organization takes $55 for ourselves and gives $45 to the clients. I think that's grotesque, considering all we do is manage information (take applications/renewals/periodic reports in, dole out benefits). We don't perform surgeries. We don't actually hire or train people. We push them into the dystopian, modern American workplace at all costs.   


On the other hand, we do give the people something (even if it is paltry), and many of the work requirements have been waived since COVID-19 was declared an emergency. Strikers aren't allowed to receive benefits, but we barely verify anything. You could all just ""inadvertently"" omit that from your applications. Us government workers are either too overworked/underpaid to diligently do that, or we're too corrupt and preoccupied with counting down the days until we get our pensions to care. It's about half evil, half stupid in here. Still, I am torn on whether I should continue to support a corrupt system because of the meager benefits it may provide to others.  


**What do you recommend, Antiwork? Keep doling out food stamps or take a walk outside on October 15?**  


P.S. [Our union is corrupt, bought-off, and has repeatedly sold out its members](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/09/19/sdco-s19.html). I don't think we've had a strike since 1994, so, I won't be working with them too closely. I've already voiced my opinion to strike with them &amp; will address them in person in a couple weeks.

During an attempt by the miners to unionize, and following the murder of [Sid Hatfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Hatfield), 10,000 armed coal miners confronted 3000 lawmen and [Baldwin-Felts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin-Felts) strikebreakers, who were backed by coal mine operators. In the summer of 1921 in [Mingo County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingo_County,_West_Virginia), hundreds of miners were arrested without [habeas corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus) and other basic legal rights. Talk spread of a march to free those confined miners, end martial law, and organize the county. In [Kanawha County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanawha_County,_West_Virginia), up to 13,000 miners gathered and began marching toward [Logan County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_County,_West_Virginia) on August 24.

By August 29, battle was fully joined. Chafin's men, though outnumbered, had the advantage of higher positions and better weaponry. Private hired planes dropped homemade bombs on the miners near the towns of Jeffery, Sharples and Blair. Army bombers were used for aerial surveillance. Sporadic gun battles continued for a week. Up to 30 deaths were reported by Chafin's side and 50–100 on the union miners' side, with hundreds more injured. On September 2, federal troops arrived by presidential order, and the miners started heading home the next day. About one million rounds were fired in the battle.[\[92\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_worker_deaths_in_United_States_labor_disputes#cite_note-92) ""

1146,Tips to stay positive? This is getting to me.,"I discovered this subreddit just today and I was so relieved to find others who felt how I did. 

I just turned 20, I work full time 40+ at a retail job like a lot of others. Almost daily I feel depressed, I look towards the doors by my cashier stand and want to run but I'm trapped. My coworkers either avoid me or don't talk to me because I always talk about how I want to enjoy my life instead of being trapped in the workplace. I find no pleasure in working, money is almost meaningless to me. I couldn't care less about ""The grind"". I can't stand shopping or buying things, I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt when I do. I feel like i'm in chains when working on someone else's time. I want to actually go out and enjoy my life. I want to explore what this beautiful planet has to offer instead of focus on a ""Career"" and ""Status in Society."" 

The crushing reality that I have to do this for most of my adulthood has been really dragging me down and i'm starting to have emotional breakdowns at work due to these circumstances. I don't want to live a life like this. My parents call me selfish and lazy, that it's just ""my generation"" but I know I'm not the only one who feels this way.

1159,Working 9-5 deteriorating in a rented apartment I will never own on a dying planet,"I think I spend an unusually larger portion of my life sitting and thinking, researching and questioning every aspect of life and the universe around us. And unlike people of the past I have access to an unimaginabley complex network that gives me access to the collective human knowledge and discovery of all there is.

I would like to be grateful for this access but all it has done is curse me with the excruciating self awareness of how utterly pointless this existence is and how powerless I am to change it. I have found that there is no god or greater meaning, that we are the result of the gradually evolving descendants of a cell that came to from abiogenesis in primordial soup several billion years ago. 

I have found that we live in an overwhelmingly capitalist world that is structured entirely around extracting as much profit out of me and my friends, family and fellow man. That this system cares not for human life but how to exploit it as much as possible. Many remain oblivious to it but the 8 hour work day takes an overwhelming amount of your time away. 
16 waking hours in a day, 1 hour to get ready, half an hour to commute to work, 8 hours at work, half an hour to commute back, 2 hours spent cooking, cleaning, doing chores and im left with what? Maybe 4 hours of freetime? I find that im too fucking tired to do anything after that and only spend it idly staring at my screen waiting till I pass out. 

And despite the fact that I will slave away for the rest of my life I will not be compensated for it, I will never own a house, I will never be able to afford to have children, I will never travel the world or truly get deep into my passionate hobbys. My parents and grandparents had all the luxuries only to tell me I'm in the wrong for not being able to afford any of it due to factors out of my own control.

I may not have much but at least there is the beauty of the natural world right? Well no not really, our entire society is only possible due to the extreme amount of energy output that fossil fuels have provided us, and what do you know; fossil fuels are dwindling and will likely be exhuasted within my lifetime. They also have the little side effect of boiling the fucking planet alive and it feels like the newest IPCC report has basically confirmed that we are beyond totally and unequivocally fucked and that I will watch several hundred million people die due to climate change related events within my lifetime. 

So what am I living for? Can someone tell me why I should continue to slave away for a rich CEO while having no freetime of my own, no children and no housing on a planet that is flooding, burning and rotting to the ground?? Why shouldn't i just put a bullet in my fucking brain?",False,pbgvfs,_______Anon______,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pbgvfs/working_95_deteriorating_in_a_rented_apartment_i/,21,1

I’d wager that for most of you here, the bigger fear is what others might think of you more than the actual prospect of living in a tent and dumpster diving.",False,pb5u1a,IfByLand,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pb5u1a/its_only_after_weve_lost_everything_that_we_are/,47,1

1208,Tired of working.,"I’m tired of working my life away just to stay alive.

I just want to quit my job. I wish I had a source of income that didn’t require me working. 40-50 hours a week. 

I’m 23 years old and let me preface this  by saying I’m in no way “lazy”. I have been working since the age of 16 and I’ve been working my ass off. Bought my own car invested heavily in crypto etc. But not enough to just quit working obviously. 

I just don’t understand I feel like I hate to work. Every job I’ve had it’s been such a drag. I wake up early in the mornings to commute to work. Stay there all day. Commute back home. By that point it’s 5pm and the day is essentially gone. Maybe 4 hours of free time if I’m lucky. And that’s not counting all the chores/errands that need to be done before I go to sleep. Just to do it all again the next day. I’m just constantly anxious about work. And I hate how America is built around a 40+ hour work week. No time to live. 

I look forward to the weekends but the moment the sun sets on Fridays I’m already dreading Monday. Every night I get home I’m dreading the next day of work. And this is constant with every job I’ve had. I’m always thinking about quitting, or part time, or I’m always on indeed looking for work from home jobs or just easy mindless jobs. 

Am I alone on this? I would love to start my own business to be my own boss. Maybe I should try remote work? Does anyone else feel a constant dread when it comes to work?  I just want to work to live. Not live to work. Which is what it’s like in the states. If you want to not be broke and poor you have to slave away for 40 hours (probably more with commute) a week

1214,Corporate healthcare vs Union electrician benefits,"Hi guys, thought I’d share an interesting little comparison between my job and my fiancé’s job. 

He got an upper respiratory infection last week. Negative for covid, but deathly ill for 8 days because he got a secondary sinus infection. All he has to do is text his boss he is not coming in. It is unpaid time off. Nobody bothers him about it.

I currently have a UTI and caught the virus he had, and now have a sinus infection. I have had a 102 fever for almost 3 days. It just broke an hour ago. I don’t get sick days, just PTO. 

On Monday, I went in to my oncology office while knowing I wasn’t feeling well because I am nearly out of PTO..and last time I was sick and ran out of time I got a call from higher up warning me of being written up unless I produce a dr’s note. 

I made it through half the day, and when I took my temp it was 101. I told my boss and she got me rapid tested for covid. I told her I probably caught what my fiancé has but that I also wanted one of the drs to examine me because I have a UTI and was worried of a kidney infection. 

So I spoke to the dr, I get cleared to leave early. And then my boss says, “Unless. Unless you feel well enough to work?” 

All because staffing is low. I laughed and said “no, I’m going home.” And immediately walked out. 

So once again, I’ve used all my PTO, as I’ve been out 3 days. I am expected back tomorrow, to help cancer patients, despite coughing and barely being able to speak

I'm almost done with high school and I'm about to have to make a decision about college or what I want to do with my life or whatever bullshit...but what I really want to do with my life is what I'm doing right now. I love my life at home. I have lots of hobbies and passions but none of them can be monetized sufficiently. It's not that I haven't ""found my passion"" or don't know what I want. I know very much what I want. I love doing my drawings and talking to my friends and playing games and reading and going on walks outside when it's nice enough.

The reality is hitting me that soon I'll be working pretty much all day, every day doing something I at best don't want to do and at worst despise. My time is this earth is so limited and I'm forced to waste it all or starve. It's incredibly depressing but I also feel like I can't tell anyone how I feel because I'll sound lazy or like a spoiled brat. Maybe I am but I can't help it...

My current plan is to become a teacher, because my mom thinks I should, and at least as a teacher I'll get to stay home during summer vacation right? I have no idea what to do so I guess I'll just go along with the flow. But I dread it so much still. I know in my heart it's not right for me and I don't want to pursue it. My mom is a teacher's aid and comes home from work every day dead exhausted and sometimes sick because these little shits are constantly picking their noses, putting their fingers in their mouths, etc. as kids do. I don't even like kids, in fact I kinda hate them...why am I going along with this?? Plus I'm gonna go thousands in debt to get this degree I don't even really know if I want!!

Any advice? I don't want to sound like an edgelord but sometimes I think I would rather die than have to do this for 25-40 years if I'm honest with myself. I know I have to work.

-Under capitalism, there will never be enough of a basic income given to eliminate the innate coercion of wage labore

-The money given will be immediately given back to the untaxed corporations//individuals who facilitate necessities

-UBI is a rhetorical disaster for a society obsessed with delusions of meritocracy and personal choice, like all subsidy it will be used to bash those who receive it. It will also be used to justify the absence of true governmental social safety nets.

UBI is a white flag in the face of the monied classes - we must advocate for the whole loaf, not its crumbs. This is why universal healthcare would be monumental here in the states. We must show people humane and highly organized systems in which profit is not a factor, rather than increase ones buying power. 

I totally understand the concept of giving everyone a base level of cash to shallow the depths of poverty, however to assume a capitalist society wouldn’t immediately render it ineffective is naive.  To assume a slurry of evil markets and middlemen wouldn’t rise in its wake, is naive.

I probably shouldn't post here because I actually like my boss and love my job but it still pisses me off that he's complaining about his lowest paid worker MISSING WORK TO BECOME A BETTER EMPLOYEE.

I'm tasked with running the entire digital marketing for our company, as in the the strategy, implementation, execution, and optimization. *Everything.*

But marketing has always been treated as an afterthought for our company. In order to do my job I need a budget and a team, two things that have been ignored. We downsized at the beginning of Covid and have lost several additional team members without replacing them. 

For the budget, it's gotten so bad that I no longer have enough to budget to even fill our sales pipeline. Yet when I try and ask for more by showing past success in different channels, always backed by our acquisition data, it is discarded as irrelevant or I'm told that it didn't have any real impact on why we won the business.

I'm at the point where I just feel like I'm stuck in limbo and have no desire to do anything. The pay is not great, as I'm stuck in a manager role when I've been doing the work of a Director for 3+ years (with, I recently found out, no actual career path to move up to Director right now).

1283,Target doesn’t care about harassment.,"I figured everyone over here would enjoy this amazing story I’m currently facing now. 

I won’t get into too much detail about it but I’ll give you the big details. 

This all started about 3 weeks ago when I found out that another team member was talking bad of me. I usually let this kinda stuff go cause, ya know it’s work place BS. Well, I decided that I just need to stop being a push over and confront him. I confront him and of course words are said but I drop it after the initial point of contact that I made and o think it’s over.

Well, everyday since then he has been coming up to me and telling me that he is gonna jump me outside of work or inside the coolers in the back room. So now this has become something more than two co workers that don’t see eye to eye. 

I confront HR like any person would and they take it seriously at first. Tell me that there is zero tolerance for it blah blah blah. They said they have to talk to him in order to get his side of the story. Of course. I understand that.

Now calculate all the restaurants and rent and fast food chains and because everyone is competing instead of collaborating.  

There is a temple in India that feeds 40,000 people a day for free. If people would be less picky and collaborate than the food supply chain would be easier.

1304,If your HR department is conducting group mental health learning sessions be very skeptical,"HR is there to protect the investors. First ask if the sessions are mandatory. If they aren't, don't go, because it's going to some bullshit propaganda without any scientific evidence, like Mental Health First Aid. They're going to try to convince you that you're responsible for your emotional well being ""with one neat trick"" so they don't have to affect any changes to mitigate the bullshit the company puts you through every day.

If it's mandatory, document your conversation with hr, and still decline. If it's a mandatory group session for all employees then it means they aren't singling you out for poor performance and in most jurisdictions, an employer can't force psychological counseling on employees. They can fire you for poor performance but they can't force you to get blanket psychological treatment.

Get in touch with a lawyer, but don't tell your employer you've done so. Tell the lawyer what's going on, that they're trying to force you into counseling sessions from unqualified individuals (these HR mental health sessions are never conducted by psychologists). Let the lawyer know HR hasn't even spoken to you about your personal productivity, they're simply forcing the treatment. If HR cans you for not attending then call your lawyer upb again. You'll be making a case of psychological bullying in the workplace, not wrongful dismissal. It pays out way way more.

The lawyer will take about half but the typical payout is about $500k for psychological bullying, so you'll be in the money.

1310,My Brother's Experience At A New Job Epitomizes Everything Wrong With The System.,"Background: My brother was recently hired at a large grocery store chain in the U.S. During the interview, he said that he needs between 20-25 hours a week but can't go over that because of his obligations at college. The hiring manager said it wouldn't be a problem and even promised him a set schedule. Everything seemed great until the first day of work...

My brother ended up working in the severely understaffed bakery department. The woman who was supposed to be training him also had to run the bakery so my brother got little to no training in how to do his job properly. This is problem number one I notice in many low-paying jobs: inadequate training from overstressed staff. How was this poor woman expected to train him and run the bakery at the same time? Was my brother just expected to understand everything in one second flat? Apparently, yes.

Remember how I said he was promised a good schedule? It was a lie. He ended up working 10 hours on his first two days with NO LUNCH BREAKS. He said management kept coming by telling them how terrible of a job they were doing. Keep in mind there were two people in the bakery--one of them being a brand new hire--and god only knows how many responsibilities. A good manager wouldn't have berated them. Instead, the manager would've helped them or at the vey least sent someone over from a less busy department to help. 

Naturally, my brother decided to quit. I suggested that he simply ghost them because they treated him like a pile of horse dung, but he decided to go in and tell them he was quitting because he has more integrity then those scummy managers ever will. Instead of accepting his resignation and wishing him well like a mature adult, she called him irresponsible and all sorts of nasty things. But the best part of the whole thing is that the manager wanted to call my mom to tattle on my brother for quitting. My brother is an ADULT and my mother ENCOURAGED him to quit. I'm honestly surprised my brother didn't go off on her, and I think it shows that he really was the bigger person in the situation. 

He was making $11.75 in a state with an extremely high cost of living, and this manager thought she had power over him. Hilarious. Bad managers can't handle the fact that the labor shortage is allowing people to walk away from shitty jobs in favor of being treated like a human being.

I worked my ass off producing candy of various forms and packaging it, alone. Doing all the paperwork involved to put it in the state system. And all the internal paperwork required. Then, she liked it on my EOD report if I wrote down what I did with ever second of my day. Which I always thought was stupid to begin with. And I've never had to do that anywhere else. It isn't a state requirement, just a personal preference of hers. I asked to work up front too, they told me that it wasn't a good idea because it would interfere with my work in the back. As if I'm supposed to never work any other hours because it interferes with my other 3 days. As if those three days can monopolize my time. So, I, of course, told them I would be filling those days at another job then and I would continue to work for them but they would have to rearrange the days I come in at will so that I can work a main job. I mean, I kind of liked the work. So I had to text my boss on Monday, ""I need Wednesday off. There is a hiring event I need to attend for a job that pays what I need it to."" Despite being agreeable to me on this subject all the times in the past that I had brought it up, she responds kind of rudely.

Anyway, she tells me today to come in to see her for half an hour. Today is my day off and I had plans. I went to that interview early, I got in sooner. I told her I could not come in as I was busy. She got upset about that and was rude again. So I just said, ""I'm done"". I wasn't rude. I just said I felt she put me in the position to have to choose. So I did. To which she tells me I better come in and get my stuff or it will be disposed of by the end of the day. And drop my key off. And a couple other messages I haven't dared read yet. I don't care. I think I got the new job anyway, and it pays almost double what I made at the damn dispensary. Anyway, ugh, it upset me a little to have the boss lady come unglued on me out of the blue.

1316,I'm about to quit my job because... life,"So I started on a new job about half a year from now. This job normally is 40h/week which is a shit already in my opinion but ok it's doable also I can pay my stuff and still have time for my 3yo dog. 

Now I am not the type of guy that prioritizes money, I like it yes but is not a guide for my life. Whenever they ask me to do more hours I always refuse, i really don't care about if I'm getting more or less at the end of the month. I care if I lose time with my family and my dog.

So my boss put me in a new spot for a month where I work 56h /week, he said it was ""temporary"" and it was just this one time. Of course I didn't mind, it was only this month and then everything will go back to normal schedule.

Here's the thing, my dog was the first feeling the change of routine, last week I got a call from the police about noise complain, my dog was howling and crying. I wanted to get the facts checked, i installed a camera and recorded while I was away. Indeed my dog was howling and crying, this broke my heart.

It's been almost 3 years and this was the first complain, so this was a BIG sign that things aren't fine and something has to change and between earning a few more money and my dog, I don't need to think twice. So first measure i took was to get my dog to someone she knows (my aunt, who also has a dog that loves to play with mine) while I'm working this many hours. Until i go back to normal schedule like i said.

Thing is they released the new information about the next month and they put me in the same spot again working 56h/week, for me and my dog sake fuck no. My dog only has 15 +/- years left to live I'm not wasting time on getting more money, instead I will take that time to spend quality time, making memories for both of us. 

Already said I'm not going to work again the same schedule, either they will understand or I'll find another job.

1318,BOOTLICKERS. Or how i learned to stop worrying and love the shoplifters.,"This exhaustion, pain and rage filled rant it about those cunts who work for giant corporations like Coles Myer /Aldi, who for whatever stupid fucken reason, take their unimportant role at the local store way, way too seriously and engage in excessive adherence to company policies, with little consideration for those actual humans that work as employees there occasionally. You know the type - the new boss who chastises u for time theft when u clock in late by 2mins yet punch out 10mins late every shift. The one who loves to invasively bagcheck every customer they can, because woe betide the company losing the revenue from a loaf of bread that a clearly struggling single mum tried to hide under her trolley.

I worked at a large supermarket chain and would sometimes wish that people with real financial struggles just went ahead and shoplifted more. seriously - by the time an item is being scanned any losses to damage/theft impact primarily on the business's revenue as they are the final stage before a consumer pays for a product. the farmer, shelf stocker, truckdriver etc have all been compensated already; and while i know losses from theft are passed on to the consumer via higher prices (but somehow never via cutting executive bonuses, hmm) if you knew how much we write off as wastage every single day you'd understand. shoplifting losses where i am barely dent the bottom line. 

So I cheer for the thieves. I dont do it myself as no product would come close to being worth losing my job, but I do however often notice, ignore, and then internally cheer for a shoplifter if i see them doing their thing and they're being kind, not rude and otherwise pleasant then i often pretend not to notice and just wish them a good day. 

I mean, do they think i would be enthusiastic to confront a petty thief (ZERO training is provided on how to go about this btw) because he's stealing some shit from a billion dollar company when the stolen items comined value is a tenth of our daily writeoff stock value? Nah bro. I aint a bootlicker like that



Which brings me to my true rant of rage. Has anyone else worked with those retail workers, often in middle manager - type positions at megacorporations like coles-myer group or similar giants like Aldi, woolies etc who will fire a struggling employee over a stolen pack of gum and then feel good about it? They seriously disgust me -literally serving as corporate lapdogs being manipulated to enrich their masters and all without the self awarenes or humility to ever see the company-employee relationship for how subtly abusive nd exploitative it is, or to recognise how large corporations cleverly exploit their employees psychology and emotions to breed loyalty to company and incentivise behaviours which produce maximum profits for the top executives.

If only i knew how to show them, the company-koolaid-drinkers i mean, the confronting reality of their embarassing waste of their one go at existance. The bootlickers often trading a third or more of each of their days - irrecoverable, 'single use only' days - of which they'll never, ever get back. Priceless memories and rich, human experiences, all traded for the sycophantic pursuit of enriching someone whom they're unlikely to have ever even met; whose personal drive to acquire wealth has surpassed their practical needs and caused currency itself to alter its primary role for them; from a redeemable promisory note entitling the bearer to a quantity of gold or silver, to simply a medium of amassing power, influence and immunity from the laws and restrictions that are intended to apply to all citizens equally. 


Other immoral yet legal things such as the ability to influence legislature and policies in self serving ways through political donations and deals, as well as gain access to other arbiters of wealth and power; which can then pool their financial and political influence synergistically to not only form a positive feedback loop of gaining wealth and power simply for wealth and powers' sake (to the detriment of the rest of society), but also to directly influence geopolitics, public policy and even public opinion on specific issues by simply utillising their own media companies to generate support of their agenda, and paying for the same from any they dont yet own.
This enables CEOs of megacorps and the ultrarich to directly influence the very tone and direction of society. Just look at Murdoch and the effect he's had on Aus, UK and US! He helped elect trump, boris AND scomo, indirectly causing nearly a million dead individuals who may have survived had competent governments been in power. How could anybody work for him, knowing not just that your paycheck funds originate from the suffering of others and the degredation of society, but that none of the extra money he gains from your work makes any difference to his enormous net worth anyway.

I view those retail workers (u know the type) who drink the company koolaid and then rigorously work towards a goal of enriching their corporate overlords  the same way i view Murdoch journalists working hard to spread his harmful, manipulative agenda. Both groups are large groups of pathetic and essentially inconsequential individuals who are either so gullible that they swallow and accept corporate propoganda unironically; so dumb as to be convinced that a small group of ultrarich being worshipped, rewarded and given huge amounts of money and power is a desirable ideal situation; or are otherwise simply psychopaths who genuinely value their own bank balance and/or career progression more than they value the wellbeing of the rest of society.

Because of these beliefs i find it hard to give a shit about customers shoplifting unless its just disrespectful or egregious or negatively affects others somehow. Otherwise? deep down i cheer for shoplifters, and honestly hope they steal more.  And then go and use those savings to shop honestly at local stores, and help support your community instead of megacorporation CEOs for whom your money doesnt even have meaning anymore. Sure, they account for losses to theft in pricing. but if everyone just stole 1 thing every shopping trip, the losses might lead to prices rising and local shops becoming able to compete with prices again.

1321,Thoughts on anti-work...," I  see ""antiwork"" as a kind of counter-weight to balance out some of the more corrosive aspects of our work-obsessed culture, the one we live and breathe every day.

According to anthropologists, in times not very long ago in historical terms,  humans in hunter-gather societies enjoyed a 15-hour workweek.  True,  survival was hard back then, but this reveals how our ancestors thrived more by being adaptable and smart rather than merely working harder.  After all, you only need to kill one bison to feed your entire village -- what's the point of doing more than is prudent and necessary.

Even  Henry Ford recognized the need for ""antiwork"" when he advanced the idea of a 40-hour workweek in the early 20th Century -- upon seeing how  \*reducing\* the hours of work (from 48 to 40 per week) actually increased worker productivity by a significant margin.

Just as the great economist John Maynard Keynes predicted decades ago, we find ourselves living at a time of enormous abundance, thanks to technology and automation on a global scale.  Our times are unprecedented in human history, which means we don't really have historical parallels with which to compare and make sense of our world today.

The story of the last 2  decades has been that the vast majority of wealth gains produced from major advances in technology and globalization have been realized by a  tiny fraction of people -- just a few hundred wealthy families in the world, in fact.  For the rest of us, the vast, vast majority, barely any gains at all.

I believe a wise  and prudent discussion on the meaning and future of work in the 21st  Century is not only good for us today but beneficial for future generations as well.",False,patv9v,perrybrissette,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/patv9v/thoughts_on_antiwork/,8,1

Sit at your desk and fuckoff talking about the weather and sports until 10am. (This is if you're lucky enough to have coworkers that you don't completely fucking hate.)

Then it's ""Here's unimportant stupid thing that's already been shit on by half a dozen project managers."" It's either A: please get this back to us by yesterday or B: Could you possibly make this 2 hours of work look like it took you all week?

It's all about billability, or lack thereof.

Everyone's primary job, whether they'll admit it or not, is appearing to be both busy and important. I've been at jobs that required actual work before, like FedEx. People at those sorts of jobs don't act like this because there's no need.

Almost everywhere (maybe one or two exceptions) is fake and glossy as hell. Be anyone but yourself. Don't talk about politics. Don't talk about religion. Don't talk about anything that would make you appear to have a personality.

""But just suck it up butter cup! It's a job! You're lucky to work in an office and to get paid what you do!""

I've been sucking it up and tolerating this environment for over a decade. I've reached my limit.

My only problem is that I don't know what else to do. I did work at FedEx and enjoyed it at the time but that was when I was younger and much more healthy- by the way, the office life wreaks absolute fucking havoc on your physical health. It turns out that sitting on your ass all day for years on end isn't good for you.

I wish there was something in the middle. It seems most jobs are either sedentary or you have to bust your ass all day.

1337,The Horse that put itself down,"In 2011, I graduated with a bachelor's in mechanical engineering with nothing to show for it except a job at one of the Big 3 automakers. Four years of studying engineering had not instilled a sense of wonder at the sublime beauty of an automobile differential. My lecturers had done a miserable job at teaching an outdated pedagogy to a cohort of students driven by the insecurities of their parents, who had viewed getting a job as the ultimate marker of a good education.

I hated my first job. All everybody cared about was output. Fuck employee development, fuck mental health, fuck engagement, fuck you if you can't give me those files by the end of the day. **What ground my gears worst of all is that the company called laptops ""assets"" and employees ""resources""**.

The only thing that kept me going was a guaranteed seat in one of my country's best management programs. I was too scared to scuttle my prospects of a ""bright"" career by jumping jobs or trying something new. I was scared.

After a year-long MBA that I will cherish forever, I joined one of the Big 4 consulting firms. My year there was marked by a hierarchy that treated young consultants as prostitutes who were encouraged to ""network"" and keep up their ""utilization"". if they didn't, they were screwed. And that's what happened to me, right in the middle of the COVID pandemic. I was put into a performance improvement program that was nothing but an excuse to provide grounds for firing. If they really wanted to improve my performance, I never knew. Nobody had a conversation with me about what I was doing wrong, nobody wanted to hear my side about what had been going on over the year. Three months after that, I was fired - in the same week that I had a breakup. Those last six months put me into a spiral of anxiety and depression that still resurfaces from time to time. 

Those months of unemployment actually helped me regain my self-image to an extent. I no longer had the pressure of deadlines and the need to keep up appearances of competence. I could finally tell myself that, yes, I sucked at the job. But it's okay to suck at something. You could suck because of a lack of skills, an unsupportive team, the job not engaging you, or maybe even issues outside of work entirely. But  parents, friends, teachers, influencers, entrepreneurs and politicians drill this idea in your head that it's your responsibility to not suck. You're fed this rhetoric of a dog eat dog world where even a moment of reflection or vulnerability with your boss is an admission of failure. This turns a simple lack of knowledge or skill into a weakness to be eliminated with nobody to lean on but yourself. **And so, companies save a lot of money by placing the onus of upskilling on the employees.**

Fortunately, my unemployment lasted only three months and I'm working for an e-commerce major. But the hamster wheel doesn't change. Everyone's out to cover their asses and new employees are supposed to do the job from Day 1 with just a few basic pointers and a goody bag. I don't imagine that my self-image will separate from the work I do at any point.

1339,Left My Job After 2 Months,"I was working as a community manager for a totally new videogame studio with 7 employees that's working on it's first game.

They had a ""core hours"" policy where we have to be online and reachable for 2 hours a day but work whenever the rest of the day, which was neat at first to be honest.

My main responsibility was to create a community for the game to hype it up by creating some social media campaigns and interact with the audience till release.

The thing is, there is no game yet, I had zero content to work with, so they added another responsibilities to do like managing all the social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instgram), organizing a content plan for the studio's YouTube channel where they post a weekly podcast that I also edit, reaching for people in the videogame industry to appear as guests in that said podcast, designing thumbnails, they also tasked me with creating a fundraiser campaign on Kickstarter to raise fund for the upcoming game.

I never under delivered though, and delivered my tasks on time, attended the daily sprint meeting on time, when they tried to reach me outside of the core hours I was available, yet the senior developer which was also my team leader was always passive aggressive and spoke to me in a condescending way, but I brushed it of as jokes and moved on.

One day I had a very important errand to do before the daily meeting, so I gave them a heads up that I am gonna be slightly late, and I was 3 minutes late, the meeting was normal but then I saw the team lead's reply to my heads up message where he's giving crap about me being late and I should have planned better as its easier with the ""core hours"" system, In another day he told me that ""my grammar is off"" because of a video title I wrote that was missing a question mark.

Started to burn out, I reported to the CEO that I didn't appreciate the team lead's tone with me and he stood strongly with me and he agreed it wasn't acceptable, but the day after all the three of us had a call where I was basically in ""The Naughty Corner"", both of them kept agreeing with other against me and how wrong I was, and said the work environment doesn't have to be friendly all the time with some aggressiveness in between to keep people in check, but I didn't like that at all, so I quit a day later.

Some time after I left the studio I saw a podcast where they were discussing which way will they place the computers whether the developers facing the office or the wall, they decided to let the developers face the wall so they can see the screen clearly to know if he's slacking off, with them saying ""their privacy doesn't matter"".

I am glad I quit in the probation period before everything went sideways, my biggest red flag was when we were discussing how late I was for the meeting, I told them that many times before you reached me outside work hours and I was available, they responded with ""you could have said you're not working right now"" which is true but the fact they are negating the fact that I didn't is really making me feel mad and underappreciated.",False,pakb3b,ostolscout,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pakb3b/left_my_job_after_2_months/,1,1

There is also a policy where you have to clock out just to use the restroom if you’re going to be occupied longer than 2 minutes (fair enough I guess), but in order to clock out - you must call the attendance line, before you call the attendance line, you must request permission from a supervisor.. you can see where this is going..

Queue my gut issues. Dealing with issues for years, but have been having a particularly annoying flare up the last month. BTW, this is a WFH remote position, so permission must be asked through the work discord page. 

Asked a supervisor if I were correct in my assumption that we had to ask permission to call and clock, they agreed and ask for the reason, I provided it, then *ghost* - didn’t hear a thing.

No confirmation, no acknowledgment, nothing. For nearly 20 mins. Now, I know policy. And I’m quite sure they were expecting me to get back to work until I received an answer. 

But here is my thing.. I’m not asking “permission” per say.. I’m really just providing a courtesy notice. Because if they denied my request, do you REALLY think I was just going to say “okay”, then sh*t myself? 

No no.

Called the line, called out. Called out today. Will probably call out tomorrow. Already have 2 interviews tomorrow before the shift (if I clock in), and an interview set up for the following day.

I haven’t asked for permission to take a sh*t since high school. And I’ve never experienced that in my own home.

I have been medically diagnosed with major depressive and anxiety disorders, which makes it incredibly difficult for me to hold down a job. I haven't been able to afford the $250 doctor visit to get a new prescription, so I've been off meds for about three years now.

This year started out great. I had a job that I actually enjoyed and got this apartment lined up based on what I thought I'd be making. As it turns out,  the job didn't have as many hours as I was expecting when I got the apartment, meaning I had to leave for ""better"" jobs.

I spent all of this year struggling to pay for a place that cost altogether $800 a month in 2019 and suddenly jumped up to $1,200 because all the landlords were air raid siren crying about the eviction moratorium. I've been in a cycle of getting and losing jobs I can't handle because the start date was the main priority. I couldn't get unemployment because I was effectively job hopping, I assume it would be the same with rental assistance. All of my money, and whatever I could borrow, went directly to bills. 

My luck ran out, and I wasn't able to pay even partial rent this month, so I've been notified that I have to leave the property. To my surprise, I was actually relieved when I got the news. That's when I realized threw this whole year away based on an idea of what I'm supposed to have at my age. A ""good"" job, my own place, etc.

I just started a part-time job yesterday with a flexible schedule enough pay to afford a room somewhere. For the first time this year, I could make more than I spend. I could pay back what I borrowed, and maybe even start saving. I feel like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders.

1354,Took my first vacation ever and now I want to quit and live on an island.,"Hey everyone, I am an attorney and I used to be a workaholic. I went straight through college and law school and got admitted to the bar at 25. I started my first litigation job in a government office shortly after that. I spent the next three years working 2,500 hours a year - sometimes sleeping on a couch in my office just to get work done. I will admit at the time it didn't seem like a problem. I was a single guy, living with my parent and I was very fortunate to benefit from his hard work. I went to work, went home, worked out and saved money. But I didn't feel fulfilled. 

I ended up having an office mate that turned into a friend, and is now my fiancee. She is the best thing to ever happen to me. She has opened my eyes to travel and having new experiences, trying new food, and just not letting life pass you by. We are total opposites. Lol but she is undoubtedly my soulmate. Anyway, I left that government job never taking a vacation, ever. I used some sick days, but in the end I had 430 hours of personal leave time left. I thankfully got it all paid out to me, which was nice, but I started a new job. 

My fiancee and I went to the Caribbean recently for 7 days and 6 nights. It was my first plane trip, first time leaving the country, and I was terrified. When we landed the country was beautiful, the atmosphere just hit different. Waking up the following morning - a Monday - and being able to lay in bed in this new place, get breakfast at 10am, go back to the room to change, go to the beach til 3pm, go back to the hotel to cuddle and get lunch, and get ready for dinner at 7pm made me realize how much you can really enjoy time with your family and loved ones when you are not burdened by an alarm clock, travel to work, and the constant chime of an office phone or email notification. It was an all inclusive and easily the best week of my life. 

I am now back at work and I miss her every day. Our time together, usually after 7 or 8pm every night is stressful, we can barely discuss or wedding or enjoy time without our jobs being there in our minds. I just sorely miss the opportunity to sit with her on a beach and relax. At least when we were remote during COVID we could take some time to just sit with each other and enjoy a quick episode of 90 day fiance. 

First post here, just wanted to share a now disillusioned attorney perspective from someone who was saved from being a workaholic by the woman of my dreams.

1363,"My Boss Is a Creep, a Manipulator and a Real-Life Nazi — It’s time to burn some bridges!","I’ll try to keep this short (if only to protect myself): I started waitressing on the side last year, because I’m still a student and barely got assignments in my preferred profession due to Covid.

I was really happy at the beginning, because the staff was mostly nice (I even made a good friend. She has left ever since but we keep in touch!) and I make a lot of tips at this place (it can double my already nice salary on a good day). 

But then we had our end of the year staff dinner... Not only did my boss grab my ass but he let a bunch of regulars shout nazi chants and hold racist speeches.

When restaurants opened again in Spring I politely announced that I have started a new degree (additionally to the one I’m about to finish) and while I loved the opportunity they gave me, I would stop working in August/September to focus on that.

Now my boss loves talking shit in front of people to hurt them. All staff foreigners tonight? Racism. All women? Sexism. 

He’s not subtle but this takes the cake: on my last shift he watched me all evening and even tried to send me home after 2-3 hours (which would have meant going home in the middle of service and not making any tips). Then he started telling one of the regulars (they were right in front of my station) that *finishing* a degree is not a guarantee for getting a job. Apparently there’s too many people with diplomas now and we all still have to prove that we can _actually_ work, because we’re just lazy academics, right?

I almost started laughing out loud at how obvious he was — he can’t get new staff despite the good salaries because everyone knows by now that he’s a fucking terrorist and he knows I’m way over qualified for the job by now.

So I’m home now finishing writing my my little lazy thesis about the shitty work conditions in my preferred profession while scheming to retire early so I can have more time for the important things: quality time with my loved ones and half a dozen hobbies, more travels and more sex.

And mayyybe I’ve started writing reports to the respective authorities about him &amp; his bullshit, (Keeping safe!) one investigation is already under way :)

As I read the description you guys say you want to end work, how can you end work? Like put it this way thousands years ago in order to get food you had to get up and hunt right? That's work you had to build a house, yes that's work, not only that you had to learn those skills, if you didn't know those skills why should a person do it for you for free for absolutely no reason, lets say there is 1 worker who knows how to build houses and 100 who don't, should he build 100 free houses for them, waste his life and work for them? Well that's not fair.

Anyways you get it in life you need to work to get things, so why are you so anti work, who will do the stuff what need to be done if you all don't want to work anymore?

I get it I worked bad jobs, hideous jobs etc, but I studied while doing those jobs and landed a chill nice good paying job which I can say I enjoy and doesn't feel like work that much, even tho it's a lot of effort and by that I went back to uni, learned stuff which I didn't want to.

I do understand some bosses, managers are trash I do agree some are unfair etc, but that's not everywhere.

Now tell me if we all quit working how would the world be, also I wanted to state, the riches don't work because they already worked 30-40 years and got huge money so that's the reason they don't work, why don't you do the same?

1400,Promotion AND a pay cut - I’ll see myself out.,"Title says it all really. The company I work for has completely outdone themselves in tone deafness.

At the start of the Covid situation, I took on a hell of a lot more responsibilities and duties that were outside my role in order to ‘help the business’ while 90% or my colleagues sat at home receiving 100% salary (my company topped up their furlough payments, which is pretty nice) however the ones left working got, and have yet to receive, any sort of recognition or remuneration despite one of the busiest and toughest periods in the company’s history. Above and beyond doesn’t cut it. That said, over a year later and The director of the company sat me down and told me how ‘hard’ they worked in the background to get me a promotion, despite the ‘current economic climate’ and I should be ‘thankful they are putting my needs first and showing their appreciation.’ 

The catch - They were quick to follow this with, ‘now there won’t be any salary reviews with this due to the aforementioned economic issues’ and that we could maybe review it next year if the business continued to over-perform. Notice overperform - despite the down turn we raked in a tidy profit (£m’s) and are continuing to do so with normality returning and I personally oversaw a fair portion of that. So all in, company’s doing great, on for a record year despite the problems, worked harder than ever and getting a paper promotion in title alone, which as it turns out, was an admin error on the company’s part as they accidentally gave out title changes to less senior roles which then upped mine by default - so they essentially lied about the why and underdelivered on the what. So they essentially took any negotiation leverage away, updated my responsibilities list and are telling me to be thankful or what is essentially an invisible pay cut!

I’ve told them that I’ve been made a lucrative offer by another company and they have literally bent over backwards to try and keep me and offer me those things which were completely off the table until the threat of pulling the plug came up. I do so much and there is no effective succession planning, so they’d be screwed. 

I plan to hand my notice in in two days, as I’ve found another role within a different outfit who sound actually excited to have me and my skills set. A new job to escape an old job is essentially just moving prison cells but the takeaway from here is that regardless of how much effort you put in, nobody cares until it’s likely to hit their pocket or increase their workload. Talk is fr, and conglomerates will happily pay you in platitudes.

Know your worth folks and don’t settle for any less - don’t be afraid to take a risk to improve your situation when it’s sensible to do so.",False,pakxqi,Zephyr117_q,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pakxqi/promotion_and_a_pay_cut_ill_see_myself_out/,23,1

1402,Fired for 'Dress Code' from Hospital that didn't take COVID seriously,"Just wanted to share my current unemployment story.

During the height of the 2020 pandemic, I was working at an IT Help Desk office in my small Midwest town's local hospital.  I learned quickly to repress any sort of expression or personality, and to not chime in when I heard coworkers expressing what I found to be ignorant and unprofessional views.  Our office was packed to capacity in a relatively small enclosed area.  Our hospital's CEO had implemented mask mandates for all on-site employees, but there were still many in the office who refused to wear their masks.  Having had a previous stint with cancer, I brought my concerns to my office manager multiple times.  After weeks of no enforcement, I decided to 'anonymously' contact HR. HR showed up unannounced at my office, and we got dinged/failed audit.  My boss called me into her office, revealed she knows it was me who alerted HR and that she was disappointed because she was 'just about to' address the office about mask enforcement.  Whatever you say...

Our office had a rotating 'office runner' role where if it was your day to be runner, you were allowed to wear jeans and tennis shoes due to the physical nature of the role as long as you had a shirt displaying the hospital's logo.  My other coworkers very often got away without wearing shirts with hospital logo, and so I never really bothered to go out of my way to order shirts I'd have to pay for myself.  I had been runner many times without wearing a logo shirt, just like the others.  I finally ordered some shirts just to be on the safe side, and it takes several weeks for them to arrive.

A month or so after reporting safety noncompliance to HR, I was performing runner duties when my manager approached me in front of the rest of the office to make sure everyone heard and told me I needed to go home and change into dress pants and shoes because I wasn't wearing a logo shirt.  I told her not only were my shirts were ordered and arriving soon, but nobody else seems to be held to this standard.  Never mind the fucking obvious hospital photo ID badge clipped and displayed on my shirt pocket...  I'd put up with WAY too much bullshit overall at this job at that point to not reply with ""I'm not going to perform runner duties in dress clothes.""  So I did, and in front of the whole office she told me to clock out and go home for the day.  Without a word I stood up and walked out.  The next day, I showed up and sat at my desk and was called into a conference room where my manager and HR rep told me I'd been fired for dress code noncompliance.  In the 2 minutes that took, I came back out to my desk and found in those 2 minutes, my entire desk was dismantled and all of my personal effects were packed up and dumped into a box waiting for me on my chair.

GOOD.  RIDDANCE.  I've been riding the unemployment train ever since December 2020, and I honestly feel like I earned it, and I don't allow family or friends to shame me for it.  Fuck you, I earned this mental break.  When I decide to return to work, I can promise you I will only look for 100% remote positions - there's no need to go to a physical building every day to sit at a computer being forced to listen to what I find to be horrifically ignorant political banter.   No, I don't want to go to go bowling as a Team Builder.  No, I don't want to come in this weekend for coverage when I'm burnt out telling myself all week 'just make it to the weekend - you got this'.  No, I'm not here to make friends and I don't want to hang out with you outside of work.

1406,I feel at home in this sub. Left work and am never going back.,"I've discovered this sub quite recently, but never have I identified so much with a mindset here on Reddit. I have no one (or almost no one) to talk about these subjects. Generally people say you're lazy or whatever when you point out the absurds the ""labor force"" (modern slaves?) has to go through.

I worked sometime within a company and I had a manager that is all that we comply about here on this sub, and more. That narcissistic, xenophobic soab really drained mine and my colleague's energy, until a day I decided not to take it anymore and spit all the truth on his face. He was astonished, and I believe that was because nobody had ever talked to him like that, nobody had ever faced him and pointed out the toxic mf he was. I said everything, from how toxic he was to how I did not sign a contract for that. Said that I had worked in many places before, but it was the first time I had to deal with *that* amount of shit. Said that nobody on his team liked to work with him. He was like ""what about Jon Doe?"" (he asked this twice), our other manager. I said that everyone liked him. His face was priceless. I packed my stuff  next month and left for good.

Fortunately I got lucky with some Bitcoin/crypto investments and am now able to live for some time without worrying much about money (not financial advice, crypto is extremely volatile and dangerous; as I said, I got *lucky*) or if my retirement pension will pay for my expenses. Nobody that works for most of their lives should have to face financial insecurity when of age. I do not have luxury and am extremely far from being a millionaire or whatsoever, but my bills are paid and I don't have to submit to this kind of thing anymore.

I hope and wish you all get your financial freedom soon, and that time be kind to you and your loved ones. You're not alone and hopefully more people will become aware of how much of a trap is the ""you have to work to be someone"" saying. You already are someone. Do not let the system trick you.

In what ways have we proved that it is possible to work from home compared to pre-pandemic? Are the employers ok with it or still no? 

It is unfortunate in the beginning of the pandemic that many peole lost their jobs and not many can work from home such as many of the essential workers, what uncommonly considered things/instances actually happen? (like I said, I'm still a student)

1414,I'm returning to in person and my psychiatrist denied FMLA (:,"So. I'm going back in person for the first time since the start of the pandemic this week and it absolutely feels like dying. My job definitely cannot be done remote long-term so it's not them being unreasonable. I feel like a piece of shit because, as far as jobs go, mine is pretty good, I like my direct supervisor and team, and I mostly get left alone to listen to music/podcasts for a good chunk of the day.

What I don't love is being paid almost poverty wages in one of the most expensive parts of the country. I don't love being understaffed and being expected to work several different jobs. I don't love commuting for 1-1.5 hours each way. I don't love wearing a mask for 11-12 hours (work + commute). I don't love having 5 or 6 hours max to do all of the things I need to do. 

I wanted to do therapy - welp, can't, there's not even a place to go for privacy for teletherapy, let alone in person. I wanted to take FMLA for a few months and told my psychiatrist I was doing *really* badly and she said it was **""not enough to be a little overwhelmed""** and **""it's for things like hospitalizations""**, which honestly I should probably report her for. That's genuinely dangerous language. And I provided ample evidence that I'm far more than ""a little overwhelmed"". She offered me two weeks and accused me of not cooperating because I said it takes longer than that to deal with a *diagnosed circadian rhythm disorder* (which, let's be real, half means the post-industrial revolution world isn't cool with my sleep schedule not squeezing into its genuinely unnatural shape - but whatever, I'm fully willing to try to fix it) and sleep deficit.

I really want to just leave but have no follow-up plans. Everyone says to do it and hit up the hot job market but I don't *have* a dream job. A job where they leave me alone is the best I'm going to get. I just wanted a break. An UNPAID fucking break. But it's not enough to be ""a little overwhelmed"" :)))))

I'm sorry, this is just complaining but I honestly just want to scream and don't know what else to do.

1434,"I am happy about her achievements, but where are mine?","Hey guys,

So first of all. Me (26) and my GF (24) met  at our first working place ever. Let's name it Workplace A.

We were both trainees and really enjoyed our traineeship. Since I was a little longer in it than her, I finished my traineeship earlier and got promoted to a temporary, but higher position. Long story short - I became her boss.

I was interested in her from the beginning on, while she always thought I was kind of a weird guy. 

We had some interesting projects together though and since we both really loved our job we grew together kind of close. Some evening the dream came true and I confessed my feelings for her, which she did also - we started a relationship.

Over time we confessed our relationship to our boss that time, who of course wasn't really happy about that. 

Eventhough my job at that company was only temporary, I always felt as if I was doing a great job and was told so as well.  I got fired after. Most likely (i think it is like that) because of the relationship that we had. 

It killed me on the inside because working at Workplace A was all I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I loved my co-workers, the stories that we wrote, all the memories and even the traineeship. Literally everything about it was perfect.

At that point my GF had one year left at her traineeship, but other than with me, they wanted her to stay. 

She was offered MY dreamposition in a permanent employeeship, which she declined. Most likely because she knew it would break me seeing her in the position that I've always wanted.

To that point I was working at Company B a few blocks away, which was a horrible experience for me, since I had to force myself to go to work every single day.

My Girlfriend started to work at a different company as well, and immediately found her dreamjob there, this working topic is really present at friends meetings and stuff like that, like it's all she wanted to do. Working at Workplace A wasn't her dream, but mine.

In the meantime we moved in together, built up a lot, grew into a healthy relationship. We're together for almost 3 years now, living together for 2.

Well. What can I say. currently its going horrible for me.

I've decided to quit my job at Company B, because I felt like I should do something that is fun (equal to Workplace A) and startet a new, more promising job, at a company where my brother is working. 

This turned out as a horrible mistake, since I got mobbed from day one and suffered from a mental breakdown not long after, leading myself to leaving this position after only one week. Leaving myself unemployed. 

As you can imagine, me being unemployed and chronically unhappy with my jobsituation wasn't easy for our relationship. GF tried to be there for me but since she never experienced anything like that before, due to her always exactly achieving what she wanted. But it continued.

I was ""lucky"" to find a job eventhough COVID-19 hung around.

But guess what. The next shithole. Company D was better than Company C (which was the mobbing position that I mentioned earlier) but not even close to being fulfilling. And NOW I am in deep depression.

I don't want to bother my girlfriend anymore. I love her from the bottom of my heart and I love that she has the possibility to enjoy her life and gets exactly what she wants almost instantly all of the time. But here I am, a broken man, always having problems in life, never achieving anything easily and always having to fight for one good thing to happen.

Not only am I left with a dead end shit job again, but as well with a GF that is clueless with what to do with me. And the relationship being the only thing that is healthy in my life, I don't want to risk it at all with complaining about my situation.

Problem as well: I can't find something better right now. COVID is kicking here in Germany and we are not really able to write a lot of letters of applications.

So:

Not only in Jobs my girlfriend is achieving literally everything she wants without any complications. She sends a letter of application, gets the job. Is happy, easy. She wants a nice car, her parents buy it for her, easy. She gets presented everything on a silver tablet.

It's good for her, I love her.

But nothing good ever happens to me, I end up in shit holes all of the time. My family isn't caring about me at all. She wants to settle down with a nice little house or something in the future, while I am struggling to even find out what I wanna do for a living - because right now I can't tell. I'm not even sure if I can stay in this area due to the lack of job possibilities that I have here.

All of this kicked me into deep depression and I really don't know what to do next..

Fuck work man, why can't I just enjoy my life without it!!!

1438,Caring when I really dont want to care.,"I just want to start off with an apology for some bootlicking behavior on my part. You see often when I'm at work (department store similar to marshalls) ill come across losses or potential losses and some part of me wants to catch someone doing something, and wants the thrill of sticking it to some customer. 

For example a customer wanted to return an article of clothing with the alarm sensor still on it. It is entirely possible to walk into the store with a receipt find all those items again and then return them without returning them. I get cases like this occasionally but the result is always the same from the supervisors, just process the return and dont worry about it. 

Just makes me feel like asshole now, and it doesn't make sense for me. Its not like me to give a shit, im a regular on this sub, and i have no sympathy for my company, fuck the bastards.

It make me think about something I learned from a video on parents verses non parents in terms of happiness. That people stuck with a choice they cant undo will trick themselves into believing they are happy with the situation regardless of the actual amount of enjoyment they will insist they love it even if its just to convince themselves. 

I think im doing the same thing to myself with retail work and its causing me to act like a class traitor prick. The only times im happy at work is when im that asshole. When I dont do that im miserable, i feel like my work is meaningless, the clock goes slower, and i dont have as much fun at work. Its a hard thing to understand let alone explain. This wierd dichotomy where on one side is being happy with myself as person and the other is being happy at work. 

I should really get out of retail, but in the meantime this is an eye opener for me, I never realized how important it was to me that the company I work for has values and does good work that the real me aligns with because if they dont and you work there for too long and succumb to the sirens call of happiness will it corrupt you and change you to fit their mold but if you fight it retail will chew you up with years of misery and still nothing to show for it.

Even when you're an adult you never stop growing up, your environment can still mold your personality it just takes longer than it does for a baby.

1442,Tips for calling into work when sick,"I came down with a cold yesterday, and when I call into work (I do not get paid time off) I usually have trouble getting the day off. This is because I supposedly am a “very important role” in the workplace. Many people call off and don’t receive the same treatment as me. For example, an employee calls off at least once a week and they don’t say much to them about it. I call off once maybe every 4 months because I get chronic sinus infections and I get told that a sinus infection is not a good enough reason to call in. Last time I got sick I made a post on Facebook about regretting not taking my allergy medication, and a coworker took it upon themselves to show my boss which created lots of issues. I now get very stressed about calling off, more than I ever did before. I haven’t called off since then, and it’s been months. I have tried asking for a half day instead of a full day, and I have tried texting instead of calling. It’s usually accompanied by, “come in until we can figure something out,” or a harsh response. I’m just very stressed about the whole situation, and I think I just need someone to validate what I’m feeling and provide advice.

1448,Way out of the misery,"I cannot resist to write this, but as I have been following this subreddit and reading all the posts and rants about working, soul sucking slaving, not having time or passion for other activities, it makes me wonder. 

What’s the solution to get rid of these bad feelings? 

A little of my background. I am 26, from Europe, with bachelors degree - so luckily without a debt / student’s loan. I chose the field I studied and now work in by very much random. It pays quite well, hours are okay, but it’s stresfull and I do not like it much. I come home after 8 hours in the office often more tired and miserable than when I had two mentally easy jobs and worked 70 - 80 hours per week. 

I quite liked working as a waiter or customer service in car rental company, driving around the city, to aiports,  meeting people made me happy. 

However this is age when I and I believe other people start think about family, buying their own place future, security perhaps health both mental and physical. And I know that working easy job would not allow me to consider getting a mortgage or take care of 3 people if I had a girlfriend and a kid.
Which I don’t have because I either don’t have time or will to be actively meeting many new people. 
I need time to get along with people, so most of my friends I met in school and jobs and we have known each other for a long time. Moreover my colleagues now are mostly 40+ , working for the company 10+ years and taking it quite seriously - no fun part in working included… you get the point, nothing much to look for in the morning. 

I don’t want to live with my parents forever or rent cheap flats when having an easy job where I am happy, but don’t earn much. I am not from a family that has that much money to allow me not to work for it. So if I want to be independent (from family) I need to earn more and be dependant on the higher paycheck that will allow me to save more

Sometimes I feel that as I get older and more used to the workplace it will get better and easier and more enjoyable even though it’s not a dream-job. Maybe with experience I will be able to get an offer that suits me better and will be happier.

I could write so much more about my thoughts on this consumerism and not wanting to work, but i will be just going in circles…

If you made it here, thank you and congrats. Let me know your thoughts and i would love to chat and look for solutions to happier work life balance. 😉",False,pa8q5v,rough666,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pa8q5v/way_out_of_the_misery/,4,1

Spotty Employment History: 

Only put current/last job on resume. You want to know what I've done in the past? It doesn't matter, I don't have a future. 

Poor Interviewing Skills: 

Dress casual. Dressing ""for the part"" is bullshit. I didn't choose this. I'm a not a professional. 

Don't research the company. Who cares what they stand for or believe in, I don't reflect those values. And as far as what the company provides to society, I'm sure it's unnecessary. 

Lack of Networking: 

I don't even have to try with this one. I'm antisocial, I'm not going to put effort into convincing other people that I'm hireable.

I’m really burnt out with my current job and I’m fairly close to blowing my brains out. I work in mental health and everyday I have to give pieces of myself away for my job. My company exploits my compassion on demand to the point where I think about dying or quitting. It’s only going to get worse soon, because I’m being given a large caseload of patients assigned to newer coworker that couldn’t/ didn’t want to handle it. 

Problem is I still have a bunch of bills keeping me locked in. I’m in the process of transitioning into a software engineering career. But between the constant vampiric demands of my job and the rigor of learning a new set of technical skills I’m slowly unraveling and something is gonna break in my psyche soon, I can feel it. 

So I figured it’s this job or my mental health(ironically). So does anyone   have any suggestions for short term work for a person burned out on being an exploited  caregiver?

It's amazing to me that all of a person’s time is
completely owned by a company, whether on or off the
clock, so much so that the company gets to decide
when that time is “on” or “off” and whether that time is
paid. The company will go so far as to deny “off” time,
because they own ALL of your time already so you need
permission to live your life outside of the confines of
the company walls, and the company will even go so far
as to deny paid time “on” in some instances. His is all
seen as normal.

1510,Not sure if I can stomach much more of boomers blaming younger generations for the shitty work cultures and broken economy that they’re leaving us.,"I was fired from my job in retail last week. An assistant store manager had been sexually harassing me so I reported it. Corporate demoted her to the lower management position of my department. And then they fired me. For time theft. Because I took a few extra minutes on my break a few times and someone reported it. No verbal or written warning. No coaching. No suspension. Just “you’re fired”. But she got to keep her job.

Fast forward to today. I go over to my parents’ house to do some laundry and hang out. I love them dearly and they’re good people. But I don’t think they’ll ever understand what it’s like for younger generations to hold down a job in the workplaces that they’re leaving us.

To be clear, I know I didn’t get fired for time theft. I got fired because I told a superior to stop treating me inappropriately. I confronted a boss and reported their awful, predatory behavior. I stuck up for myself and made it clear that I wouldn’t tolerate unprofessionalism or hostility from a colleague. It sucks and I hate that it happened to me.

But the fucked up thing that hurts worse than losing my job is how little empathy my parents and other boomers have for me and others like me. They know it’s a different world than the one they grew up in. But they act like we’re whiny, lazy, bad with money, and “just don’t want to work anymore”. Meanwhile we’re being systemically crushed and depleted by a system that was supposed to reward us for hard work and provide us with a sustaining quality of life, yet has done the exact opposite.

It’s a system that they were able to buy into at our age. They maintained it, cultivated its atmosphere, and shaped its culture. And now they’re cashing in their chips while judging us for their failures. “Why don’t you work more hours? Why can’t you save money? Why aren’t you buying a house? You shouldn’t be struggling to make a car payment. Just cancel your Spotify.”

When I told my parents why I was fired, their response was, “Well that’s not surprising.” It literally made sense to them that I was sexually harassed by my boss and lost my job because I reported it, but they can’t wrap their heads around why I might have trouble saving money or making ends meet in this current economy.

This entire incident has effected me financially, socially, personally, and professionally. I am deeply depressed and stressed about all of it. And after four hours of trying to put it all in terms that my parents might understand, I’m feeling very hopeless that they ever will. My dad has been white collar management since I can remember. My mom has never had a job. I really shouldn’t be shocked.

But it still hurts. And it really makes me not want to hang out with them or any other oblivious boomers anymore.",False,p9qi5j,NewEraSoul,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p9qi5j/not_sure_if_i_can_stomach_much_more_of_boomers/,369,1

At the end of my smoke break, there was the choice to bugger off and continue the conversation -- forming a connection and memories that I knew would last my whole life -- or to sacrifice that beautiful golden moment for a boss who would just be crabby with me for taking five minutes in the first place.

We buggered off down the fire escape, sat in an empty parking lot and talked for ages about *everything*.

1519,My advice for some people on this sub (hear me out)...,"I'll start by saying a few things. Firstly, this is definitely not going to be for everyone, and isn't even an option for everyone. Second, this isn't gonna be about policy or philosophy, its simply a suggestion to certain people. Anyway, here's my suggestion for something you may wanna try:

Play poker.

Hear me out... first an obvious side note: This is of course not for everyone, this is for people
A) that don't have any history of problems with gambling and have have some amount of self discipline. Make no mistake this is indeed gambling (but so is the stock market or any number of other """"""""""real"""""""""" jobs. Gambling where you have the edge is still gambling)
B) for whom a day job is just not an option or they desperately need a way out, and don't know how.
C) that don't have ambitions of being rich (I think this is most of you). People that only want to make enough money so they can get by and have the rest of their time to themselves.
D) enjoy the game. If its something you find extremely boring then obviously this isn't for you as it would just be work. I think most people generally enjoy the game but haven't really given it much consideration. This post is for those people.

I'm not going to go into many details or name any specific resources in regards to where to play or where the best place to learn and improve is, besides saying that Twitch is probably a good start. There are an endless number of resources and information available with a simple google search and thats not the point of this post. I'll also say that online is the best/main way to play, and you likely do have options to play online. If you live in most of europe or certain US states, there are plenty of regulated options. Otherwise, its still legal and safe for you to play on a number of sites. You are not breaking any laws buy doing so, and whether or not these ""unregulated"" (meaning the government isn't watching) sites are breaking any laws is contested. What is not contested is that as a player, you are not breaking any laws whatsoever.

Here are the main reason I'm suggesting this.
1) You can start from 0, and my advice here is to do so exclusively. Never put your own money in. Contrary to popular belief, you need absolutely no startup money. Every single online platform offers multiple freerolls DAILY. Meaning a tournament that is free to enter and has cash prizes (Usually under 5$, and only for the top 20 or so players depending on how many enter.) This will serve a dual purpose, as a way to start your bankroll and also getting your beginner practice for free. It'll take a while, but once you make your first little bit you can move on to micro-stakes (where you play for 1 -2 cents, and 2$ is a full buy-in for most games). It's also much easier to beat the early levels (no matter what so losing players will tell you. They're just looking for an excuse)
2) This might be the most meaningful here: Your progress are dependent on only yourself and your brain. You work for no one. No one is exploiting you. You are completely outside the system. If you stick to the basic principles (mainly ""Bankroll Management"") then you WILL progress if you get better. When you fail, its on you. When you succeed, it's on you.
3) You'll find that 99% of the pitfalls, especially in your early stages, is just fallacies your own brain tries to trick you into. If you are confident in yourself and your discipline, and approach it from that viewpoint, you will already be further ahead than 99% of the field.
4) Poker is a zero-sum game. Meaning yes, when you win, it will come from other players. However the main difference between poker and the big game of capitalism or life or whatever you wanna call it, is that absolutely no one is forced to play it. 100% of players does so voluntarily. In a way, poker is one of the most fair things there is. Nothing about you matters except your skill. There is no way to take advantage of others except by being better at the thing you both agreed to play. Poker doesn't care about what you think or who you are, or what class of society you where born into. It only cares about the cards and your skill. (And no, players with more money hold absolutely no advantage over you. Likely the opposite. That is, not if you follow the basic principles. Sure, if you break the most fundamental of principles and buy in with your whole bankroll and are too scared to really play with it then yea technically someone less scared can push you around. But we're never gonna be in that situation because we are not idiots.)

This whole process will likely take a few months, and by then you'll know if this is something you really love, something thats not for you, or something in the middle, like maybe a side source of income. Worst case scenario is you spend a couple of months playing a game you like. If you follow the instructions above it should cost you no money. But I will say one more time that you have to have the self-discipline not to do anything stupid. I made this post here because most people here say that they do have self-motivation, so I leave this as a humble suggestion of something to try.

1520,Do I have to tell my job if my vacation got canceled? I still want to take time off.,"My gf broke up with me (while in Hawaii lol) and I am no longer going with her to meet her family in Brazil.

I still want to take time off to rest and process my break up. I don’t really feel like I need to tell them as we already agreed upon a return date. I know they will be fine when I’m gone, I’m a contract temp so I don’t feel that committed at all to the company, and when I get back I may just answer open ended time/ vague since I don’t think people really care about my trip.

1522,"Store 3472, you want to know why the new girl quit.","  I know the girl. I am her dad. I also know that girl can throw down and work like there no tomorrow.  She can work from dusk to dawn on anything around the farm.  She can out work most people, she isn't afraid to roll up the sleeves and get dirty. Her work ethics are beyond anything your store deserves. She started and did everything she was told. She cleaned your sprawling store top to bottom, and the bathrooms every two hours while your two other “employees” did absolutely nothing.   
 

Your older “maintenance” guy was always staring at her boobs and making 1950 sexist remarks. When she reported it to management, your HR lady over talked my kid. Told her she was just being a “silly little princess”. Your management then insisted she do all cleaning by herself. All 180,000 square feet, including all five bathrooms, both break rooms, and all the checkout stands. Despite corporate policy stating what maintenance had to clean and what employees had to clean what, and how many cleaners you need to have.  Then as retaliation you started tasking her with work outside of her department, and unrelated to the job you half-assed trained her for. Then you wrote her up for not knowing the job outside of what you trained her for.  She did her job well and was punished by a work load that nobody could handle, and you punished her for not being able to do the work.   
 

She stood up to the challenge and worked through it with the best attitude she could muster.   
 

Then the coworker who texted her “Nice boobs” on multiple occasions, AND then tried to gate keeper to prevent her from making friends with male coworkers. I read the text. So did your HR. Because she reported that your HR and your 1800 number that ends in 8442. Your HR over-talked her and told her she just misunderstood the person. Within three days of calling your “retaliation free” hotline, your store retaliated against her. The guy she reported for sexual harassment went past the barrier  into secure the bathroom, cornered her in the bathroom and dressed her down.   
 

You let my daughter get sexually harassed multiple times by two separate people, including in a gendred bathroom by a person of the opposite gender, and you did absolutely nothing to the people who harassed her. You punished her for speaking out.   
 

Then your “confidential line”, as we suspected that wasn’t confidential. I know the person who acted as the intermediate between my daughter and you.   I know that you allowed the “confidential” complaint, as in the actual recording, to be given to the very people who harassed her.    
 

You want to know why she clocked and never returned. It because you failed to enforce your own policies. Tell your HR lady to STFU and listen. Get with the program, it is not acceptable to treat  women like shit or view them as objects.",False,p9ttem,DukeBeekeepersKid,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p9ttem/store_3472_you_want_to_know_why_the_new_girl_quit/,50,1

1543,Looking for ideas for what to do next,"For background, I'm 29M with a bachelor's degree in Accounting, and another in Music (performance). Been working in Accounting since 2015. First job out of college was at a small firm for about 5 years. Then Covid happened. Shifted to WFH and burnt out on the workload/craziness of everything going on. Resigned, moved back to home state (IL), and went unemployed for about 5 months. Picked up a bookkeeping position (in office mandatory) in Nov '20 which is where I'm at currently. Big decrease in pay but I just needed a job at that point. It's also pathetically easy, but comes with drama and poor management. So I'm considering leaving and looking for a new job.

I didn't want to post on any career advice subs because I didn't want the typical, eye-rolling responses like ""Work towards your CPA certification"" or ""Ask for more responsibility and they'll reward you with more pay and higher satisfaction"". The reason I'm here is because the very idea of trading your life for the luxury of affording to live is asinine.

I've hesitated to update my resume and start the search again because the motivation to do so just isn't there. It's really hard to imagine a job I could ever enjoy. My best guesses would be playing piano somewhere, streaming (piano or gaming), or maybe something park/forestry related.

I feel like the problem with those is either risk or lack of experience. Music gigs, even in orchestras, aren't even always paid. And I'm not super talented enough to land any permanent positions. I just like playing. Been doing it for 21 years. Trying streaming would basically mean negative income for an indeterminate amount of time with no guarantee of payoff. And I feel unqualified for nature related fields. I only had a summer job doing various landscaping for a park district in college for a couple years. I just feel like being outside and in nature seems nice.

1560,Why Automation Should Be Welcomed,"I am a data optimization and processing manager and just started my role a few weeks ago. During my interview, I made it very clear to the VP (my manager) and the CEO (manager’s manager), my primary goal is to make other people’s lives easier through data efficiency and automation. I explained that I believe in a “work produced” philosophy and I am not the typical mid-manager.  The VP and CEO were excited with my ideas and brought me onboard. 

A bit of background, this company has a tenure issue. 99% of their staff has been with the company for 5 years or longer. My colleagues are set in their ways. 

Today, I met with one of my colleagues and I mentioned that we can automate a process which takes a few hours per week to complete.  My colleague was confused, “What will I do with those hours?”

I explained to him my work produced policy. As long as your work is complete, check with your team, and  be available but you can live your life. No need to be in front of the computer. 

My colleague could not comprehend this. “But this is my job. I run this process. “

1566,Why do I have to jump through hoops to get this job?,"Since I got out of high school, I've largely worked dead end jobs for big corporations that don't give a shit about their worker's welfare. Last year in February I left my job at a well-known online retailer that, contrary to what they might have you think, did not leave me feeling very fulfilled. Since then I've struggled with finding jobs and have been unemployed for the better part of a year. I worked some WFH customer service jobs but with how bad my social anxiety has gotten I  couldn't continue with them.

Now I'm applying for a new job that more than likely won't even pay more than $11/hr but I would be more comfortable at. Even though I might get part-time which will be even worse for my already dire financial situation. But I've had to fill out a 15+ page packet, resume, and write a cover letter. On top of that I have to have 3 reference letters to bring with me to my interview today. Which, unfortunately, I've completely forgotten about until just now. Everyone I could ask is asleep and works in the morning.  I feel like a failure but I'm also mad that I even have to do all this for a job that won't even be paying me a livable wage! So here I am at 4 in the morning absolutely losing my shit and freaking out that I'm not gonna get the job because I forgot to ask for friggen reference letters. Sorry for the rant, I'm sure to most it seems like I'm complaining about nothing...but I'm so stressed and at the end of my rope. My mind is constantly drawing blanks on me and I feel like my days are numbered.

This is the first job I've needed actual reference letters for. How common is this? I've had seven jobs in my life and never needed even one reference letter.

1587,TL;DR: I love you all,"It's a cliche, but it is still true to say that words literally cannot express how happy I am to find this community.

You must understand, I'm genX. I started out working in the financial district in San Francisco in the 1980s. It was very exciting compared to my suburban upbringing, but the overwhelming stuffiness of my well-paying office job and the absurdity of the corporate culture became vividly apparent to me far too soon for the whole puritan work ethic thing to stick. On the day they told me I couldn't chew gum at my desk, I went on my coffee break and never went back.

There was an underground zine at the time, Processed World, [http://www.processedworld.com/home.html](http://www.processedworld.com/home.html) that had a big influence on me in that it was a reality check for me, assuring me that I wasn't just crazy or deviant or something. Since then, I have remained certain that steady, predictable drudgery in the dogged pursuit of material acquisition was not for me.

My family has never understood this and has always looked down on me as undisciplined, childish, lazy, and dissolute even though it's important to me to be self-sufficient and I have rarely asked them for anything. I don't drive a car because as a teenager I found the whole process produced a lot of anxiety in me and I had no desire to have a car really. I get around fine on my bike. It's true that I have kind of a checkered past because for a long time I was distracted looking for love in probably the wrong ways and places. But the germinal idea, the only one that really matters, is that I am happy.

But of all the many and varied and wild experiences that I have had, the one thing I never thought I'd see, was a growing number of people feeling the exact same way I do about all this, about their lives and how much more important it is ultimately to please yourself (not hedonistically. fundamentally.) than to offer up every lively moment to The Man. See, the way they are now -- they were like that then, too, but they weren't quite so bold. And now they're doing everything they can to eliminate any kind of alternative lifestyle as a realistic choice at all.

You know all those tv shows glorifying house flipping? Those weren't by accident. Rent is supposed to be no more than thirty percent of your income. In my town it is legal to raise rents by TEN PERCENT A YEAR. I don't care what you say, there is just no way you can justify that, ever. And this idea of just passing along any increase in the cost of doing business -- new regulations, tax increases, wage increases, raw materials getting more costly -- passing ALL of it along to consumers, so that profit is never, ever, ever reduced -- that is some fucked up bullshit too. When is it their turn to eat a little bit of a loss, to lose a bit of spending power? Hell, why the fuck aren't they happy to just make the same profit they did last year? Why must it always be MORE?

We were barely ever together. Any moment together, he would be exhausted. Making love was no option either. We were on and off because the situation ruined my mental health which in turn caused me troubles with the start of my own career. 

I developed a hate for work itself and I wish I could take some sort of revenge against it as a whole. When covud came, I really hoped that the entire system collapses. I still do.

1610,Rent has doubled in my small town but the job pay actually seems to have gotten worse,"So I live in a small town where rent prices have sky rocketed in the past year or so (like over 50% increases) Shithole studio apartments that rented for $600 a month in 2019 are now $1300 a month. I work for myself so I’m not in need of a job but curiosity got the best of me since most businesses in town are still short staffed and have reduced hours. All have hiring signs galore. Upon looking at the local jobs listings I could see why no one could find help. Here’s a small sampling of the pathetic jobs listed in my town: 

1.) Job listing for Panera that listed no pay range or benefits but had the headline “ WANT DISCOUNTED FOOD ALL THE TIME?” 

2.) A boutique hotel seeks someone w/ at least an associates degree for a front desk person. Hours are 9am-6pm M-F but you must also be available to work weekends as well. Pay is only $9 an hour.

How am I supposed to keep working if I had such an incredible time before? I have no motivation at all, it almost feels like I'm throwing away my happiness. I have to pretend that I enjoy my job, but I hate it I never wanted to sign up for this shit, but I had to.

First ""real"" job I had used the absolute shit out of me. I worked long hours because I was eager to impress and land a permanent place in the company.  It was only when they started dangling things in front of me that never came to fruition did I wise up. Then I slowly started losing my fire to work, and I lasted long enough for huge company layoffs. I collected my severance and went on unemployment.  

The unemployment benefits would only kick in and be maintained if I went for a meeting and 2 training sessions on job searches at the labor department.  This old sweaty man asked us all if we ""knew how to do computers"". um what??  Proceeded to show us a powerpoint created by a 5-year old on how to put together a resume.  In my one-on-one with him, i told him what i was looking for and he scoffed and said I should be branching out. He gave me brochures for entry level positions that had nothing to do with my field but would get me some form of employment. 

I really didn't know why he was pushing all this on me.  Does the agency keep the money that is rightfully mine if I get a job quickly? I turned down those options. I kept searching my field while collecting my benefits.  Finally on the last month I was able to land something and the remaining sum never arrived in my account because now i was employed.  But sometimes I wish I could have just spent that entire time pursuing hobbies while collecting the entirety of my benefits.  Instead I was so stressed and demoralized by the thought of not being able to pay rent and bills. These days I make it a point to speak out when im overwhelmed with projects or take random mental health days out of the blue. I find time to do something I like to do even if deadlines are looming.

So I called to speak to my boss, to tell her I’ll be playing it safe and staying home. Immediately she says “are you kidding me? It’s still early and we’re slammed here.” I told her I could maybe try to stay until noon but no later than that. She then tells me I need to talk to the store manager. 

So she puts me on hold, but then picks up the phone again and said “[store manager] says if you want to come in till noon that’s fine, but if you want to stay home that’s fine also.” I said “great, I’ll be staying home then” and then she hung up on me.

1648,My satisfying revenge on an employer who wanted me to beg him for a job.,"

This was a few years back but it is still the most satisfying moment against an employer in my life. 

I had just left university and was struggling to find a job related to my degree. My dad passed just before graduation and I was desperate for money. A job came up, it was a temp job for about 6 months and very low pay but I needed to take on anything. I was offered an interview and honestly, looking back I feel such pity for my younger self. I was trying so hard to dress and act grown up for my first real job.

On the day there was a big storm in my town, the bus only took me half the way. I got there looking like a hybrid of the girl from the ring and a drowned rat. Everything felt like it was against me.

It was a tiny start up run by this arrogant but obviously insecure 30 year old man. He saw me and laughed before even saying hello. I was already humiliated but followed him into the room.

He sat me down and leaned back in his big chair with his armed crossed over his beer belly and said:

“So tell me, why should *I* hire… *you?*”

The rest of the interview had the same tone, he really seemed like he wanted me to beg him for it. He would swing the money (which was extremely low) in my face because he knew I needed this. He would laugh and smirk when I showed him my work and even after all questions were asked, he seemed to really just want to drag it out longer because he was enjoying the power trip.

When I got home and changed out of my damp cold clothes I just felt humiliated and dirty. I checked my mail to see that he already sent me a rejection email, saying something like “I feel your work wasn’t up to our standards and you lack the experience”. I shut it off and went to bed trying to forget about it. (And keep in mind the position was temp and only 6 months…)

The very morning after, I got a very surprise email from a large company I jokingly applied for weeks ago (because I thought I had zero chance) asking me to head out to another country for an interview with them (all paid for). Long story short, it went well and within 3 weeks I was told that I had landed my first real job.

2 weeks after that I was already packing up my life, relieved and excited to finally get started in my career, when I noticed a new email from the start-up company that rejected me. The email said “Hi, we would like to invite you to another interview as our recent hire didn’t live up to our expectations.”

So they wanted me back..

I accepted and went back to them within days of getting the email. The same guy greeted me and took me into his office, only this time I wasn’t nervous or trying to impress, I was just being me and you could feel his discomfort. “Why isn’t she intimidated by me??” running though his head.

He started saying “So, luckily for you I’m going to give you another chanc—-“ and I cut him off and delivered the most satisfying line of my life.

“Sorry but let me just stop you there. I have actually just been hired by &lt;insert big company&gt; so I will not be needing this temp position. I wanted to come down here to let you know in person rather than reject your offer by mail. I feel that this position at your company isn’t right for my needs or skill level, whereas this new company is. Also your pay is 3x less than what I will earn over there in a junior position. But thank you for the interview experience.”

He was a mix of pissed off and broken, as if his inner lack of confidence in the real world had shown it’s face in his shitty little office that day. He said fine ok and then walked me out.

To this day I still feel that tingle of joy when I think of it! Also if anyone is wondering, the company went bust not long after.",False,p9e4kd,Mary_Mystery,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p9e4kd/my_satisfying_revenge_on_an_employer_who_wanted/,37,1
1649,Told my old temp-employer to shove it.,"Hello all. New here. Figured you all might enjoy my story. First of all, let me just say I love the material on here. While I might not always agree with everything posted on here, I get that a lot of employers suck and need to start paying a living wage and start valuing their employees. Enough of that. Now on to the story,

Tennessee. Small town. Economy sucks. No jobs. I moved to Arizona for 6 years. Was forced to leave a great job to come back to TN due to wife's family dying out. Can't find work. Even with everyone hard up for employment. Maybe it's because I'm half Mexican? I don't know. So I'm now doing Grubhub and UberEats. I work 10-13 hour days. Seems like a lot but I have a wife and 4 kids to take care of. I do pretty good. Not gonna lie. Plus I enjoy it. No asshole supervisor breathing down my neck. Can work when I want, can stop when I want. YouTube and listen to music all day. Not a bad deal. 

One day I get a Grubhub order for a place I used to work at through an employment agency. Let's call this company Greedy-Ass Alcohol Distribution Company. I was placed with Greedy-Ass Alcohol Distribution Company through an employment agency back in 2013. The day I started working for them, I was told that if I work hard enough, I would be hired on permanently. I worked for them for 11 months at $10 an hour. Busted my ass every day. Finally, they came up and said ""We appreciate your hard work but we don't really need you anymore.""

Fast forward to Summer 2021. I'm delivering a Grubhub order to the guy who was my boss. 

Old Boss - Hey there. It's been a few years. How have you been? 

Me - It's been alright. You?

Old Boss - Alright. I'm still working here as you can see. I see you work for Grubhub now. How you liking it?

Me - I love it. I make my own schedule. I make good pay. It's not too bad

Old Boss - That's great. Well, as you could probably tell, we're hard up for workers since a lot of people don't seem to want to work anymore. We're trying to do some hiring but nobody seems interested. How would you like to come work for us again?

Me - Yeah I remember once upon a time I worked here and busted my ass every single day. You remember that? 

Old Boss - I do. You were a great worker.

Me - Well apparently not good enough. I seem to remember your words being something along the lines of ""Thanks for the hard work, now scram.""

Old Boss - Well we just had no more need for temp workers at the time.

Me - I worked for you for 11 months only to be reminded that if I work hard enough and stay patient that I'll get hired on permanently and good things will happen. I also tried applying to work for your company after you cut me loose by sending in an application and resume. I clearly had the experience. But it seems to me that at the time you wanted cheap labor to exploit! 

Old Boss - Well I'm sorry if that's how you feel but that's not quite...

Me - How much are you willing to pay these days anyways?

Old Boss - We start out at $13 an hour.

Me - (Trying to hold my laughter back) I basically make $16 an hour doing what I do. Stop using people for cheap labor and pay better and maybe people might actually want to work for you.

1658,Guilt about calling in sick,"I have a job where we're incredibly short staffed right now, we're at a point where if one person calls in sick there's a good chance things will have to be cancelled and revenue will be lost. On Friday I got my schedule for the week and found out that at minimum I'm scheduled to work 56 hours this week, if things go sideways that'll go up to about 64 or more. Oh and I'm salaried so I don't get anything out of working that much. 




So Friday night I was already trying to work out how to deal with this, because I just can't be mentally sane while working that much, let alone hygienic and well rested and properly fed. 



Then Friday night my boyfriend mentioned feeling a bit rough, I woke up yesterday morning feeling like shit, and yesterday afternoon we both went to get covid tests just in case. I talked to work and they said to let them know the results asap. The tests came back negative, must be a cold, but the thing is it's still illegal to show up to work here, positive or negative test, if you gave any cold or flu symptoms. So for me this is good, I can call in sick Monday and Tuesday and then Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday it'll be 3 13 hour shifts, which brings me closer to a normal amount of work in a week, and I'm doing the right thing. I'm making sure I don't get my coworkers sick, I'm following the law, I'm being sensible in a pandemic. 



But now I'm trying to write the email to work and I'm thinking about how any other year I would have just kept working, because really I don't feel too bad. I'm congested and my throat hurts but I can do my job. And if they do have to cancel anything because I'm sitting at home playing video games with a stuffed nose then I'll feel like shit. 



The truth is its their fault we're so short staffed, not mine. They should have seen this coming. I'm doing the right thing. But I am so absolutely stressed and full of guilt right now, om a Sunday, while trying to work out how to properly handle the next couple of days.

It's literally raining ash out of the sky and the sun is bright red. I feel like I'm in an apocalypse.

  


The tourists have all been told to leave because the major freeway getting out of town (one of only 3 exits out of here) is burning and is closed. The restaurant is dead, we have been selling about 2k a night when it's normally around 9k.

Well, a manager heard me this time and he came storming up to me asking what I'm doing. He said it's not allowed and could be considered 'stealing from the business'. I guess I could have said okay, sorry, end it.

I let my emotions take over me and I defended my actions. I told him it was stupid and wasteful and a slap to the employees. That it's a huge problem that all of this food gets wasted everyday when people are starving.

When I told him I thought it was something we all do, he asked me to 'give him names' of others who do it. I said no, I will not give names. Actually, I told him that he himself has given us expired chocolate before. He said that's an approved managers gift. A gift. Wow, how thoughtful. 

'Business is business' he said. So I went to the rubbish bin to throw out the cereals with all of the rest of the food waste. I got my period that day, and I started crying after that. Kind of embarrassing, but it felt like too much that day.

People from rich countries, besides the exchange have the benefit of easily getting visas, which definitely does not happen with those who come from poor places.

In some poor countries, despite the many problems, you may find regions where life is less hectic and demanding.  Beaches, countryside, small towns, in many of these places life goes slower.  Also, the mere fact that you speak English can do some things in these parts (or not).

2. Is the green grocer selling you vegetables to feed your family with work or is spending a day at the allotment work?
3. Is commissioning an artist to make a painting for your living room working or is attending your evening art class learning to do landscape paintings that you will give to your husband as a gift for his birthday work?
4. Is a therapist listening to your friend after the loss of a family member working or is spending time with your friend listening and supporting them going through a tough time in their life work?
5. Is a marathon runner aiming to get gold in the Olympics working or you doing your local marathon to raise money for a local charity work?
6. Is attending a restaurant and a chef cooking you what you ordered working or is cooking your family the evening meal work?

1700,"I survived my first suicide attempt over a year ago, and now I'm thinking about it again because of work pressures. That's it. I just hate work. I hate money."," What happened after my suicide attempt? I met my first girlfriend, experienced a lot of things for the first time, and we're still happily together to this day. I also started a garden, I started making homemade soap that I plan on selling, and I've started learning to play the piano since I already knew how to play the trumpet.

It sounds like things got a lot better, so why do I still have suicidal thoughts? Because society and humanity in general is fucking disgusting. Humans were a mistake. All of them, including me. Just, fuck. We live in such a terrible, miserable, bleak world. 40 hours is the MINIMUM expected of us to work. That's over a third of our waking hours, and it's becoming normal to expect 45 to even 60 hours from employees at one job now. If you're not one of the people promoting a lifestyle where your life is consumed by work with no enjoyment whatsoever, you're one of the people forced to work 2 full time jobs because it's the only way to pay bills.

Bills on a house that you're essentially never inside of because you're always at work.

It's just, I have my girlfriend and don't get me wrong, we're absolutely happy together, it's just all the factors on the outside that still make me depressed. I hate working. I hate working a bullshit job for the sake of ""the economy"" or whatever bullshit it is. I don't give half a shit about taking ""pride"" in a company that isn't even mine and that abuses and exploits me daily. I don't want to go to work every fucking day for the rest of my life just to ""earn"" green slips of paper which I have to use to pay for water and food even though you see deer freely drinking out of lakes. I also don't WANT to have to turn soap making into a job. I want to be able to just do it in my free time, for fun, not be forced to make money off of it because of bills. Society expects you to turn all your passions into a job and corrupt it with money.

Cut the bullshit with the ""do what you love"" act. Once what you love becomes a ""job"", you're not going to love it anymore. I love baking, but does that mean I want to stand there and do it 8+ hours a day, every day? Fuck no dude. Maybe I wanna bake on Tuesday, but then go tend to my garden on Wednesday for the day. What the fuck even is the point of working jobs? I'm not saving lives by flipping burgers, I'm not saving lives by responding to emails. Just, why, it's so bleak.

Society is just fucking terrible and is so shallow and self centered. Constantly posing for selfies. Fuckboys in generic sportscars trying to be cool racing on the street killing innocent people in accidents. Song lyrics that are promoting cheating with stuff like ""I got a man but I want you"", ""I send your girl back home with my hand on her asscheek"". It's just so fucking depressing seeing all this stuff. Drivers are terrible and I actually recently ordered 2 dashcams because everytime I head out to town, I'm almost always involved in a near-miss accident because of some impatient fuck who didn't want to wait to swerve out of a parking lot or behind a yield sign.

I just want to be uninterruptedly happy with my girlfriend. We want to be able to homestead in our future, but even that costs money. We just want to live on the outside of society, no ties to money, no encounters with disgusting/aggressive people, no risk of being shot to death on the highway or at our jobs because of some impatient fuck, etc. I feel like I'm in a cage. I'm so tired of meaningless work. ""Meaningful work"" to me means things that I can actually enjoy doing, like building a chicken coop, cultivating dirt to prepare it for planting, etc, not goddamn flipping burgers and getting screamed at for not having an order done in under 2 minutes.

Humans were a mistake and the systems they've created were a mistake and modern work as we know it was an absolute mistake. I'm so fucking drained from it dude.

We have been creating for thousands of years, different technologies to ease or all out rid ourselves of having to work as hard as we previously did, but it seems our workloads are ever increasing.  Is there any feasible way of ridding ourselves of work, and still produce the things we need produced? I feel like we are all living in a state of cognitive dissonance. This is why so many people are depressed and are on pharmaceuticals. Deep down we hate working, but since we have to work to live, we feed our minds propaganda like: money doesn’t buy happiness, work hard and you’ll get a raise, anyone who doesn’t want work is lazy, and many others. Personally I think if people’s basics needs were taken care of, but you had to work to get the cool car, or nice house, people would be happier. Things would still get done, and people would still be incentivized to work, and be happy about doing it. I hate working so hard, only to be able to scrape by. It’s getting to a point where working one job doesn’t pay the bills anymore.

They were surprised/upset when they learned I had replaced the OS and basically confirmed that their Ubuntu installation had ""tracking"" tools installed:

1711,"New here, really tired of working like this.","Hi everyone,

I live in an expensive city (no much of a choice) and I have some debt. I also like buying stuff, it makes me happy but at the same time I have to work more for it. I don't have any support, I have a few friends but they either get unemployment or donate plasma to make money. 

On the other hand, I work a lot. Like a lot. I have a goal on the side but I don't wanna end up homeless either and I have expenses. I guess I work hard and not smart. I have a regular job and that is not enough... After taxes, it is nothing. So I do temp gigs. In those temp gigs, most of the times you are being treated like a slave. Or most of the times those are gigs that require a lot of physical labor. Very often I sleep only 3 hours, especially it someone at works call off. They don't care about my well-being. 

The other night I worked a gig shift (double including my regular job) in a cooler labeling stuff and lifting heavy stuff. They wanted me to stay longer and they could see I was worn out, of course they didn't care. I had to wake up after 3 hours to go to my regular job. I feel exhausted. Like fainty exhausted. 
I also want to add how it really surprises me how all these gigs I do, I don't see any attractive females. I am a female myself and I take care of myself when it comes to looks but I am wondering how those kind of females survive? My friends receive unemployment and I guess it works for them. My other friend who is a female does casting for reality shows and she doesn't has to work hard. I have skills such as computers, multi-languages and such.

Nobody would risk their life savings to start a business if the best they could hope to do is equivalent of minimum wage.

1722,Why society would still function with Universal Basic Income,"My son is very spoiled. Lol you can parent shame me if you want. But we're rich and have tons of money so he gets to pick out a toy everytime we go to the store.

The thing is, it doesn't matter how many toys he gets 😆 No matter what he gets, he still asks to go to the store everyday so that he can get more toys. My husband and I just tell him no when we're not already at the store. 

When he keeps saying please, we just tell him, ""When you're old enough to work, then you can use your money from work to buy more toys.""

Today, after we told him that, he asked, ""Can I work? Pleeease?""

We couldn't respond. We just laughed because he's still a toddler and can't grasp the concept of money or work yet. But I think toddlers are really good examples of human nature.

There will always be people who are willing to work because they want more than what they are given. I say, let the people who want to work, work.

My mom said something to me the other day that has me so fucked up: she's proud of me because I'm in a job that's paying me more than she ever made.

Why does this have me fucked up? Because I'm *struggling*. I rely on my parents to help me with my bills--my parents had less than me, and they had to raise two kids, and also fund my dad's shitty spending habits. 

I understand inflation's a thing but it's so upsetting that my parents moved to America, busted their asses trying to make a life here, and don't have anything to show for it. And my mom worked *hard*. My mom worked in a big retail chain for 20+ years, being fucked over and treated like shit by mediocre egomaniac bosses. We missed holidays, my parents were never around when I was a kid, and my mom was too tired after work to actually be present. 

My mom is 65, and she still works. She works at Walmart; unlike my dad, she actually has savings and a pension--but it is nowhere near what she actually deserves. They don't own property, they don't own anything. (Also the company she worked for for 20+ years? They went under, and she had to fight tooth and nail to get the pension *they owed her*.) 

My parents have degrees! My parents should've been okay. My mom had dreams to travel, but my dad fucking sucks (they're not together anymore, won't get into that because not relevant), and on top of bullshit retail pay--she hasn't been back to her home country since they moved here. She hasn't even left the continental US since she moved here. 

I don't even remember the last time she traveled to see her family in California--she has to live in hick ass Nowheresville, KY because it's all she can afford. She's 65, and we're in the middle of a pandemic; when will she get to travel? 

I'm making more than my mom ever did, and I should be the one taking care of her, but I can't, because I'm drowning in credit card debt and I'm only just now starting to pay it off but I'm stuck in a job with a boss who gaslights me, and has a chip on his shoulder because our industry treats people in our position like shit. But instead of trying to subvert that, he perpetuates it.

Moholy taught and practiced art and design in Chicago, but was always outshined by other artists and architects, most notably Ludwig Mies van der Rohe—famous for some of the most brutalist, boring buildings in the city. 

Anyway, in the book, as Moholy is dying of Leukemia, a friend asks him if he was satisfied with his body of work.  Moholy reportedly answered:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“I don’t know about my paintings, but I’m proud of my life.”

Reading that, I’m still flled with a sense of peace so rare in a culture that, like ours, pressures us leaving something behind, some sort of legacy, as if our we were getting one final report card upon death, a final grade on whether we did the homework right. 

“I’m proud of my life.”  Not my work.   That’s all there is to it at the end. 

The book continues, describing Moholy’s funeral:

&gt;“\[The\] eulogy managed to praise and patronize at the same time…comparing Moholy to a ‘an unprejudiced child at play’…\[it\] might have envied Moholy’s innocence, but also made clear that Moholy hadn’t moved big shafts of still or bought and sold companies the way the Fat Men did.”

Good for the Fat Men.  But they forget that work—which will eventually fade away no matter what--is merely a means to a good life. 

Team Moholy all the way. ",False,p8x0ic,TooMuchAmerica,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p8x0ic/i_dont_know_about_my_work_but_im_proud_of_my_life/,0,2

Talk about being ✨delusional✨. I actually thought I'd have some kind of purpose outside of being a corporate drone. At my advanced age of 27 I've suddenly found myself with a bad health issue (thyroid problems) and I don't know how I'm supposed to function going forward.

Prior to the pandemic, my life was mundane and boring as fuck but still somewhat tolerable. I met my boyfriend in April 2020 and that was fun for a hot minute but now that the novelty has worn off and we've fallen into a normal routine together I'm back to hating everything. 

Where I live, people under 40 are not eligible for the vaccination yet (they are prioritising the boomers) and Covid cases are high so we can't go anywhere or do anything. My health problem makes me get out of breath really easily so I can't even go for a walk.

I just don't know what to do with myself. I was doing a postgrad degree but I think I will have to defer it until next year and I just don't know if I can actually force myself to do it 😫

I am so tired that I am unable to cook dinner at night or really do anything of value once I get home from work each day. The BF and I do nothing together, he plays video games and I read crap on reddit or talk to my friend on the phone. I feel like our life has lost all value and I don't know what the point of it is.

1744,I thought I did everything right,"I came from a middle class background. Went to a good school, got good grades. Didn’t even go to university right away, just worked in retail and explored some different avenues I could go down. Tried a few and failed, thought okay, well what do you really love? Unfortunately perhaps, what I love is books and writing. So I did my degree in English. Then I realised shit, what job could I do with this? Well I love to write, so I’ll go into journalism and make a career of it. When I achieved that I tried to pursue it and…. Failed. Couldn’t get a foot in any of the doors, newspaper, film, tv, being a runner you name it I tried. I’m now 28 and so beaten by life. 

Sure this might come off as whiney to some but I was just thinking this weekend, I did everything I thought I should. I look around at my peers and most are thriving in careers in just about the only sectors left to work in in my country (computer science/IT/tech roles or being a cop). So from my first crappy retail job at 17, I’m still working a crappy retail job at 28. Part time. Shit wage. No will to live anymore. I find myself more and more agitated as the weeks pass me by. I hate myself for choosing my passion, can you believe I have to say that? I wish I’d tried harder science or maths in school so I could have had a chance at a career. I feel like I’ve made a series of the worst kind of errors and now I’m paying the price. I was going to go into education as my next move but I have no strength left to get up off the ground.

1765,disabled and dreading work,"Idk if this has a point, but its sorta just a rant. Maybe if anyone has advice or support?

I just graduated college this past spring, and had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes directly before the pandemic. I had a job as a barista before all this nonsense, but had to quit and haven't been back because of covid. My girlfriend has multiple part time jobs but I mostly stay at home all day and cook and clean and take care of our kitten.

I've slowly realized over the course of staying home that I'm just not cut out for retail, or most other corporate or heavily micromanaged jobs. I need constant breaks, whether for snacks or to lie down, to manage my diabetes effectively. Its basically a full time job on its own, and it doesn't fit within the 15 minute break/30 minute lunch setup of a 9 to 5. And while covid is still an issue, I don't want to be in front of hundreds of unvaxxed antimask customers who could give me delta and send me to the hospital. 

But I'm not anti-labor, just anti-work. I actually love keeping myself busy and being productive towards my own goals! I help my girlfriends dad building a guest house in their backyard, and that's pretty intense manual labor! I sew and paint and have a ton of artistic and musical hobbies. I cook every day, clean the house spotless, basically all the wifey duties I thought I would dread as a kid. But I still struggle feeling inadequate, useless, and a drain, since I can't ""handle"" a normal job anymore. Plus it feels cruel to send my girlfriend into corporate hell every day while I get to play Stardew Valley for a lot of the day.

1770,I don't know how to bring up my mental health with my boss,"So I'm doing a work placement for university where I basically take a year out to work for free. I'm currently at an equestrian centre which has been pretty okay so far, although my anxiety and eating disorder have flared up since starting there.

My university has quite a lot of rules when it comes to my placement such as no solo work, which my workplace often ignores. This is fine, I don't mind working unsupervised, but they only seem to employ this when it benefits them. If they need a horse in from the field, they're happy to send me alone, but if they need a group of people to walk alongside a hack and I tell them that triggers my anxiety, they tell me they can't leave me alone. 

My university also states that my placement provider has to make reasonable adjustments for students with disabilities. I get a disabled students allowance (DSA) because of my mental health issues so in this case, I come under that category. I want to discuss this but my boss is never on the yard, she left an 18-year-old in charge while she went to Croatia to get married and has only just come back, but half the time she's not actually there. She's yet to actually confirm my placement with my university (the placement team know I'm there and have had a meeting with me but need her to email them back to tell them I'm actually there. They've sent two emails and both times she didn't reply).

I've noticed my workplace has a ""suck-it-up"" attitude about everything. I watched a girl fall off of a horse during a showjumping clinic where she was literally thrown into the side of a jump, cutting her hand and hitting her head.

1775,Rant—fuck the restaurant industry,"Just saw the owner of a local chain on the TV complaining about how they can’t find help because “people are sitting home getting checks from the government.” Two Saturdays ago, my 16 year old son was called in to do a *nine hour* shift on his day off at a the local franchise sandwich shop—let’s call it Elevated Train—and, good little doobie he is, agrees to go in. About an hour later, he starts to feel sick, feverish and nauseous. He texts his manager to let her know what’s up. She tells him to “just sit down.” He does, but it’s getting worse. He texts her again and she tells him he “can’t just send yourself home” and there’s no one else to cover. 

He texts us, his parents, and we tell him “do what you gotta do” so he walks out. 

I know he didn’t have COVID or the norovirus or anything contagious—it was a reaction to getting the meningitis vaccine the day before. His manager sure didn’t know that, so not only was she willing to make my son work while he was sick, she was willing to risk him infecting his co-worker and customers. (Enjoy that sub!)

On top of all that, it turns out he was never getting his legally-required breaks, since he was often alone in the shop or, when he was working with someone else, they were “too busy.”

So, fuck anyone from the restaurant industry who says “no one wants to work any more” when what they really mean is “no one wants to be abused for shit wages.”",False,p9ce1i,InstantKarma71,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p9ce1i/rantfuck_the_restaurant_industry/,276,1

1792,"I’m starting college again in the next few days, and I feel like it will be a complete waste of time","So, I went to community college for two years in order to get my associate's degree. I mainly went to community college to delay being an adult, as well as explore different potential career paths. I graduated last year, and I feel like I didn’t really get anything out of it. The only thing that was reinforced is my desire to be an artist, which has been a dream of mine my whole life. The thing is, I kind of dislike the actual process of creating art, I only like seeing the finishing result. I speculate this has to do with dopamine because when I am in class or if I have no access to technology, I enjoy doodling and drawing a lot more than when I am around my computer, or phone, or gaming console.

Anyways, it’s pretty unrealistic that I will ever be an artist because I never draw, which means I am not getting any better at it. And even if I did choose that career path, I probably wouldn’t be financially stable enough to solely have that as my job. Looking at all of the other available career paths to choose from, none of them sound interesting to me at all. I’m a pretty nihilistic person, so I don’t really see any value in any of these career paths. Because of this, I feel like I am just going to have to choose a career path in order to survive and have a stable life. I feel like I am doing this for other people and not myself. I could care less if I live or die, so I am doing this for those who care about me living.

I chose the career path of UI/UX design and graphic design because I feel like I am good at things that are artistic/creative in nature. From the experience I’ve had with these things, I really dislike them. People always tell me that I will probably become more interested in these activities as I go along, but I really doubt it. I feel like with this career path, and with any other career path I end up with, I will probably just suffer for the next 40 years in order to survive, and then drop dead.

It really feels like I am just not suited for work. I feel like I was supposed to be born as a mountain or a tree, not a human being in the modern world. I just really don’t fit in with society’s expectation to work in order to live.

I really wish I was magically super interested in making art, and I got good enough at art to get in a cool art career like being an animation showrunner, or an art YouTuber, or a comic artist. But unfortunately, that’s not the case, and I am just going to have to buckle down and just do things that I find zero value in and things that I really don’t want to do.

1803,Labor Shortages in a Capitalists' America moving towards the future.,"For the past few months, we've seen many business owners, especially in the food/service industries, along with particular occupations (especially Agriculture) that have been enduring an extended labor shortage.  We often hear some business owners, consumers, and even right-wing pundits/talking head go to the tired cliches of ... ""everyone is getting handouts from the government or are still benefiting from stimulus money.""  ""...we need more people to pull themselves up by the boot-strap and find work to fill this vacant position.""





Even though, many states are back to or have exceeded unemployment numbers, pre Covid-19 pandemic. It's not any of the employees' fault; the laid-off or furloughed workers who decided not to come back to these business; or even the consumers.  If your business model was to bank on always having enough ""hungry dogs,"" as Jon Taffer expressed in his Fox News interview -- isn't your business model setting, itself up for failure.






First, it's a narrow-minded and presumptuous plan to have with a business in the first place, especially if you need a good number of people to be employees in your company.  That's pure and simple that if you decide to run any operations, you have to consider the human element of your business.  If you don't feel you can pay your workers minimum wage or a decent living income, then how can you expect to keep people in case there's a catastrophe; changing economic cycles or trends; or an overall reduction in active workers.

Alot of business owners or talking-heads/pundits (mostly on the right) seem to only understand one aspect of capitalism or any given economic system. How can the business owner (especially if they are wealthy) survive at any given cost?  I'd often say by keeping wages low, while not offering too many benefits? They almost speak as if they are gaslighting all workers, regardless if they are extremely poor to somewhat wealthy. The people are  ""terrible, lazy, and only want handout"" arguments are swimming past lazy and tired to absolutely laughable.  


Many states are maintaining high levels of employment, even as many Baby Boomers with few Gen-X ers are retiring or leaving the general work force. There's nothing society can do to help this businesses, unfortunately, except maybe grants, loans, tax cuts, or bailouts.  For many of the business who have gotten these benefits, what happened to the extra money?  People benefited from the stimulus checks and are starting to move on, but what is the problem for this companies.  


I know certain individuals, like to harp on ""socialist"" and ""Marxist"" programs are making people think they have to be taken care of by the government, or demanding exorbitant wages, just to do a job for ""...high-schoolers, people with no skills, immigrants, or people too lazy to pick up new skills.""


So, there's a worker shortage, now. The people that you've mocked also don't want to work or need to work at these jobs.  It seems like you would update your business model, or change the direction of your company. That would be the logical things to do. Also, as many people have said that system works fine, as it is. But, at this moment, the system is now flawed, because business owners are getting what they want with minimal effort. If you cannot adapt, doesn't that mean your business just dies a slow painful death. If your profits weren't much to begin with, how are you expecting to survive in the first place?  Employees are never obligated to stay, just like all of the consumers who are not required to use your services.

1816,The thought of getting a job makes me want to die. Do I need a psychiatrist?,"I always dreaded graduating and getting a job. I went to law school for a very long time, almost spent a decade on higher education. The world really changed while I was learning. Went in with no one using e-mail or laptops, and graduated in a world where all the work is digital. 

I had no experience. I didn't know what I could do with my degree. I was already too burned out to be an attorney. I thought I'd have decent jobs as an in house lawyer. But my first job was so horrendous that I was let go after two weeks. I applied for jobs in Brussels because I'm from Belgium and I could have been hired, but the commute and the high office blocks terrified the hell out of me. It all seemed very depressing and lonely. I did some jobs far below my level and those were the best. I had lots of heartbreak too, and it messed with my head so much that I had regular nervous break downs and couldn't keep a job for long. It made me only capable of handling part time jobs far below my level. Money has always been an issue because of that. Handicap benefits are a joke so that's no option.

I finally found a job that was sort of challenging but not too much, 10 min. commute, great coworker, good pay, part time. Lost it because of covid measures! I was devastated and my depression and anxiety soared. I quickly tried to look for something else, anything, because there were so few job offers then, Jan. 2021, midst covid. So I enrolled into a terrible job again, to keep it short. I have been unemployed for 2 months now because I'm crippled with anxiety and don't feel anything anymore. I hardly eat, mostly cry, I don't see the point of working. I'm alone in a new city. I think of dying often. I don't know who can help me. But I'm not in the mood for anything anymore. I feel like I can get a job fast, because I'm so good at hiding pain during a job interview, but I feel like no one will want to work with me in the long run cause I feel mega depressed while working. I wanted to be a housewife, have children, maaaybe work part time, sometimes. I didn't want all this misery. It's mostly all in my head, all the sadness, heartbreak. I have a good life, nice parents, still I just don't want anything anymore, except dying. 

I just don't know what to do with myself. Anyone else feel like this and how do you cope?",False,p8pey7,Lazy-Natural-5980,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p8pey7/the_thought_of_getting_a_job_makes_me_want_to_die/,18,8

I know that I could do most of the work from home since it's mostly video editing and graphic design. My boss is very nice and so are my coworkers and the hours aren't that much.

1823,Friday Inspiration: Be your own boss,"I really love this sub, thank you all for being here. I feel like many folks here are just beginning to see the world as the stupid fucked up thing that I saw it as in 2008 where I began my journey away from capitalism and it's model of ""sucessful person"" I hope to inspire you to somehow walk away from the death trap as well, however you can. Your journey will be your own, this is mine.

TLDR: I still work but on my own terms

In 2008 I was 27 and was slaving away in marketing, renting a condo in a multi-level building, just bought a comfy leather couch, new flat screen tv and I don't know what happened but I just realized this was not the way. I quit my perfectly fine job out of the blue and went in search of a job that I liked to do. Luckily there was a river near by and I found whitewater rafting. A lot of the guides lived on property in old school buses and for me it just clicked ""I'm in!""

The pay was awful, the boss was awful but the job absolutely did not suck, no one cared how you dressed and living on site I had practically no expenses so I did that for a while. Heck I did that for a decade and went to different rivers all over the country just getting paid to play. (Other guides travel the world doing this) BUT....living on site means that your entire existence relies on you keeping that job with that employer or renting a place when you want to move states seasonally is a bit difficult too. So I started looking for land I could afford anywhere in the US that was close to a river. 

In 2011 I found my piece of land at a tax auction and paid cash. This was my big break and it is important to do a ton of research but also not impossible to do. I bought the land for $2,100, about $7,500 under value. I was absolutely shocked no one else bid on it. 

Made the essential improvements to make it ""livable"" in a tipi with an outdoor kitchen and outhouse. The tipi was 2k and the other buildings were made of whatever I could get my hands on. Old wood, palm fronds, discarded tin, free table from the side of the road, I even straightened nails. Moved there and saved all the money that would have been spent on rent, electricity, internet, water etc. Took showers elsewhere for a while, friends or pay showers. Step one complete: Housing that is mine that doesn't suck money out of me constantly

I continued to guide rivers and wait tables, keep my expenses super low but I still did not have enough income to qualify for ACA so that's when I made the leap to not work at all for anybody else. Cause fuck that, I'm working 2 jobs and still cannot afford basic healthcare benefits. Plus I need to build a house too. 2017 income was $10,189 according to my tax return. 

The business I started was based on a specific need in my community but also benefited me and my existence to do it. I picked up recycling from people who would pay me a monthly fee to do so. Then I would use what I could to build my house, sell aluminum cans, steel and batteries for scrap, and take the rest to the bigger recycling center. I did not make bank doing this but I got a ton of stuff to build my house: windows, wood beams, doors, re-bar, shredded paper (I make into papercrete bricks), steel roofing, wine bottles, copper pipe, 2x4's.....my house is probably 80% recycled stuff. I made my own schedule, it was a super easy job just to drive around and sort stuff and listen to music.

I have had some bumps in the road of course. I pulled all money out of my IRA at one point and just started over recently. Recycling industry basically fell apart when China stopped accepting plastic. It still gets wet inside a tipi when it rains and no flushing toilet. But I never got into debt with any of this and that has been a key point in my own journey.

Anyway, I had to pivot into something else so I just went with one of my other talents which is native plants and landscape installations. I still do that today and work out of my recycled house. Two people also help me and we all get paid the same, I just have more office hours. We choose our own work schedule, I recently changed my schedule so I only work Monday-Thursday (thanks to this sub for that!). A lot of my normal expenses are now tax deductible like computer, cell phone, mileage for my truck, hey actually the whole truck, internet, printer, office paper, oh yeah and plants, soil, mulch, chainsaw, weed whacker, jackhammer, any fucking tool I ever need. 

The way I look at it, as long as the three of us are all getting the money we need to get and the amount of work we want to do, then it's a success. The business does not need to be profitable because there are no investers, or loans to pay, or any expenses other than the normal living stuff (okay there is some software and insurance that is directly business expense related, very minimal that I make sure that is covered in the rates) If we need more money for our time, hell I'll just raise the rates. 

There will be no getting rich, no PTO but also no fucked up schedules, or meaningless tasks or any of the other bullshit that comes with corporate capitalism. Its just the 3 of us trying to live. 

Our society needs more people to drop out and be their own boss, please consider it. The people in this sub are the exact people that can do it without expoliting people to get rich! You can do it!

1884,I finally quit my job that wasn’t valuing me. Found a new job that seems more promising — sharing my story here to hopefully inspire one person to keep fighting against corporate bs,"Desperate for a job during the pandemic, I settled for a call center job that promised to be better than the others. I was naive and totally drank the company kool-aid, thinking it was great because it was remote and the people are nice. It took awhile until I started seeing the red flags, and I’ve been following this sub for awhile which helped me see how I was being exploited. They severely underpay every single employee regardless of their title, promotions don’t come with pay raises, and there is no clear pay raise structure, to list a few. The managers didn’t do anything all day, and workers were frequently infantilized and often interrogated for not hitting certain performance metrics even though the company said those metrics aren’t important. They constantly kept adding more and more responsibilities, and even had the audacity recently to lower the wage for new hires in an expensive city while all the older hires are all quitting because what they originally paid wasn’t even enough to pay rent. Rather than paying the workers more, they are trying to force everyone into a new office even though they were hired remotely and have been doing fine the past year working remotely.

Anyways, this was slowly eating away at my mental health. I wanted to quit but didn’t know what to do next. I absolutely dreaded applying for jobs because the process is so de-humanizing. I decided to muster the energy and apply to some new jobs anyways, and I got many rejections but I also got lucky and found a job description that was actually transparent and listed the pay, which is 2x what I was currently paid. I applied and found out recently that I got the job! This new job actually has sick days, whereas the old one didn’t. This new job also explicitly said they care more about the employees than the customers, and it’s fully remote and it felt like I finally saw some light. I quit my old job and start the new one soon, and I’m really glad I didn’t settle for less. I will likely delete this post soon because I don’t want this up forever but I’m happy to share more details in my inbox to try my best and answer any questions you may have. Love this sub and I hope together we can make change or at least help some individuals improve their own situation.",False,p8oiha,pupcolorado,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p8oiha/i_finally_quit_my_job_that_wasnt_valuing_me_found/,2,8

1886,Capitalism doesn’t want us to read books,"As a teacher, I see how the young (and the old) read less and less every year. Reading helps us put ourselves in other (even if fictional) people’s shoes and live their lives. Which helps us see our own material living conditions with more clarity. 

Spanish writer Teresa Viejo’s novel “Domestic Animals” (Animales Domésticos) is inspired in a reader who confessed to her she quit reading as the clarify it gave her was making her unhappy. 

Capitalism and employers want us dumb, they want out children dumb. They want us to keep wasting time on social media, watching TV, and consuming ads that push us to work more and more in order to buy stuff. You can’t put ads on books (yet).

They want us to admire big CEOS like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, influencers, etc. Not because of what they do but because of how rich they are. So that we keep working our asses out with the hope of being like them someday. 

They don’t want you to admire Thoreau, who went to live at a cabin in the forest. 

If any, they will encourage you to read self-help crap about how “the problem is not your circumstances, it’s your attitude”, “be positive and you’ll become unstoppable”, “be productive, wake up at 4am and and arrive first at work”.

1898,"The story of how I got ""fired"" and got a raise in the same month.","So for starters I have always been the kind of person to put my work before everything. I have no friends (that live in my city), no gf, and my family does not live in the same city, so work sometimes was the only thing I had. That was pre-pandemic. March 15, 2020 I will never forget I lost two jobs in one day. Fast forward 13 months later. I updated my unemployment after being unemployed for over a year at that point. 

The unemployment office contacted my previous employer and ALL OF A SUDDEN my employer contacts me after no contact for a whole year saying I need to come back to work. So I did.... but I made a deal with myself, that work would not be the biggest priority in my life. If I was having a negative mental health day? Fuck it, I'd take the day off for some me time. Too tired because I just worked 14 hours between two jobs the previous night? ( I picked up a second job after job 1 asked me to come back) Fuck it, I'll sleep in, sorry I'm going to be 3 hours late. 


Anyway, my supervisor (really cool/hardworking guy, he just still has that corporate goon mentality because he kept his job through the pandemic) called me out on this. I was pulled into a meeting where they started talking about their point system Yada Yada corporate jargon etc. and I shit you not 10 seconds into the conversation I told him "" look, I am going to be real with you. I don't care if I get fired what you see is what you get."" At that point he said ""OK we can let you go.""


Now me and my HR we go back a little bit I know nobody at work is your friend especially HR. But we both have a lot of mutual connections in our business network. She emailed me saying that I am not fired and that I am expected to come back to work after my vacation. That is what she said ""officially,"" behind closed doors she was like ""hey you stubborn fuck, they were wanting to fire you, I went to bat for you... if you leave you need to do it the right way... don't burn bridges."" Although I didnt give a fuck about burning bridges with my company, but  I didnt want to burn bridges with her personally. So I came back.


I was applying to jobs left and right. I had job offers out the ass. To the point where I was getting cocky asking for a little bump in pay because I have years of experience in my field with excellent references. Anyway, one of those job offers called my current employer to ask around and see what kind of employee I was (I'm a lil salty about that because I never gave them permission... but what can you do?) Anyway my employer got spooked. This week they told me they appreciate my hard work and that I am going to get a lil bump in pay (legit like over like 20 percent raise) starting next week.


There was a lot of other things that happened that led to this such as: my city having a worker shortage, the people we did hire were unreliable, etc. But I felt like I typed too much already.

I am willing to look for other opportunities, but i am hopeful I can wait by the time my house is completed. I honestly want this resignation letter to kind of scare them.

For comparison I made in a night at the bar what I did in a week (20hrs) at the internship. I was going to a community college looking to transfer to a state university (which I did 3 months later).
But i got so overwhelmed and I was having starbucks and realized that I no longer enjoyed drinking coffee. It wasn't an enjoyable action anymore like it used to be. It became a ""guzzle this down and get to work"" thing. 
I decided i was just gonna quit school. I stopped going to classes for a week. I was going to enjoy my life and figure something out. Then... my brain freaked out on me. And I started thinking.... how is my internship even going to keep me once they find out. How am I going to transfer? Well. I went back. I transfered to the top 30 public university in U.S. and..... I WAS MISERABLE. I was working towards something that was bullshit all along. I graduated, got my first office job and.... I WAS MISERABLE. I quit after 3 months. I went back to work at a bar. Since then I went back to the corporate life.... and .... I WAS MISERABLE. 
2 weeks ago, I was fired. I'm not upset, I am relieved, I am a bit scared but I am in no rush to go back. Let me just state that this financial runway of savings I have all came from my bar jobs. Not corporate. It was literally impossible to save anything from corporate roles. I feel like this is an opportunity to not go back and to figure it out.",False,p8s9zt,staysour,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p8s9zt/the_first_time_i_wanted_to_quit_the_system/,0,2

1947,Overtime is a scam.,"I don’t understand why we went from a regular 9-5, 4-5 days a week sorta normal working schedule to being pressured or expected to work 9.5+hr a day 5+ days a week. What happened where most employers are just totally fine with strong-arming people into working to the point where they have no time to do anything outside of work except maybe sleep and eat. 

My schedule said i worked 12:30-10pm today. Not horrible and i like closing so its not bad. I stay up late last night cuz I figured i didnt hve to get up till maybe 11. Store manager proceeded to call me at 7:30am like two hours after i went to sleep. One of our cashiers quit because that same SM was trying to force her to work even though she was pretty sick and needed to go to the doctor/hospital idk. Anyway it gets more irritating. She calls me in to work cashiers shift and the original agreement was that someone else would work mine. 

She didnt call any of the 3 other cashiers before calling me, a manager. Two of them had the damn day off. Called me first instead of even offering it to the other cashiers. I was like f*** it, if someone else is working my shift then it’s whatever sure why not. 

I get there and after a couple hours my SM starts talking about how i need to remember this and that for when i close tonight. I responded, “isn’t someone else working my shift?” She said no that she didn’t need to call the other cashiers cuz “youre young, you can handle some overtime” 

TLDR manager expects me to do a 14 hour shift on 2 hours of sleep and had a toddler tantrum when i said id rather be at home asleep then get any overtime today.

I go back to work, another strike but this time I get an electrical shock from my mouse and then my PC turns off. All while I jump up and nearly piss myself. 
In a hysterical state I messaged my boss, ""omg lightning hit the house and me too"" he responds with ""ok I clocked you out. Clock on when you get power"".

Im still in shock from being indirectly hit with lightning or contact shock. And I'm still bothered by my boss response. No, omg are you ok. Just a bottom line to consider.

To clear up some possible concerns I did not go to the urgent care I don't have too much money to my name. I only work part time I've asked for more hours at work but they reduced my one 10 hour shift to a 8 so now I just work three 8 hour shifts. My dog is fine!

1954,Marx Quote,"""labour-power is a commodity which its possessor, the wage-worker, sells to the capitalist. Why does he sell it? It is in order to live.  

But the putting of labour-power into action – i.e., the work – is the active expression of the labourer's own life. And this life activity he sells to another person in order to secure the necessary means of life. His life-activity, therefore, is but a means of securing his own existence.

1976,I’ve wanted to quit for 3 years now.,"In my most recent meeting with my manager (3 month ago) I was told that some people on my team think that I don’t care about the job. And I just responded about how I’m literally the only one on time and don’t have call offs (basically my morale was low). 

It was after this meeting that all of the sudden certain coworkers started showing up on time and calling off less often. Even better one person who never really worked while at work, quit. This also meant a promotion for someone on my team.

I like most of the people I work with and there are only a few who can really ruin a day for me.

I’m still ready to leave though. And have been for 3 years. Especially after working through COVID lockdown (I didn’t get to work remote). I’m at a point where I’m about to go medical for weed to deal with physical pain from the daily 8 hours of standing running and lifting. Always been a rec smoker, but mostly just on the weekends.

I explored leadership development, but as an introvert, I’d rather find a more technical career or something with small teams versus large.

 It’s also about fitting in with the managers. I didn’t grow up like most of my managers. They just don’t get reality from living in their upper middle class bubbles. They tend to look down on me and some of my coworkers that grew up in different circumstances. I’m not looking to be a “you rose up from the bottom” B.S. for them to feel good about themselves.

I’ve always lived a bit below my financial means. I could survive 1.5/2 years with a part time job, but not sure if it’s worth it. I’d hope to really only be unemployed/partial employment for 3-6 months if I left. 

I’m only 34 but I’ve worked since I was 16 and I really need a break after 14 years of being at my company (4 years while in college the other 10 split between different contributor roles). But I find it hard to quit. 

Sorry this was a bit of a ramble but I’m not sure what’s the best option. Other companies offer 2/3rds what I make because of being at my company for so long. 

Hopefully I can leave in January(after my annual bonus) or at least ask to 1 month sabbatical.",False,p7uu30,dylan51299,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p7uu30/ive_wanted_to_quit_for_3_years_now/,2,1

2002,"Boss says theres a federal that I must receive covid test results within 24 hours, is this so?","TLDR: My boss insists that theres a federal law mandating that all covid test results must be available within 24 hrs, is this actually true or nah? 




Hey all, looking for advice/clarification. So last week I wasnt feeling well, and after several days I decided to take a covid test since numbers are skyrocketing in my area right now. (I'm vaxed, but so was my other friend who got it last week) The test came back negative and I'm feeling better so all is well, but when I told my boss that I'd be taking a covid test on Monday, and that I'd have results by Wednesday he insisted that its a federal law that all covid test results are available within 24 hours. This didnt sound right to me, so I asked him to clarify if he was talking about the rapid test and he said no, and that federal law mandates that all covid tests of any kind must give results with in 24 hours. So I went to CVS to get my drive thru test done like I've done many times by now, and I asked the pharmacist if she had ever heard about this federal law before and she said she hadn't. Well low and behold, it took almost 48 hours to get my results back, meaning I did miss a day of work waiting, but I work as a vendor so I can easily make up the time before the end of the month. This morning I went back to work, and when I joined the virtual meeting my boss was again telling the whole team about this supposed federal law, and even said there was a $10,000 fine for any testing site that didn't get you your results within 24 hours. After the call we spoke on the phone and he asked me where I went to get the test and I told him and much to my ABSOLUTE horror he told me he was going to go to that CVS and talk to their manager and potentially report them?!?!?! I objected saying I didnt want to get anyone in trouble and I was fine but he was really insistent! I felt super uncomfortable having my boss go hassle some CVS pharmacist, especially because they only administer the test, they dont do the lab work anyway.

I was so freaked out I called the CVS pharmacy to warn them. Luckily the pharmacist I talked to was really cool about it, he was like ""yeah cool send him over so I can tell him myself that hes wrong lol, I deal with people like this all day.""  He confirmed that he had never heard of such a ""federal law"" and that sometimes test took up to 72 hours or more, and that theres only so many hours in a day and thousands of test pouring in, it would be impossible to process every single test within 24 hours. Not to mention if there was a law like that he would be aware of it by now. He thanked me for the heads up and assured me that there are laws preventing them from even confirming to my boss I ever took a test there anyway so I'm starting to calm down a little but I've been stressing about this so I wanted to ask y'all, has anyone else ever heard of this ""federal law"" or anything even remotely similar?

2006,"A simple explanation for why you will never be wealthy, and that's a good thing.","Society as it is is a game, with points and levels and values and such. But only some of us are aware it's a game. Those who are power hungry *and* aware of the game (sociopaths, mostly) will rig the game in their favor, turning as many players as possible into their personal wealth-manufacturers. 

The interesting part of this game is that it only works if a sizable portion of the population is not aware that there's a game at all, but instead believe that all the rules of society are based on natural laws of good and bad, valuable and not valuable. They *have to* believe that if they follow the rules and work hard enough, they can be rich too. These people become upper management or owners of small companies, earning enough money to feel good about but always having to work so much that they never get to enjoy the fruits of their efforts. Until, maybe, retirement when they're old tired and close to death.

The only thing stopping these second people from becoming truly rich (owning the means of production, having value generated while they do nothing, being able to create the rules themselves) is their honesty. Which leaves the sociopaths to rule the whole show. 

Look at any industry, follow it to the top, and there will be just a few assholes doing almost no work and making 100s to 1000s of times what their employees do. What's more? They have created their own rules to create their wealth. In the stock markets it's hedge fund managers who abuse the system to the point of global economic collapse. In the chicken meat industry it's conglomerate owners who abuse farmers into slavery. This is true anywhere you look. 

There are also honest people who know it's a game, but don't have the greed to try and manipulate it. That's us, in this sub. We know it's a trap to try and work hard for a better life, since we will only gather more costs and debt and have to work even harder to gain any margin of comfort. We don't have the will to subjugate or fellow humans to wage slavery so we know we can't become truly rich. Yet we can't exit the game, there's no ""opt out"" choice. So we work menial jobs to secure our survival and find real meaning in the space around our work.

The pandemic was tough in that the leadership demanded more and more, did little to reassure us in the chaos, and ultimately did us dirty. Our overall productivity shot through the roof and our bonuses/comp were cut.

Our CEO asked us to celebrate all we’ve done for clients this last year and a half and to try not to worry about the cuts in compensation.

As a result, many people are happy to leave. In my small group alone about 25% of us have openly admitted that we’re looking for new work.

My boss has offered me a promotion. One of my first managers told me about the concept of a retention promotion and said it was an act of desperation and usually a sign that your boss has gotten away with *not promoting* you for a long time.

We’ve got a bunch of Gen X, Boomers, politician, and geriatric fucks who are so scared to lose a few percent of their offshore stockpiled millions that even a sniff of bad news makes their gaping assholes scared into hopping out of the market.

2028,Just need to vent.,"I work at a restaurant. I recently contracted covid and was off for about two weeks. When I called my manager to inform them I had tested positive, they seemed pretty understanding and told me to give them a call when I was “finished”isolating and let them know how it’s going/we would talk about getting me back on the schedule. I’m 1 of about 13 people at my restaurant that had gotten sick.

Well, I took a few extra days after the mandated 10 days of isolation. I was going to give them a call that first monday after those two weeks were over. Well, as it turns out, they had already taken the opportunity to put me back on the schedule and the only reason I even found out was because one of my coworkers was trying to pick up shifts.

And it’s like…. yes, my isolation period was technically over, but jesus, I could have been in the hospital on a ventilator for all they knew. They didn’t even call me to see if I was okay, they just assumed I was good to come back and didn’t even ASK me. 

On top of that they keep scheduling me weekend shifts to do to-go orders by myself. Typically on weekends there are at least 2 people because the volume of to-go orders can get really high and you kind of need one person packing orders and one person running them out (we do curbside). 

It was like this last saturday and it was a fucking train wreck. Not just for me, but the entire restaurant, because my to-go orders were getting in the way of the food that was going to guests who were dining in (even with capacity on to-gos turned down). Not only that but we were understaffed in the bar and the kitchen and we just got slammed for some reason.

I noticed that I’m alone again this saturday and I’m dreading it. I know the most reasonable option is just to get a different job but, well, you already know why that is difficult.

Every job I've worked I've requested part-time because mentally I know I'm happier only working 4 days a week. 5 seems never ending. Almost always am I asked to work more shifts because they need help. And no, this is not a ""nobody wants to work any more post"" as I'm talking about it was this way even way before the pandemic started. I don't blame anybody who doesn't want to go back to work right now. Not at all. They need a break, I didn't even expect mine to be an entire year either but I was that burnt out. Depressed from working too much and my schedule literally being work, and then spending my entire weekend catching up on things I've missed. Ie. House cleaning.  Eventually I came around as I've been bored and I want to buy things, so let's see how long I'm okay with working until I've been worked too much I hate it again. What's funny is I wouldn't hate it at all if I wasn't asked to do so much more. I enjoy spending my day being productive and watching my to do list fall, I don't like it when my to do list piles up and becomes never ending because I literally get so stressed out that I cry. I know my limits and I know them well. Anyways, I'm going on this rant as I just got home from a job interview and I'm always clear and upfront about only wanting to work 4 days a week. The interviewer nodded their head as if they understood and then later on in the interview ended up telling me I'd start off part time but would work full time eventually. But then said something about benefits part time right after thay. It was a weird loopty scramble from how I heard it. So basically what was said between the lines was I was going to work full time whenever they needed and it seems like that's going to be all the time. Like why even have the option for part time available in your job listing?? I always steer clear of the ones that say only full time.

2038,How do I shut up and stop getting upset about work culture?,"I've started a new job and I'm being trained by a young, idealistic and very conscientious woman who obviously gains a lot of satisfaction and much of her identity from her work. She works long hours and doesn't take breaks which sometimes means I don't get them either because training keeps going if she does.

The job is something I've wanted to do for a long time, even though, being a bit older, I don't believe in dream jobs any more. Just about every job I've ever had has fucked me around one way or another, and it wasn't till I discovered this sub and other related subs that I realised this exploitative stuff is just the nature of paid employment and capitalism.

I've made a couple of comments about being at a stage of my life and career where I've realised the importance of work / life balance and I'm strict with boundaries, but really, it's because I've noticed extra work is rarely appreciated, much less rewarded  by employers, so I will not sacrifice my own time, energy and mental health to do it. 

My question is, how do I learn to be comfortable with a workmate that hasn't and might never learn this lesson? I'm with her alone for hours each day, and I can't pretend that I share her ideologies, though I know *logically* that I can't be spouting any antiwork sentiments to workmates. What are some nice neutral things I can say to her when she is sort of bragging about being too busy to eat her lunch, or patting herself on the back for being a good worker and working herself to death? I care about this job so I can't share my real opinions but I don't want to enable and support unhealthy work behaviour because it's against my values and I want to work in a healthy environment.

I've worked for him for serveral years and only got a 1 euro raise once. And this dude just straight up buys a brand new build house (also quite big) while I deliver all his stuff through rain, wind and snow for hardly anything.

That’s all I need.

I don’t want to beg for a raise. I know I’m a hard worker. He made me feel appreciated. He put his money where his mouth was without my asking.

2077,My boss understands.,"wanted to tell you guys about my boss. I’ve been unemployed for years before finding this new job at a museum, cataloguing ancient volumes. 

My contract is a pretty short-term one (1 year) although not the shortest there could be. I am paid minimum wage and work about 30 hours per week. 

I’ve been working here for 2 months, and wanted to share here what I think a good boss should act like. I’ll call the boss “C.” here for the sake of brevity.

You should know that C. cannot remember my name, but checks up on me every now and then and apologizes when he gets the name wrong.
C. understands that my wage is ridiculously low, so he never yells at me if I’m late, and understands whenever I have to leave early, even though he can’t always give me permission, at least he apologizes for it. 

C. lets me take little breaks (like the one I’m using right now to write this post) if my job is done. 

C. makes sure all security measures are accounted for. Although mine is not a dangerous job, he makes sure to take every precaution to avoid I injure myself, or like know how to use a fire extinguisher if needed. 

C. pays for my lunch at a bar a few metres from where I work and has a small fridge full of water he paid for and all employees have access to it freely. 

If my task is not too clear, C. explains it to me as many times as needed and doesn’t push for me to work as fast as possible. 

C. sometimes comes to my cubicle to thank me and compliment my job or just to chat about how the company is going, how’s my family is faring or about our pets. 

C. is a 58 yeard old rich boss who understands what it’s like not to be one. Thank you C.

There’s only three of us in my division. It’s been a shitshow at times. We came close to potentially breaking a clients system more than once. I have lied to clients.

So, I've worked at some of the best cocktail bars in the world and in the last job I had, my boss was a useless piece of shit, yet I was the one they thought was a bad worker simply because I didn't want to fix his fuckups.
For example, if I had the 9-5 shift, one of the persons that closed would come in at noon, leaving at around 8pm (which rarely happened because it'd get quite busy) but, the problem was that, coming in at 9 I should be leaving at around 5pm when there was almost no movement but instead of being able to do that...right around 4:45, my boss would ask me to do a bunch of shit or to cover for the noon shift guy to do it, when we could've easily done in between the time he got in and my clocking out time, given that from 12 to 5 we were both standing behind the bar simply doing some side work cause two people were barely needed at that moment but no, he would always wait and make me have to stay in an extra 2 or three hours sometimes, without it being cause the bar was busy. It was ALWAYS because his organizational skills were shit and he simply never could message us to tell us he needed something done, no, he had to fucking wait till I said I was leaving to even remember that shit needed to get done, and then he'd ask us to do it. I'd tell him I couldn't stay for that much longer if it wasn't busy and that he could improve the way he communicates things but his answer was that I should be a better team worker and help out whenever needed. Mind you, this would happen almost every single day.
Eventually I got tired of it and told them to fuck off....

None of our dominant theories are going to solve the problem, they are all predicated on industrialized labor—you going to work for your boss. Whether it’s “the company” or “the party” workers remain under heel. 

Sure, America would look a lot more socialist if it fixed its system, because it’s already at a capitalist extreme. But buying into socialism wholsesale will just swapping one boss for another. 

Economics is a distraction, because the topic isn’t really money, it’s greed, corruption, exploitation, and abuse. Money is just a counting system being used as a rationale for wrongdoing.

2100,Help! Which role of slavery should I take.,"Hello there fellow Antiworkers,

I’m currently unemployed. I have been offered two jobs, one in customer service (call center) and one in retail. I will explain both jobs. 

Call center: offering more money than average, working 8-21 in shifts, also working on Sunday (not very normal in Germany). Did not explain the tasks properly, interview consisted of a slideshow on Teams and I was only asked 1 question; if I am prepared to be shouted at by people. The lady said she would call me by Friday and let me know, if it’s a yes I will receive the contract per post. I haven’t seen the offices, the coworkers, nix. Am I just being negative or does this seem like a trap - they are also searching through recruiting companies for people, despite the high pay rate. Since months. 40 hours a week plus overtime expected, won’t be paid - will be ausgeglichen when I need to go home early or something. 

Retail: very normal pay rate (not bad and not luxury), standard retail hours - went for a trial shift today, was a pretty normal day in retail. The good and the bad is included in retail with customers too but, they come and go. It would give me a base to start at least making some money and keep me busy until after the whole corona mess is finished and stuff. Also I can work 35 hours a week (4 day week). 

The advice I need is: what would you choose, if you were in my position?

2107,"In the Union, everybody hates the company man.","Just like the title says.  Everybody hates the company man, because when it counts, that person is standing for the company, and not with his/her brothers and sisters.

There is too much sacrificed every day because people are job scared.  The fear of getting written up or fired is something that we need to strive to move beyond.  The company has cultivated this form of control to force us into line, to be the good little worker bees that are quiet and content to tow the ever changing line.

Their BS about “family” and “sacrifice” in the name of the good of the company is a lie.  Does it profit the company?  Sure, but we need to make sure that it profits is as well.  Tell them not just “no” but “HELL NO!” to their 50¢ raise.  Tell them we are worth more than $10.50 an hour, we spend our lives working in their shops, restaurants, stores, and job sites.  We deserve to be treated like human beings, not line items on a quarterly statement.

You matter, you make the work possible, and the people that tell you what to do and how much you’ll be compensated for doing it need to know that you won’t just stand up for yourself, but you and your coworkers will stand up for each other, otherwise they’ll keep walking all over you, they’ll keep feeding you lies about expensive union dues, how unions won’t do anything for you, and how they are what’s best for you.

2110,"I married my husband, but I feel like his job is the other woman we BOTH hate.","He's worked at his previous company for almost half a decade and finally outgrew the company. They were constantly over promising/under delivering. For example, before the first lock-down, they promised everyone pay and job security, but when it came down to it, let everyone go and told them to file for unemployment instead, after the lock-down officially fired 70% of their staff, cut pay, stretched what little employees they had, etc. It's just an all around shit company.

He got a better job offer, but he wanted time off which he never really got because the previous company got rid of vacation pay as well. He told them he would only start 1 1/2 months into the future or he wouldn't be able to take the offer. Surprisingly, they gave him the position anyway.

Today, I dropped him off for his first day, and we're both depressed to say the least. I feel so lost without having him in the same room. I felt so spoiled in the last couple of months we had off together. It sucks because I married my husband, I love him, I take care of him, and I made vowels to him, but a fucking company gets all his time and energy. It absolutely broke my heart because he couldn't sleep from the dread of having to return back to work.

He even began stalking this sub and saying how shitty it was that a few minutes of pleasure for his parents resulted in 60+ years of working for companies that suck him dry. I can't disagree with that. Right now, I'm a college student seeking a software engineering degree and the plan is to retire him as soon as I find a job. I loathe that he has to work. I don't mind working too much, but I just can't stand that all I want is to spend every moment with my husband, but it isn't the reality we live in.

Maybe work is necessary in this life to survive, but to think it's normal to give all your time and energy to companies regardless of pay, is NOT normal. How is this natural in any way shape or form? I don't want my coworkers or boss or office setting to make up like 70% of my flashbacks when I die. I won't care for them one bit on my deathbed. I genuinely believe work breaks up families. Those moments you have with your loved ones are so meaningful and priceless, yet we're forced to trade them in for completely meaningless moments, all to benefit someone else's greedy dream. I just feel so empty without my other half. I hate work too and I'm glad there's a community that agrees without thinking it's ""laziness"".

2114,2+ Years Without a Raise,"I apologize if this is the wrong sub for this but seems to be the best one for venting about work.

I work for a multi-national engineering consulting company and have been with the company for just over two years. The pay 2 years ago was average for my position and experience, but after 8 months when I asked if they would be giving raises they said “they’re coming, we just haven’t determined when”. One year after that, having not received a raise yet, I scheduled a salary review with my manager and in summary he said “we’re not giving raises to anyone right now”. 

My frustration is with a couple of things

1) The cost of living / inflation has skyrocketed in the last two years so even if I continued to provide the same level of value to the company, without even a cost of living raise they are effectively paying me less.

2) I have taken on a different role entirely from when I started that carries so much more responsibility including dealing with an absolute prick of a client and managing up to 30 projects for him.

Better pay is what motivates people to put up with bullshit and at this point I’m having a hard time caring at work. I understand that you usually have to ask for a raise but getting denied a basic 2% raise after one year to offset the more realistic 8-10% inflation that’s going on destroys my motivation to work hard.",False,p7n5g4,madebybarton,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p7n5g4/2_years_without_a_raise/,3,1

I've been enjoying the time I have now sleeping in, watching tv all day, and reading because I know it's about to all go away. It doesn't help my parents keep making sarcastic comments like ""The fun is going away"" and ""You won't be so bored starting next week"". And before anyone says well you can still watch tv, read, and hang out with friends... yeah, no.

I miss having control of my life. I miss planning my day around things that are important to me, with the only dead time being the few hours of sleep every night. Guess what? Now I have MORE dead time in the middle of my day. 

I go to bed, wake up, get ready for work, work, and THEN I have a long walk home....only to do all the chores and stuff I neglected because I was at work...and finally, I'll have a couple of free hours....free hours that are corrupted by the knowledge that I'll be back tomorrow. 

Days off? I spend most of it doing chores, and half of the time, they beg me to come in anyway. 

I'm not totally unhappy, its just that every moment of happiness I have is ruined by how limited it is.

What could change all of this? Feeling like my work matters. I want to see the fruits of my labor and enjoy it. I don't want 75% of my day to be a waste....and that's what it feels like, even with their $9 an hour pity bucks they give me every couple of weeks.

One job had me working on the ground cleaning, wrapping items, assembly, etc. One was super hard on the body where I was throwing 150lb slabs of lumber.

This third most recent job was minor in physical demand but the issues were around the setup for employees. I don't expect much from these jobs but when it comes to general labour I expect to have the proper tools to do the job, though that should be the case anywhere. The biggest red flag was no clean drinking water, we had to use the tap. I'm not looking for a coffee machine here, I'm not too good to drink from the tap. But this is a workplace in a hot warehouse setting and the least they could do is provide a water jug to fill my bottle with.

The girl training me this week told me that her sister is positive for Covid and that she babysat her kids recently. The employer did nothing about separation in our work area and she wasn't sent home. Because we could safely distance ourselves and were basically working outside (garage doors open) we weren't required to wears masks. I'm double vaxxed but put my mask on to be safe anyways.

This meant I had to learn a new routine and new names every day, as well as gain the kids’ trust and build a positive relationship with them. I have limited experience in a nursery/daycare, and only very recently qualified.
Regardless, I managed. Was I told the routine? No, I figured it out on my own.
I did numerous tasks without being asked, mostly cleaning, sweeping floor and cleaning tables after mealtimes. Set up activities for children on my own. The 3-4 age group in particular was extremely unruly and I managed to get some of them to calm down with a drawing activity. 

A child came to me and told me some kids had escaped into an empty room. I found five children unsupervised, and yet there were two extra staff there that didn’t notice. 

Another child bumped his head, I took the initiative to help him and report the accident, give him an ice pack, standard procedure. The nursery has an app that you report accidents on. Nobody had shown me how to use the app. Again, there were two extra members of staff in the room. 

Every new room I started in, I also seemed to have a positive working relationship with the other staff, or so I thought. They expressed gratitude at the end of my shift, and disappointment that I was moved to a different room each day. 

I submitted a new starter form, which gave my emergency contact as my partner, who had a clearly female name. I thought nothing of it at first. It’s illegal to fire someone for their sexual orientation but it’s not unheard of to find ways around it and throwing someone under the bus, so that it appears that you are sacking someone for a good reason.

Cue getting called into the managers office and being told that staff had complained about a so called lack of initiative, that I just sit around and wait to be told what to do. Which is of course, bullshit.
I was not allowed a chance to explain, this was clearly not an opportunity to hear my side of the story.
The way she spoke to me as if I had committed some heinous crime, I’m not exaggerating. She abruptly dismissed any attempts to defend myself, and even scoffed at me when I started to show that I was visibly upset. 
Then just said “that’s all you can go”.

I cried in the toilet for a bit then took off my uniform, grabbed my coat, signed out and left. She just said “that’s your choice”.

Sent a very long resignation letter explaining all this. I only just received acknowledgement of the letter and told that my feedback has been forwarded this afternoon. 
I have no proof that my sexuality had something to do with it but the circumstances and timing is very suspicious.

If it’s not about my sexual orientation, it’s still clear that this is not an environment I want to work in. 

I’m glad this sub exists. I have had the bad luck of having to work with some of the most abusive people. I know I’m not the problem, because I have worked with some great people as well, although it’s not as common. This sub has been so validating. I had no problems with my mental health at all, until I started working.
If you read all of it, thanks, I really just needed to unload.

2136,Found my dreamjob. Getting paid for doing whatever.,"I work as a nurse/councellor in a psychiatric setting. I started working day and evening shifts but got tired of the chronic understaffing, no support from management and lots of other shit. An opening for a new full time night shift nurse opened up so I thought lets try it. I've been doing it for two years now and holy shit I've never felt better. I've never felt so little stress in my life.

Every night lasts 9 hours and there is work for about 3-4 for. The rest of the time me and my colleague can do whatever the hell we want. What works so well for me is not the stuff I have to do but that I can decide when I do it. Sometimes I like to do all tasks after the other. Sometimes I like so smear them out over the entire night. I decide. The rest of the time is filled with just hanging out with my colleague. Talking, making food, watching movies, playing videogames, playing pinpong or frisbee. I wanted to buy a gaming laptop for work but realized I can just bring my whole pc. Other colleagues asked if i's allowed haha. Who the hell is gonna say anything? There's no one here. Now all other  colleague's who have gaming pc's and who work occasional nights do it aswell. 
And the best part is I work 7 nights and then have 7 days off. My working days don't even feel like work and after that I have a whole week off. I have so much free time now it's great. My girlfriend I are childfree and she plans in her own time at work. So in my free week she can schedule 5 days off or something. Lets take a trip to mallorca/krakau/prague/mini roadtrip whatever. It's absolutly fantastic. I have some childfree friends aswell who I also take trips with and it doesn't cost me a single vacationday. And when I take time off I usually take 3 weeks but it only costs me 2 weeks in vacationdays due to how I'm scheduled. 

Every hour I work I get paid extra because they are odd hours. I get paid more then our totally overworked teamleader who also has to sit in traffic every morning and afternoon. I have no trouble sleeping during the day and switching back and forth every week doesn't bother me at all. I sleep at around 0830 and wake up between 1500-1800. Leave for work at 2215. 

I love the questions friends and people sometimes ask me. 'Don't you want more in life?' Bitch, my life had never been more fullfilling then it is now. I have so much spare time and more money than ever. I have so much time to do what I want and I want to do a lot.

2144,My dad is permanantly physically affected by a horribly stressful job he had 14 years ago,"Longish story. My dad told me this story last night and all I could think of was this sub. At the time I was pretty young and was totally unaware of what was going on. 14 years ago, my father was moved from a position he loved to a higher position that he felt completely unqualified for. He had to manage a team and lead a project after the unfortunate death of the previous manager. Told the project had to go live in March that year, he worked his ass off - between 18 and 20 hours PER DAY. Day and night, he worked and stressed and became increasingly distant from his family, despite my mom being pregnant with my youngest sister. The project was delayed time and time again, with the final date being the 16th of July. When it finally wrapped up, my dad took family time off for my mom. Just 2 days before my sister was born, he tried to sleep. 10 minutes passed and he's woken up suddenly by a rush of adrenaline. He tries again. Snaps awake. He had been worked so hard that his body became accustomed to not allowing him to relax at all, still in the mindset of needing to stress over this project that he knew full well he wasn't qualified for. The bursts of anxiety kept him awake until he realized he needed to see a doctor. The next day he was perscribed xanax to help with his shot nerves. The day my sister was born, he was so high on xanax that he nearly missed it. I'm glad to say that he is doing quite well now, and fully understands not to ever take on a job like that again. However, every now and again he will have small, short, violent anxiety attacks as a grim reminder of that horrible time when his job threw him into a position full of horrible stress. It's stories like these that make me further embrace the views of this sub and appreciate that more people are starting to see the bullshit that our bosses and managers try to put us through.

Man, do I love the look on their face when I reply with what hobbies I do in my day to day life instead of a job. When they tell me they meant what kind of job I have, I say: ""I don't have a job. I have hobbies.""

This really helps me weed out the people who aren't worth my time. There have been a few cases though where people have downright applauded me for sticking it to capitalism. I really like these people and I keep them around.

2153,"I'm out sick, but don't let that stop you from bothering me.","Please forgive the rant, but I need to get this off my chest before I climb a building and screech.

I work in an office in which 95% of our employees are vaccinated. My direct co-worker is not vaccinated and has no interest in getting the COVID vaccine. It's also worth mentioning that I absolutely hate germs and being around sick people. So you can imagine my displeasure when she came into work last Thursday coughing up a storm. Our boss made several comments about my co-worker coughing, but that's as far as it went.

On Monday, our boss began her vacation and is out this entire week. Monday evening, I started to feel odd and left my friend's house after (according to him) looking as white as a ghost, followed by throwing up. Over the course of the night, I started to feel progressively worse. When I woke up Tuesday morning, my nose was blocked, my throat was on fire, I was sweating like a stripper in church, and I had severe sinus pressure. I sent a text message to our acting supervisor and let her know I would not be in due to the aforementioned.

I scheduled a COVID test that afternoon and was told it would be between 48-72 hours for results, with a chance they'd come back sooner than that. I screenshotted the appointment confirmation and the ""Pending Results"" section to our acting supervisor to show that I both scheduled and attended said appointment. When I was hired, I was told I could work from home once and awhile, and figuring that this is an important week for us since I work in the billing department, that instead of being out sick and not contributing in any way, that I work from home to ensure everything gets done in time for Friday.

The acting supervisor didn't get back to me until this morning and said that the big boss who's on vacation isn't thrilled about the idea of me working from home as the work isn't ""quantifiable,"" but given the circumstances, they'll allow it for today and we'll revisit the situation tomorrow. I was also instructed to keep a log of what work I've performed throughout the day, I guess as some measure of justification or efficiency. Great, thanks. Since, you know, I didn't ask to get sick and my co-worker was the one who came to work coughing like some sort of animal.

While I'm sat at home on my computer getting caught up on my e-mails and getting everything sorted, I get this passive-aggressive e-mail from my co-worker saying, ""You have two accounts with billing that's been sitting here since Tuesday.""

I've been fucking out sick since Tuesday, haven't I? Not to mention I literally JUST got the approval to work from home, so pipe the fuck down and give me some time to catch up on everything. If I didn't get the approval and was told to take another sick day, those accounts would have sat there for another day.

So now all I can think about is the fact that if I don't have a negative COVID result/feel well enough to return to the office tomorrow, I'll most likely have to take another sick day opposed to working from home, since they weren't entirely on board with me working remote, which begs the question as to why it was even pitched as a perk during the hiring process if it was going to be this much of a problem.

Not to mention the fact that knowing how my boss is, she's going to come back from vacation next week and bitch about how I wasn't at work to get everything done properly, as if it's my fucking fault that this bitch came to work sick, most likely got me sick, and I'm the one bleeding sick time during the busiest week of the month because of my co-worker's poor choice to come to work sick and my boss' poor choice of not sending the bitch home.

2172,My father told me that his self-esteem depends almost entirely on his work. Our conversation about work and self-esteem made me anti-work before I even found this sub.,"A couple months back, I was having a conversation with my mother, father, and sister about finding a job, working while in school, etc. My parents place a LARGE emphasis on work and praise me for working 30 hours a week while taking summer classes but would ridicule my sister for being lazy and working less. Discussing this with my parents, it's clear that for them and their generation (baby boomers), your intrinsic value derives from how much you work or how much you make. During this conversation, my dad directly told me that he would feel useless and purposeless without going to work. It was not solely a matter of enjoying his work and how it fulfilled him, but that he would feel less valued or important for even working less. My father has worked incredibly hard for his entire life. Even into his sixties, he works 13 days in a row, drives an hour there and back, and works 50 hours a week. I was taken aback when he told me this straight out, and it made me take a step back from all the work I do at work and school to question where I'm getting my self-worth from.

What's even crazier to me is that my mom is struggling to maintain a relationship with my dad because of his work. She tells me all the time that he's a ""workaholic"" and she wants to spend more time with him and all of us as a family. But even for her, she can't seem to escape her reliance on house work and chores to bolster her self-esteem. I just see both my parents trapped in cycles where they work so hard and it benefits nothing in their lives but their self-esteem.

Having an objective perspective of their situations, I hope to build my self-esteem on things outside of my work, such as building positive relationships and growing my self-confidence through my hobbies. No matter how hard I work, my value comes from me just existing. I think younger generations are picking up on this, so I hope people stuck like my parents can become un-stuck and find reasons to value themselves outside of their work.",False,p71kn9,goatsnsheeps,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p71kn9/my_father_told_me_that_his_selfesteem_depends/,7,1
2173,I just quit a job that would've killed me,"I just quit a job that would've killed me if I didn't leave.
I worked over 20+ hrs of overtime a week, got reprimanded for not giving customers free items if they threatened violence or demanded I pay them for my failure to serve them, and everyday before and after my shifts I'd break down in tears over what I had to deal with. All the while most of my coworkers and some customers would insult me and comment on my personal life. The worst part was when my coworkers who got divorces or lost their partners due to overworking got mad at me for making time to spend with my partner, claiming I'm not dedicated enough to our work family.
It got to the point where the company tried to guilt us into staying bc ""we're family"" and gave us discounts on things no one working on min wage could afford like Broadway theater tickets, $300 floral arrangements and new cars at dealerships (I still don't know how they got them or if they were just a lie).
When I told my boss I quit bc I got a better job their first response was ""How'd you get another job? That's not ok."" When asked as to why I'd want to leave I let them know everything and they had the balls to tell me that if they could work through 3 strokes, visit the hospital once a week due to stress, and be forced to only spend time with their children 4-6 hrs a week so can I.

- With decent benefits like: paid time off, static full time schedule, 2x &amp; paid holidays and birthday pay &amp; free lunch. Also only a 2-3 minute commute with traffic.

I have a cake job, very easy. No managers around. Just me and about 5-6 others around me on the floor. There are no cameras whats so ever. I estimate that I work a total of 10-15 actual hours out of 80 every two weeks. 
- So I sit lay down/relax 70-80% of the time taking breaks whenever I want. I usually listen to music and play on my phone etc. And when I do work I’m alone and going at my own pace. Doing very basic stuff like wiping counters, restocking a cabinet, vacuuming a floor etc.

Writing as of now I’ve been sitting in a recliner for an hour.

Within a couple months they found something to get me and fired me. I then filed class action for unpaid overtime. Everyone was owed money. I could barely get 10 signatures. All of the other employees, even ex employees were too scared to sign. Nobody stood up for themselves. 

The company first blamed the parent company. Then the payroll company. Even sent out checks to employees to try to cover their ass. Some received checks for 85 cents. I would have ended that corrupt ass company. The lawsuit was settled. I won. That was not good enough. 

There is definitely A lot more to it. I had them on ADA violations, clear as day. I filed a federal complaint. The government did nothing. My lawyer did nothing to help me. Took my winning class action, and hung me out to dry on ADA stuff.

My training was supposed to finish this week's Tuesday, so last week my boss officially added me to the team communication channels and included me in the timetable to work from 7 to 3:30 pm. 

I have no problem with this. Since the training started, ive been working from 9, which is perfect. So, I'd really prefer that he asked me about what hours worked for me and what not because I really would like to start my shift at 9:00 as I live far from the company and I'm not a morning person. 

I forwarded him this request. He said
""According to the business needs, you've got to be here at 7 to start the shift"". 

This is the problem: it's not his first time having a trouble with a simple schedule adjustment. This dude makes a timetable at the beginning of every month and that's it. Which is absolutely ridiculous. 

I asked my shifts to be changed a few times before and he's never been flexible. So I reported him to HR. He got to change the hours, and then I was like, ""I don't think I made myself clear: I quit"".

But when the organization moved to WFH over the pandemic and then forced us back into the office four months later (August 2020, the peak of the pandemic), and I realized how much of my job could be done remotely (99% of it, to be exact), I couldn’t take it any longer. 

I gave my boss my two weeks notice a month and a half ago, with the reasoning that I wanted a remote job. My boss then asked if I would stay if he would propose that my job become a remote position. The organization fucked me over, made me wait for a whole month before getting back to me, and my proposal went all the way to the god damned president of the organization (for context, my job is a managerial level) before getting rejected. 

The reason being that the president wanted an emphasis on “community” in our local site. What the fuck. I have in-person meetings maybe once a month. I demonstrated very clearly I was able and motivated to complete my job from home. This rejection of my proposal made me realize that while I was valued at the lower levels, I was simply a cog in the machine to the upper level administration. 

So, fuck that. You want someone to stay in the office from 8-5 for no reason, good luck finding someone when my field has over 200+ open positions for a remote job.

2186,"The inherent requirement of ""doing more"" in jobs and industry is one of the causes of job misery.","I'm talking about the two different things: 

First is the rhetoric that within most desk jobs or corporate jobs, you have to always try harder and do more to move up the ladder.  If you hit your target, you have failed (at my company you get a 3/5 if you meet your requirement and 5/5 is ""extremely exceeds expectations"". 

-versus-

The requirement for companies themselves to always do more.  Higher revenue, higher profit, lower costs, more, more, more, every quarter and year forever. 


Then there are entire industries of companies that exist to help the other companies do more, like ad agencies and consulting.  If there wasn't extreme competition within capitalism, there would be no need for thousands of supporting companies that only push other corporations to higher extremes of performance.  
   

Working for a company that only helps other companies increase shareholder value is entirely void of fulfilment.  You are pushed to do more, work harder, with less resources, so you can help some other company do more with less resources.  


I don't know anyone that only works during ""work hours"".  Within the company, other friends, even clients and customers - all buring the midnight oil to slog through the week and have 2/7 days of ""freedom"" while dreading the next work day.  


No one takes all their vacation days, most only 1/2 of the allocation because of the flywheel of working more, and more. Even after a 60 hour work week, or 70 hour work week, the closing thoughts from a manager is, ""OK, so what are you going to do next week to improve?"".  


Doesn't it all feel like a scam sometimes?  Like, all I wanted to do today was hang around and read a book or take a walk or anything other than what I'm forced to do...  but 200+ emails later, here we are; Wednesday afternoon, coming up on hour 40 of work already with another two 12 hour minimum days coming up.

2200,Is there any way to fight institutions/large employers? Is it enough to turn away when you know there is someone more desperate than you who will take that spot?,"
I worked as a lab tech at an Ivy right after college. The University would let you know on a near constant basis that you were shit and how much money they put towards the professor in charge of the lab. And they were very smart about everything (nothing in writing). My first week the PI sat me down and said that this is not a 9-5, this job requires overtime but not to put it on my timesheet (I was obviously hourly). Being a fucking stupid immigrant first gen college grad right out of school, I did not record or take notes of anything related to this. Also it was my first job, at an Ivy, and I wanted to apply for grad school next round. 
The next THREE years were fucking hell. I was regularly working 60+ hours a week not including commute and weekends. My boss kept telling me I wasn’t ready to apply for grad school and he would not give me a recommendation to do so. It was always “I think you need one more year or a first author paper.” This was also happening to international students in the lab. One tried to get another job halfway across the country after being in his PhD program for 7 years. The PI sent an email basically telling the other international students to not even think about it or they’re getting sent back to their country. Other professors in the department knew this was happening. I tried going to collaborators for advice. They would tell me to cut my losses, they didn’t want to give me a recommendation because if it came back to my boss that they did, it would be awkward… After wasting three years and without a recommendation, I should leave. I got in contact with HR about unpaid overtime, and they called me in for a face to face (no record) and basically said it was my fault that I didn’t put hours overtime down on my time sheet even though my boss explicitly told me not to(I kept my own record of hours worked). I let them know that my boss was basically keeping me hostage with the rec letter and due to the nature of lab work I had few options and fewer people to go to for help. A week later they called me in for another face to face. My services were no longer needed. I was given the option to resign so that I wouldn’t have the red mark of being fired on my record. Being a scared idiot I agreed to resign. This was the week before winter holidays began. 
Then 3 months later the pandemic hit and employers stopped hiring. And I couldn’t get unemployment because I resigned. Luckily I got in contact with my tutoring gig from college (I was making more here part time than I did working at an Ivy lol). I thought since I’m fucked why not open up an Etsy account and try to sell whatever I had for some cash. Then I thought better yet, why not buy Etsy stock. By the end of the year I stopped thinking about trying to get another job in academia or industry. I threw away the dream of grad school, would not even consider throwing money away on a master’s. I saved up enough to put a down payment on a house. If you live in a HCOL city making middle income or lower look for a workforce housing program or something similar. Properties are hard to find and there are hoops to jump through. Since leaving the nightmare job I finally had the headspace and realized this was a thing that could help me. Then in January I yolo’d on some gme. I got incredibly fucking lucky. That job and the pandemic could have ruined my life. I’m currently choosing to work part time tutoring through zoom. I make enough to afford mortgage/health/some fun. I have the time and energy to plan investments and work on building a solid financial foundation for myself. I have time to do things that make me happy. 
I have occasional contact with former lab members. These people can’t walk away like I did. Every once in a while I think back to that boss and that job. Is there really a way to fight huge institutions like that? I don’t know and I’m lucky enough to not care.

2201,Left the workplace permanently and now feel shame,"So I’m a 27f and married to a man who makes enough money for us to live comfortably on one income while saving for retirement, provides healthcare, and housing. He joined the army when he saw I was developing anxiety and depression issues to make sure I was ok. We have no material problems. That’s not the issue.

The issue is that I grew up with the typical life script of go to school, go to college (finally paid it off), work as a strong independent woman, and maybe have kids. I am too anxiety-ridden to have kids, hubby doesn’t want them either-and we already get shamed for that. But now I feel like I am nobody because I spend my days keeping the house tidy and playing games during the day when I’m not having panic attacks.

We don’t make a lot of money, but the army provides the basics to keep us afloat and afford my treatments. Just….how do I find meaning when I have been trying and failing to work for years.

2210,Paying Taxes in the US,"Hi,

I have a question for people from the US. Here in Germany we pay more taxes than you (probably less if you look at the additional costs of healthcare you have), however I am fine with paying these taxes. Of course they could be spent better, so I usually vote for the political parties that try to extend unemployment benefits, improve the healthcare system, pay for infrastructure and don't do handouts for million dollar companies.

I have often seen this sentiment in the US, where people are: ""Why should I pay for someone's healthcare!"" ""Why should my taxed pay for this persons unemployment benefits."" And a some people are opposed to be against taxes a lot. Is it this everyone for themselves mentality that I see a lot in America?

I would be more annoyed with having to pay taxes in the US for the enormous military complex you have, but I don't understand the resistance against unemployment benefits and healthcare. Do these people also not get any other sort of insurance? Because that is basically what these are, it is an insurance against loosing your job or insuring your health.",False,p79muv,TravisFlexThemPlease,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p79muv/paying_taxes_in_the_us/,26,1

It seemed as if my aunt held on to her last strength, her last wick of flame. She waited for my mom to get off work and hear her voice. My mom and my aunt had a love/hate relationship I believe. I don’t exactly know the story but it seemed as if my aunt was waiting for my mom to say she was sorry and to say goodbye. I wonder how many people have had the same experience but couldn’t be there for a loved one because of their 9-5 work, or was stuck in traffic.

My supervisor expects me to be on my feet working my entire shift besides the 30 min lunch break I have though. He actively looks for bullshit jobs for me to do if he suspects I'm done early.  

Lately, I've been trying to eat healthier, so I've been doing intermittent fasting and trying to get my food into an 8 hour window. I keep oatmeal pouches and almond milk in the fridge to eat for breakfast at work. Well, my supervisor caught me eating breakfast and said he's telling the principal about it, that it's considered time theft to do that. Like, Jesus Christ, I only make $1100 a month and it's an awful job, can I not just enjoy some oatmeal without being bitched at. This same dude told on me one day that I was 20 minutes late due to my alarm not being set the night before. I apologized, but he just runs straight to administration and tattles.  

I'm worried I'm gonna be terminated for him constantly snitching on me, but at the same time, I'm so sick of barely making enough to scrape by, that maybe if I leave here I'll find something better.

2251,A little rant and request for advice,"I work for the State of New York in a field that requires a minimum number of staff on shift for safety reasons. So if there's a hole in the schedule for any reason, somebody on shift is forced to work another shift up to 16 total hours. I understood going in that this would occasionally happen. If someone calls in an hour before their shift, and you can't find someone willing to work it, it is what it is. But the agency's personnel department has never been competent at adequately staffing the agency. In ten years I've worked for it I've seen locations where everybody gets mandated every day and I've seen vacant positions go unfilled for years. The pandemic has made the already bad staffing issues much worse and I've been working multiple non-consensual double shifts per week for over a year and a half. They're required to give 8 hours off between shifts. I have an hour commute so for me, this 8 hours is six hours. Then I have to do personal things like shower and eat when get I get home and give myself an hour before I leave for work to get ready. So this six hours turns into a maximum of four hours of sleep in-between 16 hour non-consensual shifts. This is not sustainable and I see now that the agency will not ever get it's shit together and this situation will not get any better so I've been calling in after I get mandated and refusing and doing precursory searches for what other jobs are out there. Some of the the agency's actions have been and continue to be unethical and abusive. There had been a policy that mandation was a last resort, only to be done when there was no other possible way to meet the staffing minimums. But last year they instituted a new policy that part time employees would be mandated before full time workers could volunteer to pick up a shift to save the state some money on overtime. I didn't even think this was legal. I checked with the union and they said it was. It's highly unethical to put money before consent and I think whoever thought of this policy belongs in jail, morally if they're not technically breaking any laws. They've counterproductively instituted hiring freezes, and they're supposed to get someone to relieve you if you're facing a fourth consecutive non-consensual double shift but my boss's boss had made it clear verbally in writing that they don't have to. I've made it clear to my immediate supervisors that I don't give a fuck and I'll call in when I need to and I'm done sacrificing my wellness because of the agency's lack of competence or ethics and I don't care if I get fired.  I'm going to a doctor later today to try to get a note that says I need reasonable accomodations and can't work like that.

Sorry for the long rant. Mostly why I'm posting is for some advice about my future being uncertain. The most responsible thing to do would probably be to line up another job, then quit my current one. But I'm wondering if getting fired, getting unemployment for a while, then getting a new job would be a good move. Do I still need to be fired to collect unemployment? When I looked into it 20 years ago, a person was not eligible for any benefits if they'd voluntarily left their last job. Should I worry about the reference? I know there is very limited information a former employer can give and they probably do only confirm employment dates but I'm a little worried they'd say I was terminated and not rehireable and this job is ten years of work experience for me so I don't want to burn the reference.

2261,Antiwork Is Not Laziness,"Its about being able to fill your soul by having the possibility to do a hobby or realize an impromptu desire. 

Imagining a day when we've all been able to create the lifestyle we want and being able to go to the museum on a random weekday... doing so without the social stigmas of being unreliable or inconsiderate.

When we've healed our internal wounds, finally taking back the power from these people who've designed a society whence we always need to buy something and need it to arrive in 2 days or less. 

Working voluntarily but courteous for a greater benefit, where ""bosses"" have vision but no power or ego because both merchant and customer alike put personal fulfillment at the top of the list and as a group we are more patient with each-other.

Yes, the go go go system will fall apart, the metrics will suffer, production will slow and everyone will know that if we treated one another like robots and pawns we could increase output by 23% but it doesn't matter anymore. 

A painter doing a 9-5 job to pay the bills could use that spontaneous inspiration to pull an all nighter and go to work at 1 or 2 pm if she needed to. Just so she could express that spiritual expression that she would otherwise silence so she could wake up at 6:45am so she can catch the bus at 7:30am.

That couple having a rough few weeks wants to drive to visit their parents on Tuesday while the family's favorite sports team is on. 

I can even Imagine people being even more productive on days they do work because they're able to fill their souls while having a job.

I don't understand why, as a species, we have created a world for ourselves where we have to work 40 hours a week to make money for someone else's company. Who decided it should be normal to work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week? I truly feel that I would be ok with work, and maybe even enjoy it, if it were for example 5 hours a day and only 3 or 4 days a week. 

My job isn't even that bad, as far as jobs go. I know I am lucky compared to others. and yet, I still hate it. I've hated every job I've ever had, so I don't think there's any hope for me to enjoy life unless I somehow manage to be self-employed. I get so resentful that I HAVE to be at work for a certain time, for a certain number of hours every day. And 5 weeks holiday over the ENTIRE YEAR is never, ever going to be enough time to recover from it. I feel trapped and that the company literally own me. 

The worst part is that society is completely brainwashed and thinks this is a normal good life, and tell me to stop complaining because I would be bored without work. I'm sorry but no. I am bored now. There are SO many things I would rather be doing than working in a boring job to make money for someone else.

Me being the work addicted loonatic I am, decided it was still a job so its worth the daily trip. --For context, the highway here is 75MPH, my car is 91HP and gets speed wobbles at anything over 55MPH-- I go to the FIRST interview, dressed up, 15 min early, the whole 9 yards. The interviewer and I go through the process, and he's growing more interested in hiring me. Afterwards, he tells me he'd love to have me in for another interview. ""Perfect!"" I thought, ""This could be one of my stress relievers."" A few days later I go in for the second interview, ace it like I did the first one. So they tell me to come in ANOTHER day, to speak with the actual manager and get everything worked out. So, I go in to talk with the manager. I'm expecting to have to write out the full menu from memory, like I was told I'd have to do when I left the second time. To my surprise, I was called straight to the managers office to speak with them. After 25 minutes of idle chatter, I get taken to the lobby/restaurant and told to write out the menu. I successfully do so and they say its perfect, and that the next time I'd come in was to finalize/finish new-hire paperwork. So I go in again (different day yet again), finish the paperwork and ask for my start date. They give me the date to come in, and I oblige. 20 minutes early, excited to start working again, everything was perfect. I walk in and the manager immediately greets me and says ""We filled the position with someone who was a better fit."" No text, call, or email beforehand to let me know not to waste my time or gas.

2295,Van Gogh was anti-work.,"For most his life all he spent his time doing was painting, even though he didn't really make any money off it. While alive he only sold like 1 painting, and it's said that his brother who supported him financially sent one of his friends to buy it to make Van Gogh feel better. His brother used to support him financially because he didn't have a job, all he did was paint. But then once his brother got married became a father, Van Gogh probably didn't want to be burden to his brother by having him keep financially supporting him, so he instead of becoming a wage slave he decided to kill himself (atleast that's my take on it).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Theo (his brother) was married, had recently become a father and was planning on starting his own art dealership. Vincent was still completely financially dependent on Theo, and perhaps felt like a millstone around his brother’s neck. Or perhaps he was worried that Theo would not be able to continue to send him sufficient funding in the future.  
&gt;  
&gt;We’ll probably never know the exact reason for sure.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- From [Vangoghmuseum.nl](https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/art-and-stories/vincent-van-gogh-faq/why-did-vincent-van-gogh-commit-suicide)

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, people only started paying attention to his art after he died. These days just one of his paintings costs millions of dollars, but when he was alive he had little to no money. His story inspired me to write a song because I can relate to it seeing as I spend my time writing songs no one listens to instead of going to work, and I'd like to think that when I die more people will listen. The song is called ['Van Gogh'](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Aa72OMDhPBQUzhpqc40E7?si=826ec13ecef94d1d) (naturally) and it's one of my favourite songs from all the ones I've written.",False,p7d4ym,Jax_Gatsby,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p7d4ym/van_gogh_was_antiwork/,4,1
2296,I was called out publicly by HR for being a terrible team captain in mandatory-fun team building event. I am so done with it.,"Recently HR organised a team building exercise to improve the morale of the staffs. Unfortunately, I was involuntary “volunteered” to be a team captain for group of 30. The entire department is split into groups of 30 with one “team captain”.

I’m someone who doesn’t really enjoy mandatory fun especially at work. I’m just that guy who just want to do my work and clock out. That’s not to say that I’m not a team-player, I actually don’t mind these kind of activities if they’re done face-to-face. However, since we’re all working remotely, these kind of activities are done virtually and it’s just pure cringe imo.

For the past few months I’ve been caught up with work. I’m pulling 12 hrs shifts a day just to deliver my project and to be blunt I don’t have time to plan for these kind of activities. I discussed with HR on whether this position can be assigned to someone else. Unfortunately there’s no way to decline this position and I’m forced to conduct a three month worth of activities to boost morale for the team I’m assigned to. 

As expected, there are some delays to this team building exercise and HR caught wind on this. I was called into a meeting and was lectured by a group of HR executives on how I should think of other people’s morale and how I should manage my time properly. 

Motherfucker I’m pulling in 12 hour work a day and I don’t even have time for myself, has anyone think about me? Well to be fair I didn’t say that per se but I did say something similar to them that is more corporate friendly. HR sees this an insubordinate and actually called me out in front of my team mates and actually guilt trip me for the delay in planning these “fun” activities. 

I am so done with work and this stupid team building exercise has pushed me over the edge. I will tender my resignation once I deliver my final project leave this godforsaken place for good. I just can’t stand the gaslighting and the fake professionalism that everyone projects. 

I’m actively investing for retirement and living way below my means so that I can retire in 10 years and avoid working in corporate offices again.",False,p7h0gh,Paramore90,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p7h0gh/i_was_called_out_publicly_by_hr_for_being_a/,43,1

If this number is greater than 1 your standard of living is rising because you got more money and purchasing power. If less than 1, standard of living is declining because, despite receiving more money, the purchasing power of the currency decreased.

2315,Got laid off and pretty happy about it.,"I started a construction job about a month and a half ago. I was a pretty good apprentice. Did my work, helped where I could, didn't complain, asked thoughtful questions etc. 

Last week, my boss texted me and said that he was sorry but he had no apprentice work for me because the project was at a standstill. He referred me to another company and I honestly was up in the air on whether or not I should call them for more work. I didn't. 

Even though I was there for a little over a month I absolutely hated it. Waking up at 4:30AM, coming home and being absolutely exhausted, and a handful of aches and pain. At one point my hands were absolutely killing me to the point where I couldn't open my hand all the way. I have a history of shoulder issues and this job exacerbated it. I don't even wanna go into how my knees and feet were feeling. Lol I was also only making $17 an hour but after taxes it ended up being $12. I honestly would feel insulted on pay day because I worked so hard only to bring home $500 a week. 

I was ready to call it quits based on the way my body was feeling alone but my girlfriend said that my body would get used to it and how I worked really hard to get the job. She's not lying. I did work really hard to get the job. 

My body did become somewhat accustomed after the first couple of weeks. Things were still hurting but they hurt a lot less. Lol 

The project is supposed to be done in December so my plan was to stick it out until then and then make a decision as to whether or not I wanted to stay. Well, that decision was made for me. 

Even though I worked hard to get this job, I'm not going back. My body felt wrecked after a month and change so I could only imagine what it would be like in a couple of years if I stuck it out. 

So now I'm just chilling and walking/boarding dogs which is pretty solid.

I just had the worst conversation with someone at work, that really made me question why we do this to ourselves.

Basically my business use excel for everything, and we have complained multiple times that this information needs to be stored in a dedicated database not a random excel sheet. This is always met with the same answer which is a “we don’t have the money for that,” or “it’s working perfectly fine, it’s probably just you using it wrong.” I mean this thing is 100s of mb. It’s way too big and the macros, and formulas are so fragile. 

Whenever I have to work on it, it takes a good 10 minutes to save, and I have to work on it far too much. 

So this guy called me at work breaking down because when he tried to save it, it crashed. Losing a load of work he’d done. He wasn’t at fault, he didn’t do anything wrong but the spreadsheet was so large it just crapped out.

He spoke to me on the phone breaking down about how “stupid” he was and why hadn’t he saved it before this? He was “incompetent”?

Never once did he say that our company was shit for not having a working database. And I just consoled him and helped him get as much restored as I could all while thinking what the hell is wrong with our work culture that this is appropriate? That guy is saying he’s going to be working into the evening to fix a spreadsheet because his boss is too cheap to pay for the right system, it’s not his fault but he has to pay for it.

My regular day begins at 9 but now I wake up at 7 and head off to the park by 7-30 (it’s a 15 min commute from home but really worth it) and spend about 30-45 minutes in fresh air under the huge trees. I am lucky to live in an area that has a fairly decent and safe park around me and am making the most use of it. 

Changing my routine to start the day with something that isn’t work and is just my own time feels very refreshing. I also get a good nights sleep and waking up is no problem at all. The best part is taking a novel with me and reading for that little time so when I am back I have done something that brings me joy. That way am better prepared to take all the heat of the day from my bosses!

2350,How I retired early on min wage. with a partner at 40,"You too can retire early if you're willing to cut out excess from your life. Here's what I did:
1. Lived in a van since 18 with my gf
2. Dumpster dived for food
3. Invested all my money into index ETFs

My typical day consists of waking up in the morning and brushing my teeth (good dental hygiene saves money).
Next, I will prepare breakfast, usually comprised of thawed veggies and lentil soup. If I'm feeling fancy, I add some ground beef too. Usually this healthy stuff isn't enough for my daily caloric needs, so I will dumpster dive behind bakeries to supplement my diet. Afterwards, I go to the gym to shower and freshen up for work.

I take all the overtime shifts I can possibly get and invest my money into SPY, along with my partner who also earns min wage.

This lifestyle currently costs me around $400 a month in HCOL city, barring unexpected expenses.
With this, I've managed to save $2.3m and plan to retire using the FIRE method.

To sum it up, I think that most can do this and retire 25 years early, or even earlier really.

I will acknowledge that my SO and I have been blessed to not have any major health issues that prevented us from saving and working.",False,p6oabp,shift_key_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p6oabp/how_i_retired_early_on_min_wage_with_a_partner_at/,18,1

I've done exceptionally well, worked off the clock, true team player. I'm always helping out, chipping in, doing my best. We have one remote employee since before 2020, so should be no issue to become remote right? My coworker applied to be remote just because he wanted to. Just out of interest, purely. I have a heart condition, and have a significant other who is immune compromised so I figured I'd apply to be fully remote too....

2373,Addiction to instant gratification is a symptom of burnout caused by work,"I would estimate people have about 3 hours to themselves, roughly, during a weekday.

8 Hours sleep
8 Hours at work (low estimate,usually higher)
1 Hour/meal (cooking, eating, cleanup) if you're cooking every meal so 3 hrs cooking
2 hours commute total

So basic estimation you have about 3 hours to yourself, 3 hours to soothe the physical and/or mental strains of the work day.  This is less than 20% of your waking hours.

Because personal time is so scarce on working days, working people naturally tend towards activities that provide a large amount of relief and entertainment without much time investment.  Moreover, because the workday and time spent maintaining yourself as a worker takes up so much of the day, you have a limited amount of energy, attention, mental space to spend towards any particular activity.

This only leaves room for a particular type of activity, low time investment, low difficulty, with high returns on chemical stimulation.  Reality TV, Netflix Serials, Video Games, Online Pornography, Drug Use, etc.  All fulfill the chemical needs as best they can, and as the 8 hours of work becomes more dense with tasks over time, one looks to even leaner time investment, lower difficulty, and higher returns.

You can certainly engage yourself in other types of activities, but you sacrifice other aspects of maintaining yourself as a worker in the long term, like sleep or nutrition.

Work culture itself creates the consumption culture by profiting from your suffering at work.  By suffering at work we feed both mouths of the monster, with our labor at work, and purchasing the salves for our suffering at home.",False,p65b5x,capnbarky,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p65b5x/addiction_to_instant_gratification_is_a_symptom/,6,1

I became a notary, and go through the process of helping people sign proposals in person, pull permits, scan and send affidavits, schedule estimates, deal with customers in general etc etc etc. 

All for 12 an hour. So I wanna work part time. I don’t care if that sounds lazy. I work 5 days a week for 30 hours.

My job has asked me if I’m in school and I’ve said yes simply because I don’t want to work full time which they asked AFTER they hired me as part time. I said I have a class at 4pm and an online class.

The amount of working I’m starting to do I should be paid 16-20 at least. My boyfriend agreed with me when I told him all the stuff they’re making me do now. 

I hate lying. But for 12 an hour I don’t want to do this full time. I have ADHD. I get stressed easily. Things are harder for me and my boss has noticed that I get easily flustered and confused. 

This is a bit of a rant. But this is why I feel the 40 hour work week (let’s be serious it’s more like an average of 50-60 now for most) is bullshit.

2381,Quitting white collar work rant,"I left my job a few years ago and am just floating. All the work I have ever done, I could have easily done straight out of junior high.   

In my last role, I was with the federal government as a human rights desk officer covering several countries in Southeast Asia. Sounds great but this meant my days and occasional nights and weekends were dedicated to writing talking points, summarizing research, coordinating on the Assistant Secretary's travel plans.   Literally coordinating with other diplomats to make sure he got his favorite room at a hotel and restaurant reservations for some meetings.  And there was the soccer game he wanted arranged so he could kick the ball around with local kids in that country.  Of course I would have to share note taking duties during meetings. None of this was intellectually demanding or required specialized skills.

The work is what it is, but why require experienced people with graduate degrees to perform glorified executive assistant roles? I am not disparaging executive assistants, rather highlighting qualification inflation and creating expectations of fulfilling jobs that just aren't.

Maybe my disillusionment is more specific to foreign/public policy type work, but after having witnessed a colleague being berated during a meeting because the travel itinerary for her country was not finalized while I received praise for my travel itinerary, I decided that my forty something back aching body with graduate degrees has had enough of this ridiculousness.  I was so insulted by the work and then to be praised for being a good summarizer and travel itinerary coordinator was just extra vinegar.  I resigned with no plans.

Now I'm an older forty something with a several year gap on the resume.  Most likely will never be hired again and it terrifies me and I don't care at the same time.  I love not working in a hierarchy or performing menial tasks, but I also feel guilty for not using my knowledge for some good.

2417,Demoralizing conversation at work,"I work for a large tech manufacturing company and got my annual review for the year last week. Here is a part of the conversation that is still swirling in my head: 

Manager: Your work was so impactful that it saved the company more than $5M last fiscal year and it was featured in a presentation given by the VP of our department to the CEO. In a company of more than 2000 people employees, that’s pretty impressive. 

Me: Thanks, I have been working on this project for almost 3 years, it finally came to fruition.

Manager: Great work, we hope you can do more such work this next year. Let’s get to the good stuff, annual raises! As I was just saying, based on all the good work you have done, you have been given a rating of “Meets Expectations” and awarded a raise of 2.5%, congratulations! 

Me: (Perplexed look on my face). I thought you said I my work was highly impactful and if that kind of work makes me a “meets expectations” employee, who is the “exceeds expectations “ employee? 

Manager: don’t pay too much mind to the definitions of these ratings, I know how valuable your contributions are. 

Me: thank you, but that rating comes with a raise that is lower than how much cost of living has gone up since the last time we did this, so in all practical ways, I am actually losing money by not even getting a 3.1% raise. 

Manager: What can I tell you, the 2.5% is the average raise for the majority of people who work here. 

Me: So I guess everyone’s losing money working in these positions? 

Manager shrugs and changes topics to what he wants to work on for the next year. I zoned out feeling completely demoralized. Someone is taking all that money that was saved and it was dumb of me to think I would see a tiny fraction of that in my paycheck. And if the next year my performance is not as “impactful” they will say that I am failing to meet expectations and probably rob me of the crappy raises completely.

Why is employee engagement important?
‘When employees’ needs are met, they don’t just become “happier” — they become better performer. The end goal of our employee engagement strategy is

improved performance, not inspiring a certain feeling in employees or hitting a specific number in a survey. The 12 Elements are prove performance management
practices that can boost the outcome of individuals, tears and the entire organization.

 

 

 

 

Questions 3 through 6 are considered

 

ideal needs: That do I give?
His month let’s look at question 5: By supervisor, or someone at work, seems to care about me as a person.

Employees need to know that they are more than a number. They need to know someone is concerned about them as people first and as employees second. The

fifth element may seem like a “soft” aspect of management, but there are key payoffs when employees feel cared for in a work environment. They are more likely to
experiment with new ideas, share information and support workers personally and professionally. They are prepared to give their manager and organization the
benefit of the doubt and feel more equipped to strike a balance between their work and their personal lives. Return, they are more Likely to be advocates for their

2453,My analogy for working more than 40 hours a week,"Imagine you own a home.  If you get to the end of the month and you have some extra money, you could choose to pay down your mortgage.  This benefits you.

Now lets say you rent a home.  At the end of the month, you don't pay extra rent.  At best, the most you are going to get out of it is a high five from your landlord.  

Now imagine you own or have significant equity in a company.  If you work harder, that should translate into your equity being worth more.  This benefits you.

Now imagine you are a drone at company with a salary and no real equity.  If you work more than your 40 hours it is no different than paying extra rent at the end of the month.  You will not see the dividends of your work (this may pay off with promotions/raises, but you'll always be expected to work  those extra hours).

Im leaving my current job that pays $12.00 an hour at a bank it's not physical at all.. but I can not stand my coworkers. I'm leaving to go make $9.00 an hour at a hotel because I'd honestly rather have that than the bs. 

I'm 20f. Everyone there is 45+ years old women. It's a very gossip filled controlling work environment. Since I've been there my coworker has taken it upon herself to take my 15 minute break time first.. despite that not being on the schedule. I get there the earliest. I thought it was unfair but kept my mouth shut since I'm the new girl and the youngest no one takes me seriously. She has also never failed to make me 10-30 minutes late to lunch everyday. I already have the latest lunch hour ... 2:30.. which means sometimes I don't get lunch until 2:45 to 3:00 pm.

2460,"New Job, Same Story","Just started a new job yesterday. There weren't many red flags during the interview so I thought, ""Well, outside of this being a sales position it doesnt seem so terrible. Pay is decent(ish), only a few hours of mandatory OT. I think I can do this for a while.""

Flash forward to yesterday. Began my training and realized the employee training manual was a glut of glorified information that praised the CEO's ascent to success. The first five pages were a front and back biography of his timeline of successes, followed by pages about why ""I should be proud to call this company my home"" and how I should turn talking about what I do for a living into an opener sales pitch (outside of work) to acquire more prospective customers and how it could make me more money.

Then I found out that the punch clock software clocks us in three minutes late (on purpose) so I ""can't show up less than 7 minutes early, but not TOO early.""

Had a passing dialogue about some coworkers achieving enough sales to earn a dinner invite with the CEO, and how he actually talks to them like they're FaMiLy. Unfortunately I dont think they realized that in their sales they paid for 500 of those dinners.

Anybody else start seeing red flags AFTER the interview and onboarding? I'm going to stick with the position for as long as I can bear it because it pays okay and I'm familiar with the product, but it feels like I landed right back into a corporate cult. Really need the money, so I'm expecting to be juiced like a lemon during my stay.

As a background, I just left my old job which was easier, less hours, but I was barely breaking even on all of my bills. That, and I was often the only dude scheduled, so all traffic was my workload. There was no way to get ahead and I wasn't expecting a raise or promotion anytime in the next ten years.

2466,Overtime seems like a waste of time..,"I wanted to break down my pay after overtime, insurance, and taxes. 

I got my paystub for this upcoming week's paycheck. I get paid 13.05 hourly and 19.58 for overtime. I worked 56.5 hours this paycheck. Here is the breakdown:

&amp;#x200B;

|Gross|844.99|
|:-|:-|
|Insurance|90.94|
|Taxes|118.58|
|Overtime|322.99|
|Total (Net)|635.47|

Out of the 322.99 I made in overtime, 209.52 was taken out in insurance and taxes.. That brings my overtime payout to a whopping 113.47... over *HALF* of my overtime is gone.. 

So after working an extra 16.5 hours, I was only *PAID* roughly 6.5 hours of that.. That's almost 1/4 of my paycheck gone.. That's a quarter of my monthly income *GONE..* To my understanding, it's because each time I get overtime, my tax bracket for that paycheck goes up..

Am I just missing something here? Am I weird for thinking this is ridiculous? I know I'm paying for my insurance, but that amount still doesn't cover *every* expense. I will still have to pay for certain procedures that can cost thousands even after the insurance covers what it does..",False,p63dk1,murphywithane,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p63dk1/overtime_seems_like_a_waste_of_time/,11,1

I’ve been looking for a job for a while now, I finally got an interview at a cafe last week! It went okay, the owner didn’t really ask me anything, just how to spell my name and If I’ve made coffee before. He wanted me to come in the next day for an unpaid “try out” shift. I’m taking my exams right now, so I said I could start the next Monday, he said too bad. On the way out of the door he stops me and tells me to come in Monday anyway for that try out shift. 


I’m super relived, I’ve been looking for a job for so long and now someone is finally giving me a chance! 


Monday comes, it’s my last exam day but I finished those the day before (which was my birthday, btw) so I could get to my try out shift. I come into the cafe and he is sitting there with someone else, who doesn’t introduce himself. A woman comes into the cafe and the owner starts serving her for about 10 minutes? Chatting with her and stuff. I just stand there, trying not to look too awkward.


The woman finally leaves and this man tells me that he forgot I was supposed to come in today, that he probably isn’t going to open the cafe today and that I should just come back tomorrow. My heart dropped to my stomach. I wasted all this time I could have been working on my exam to be here, just to get told he forgot.

2500,I don't think I can go back to work. Kinda scary.,"Hi. I'm almost 60 years old and did office work with all the accompanying BS for 40 years in a series of cubicles. I played the game successfully enough, but hated it all along.  I haven't worked since 2018 due to personal stuff/deaths in family/unexpected moves/**getting fired for surfing Reddit**/taking unemployment for the past year-plus and sitting around doing not much. I do have some retirement savings, but not enough to justify stopping work. I'm single with no kids and I do live a *somewhat* self-indulgent lifestyle.  My income topped out at $60K and I was very comfortable living on that. 

Apparently, my unemployment will run out soon and I have to look for work.  The problem is ... I'm perusing all these job boards and .. every job I see, regardless of field, I think, ""Oh, hell no.""  No, no, no.  No way.  I honestly don't think I can do it anymore. Not just the cubicle stuff ... I look at retail, service or otherwise ... I just can't picture it and it makes me nervous and nauseous.  Everything in me says ""NO."" 

Work from home?  Maybe?  My past attempts at self employment proved me to be a lax boss and a lazy employee, but perhaps I've changed since then? Some say if you do something you love, you'll never work a day in your life.  My experience has been that you just end up resenting the thing you once loved.

It looks like I'll have to make some serious lifestyle changes and live on much less, perhaps. I don't expect to have a long lifespan, but one never knows.

2505,If you stop working what to do with your life ?,"So I sold a home for a large profit enabling me to buy a house morgage free in my home town age 37.

I recently quit my job and probably won't go back to my career and will have enough savings left to not need to work for quite a while in the relative short term.

I also have Bipolar disorder and could claim disability if I wanted to but have always resisted doing this as it feels like I would be writing myself off so have declined several times applying for it. 

My question is if I didn't need to work what would I do with my life?


Wouldn't it be boring ? 

Has anyone here stopped working and how do you fill your day and what activities and hobbies do you do ?

I've been currently taking my dog on 5 to 10 mile walks every day, used to do a lot of photography and will get back into it as well as exercising.

What else could I do ? 

I've always loved the idea of van life having already lived in 5 countries and 10 cities i don't know how long I can stay in one place so potentially in the future I may sell my house and travels until the money runs out.

You’re then forced into an education (brainwashing) institution before being cut loose left at the mercy of those in power. If you dare defy their rules you get locked up or worse. So you get a “job” which is something designed to keep you too tired to even think beyond the box you’ve been placed in. 

On your so called “time off” you’re fed propaganda via advertising related to consumerism so you feed more into the system yet again. You’re then brainwashed among the majority into being expected to rinse and repeat this and have children so you’re too tied down and unable to ever break free and then leave them to the same fate you have just endured. You’re then expected to “just get on with it” bow down and work away until you die quietly.

Some back story i work for a fortune 500 home improvement company as a cashier for the past 5 years and im not even sure if this post belongs here but here it goes.... Now on with my probably controversial rant.


My place of work has re-implemented their mask policy for associates, I'm aware some of you are for it and against it and thats fine, i digress. I refused to put on a mask again not because I'm anti-mask but because I'm anti-company. I think its unjust, unfair and down right greedy that this company would reinforce masks but not bring back things like covid pay, covid bonus sick time or enforce masks for customers and associates alike. 


I lurk on this subreddit a lot and see people getting hosed because they think they have covid but don't have sick time and thats obviously wrong if you think you have covid with clear symptoms you shouldn't be in the store nor punished for leaving. Well long story short I've been put on administrative leave despite being fully vaccinated and honestly its whatever. I was being paid under company minimum wage ($14/hr instead of $15/hr) i was constantly treated with nothing shirt of disrespect with no advancement opportunities no matter how much work, time, energy i put in, it was quite frankly a dead end. 


I just wanna say that companies want to pretend they care about their associates when really they don't. I have personally witness this and I'm sure some of you at least also have. If they truly thought covid cases are rising and becoming a serious problem again they should also have reinstated policies i mentioned above but they didn't... i appreciate those that read this and i understand if you don't agree with me, leave negative comments, or downvote me just please understand as to why i did this.and hopefully see how wrong companies like mine are, again thank you all you're and awesome community!

Someone crying? Kid got hurt? Someone looks lost? I'd stop to ask if I could help. 

But now? Now, I do nothing but work. Being on time is more important than anything or anyone else. My family's entire ability to survive depends on me working, even though we're still drowning and barely hanging on. 

I saw someone had left an electronic devise on a bus stop bench on my way back to work. The good person I used to be told me to turn around, pick it up, leave a note with my contact information, protect it till the owner called. But I didn't... I had to get back to work...

Like I should be pushing myself and making less time for myself and my family to secure a spot with the company since I'm a temp. It's not technically a bad job. There's upsides, like being at home (great for taking care of a young puppy). 


But I wonder if I actually want the job anyway. So I'm trying something new. Being an entrepreneur is scary. But I'm doing a side hustle and trying to start a podcast. It's hard but actually enjoyable. Even if I never had to work, it's something I would still do for fun. 


There has to be something better than being guilted into doing more work for the same pay or no pay at all. Having people call and yell at you for stuff that has nothing to do with you. Being where I don't want to be when I could be working on other things. I'm tired of begging for time off. Or to lose out on pay for a holiday. I don't get holiday pay or PTO right now.. I want to be self determined. I hate begging and resume writing. I want to make my own hours and not this crazy 8 to 5 Monday to Friday nonsense. My friend is a nurse who got another job recently. During training she did 5 days a week. She complained to me that she never wants to do that again and how horrible that was doing it for 3 weeks. I've been doing it for years for different places.

I hate how we’re made to work so much. During the week most of us don’t have time to do anything else, because we’re tired and still got chores to do. People working a lot always say how it’s for the future, to ensure a good future. But what about now?

We give our best years to working, so what? So we’d have time when we’re retired? You know what my grandma did once she retired? Fucking nothing, because over the years her health became so bad her heart condition doesn’t even allow her to get a fucking massage. She worked years, and doesn’t even get a pension that could allow her to do anything but barely get by.. This is the future I’m supposed to look forward to?

Besides you don’t know how long you’re going to live. You could get into an accident at any moment, people die, get sick and become disabled every day for so many unexpected reasons. Your family could also die.

And what’s ironic, is that when someone dies, what do people say? ‘I wish I had more time with them.’ But you did. It’s just that our current work culture made you spend countless hours at work and not with the people you love. How many parents have you heard say that they wish they could have more time with their kids, but instead they’re working because they need to provide and everything’s so expensive, while the wages stay low? How many parents are missing out on their kids growing up and not bonding as close as they wish to?

I’m not against work. I’m against the amount of work we’re supposed to do, while our best years are flying by and we can’t enjoy them as much as we should. I’m against being a fucking slave to companies that don’t give a flying fuck about us. I’m against having to make work the center of my life for my whole life. I’m against sacrificing myself, my health, my life for a job. We get one life, our close ones get one life, we don’t know how long we have left, but we can’t do shit about the work culture. Companies love to say how they’re all into letting their employees have work-life balance, but that’s just not true. It’s not a balance if 5 out of 7 days of my week are dedicated to work only. And it’s not like for the two days I can do nothing – I have to do chores, I couldn’t do during the week because I didn’t have time for them.

Yes, there are people who are fortunate and they love their work or have money, or whatever, but that’s just not the case for most of us. I hate that this is my life and it’s going to be because it’s forced on us.",False,p5d8u5,mnlxyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p5d8u5/work_frustration_rant/,3,1

Homelessness is the threat that bosses and landlords use to force you to work. The persistent reminder that you are two paychecks away from being out on the streets. And then where will you be? Homeless people get cleared away by the cops and get robbed by people passing by. Houseless people don't own property but Displaced Persons have Displacers.

Not to mention that if we were all promised a dedicated place to live and food to eat, we could turn our collective attention to correcting the climate crisis. All the big manufacturing corporations would have to do is reduce plastic production like they should have done decades ago and enthusiastic volunteers could handle the rest. It is not our fault we are all to busy and too tired to clean up their mess. We are too busy scrounging to survive to organize and they cultivated this outcome on purpose. 

I'm trying to reach out where I can. The anonymity of the internet helps and doesn't help simultaneously. I know I have allies, I just don't know where they are. I want to protect them and myself from trolls and belligerent attacks but how can I reach out and stay shielded at the same time?

Sorry about the tangent. But action must be taken and protests just get shut down so I'm trying to come at the problem from another angle. I'm not scared of hard work and I can't argue with every idiot but I can certainly stare down the world's problems and roll up my sleeves.

I kindly told him to fuck off and that I needed at least 4 days home to get situated and make sure my wife was well enough to care for the baby before I came back to work. Well now I’m back at work and I’ve been contemplating walking out all morning. I can’t take this shit I need freedom!

2629,What's the end goal here?,"I'm not even sure this belongs here so delete if not allowed. 

I sometimes browse this sub with somewhat rose tinted glasses with an idea of being able to give up work and just live my life. I have been happier in lockdown being paid furlough than I have ever been in my living memories. Returning to work has got me thinking though. 

With the rapid steps of automation and ever advancing AI technology, what's the end goal for the human race? Not just the rich that have multiples of employees that rake in the cash but us, the 'front line' workers and the people who have no interest in being rich but just want to be free? 

For instance, McDonald's UK employs around 120,000 people, if by this time next year, the whole operation of McDonald's becomes automated, why is it those employees should be made jobless and have to go in to there next chapter? If McDonald's manage full automation, what's stopping every other food chain? Before you no it that's 250,000 - 500,000 jobs easily vanished and there wages straight into owners pockets. 

Why has there not been and why isn't there some kind of party that will support any members of an industry that becomes a victim of automation? And it's not just the food industry but building trades, retail etc. Surely we should be rising up to make these ex employees allowed to be given a continued wage by whoever is outsourcing there job until the age of retirement? Perhaps it should be known as the freedom package? You can choose to either get a new job in a different profession or continue to live your life 'employed' by your employer that outsourced your role to AI with a 'freedom package' agreement. Kind of like Garden Leave? 

To me it feels like 'The working class' is just another form of slavery. Perhaps we need to start thinking about freeing them and giving some quality of life after there time has come. It's more of a heavy hitter when someone has worked a proffesion for 20-30 years to then be outsourced.

He gets home from work and passes out. He’s stressed and exhausted all the time, and he talks a lot about dying by the time he’s 30, because he says he can’t imagine doing this day in and day out for the rest of his life. I love him so much and I’m scared for him and I hate to see him beaten down like this and I’m so fucking angry. I’m still in school and working part time, and I’m terrified of graduating because I know I’ll have to endure the same thing and I can see it killing him. I want to kiss him and hold him and tell him I love him and he deserves better, but he falls asleep at his desk choking back tears and wakes up before me to go do it all again the next day. It makes me fucking furious to see what this system is doing to someone I love so much, and I want to burn it all down.",False,p57q55,redreclinercat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p57q55/i_miss_my_boyfriend/,11,1
2644,"Work genuinely makes me feel suicidal, and I don’t know what to do.","21 F here. Working at a makeup store. I have severe anxiety &amp; that makes me overwork myself to please my employer.

I also get sick multiple times per month (this has happened since I was little) &amp; cannot afford a doctor’s note. Which often results in bosses forcing me to work by threatening termination.

I feel so trapped.

Backstory: a couple months ago my boyfriend and I wanted to leave our toxic small town. We moved to a big city with lots of opportunity. We got retail jobs next to each other to make commuting easier.

I have such a nice team of coworkers, and my managers are so understanding. So why do I want to quit? Why do I want to sabotage what I’ve set up for myself? Because I physically cannot take the pressure of working.

In the same way I couldn’t handle sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day, I cannot handle working for 8 hours

My friends and family are all hard working, and when I bring this up to them they usually say something like “well it’s something we all have to do” or “have you asked yourself why you hate doing work so much?” Or “find what motivates you to get up in the morning!”

My boyfriend is extremely sweet and understanding about this, but I still feel guilty putting so much pressure on him to work when I can’t.

Sorry if this is all over the place… long story short: I have a shift in 6 hours but instead of sleeping i’m having a meltdown trying to figure out a way to not want to die. Life is so short, I just want to spend my rent money on supplies for a business tomorrow and quit.

We’re then told the supervisors have been told it’s up to them if their employees come in. So, supervisor asked us, do we want to go in at all? Makes sense; the office hasn’t had everyone in in a few weeks due to any symptoms resembling COVID keeping people away.

Him and coworker talked for about 20 minutes about workspaces and commutes and all that. Coworker says he’ll come in part time and keep remote-location supervisor in the loop.

“No.”

Like most, I got into healthcare to feel satisfied with what I do for money. To feel like I was making a difference. Helping people. 

The truth couldn’t be more opposite. Healthcare workers are exploited so that the huge companies can make billions. Turnover is outrageous as people are desperate to find a facility that isn’t going to work them to death. Publicly, they call us heroes. Day to day we are overworked, underpaid, emotionally, physically, and psychologically abused. 

I won’t make this too long but I just can’t believe the lengths these companies will go to wring every penny out of patients using the blood, sweat and tears of its employees.

I hear people call working, slavery, because you have to work to survive? but by that logic is every animal ever born a slave,  each animal has to do tons of hard work to get enough food, find a mate, raise children (if its that kind of animal), so my question is, what is the expectation for human life? I always make analogues to the animal world as that helps me make sense of things, so it sounds like people want the life of a pet animal, who doesn't really do anything. But wouldn't that be boring? If all your needs are always provided for? Personally I think id prefer being a wild wolf with a lower life expectancy , then a dog stuck in an apartment all day, with all these amazing amenities, that it takes for granted and cant appreciate anymore.

2661,Reflections on the Lost American Dream,"Sitting at my nanny job while the toddler sleeps. 

I am over the American ideal of ""success"". 
The idea of staying in a job and having no control of my days off, vacation, or where and when I work makes me want to curl up and die.

The American Dream is lost on me. 

I want to make my schedule.
I want to take breaks and see the world.
I want multiple streams of income. 

I don't feel that healthcare and retirement are even attractive perks for me. 

I would rather pay my own catastrophic plan and invest my extra time in exercise, meditation, yoga, cannabis, and cooking for myself. 

I don't think the world will be livable by the time I reach retirement, so why buy into a company's 401k when they can yeet me at any time for any reason? No. I'm investing in myself. And maybe a Roth IRA that no one can take away from me. 

Being beholden to PTO approval and public holidays makes me panic.  Why should some incompetent middle manager get to decide when I can have time off? 

I'm a strong leftist , but I feel that this oppressive culture is pushing me to have to fend for myself because no employer gives a damn about retaining talent anymore. 
They don't care about your well being, you are just a tool. 
A tool to be used until you are ragged and must be thrown away. 
Fast fashion employment. The revolving door.
 Fuck that shit

I am not lazy, I have so much energy and ideas to invest in things that align with my ethics and values. 

I am no longer being a captive tho. 

I will no longer live to work. 

I will take control, even though it's scary.

I will live life on my terms , not HR's 

I will liberate as many as will come w me.

2672,The only good cover letter I've read in my entire life,"Dear Company,

I've lived most of my life eating food, living under the roof
of a house, drinking clean water, and even getting in a little
television watching. To provide these vital needs to myself
within the parameter of the capitalist system I’ve found
myself born into, I require money to do so.

Your company provides a position that would allow me the
opportunity to make money, doing something I have the
skilled and know how to accomplish, which will allow me to
meet my needs and survive in the face of an increasingly
bleak future and difficult economic system.

Your position as holders of wealth and owners of production
currently has you in the beneficial position of persuading me,
practically forcing me, to have to ask you to work for you, in
order to stay alive.

Your company providing that for me, is enough to keep me
on board as any job is preferable to starvation and
hopelessness, and if you provide me enough money to live,
(pretty please, thank you very much) I’ll do the job for you
for as long as I can.

I’m afraid to ask... Are they basically letting companies getting away with paying workers below minimum wages? Btw no it isn’t a job where workers are tipped.

2692,What i think about Hustle Culture?,"Fair warning, I'm a guy that is in between minimum wage jobs, I don't have one right now and currently living with my parents. So just if you're reading this and I'm think I'm a loser, I have to agree with you. You don't have to read the rest of this post. I just wanted to get this of my chest.

What I think about Hustle culture? Its selling hope, hope that you will succeed if you just work hard, build yourself more. And maybe, just maybe you'll finally get your millions to buy the things you always wanted in life.

What they don't tell you, I mean the media, news outlets, youtube, reddit, instagram, twitter, basically everything. Is that you, the average joe or jane, most likely won't get there. Why? Its simple logic. In a game, there's always winner and losers. And more often than not, there are more losers than winners. The more successful the winner, the bigger the pool of losers. You'll never hear from them, well because their losers.

If everyone is successful, no one is. Not everyone can be millionaires, you need a lot of poor people to have little millionaires.

The same thing can be said with the job market today. Way back then, you didn't need a college degree to succeed, or have a stable life and family. Now that the whole market is filled with college degrees, college degrees have become a minimum requirement for most high paying jobs. Eventually there will come a time when masters degrees are the new minimum requirement.

What these people who promote hustle culture have one thing in common, they sell you hope in a continuous loop. The people on YouTube who promote hustle culture sell you hope in pieces so that if you fail, which most likely you will, you will come back to their channel and continue watching the videos that they make. 

Its a continuous cycle of failing-&gt;hustle culture videos-&gt;failing-&gt;hustle culture videos that they want you to experience. Eventually some people like me decide it isn't worth it anymore and drop out. In which we become the prime example of being a loser, and everyone else should work harder unlike us, thereby passively continuing the hustle culture. 

But why does everybody promote this? Well because whether you're working for someone or owning a  business. You most likely have to pay taxes. Taxes means higher income for the government, which stimulates the economy. It also means bigger bailouts for billionaires, and whoever is the 1% at the time. 

And since most of us are not at the top or the middle we will continue to work till our body breaks down. This also forces us to seek expensive medical attention later which costs money which also stimulates the economy. Debt is also good for the economy.

Now I am not saying you will not succeed if you work hard. You just might just succeed to move yourself up to the middle or upper class if you try hard enough.

But don't beat yourself up thinking that its sorely your fault if you fail despite trying. People get burnout , which can sometime lead to laziness like me. Not everyone can be winners, its just how the world works.",False,p4v4iu,Crafty_Ad8665,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p4v4iu/what_i_think_about_hustle_culture/,4,1

2695,A real life analogy for how life favors the rich,"Don't take this wrong, it's not a humble brag. But it's something I've noticed about upvotes. I was on reddit for a long time,  I'd get an upvote or two here and there, if I got a few more all at once that was nice. Then one night I said some simple thing in passing and when I woke up the next day I had a lot. Well hell ngl that made me feel good, but mostly I just say stuff that matters to me or trying to help or whatever.

But then as a couple years have gone by, I've said maybe a few more things that people liked but what I've noticed is that now it's a steady trickle, even if I don't comment for ages or get downvoted or whatever. It's just from the past.

 And that is *exactly* like rich people's money. I mean I knew it before in theory but it never happened to me because I make minimum wage and my bank account only ever gets smaller lol. They have this big amount and no matter what they do on any given day it gets bigger.

2698,Avoid being a city mail carrier for the USPS,"Today was my breaking point. I began training to be a city mail carrier for the USPS in early July, but in mid August, I've had all I can take. 

If you not familiar with this position, you basically drive to various blocks in the city, park and walk a loop. You can walk up to 14 miles a day.

Now that in itself isn't bad, but when you have one day off a week that could magically disappear, it doesn't make better. Nor does getting done with a long day of work, looking forward that date with a beautiful girl only to be told to go and deliver more shit... 

The pay is good, but I probably could make a decent amount money in an easier office job and still have a work life balance.

I was also told to not talk about my interest and moving into an office position, because some may not take kindly to me not working myself to death...

I use to think that being a mail carrier would be better than working for Jeff Bezos, but the USPS has a Amazon Day, and I kid you not, that's my easiest day of the week other than the day I'm off... Luckily, people at my former minimal effort minimum wage job still like me, so that's where I'm going until I get an office job... I will get me one of those cozy office jobs or die trying.

Residential MFT Therapist,"I'm a therapist working at a residential treatment center for teens... teens have been impacted by the lockdowns more than anyone and its amazing to try to help them get their lives back on track. The problem is the cost cutting management and backbiting employees. They offer such low wages that they attract the bottom of the barrel and routinely ""fail"" to do the background checks and drug testing that I had to go through. The toxic and understaffed environment caused most of the good people to quit and only the insane and those with something to hide have been sticking around for the jobs like medical assistant etc... 

This leads to a bizarre environment of people completely unqualified to be working with mental ill teens forming cliques and creating toxic environments of gossip and reporting innocent things to management. Things like buying the kids a board game or getting them a bottle of water on a outing...  If these lazy fucking greedy management paid living wages for people with student debt/sunk education costs then the place could be amazing but instead its a pit of gossiping vipers where the teens are treated as dogs to be ordered around. They get 800$ per day per kid but the majority of that goes the CEO's private jet (real thing) and the inflated salaries of the few at the top. It's impossible to do good in an environment whos main purpose is greed...

I have two offers for other positions that I’m certain I would prefer. I’ve only been at this job for about one month, and I cannot fathom working two more weeks after giving a notice. It’s not worth the pay by any means.

2738,“I actually enjoy firing people y’know…”,"The words of my new manager on the first day of a new job. 

A bit of backstory. I posted on here a couple months back, celebrating the fact that I’d finally plucked up the courage to quit my shitty call centre job, a job that had basically ruined my mental health to the point where I couldn’t sleep or eat properly. 

After a blissful two months of unemployment, I found a job that would (on paper) allow me shorter hours, in a far less demanding role. 

Unfortunately I’ve ended up in the exact same situation. The first red flag was the fact that my training had been completely messed up, and my actual start date hadn’t been confirmed. 

It basically meant I started a job without proper training (including Covid-related formalities required before I could even step foot in store). I wasn’t told what my break entitlements were, and it turned out they’d ignored my availability, and put me down for a 40 hour shift pattern without any consultation. 

It also turned out that my manager had broken company policy by having me in-store before the official company induction. They were expecting me to lie to my training instructors, and omit the fact that I’ve been working in store for two days before I was even allowed. 

Finally, earlier today, it turns out my scheduled days of next week were completely wrong, so all of the plans I’ve made outside of work now have to be cancelled. 

The title of the post is in reference to a conversation my manager had with me on my first day. His words were “no offence, but you mean nothing to me and I actually love firing people”. Naturally my first impression of this man is anything but positive. 

Sufficed to say, I feel like a complete twat, and this company has taken absolute liberties with me from day one. I’m already looking for other work, but I’m not sure I can manage yet another sleepless night. I’m considering arriving tomorrow at 8.30 and just quitting on the spot. 

I hope I make the right decision tomorrow - I know I should be putting my mental health first, but unfortunately corporate conditioning is putting those seeds of doubt in the back of my head, and I’m worried those doubts will prevent me from doing the right thing. 

I’ve already put aside a month’s rent, and the rest of this month is also paid, so I know things will be fine, if a little tight. 

Wise sages of this sub, I think I need some words of encouragement - should I quit tomorrow or should I try and stick it out until I’ve at least secured another job?",False,p4jk2i,HouseRajaryen,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p4jk2i/i_actually_enjoy_firing_people_yknow/,15,1

2747,"Sports are a dumb-ass metaphor for jobs, please let us enjoy them without weaponizing them against us","Simon Biles’ display of strong boundaries at the Olympics and the punditry shit-storm that followed shows that, unsurprisingly, hustle culture is alive and well in sports.   Any hot take I might have about this would be the millionth you’ve seen. 

I also [won’t be the first](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/sport-metaphors/487433/) to argue that sports as are generally an [idiotic analogy](https://reneebranson.blog/2019/08/26/lets-call-a-time-out-on-sports-analogies-its-bad-for-well-being-and-isnt-great-for-business-either/) for jobs.  But since the motif gives work-humpers such a hard-on, and the Olympics have brought the usual crop of articles telling you how [athletes’ hustle is just like yours](https://www.hecticapp.com/blog/6-freelance-lessons-learned-from-olympic-athletes), let’s again punt the notion straight to hell.

***For starters, sports are winner-take all--the slightest advantage is the difference between glory or total ruin.  99% of jobs are much more forgiving.***

When Bill Belichick imposes the tyranny of “Do Your Job” upon Patriots players, it’s because only one team gets to win the Super Bowl.  In other areas of life, the second (or 26th)-best can still live large.  Ask the bosses at White Castle or any other also-ran fast food.  (BTW, you could also ask any worker at McDonald’s how being #1 is working out for them)

***Sports require you to focus your best energy on a relatively short performance.  Most jobs require long periods of “good enough.”***

Yes, Jordan practiced hard, but he was building up to maybe a handful of critical 48-minute moments each year.  Forgive me if I’m not using Jordan-flu-game focus to attack my 8th meeting of the day, for the 10,000th day in a row. 

***Many sports reward a hyper-competitive “mean streak” which blows up in your face in any other context***

I’ve seen more than one person annihilate their good will among coworkers by trying to bring “needed intensity” into the building.  Try treating your fellow shippers at FedEx the way Michael Jordan treated his teammates and tell me how it goes. 

***Most of all:  sports are awe-inspiring and fulfilling activities worth putting your all into, while most jobs suck ass and aren’t worth more than the bare minimum***

I’d like to appreciate crazed athletic overachievers without worrying that a middle manager is going to make my life miserable by aping them to satisfy his authoritarian impulses. 

To the cottage industry of ex-athletes writing books about management, or pitching sports as teaching children the “values” (i.e. tolerance of blowhard exploiters) to succeed at work: I know you have to maintain your lifestyle, but for the love of God, take pity on the rest of us. ",False,p4cwow,TooMuchAmerica,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p4cwow/sports_are_a_dumbass_metaphor_for_jobs_please_let/,5,1

Why do they want to get you back to work? Well they already collected the tax and they want to keep it. They want to keep the money that you paid in to unemployment ins. And they would like you and everyone to believe if you are not currently selling your soul that you are lazy and a drag on society.  Fuck that!

Fuck your political affiliation, it is the number one driving factor in splitting us apart to forget about what our real issues are. Sure those issues like gun rights, abortion, and immigration are important… but they are not nearly as important as the thing that really unite us all,  that we all forget about because we have been conditioned to become reactive and passionate about things that don’t really matter that much and defend something we’re made to believe we should be defending. Really take the time to think about it, none of it matters as much as the pay you bring home, the hours spent working away from your family and friends, the lack of benefits you and your family receive, the hours your expected to work unpaid, the list goes on and on. I’m tired of everyone self identifying as Trump or Biden supporters,  progressives, socialists, tea party, moderates, etc. just stop because beating that dead horse isn’t getting us anywhere. So I say this with the utmost respect for you because you need to hear this… leave your former political party belief system at the door, break free from the shackles of how someone else told you to think, don’t let them put you in a box, you have the ability to think freely so don’t let some politician or the media tell you what’s important for your life. The next time someone asks you what your political affiliation is you should tell them it’s r/antiworkaction and when they ask what that is you tell them it’s about uniting a divided country over what really matters and affects our everyday lives. We will take action on our grievances against this broken system, we will unite and not allow frivolous bullshit to divide so they can concur, and we will rise to the occasion because frankly people, we have no other option. So, please join us over on r/antiworkaction no matter what party you affiliated yourself with before, you are welcome here. Let’s move forward together, as one workin class movement! We are the biggest group of people in this country. Let’s demand more for ourselves not only because we want these things, but because we deserve them!

2774,"I feel like a slave, without freedom and having to work everyday and with no hope of better days"," 

first i loved this group you really have a great vision of reality ..

i live in brazil i will turn 22 on august 18, i live in a favela the conditions here are horrible, i have the drug dealers to worry i am afraid of being robbed every minute, i am afraid of a gunman, i am afraid of the police (Yes, the police here steal money from residents and often beat residents or arrest them simply because they want to).

but then you must be wondering if you are in this horrible situation so go to work, the answer is you don't have a job the unemployment rate in brazil is very high the official is 14 but this is a lie the government lies a lot the number is much higher , so since you don't have a job then go study to get a job also you don't have a job and colleges are very expensive and the vacancies that the government offers for free are very few and even so those who get these vacancies are the rich because the parents are the ones who there's money to prepare the child for the test since childhood to not pay for college and among the poor who don't have quality schools we hardly get a place, but ok you managed to graduate and now right now you don't have a job that's right I'll leave a subject Here from a man who graduated in engineering and graduated in the united states and now delivers curricula at the lighthouse because he doesn't have a job in the area.

half the Brazilian population lives on 200 dollars a month or less and only 1 percent that's right 1 percent of the population earns 5,334, if for you who live in the united states/canada 1st world countries the condition is difficult for us who live in countries of 3 world the condition is inhuman...

I don't want a luxury life I don't want a mansion I just want my freedom I just want it wake up in the morning Don't worry if I'll have money to buy food or not I want it wake up in the morning Don't worry if I'll make it Pay the rent or if I'm going to be evicted and have to live on the street, I just want to be able to buy new clothes when I need it and have the money, I want to wake up in the morning and not have to work every day, and for the situation to stay still worse, my 53 year old mother also has to work every day and it's horrible for you to look at your mother to see her suffering every day and you can't do anything is a horrible situation.

I'm a survivor. Many schoolmates or children in jail are dead or are drug users, these battles I've already won but the financial battle is killing me I live near the beach but I can't go to the beach because even the money to go It will be missed, I'll leave the links here, the case of the engineer with a graduate degree in the United States who can't find work and another showing how much Brazilians earn

if anyone can, contact me so i can get a job offer in canada so i can get out of this prison named poverty in brazil, any job will do, it can be any job

I know this is an international movement, so I don’t want to discount that by making this statement but this is being said specifically for my American brethren.  Fuck your political affiliation, it is the number one driving factor in splitting us apart to forget about what our real issues are. Sure those issues like gun rights, abortion, and immigration are important… but they are not nearly as important as the thing that really unite us all,  that we all forget about because we have been conditioned to become reactive and passionate about things that don’t really matter that much and defend something we’re made to believe we should be defending. Really take the time to think about it, none of it matters as much as the pay you bring home, the hours spent working away from your family and friends, the lack of benefits you and your family receive, the hours your expected to work unpaid, the list goes on and on. I’m tired of everyone self identifying as Trump or Biden supporters,  progressives, socialists, tea party, moderates, etc. just stop because beating that dead horse isn’t getting us anywhere. So say this with the utmost respect for you because you need to hear this… leave your former political party belief system at the door, break free from the shackles of how someone else told you to think, don’t let them put you in a box, you have the ability to think freely so don’t let some politician or the media tell you what’s important for your life. The next time someone asks you what your political affiliation is you should tell them it’s r/antiworkaction and when they ask what that is you tell them it’s about uniting a divided country over what matters and affects our everyday lives. We will take action on our grievances against this broken system, we will unite and not allow frivolous bullshit to divide so they can concur, and we will rise to the occasion because frankly people, we have no other option. So, please join us over on r/antiworkaction no matter what party you affiliated yourself with before, you are welcome here. Let’s move forward together, as one workin class movement! We are the biggest group of people in this country. Let’s demand more for ourselves not only because we want these things, but because we deserve it!

I’m pretty sure it was all work related. He came back unfortunately based on his own decision. After a short period of time he is back to his old self. He still isn’t healthy. I can see and hear it in his voice.

I’ve told him so many things I’ve learned over the years and some of the amazing quotes I’ve learned off /antiwork. Nothing seems to help. I swear he is mentally ill pushing himself so hard. Being accountable when others aren’t and working hours to fill the gaps of others. It sickens me to see him do this to himself. 

I know I shouldn’t be so upset because I’m also in the same sinking boat as him with my health due to work related stress and putting work before health.

I’m at my wits end. I’m at the point where the only thing that may help is for me to stop helping him at work. Me being accountable to him I think is only helping him work harder.

2787,How do I break my conditioning? Vent,"My dad taught me the value of hard work.  I still hold those values but I'm being exploited.

I took a job in December that was supposed to be M-F 10 hour shifts.  I accepted these terms and I am ok with 50 hours per week.  But of course, when I got out of training I was told Saturdays are mandatory and I couldn't leave each day until all my assigned tickets were done which often takes 12+ hours to do.  The more productive I am, the more tickets they give me.  I average 65 - 70 hours per week.

I got a job offer last month that was ""guaranteed"" no more than 50 hours per week and $2 per hour less.  I didn't want the hourly cut and I'm not sure I even trust that guarantee but I just can't keep working 65+ so I gave my boss the ultimatum.  I pointed out that my productivity is above average and I have zero mistakes on my record.  And that the client actually likes me (they don't seem to like anyone).  Of course he implied that I was lazy, saying things like ""your coworkers carrying your load"" and ""you don't even have a family"".  Yes, I'm 35 and I don't have a family and I never will if I keep working these hours.  Grudgingly, he agreed to give me every other Saturday off if I stayed.  Its still more than I want to work, but at least I don't have to take a $2/hr pay cut so I accepted it.

I'm now sitting at home on my 2nd Saturday off in 8 months feeling GUILTY!  Why am I feeling guilty, feeling like a lazy piece of shit.  What's wrong with me!?

2794,My internship experience as part of my education [loooong rant],"I just needed to vent about this. Sorry about the super long post, might be a lil disjointed. 

I'm studying engineering in polytechnic, currently in an internship semester, where students have a choice to go source for a company and get $800 a month or stay in-house working on a project of our choosing for zero dollars. Working hours for both are 0800 to 1730 on weekdays for 22 weeks. 

$800 might as well be nothing, plus the school grades your impact/outcome based on your contributions in your internship period. Seeing as a random company aren't guaranteed to have meaningful projects to work on (students usually end up at start-ups, and we know how well those go) so I opted for the in-house option. 

This probably was the right decision in hindsight, my friend went with an outside company and they got him doing menial tasks and fixing xerox printers. In 2021. What's he gonna write in his report..?

Anyway, the project I was assigned to was hella unorganised, the previous batch of student interns were trusted to document their progress and come up with manuals on how to operate the machines, areas of improvement, etc. And the current batch was just given a crash course by the former interns (the ones who showed up anyway) and left there with no supervision. The project supervisors are often doing lectures or whatever it is they're so busy with and only visit for 10 minutes maybe once a week. 

Ok. My school's pretty big on the whole ""self-learning"" thing so I guess we'll just pull ourselves up by the bootstraps and whatnot. We dealt with automation, my station had conveyors, assembly lines, and robot arms, I learnt what I could, programmed the PLC, robot control, though the real engineers would come in if I ran into something I couldn't do. 

But there wasn't always something to do, I'm pretty confident with PLC programming and could eventually finish most tasks quickly. Then it's counting hours for the day, at one point, the 20 year-old pneumatic compressor supplying air to my station broke and I was left with even less to fill my time. I had the longest days of my life during this semester. 

Fast-forward multiple weeks and a merciful (for us) lockdown caused by Covid spikes, and I'm in my last week of internship, they fixed the compressor, I finished my work, my station is fully autonomous, reports and documentation done. I did everything I needed to ahead of schedule. 

My batch must've been hardworking because the director decided he wanted to meet all the in-house interns across all projects, he said his thanks and whatever, ""We hope you will continue your learning journey and come back to work on your respective projects. Projects are never done"", ""To show our appreciation, we'll be providing free lunch for today"", yada yada yada. 

Through the session, I was left wondering what a school director's does for their job, that they could take the time to do this, I could be watching anime in my lab. It was my last day anyway, but wait, there's more. 

The director and management board decided they wanted to see our group's project in-person, out of all the others. And they would greatly appreciate if we could come back next week for a demo (I doubt they'll be providing free lunch this time). 

I feel like they don't respect the students' time, we were forced to skip our holidays and work for you, without pay, while other students were on holiday, we were coming back 0800 to 1730. And now on our last day, you want us to come back and personally show you our work? Couldn't have read our reports, watched the videos that showed the operation processes, anything besides stealing more of our off-time? 

This just reeks of shit, I had to quit my part-time video-editing job to for this internship, I had to solve every problem that arose myself. 22 weeks for a $6 lunch set, like paying your interns isn't a sign of appreciation. 

The other interns in my project group didn't seem affected, but they defo should be. Fuck the director and his nothing job, the management board can manage deez nuts. 

My internship is finished, give me my grade and I'll enjoy my life with 22 weeks I'll never get back.",False,p55t1t,OppenheimerEXE,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p55t1t/my_internship_experience_as_part_of_my_education/,4,1

This is affecting my body and mental health, for which i have underlying conditions that given me partial disability in my home country.

2830,My boss has unrealistic expectations,"Hello,

It's been a year since I've been recruited as a ""digital marketing specialist"" (I'll explain later why I'm using this job title) to build a new marketing department that never existed before (company is +10 years old and provides custom ERP solutions) with accountability for :

1. Lead generation : I've generated 13 leads (+10k € projects) in 3-4 months using LinkedIn networking. They couldn't sign any of them, hell they couldn't even sign their own leads (red flag ?)

2. Developed a communication strategy focusing on social media, but ended up being just LinkedIn.

2. Redesigned the website (sitemap, wireframes, adobe xd prototypes, wrote all contents, managed the outsourced development...).

3. Developed an email marketing strategy and plan. They said the budget I'm asking for is too much :)

4. Created and hosted industry-focuced webinars. Tried working on a podcast but my boss said I'm not paying you to waste your time on that 

5. Worked closely with developers to improve UX and produced design prototypes for future produt developments. All my proposals were rejected on the basis of ""our development environment doesn't support such advanced functionalities...""

I can go on and on, but I did all this with a 116$ budget!

 Yes, you've read that right! And it was used to pay the freelancer that created the website using elementor lol.

Earlier this week, my boss calls me for a little meeting with the sales director who complains that I'm not generating enough leads, and they went on to say I need to provide at least 2-3 leads per week (wtf). I listened and listened, then said I need an actual budget to launch linkedin ads among other things. My boss then said he recruited me because I'm a ""specialist"" and I was supposed to find solutions and went on to say that he was expecting more from LinkedIn networking and keeps bringing up my salary as part of the marketing budget.

Excuse me If I'm wrong, but do they think I'm a scout boy selling cookies? it's ERP systems ffs. I started doubting myself, am I underperforming or are they gaslighting me? Idk what to think anymore as I always end up feeling it's my fault. I'm job hunting but wasn't that successful.

I should also pinpoint that this is my first experience in a B2B environment.

You don't want to do it. Every second you're working it feels like you're being forced to do something against your will. Your mind can't even think of other things, you can't even zone out and imagine you're doing something else- you have to focus and work. 

You can't even escape into fantasies and daydreams, you have to be in that place and do those boring and joyless tasks for hours and hours every day.

Obviously, this isn't the case for everybody. Some people don't take hate every second as much. But some, like me, absolutely dread every second of wageslaving.

2881,This is kinda ridiculous.,"Since the pandemic started, I’ve applied to some jobs, got offers, and turned them down. I felt guilty at times, but then I realized it’s easier to just do hobbies and actually experience daytime sunlight (haven’t since I was like four) while earning basically the same money passively and with zero risk of losing that income.

And what makes me mad is I realized I haven’t actually enjoyed a weekday in the sun—nay, at all—since I was like four. It’s always been a guilty sick day from school/work or a vacation where I’m stressed about my job.

And if I’d been employed, I would’ve continued with this toxicity for the rest of my working life until retirement. How sad is that?

It feels so good to go outside, bask in the sun, feel the grass on your feet and the breeze on your skin and hair. No worries. No obligations. No borrowed time from an employer nor school. Just you existing and enjoying the limited time you have on Earth.

I was ready to tell them that I'd be accepting the job offer, but my boss wanted to keep me here so much, that I took that leverage and requested a 4 day work week, same pay/benefits. I would take a shorter work week without a pay raise any day, over a pay raise with same/higher workload. (Of course, I'm grateful that I'm in a spot to turn down extra money for that perk.) 

In the end, we negotiated 1 day WFH per week with an added \~4% immediate pay raise. And I know my boss well enough to know that day won't be strictly policed, so it's basically a free day at home. I definitely feel like this is a win. Hopefully this will pave the way for more WFH within the company, or possibly even shorter work weeks in the future.

2893,I quit a job that almost made me kill myself,"Hi Reddit! I'm glad I found this subreddit so I have a place to vent about this. 

I've been working at this company for 3 years now (casual). I was desperate for work back then and took what I could get. I became good at what I did  (front shop pharmacy ), and for 3 years I put work before myself, worked harder and harder everyday for R50 an hour, converted thats $3.38 and hour.

 Anyways... for 3 years my salary was never once reviewed. Thereafter they had me working 4-5 different sections of the pharmacy on a weekend, even delivering for the drivers. 



.nd eventually weeks.  During these years I tried to work myself up to a permanent position. I spoke to my boss more than I can count on my fingers. Everytime a new position opened up I saw a new face... this happened 4 times where they didn't even consider me. Making me think ""what's wrong with me? Am I that bad?"" So I kept working and pushing,  some days I'd be opening, capturing and invoicing stock, then I'd have to pack the shelves, replace all of the physical labels, etc. They also had me work the tills and make sure parels are sent out, etc. Keep in mind there are more than enough staff to do this. But because I kept on doing what they wanted with no questions or complaints they kept piling it on me, more and more, never upping my salary and still hiring people they had never met over me, all whilst still paying me $3.38. 

Come 2021... I have been doing such a good job they ask me to come in everyday! Hell yeah!  I think to myself, it's finally coming. I'm going to get a full time job! When I arrived there the next week I was expecting to be spoken to about full time contracts, etc. 2 weeks pass, I'm thinking ok it's covid pandemic, we are busy, I'm sure they 2ill remember. Come 6 weeks... nothing . No pay increase, no health benefits, $3.38 an hour working 8-18:00 with one hour lunch, sometimes no lunch. At this point I felt like I was managing the place for the manager. Everybody was just blaming me for their mistakes. It was always me no matter what. Upon asking my boss again about working full time I got the same thing I'd been hearing for 3 years ""I am trying to fit you in, find a place."" Then what about the previous positions that opened up? I just at there thinking to myself. Me, too scared to ask for a raise because I'm just a casual... anyways... weeks pass after I'd been working every day... the depression is kicking in... I want to kill myself. 

I planned it, knew what I wanted to do and started to prepare slowly but surely. I gave myself a week to say goodbye and spend time with my family after my boss said I wasn't needed that week because it's not busy. Anyways, time almost arrived... before I could do anything I wanted to talk to my mom one last time. My partner, my dad, etc. As we were sitting there, my mom just bursts out into tears... followed by the news that a very close friend of mine had just killed himself... distraught, I turned pale and broke down. That night I still get hounded by my boss telling me to come into work because I'm needed... whatever, I do it. I feel more depressed than ever... got my salary for working so much. Same hourly rate... yet I couldn't afford things I just needed. Closer and closer to snapping ... then my friend's funeral service hit... they were talking about him and how his job drove him to taking his own life, the unhappiness. I broke down in tears... still in tears. 

Anyways... lastnight was enough. I sent my boss a message without notice, telling her that I quit. We didn't burn any bridges between us though. People seem sad that I quit but that's probably because they don't have one person to do all the work they don't want to do anymore. I finally FREED myself from the place that's been holding me back for nearly 4 years.  I quit, I feel good! But also, I'm just scared... for the future. I still have the privilege of living in my parents home at the moment. This morning people from work were trying to phone me and I felt guilty not answering.why should I?  At this point I feel so relieved that that chapter is closed now. I just don't know what to do from here.  But I do want to say this. In a work space, we are all unfortunatelt easily replaceable. 
But there's only one of you to those that matter. ❤🤗

2895,I’ve worked for FedEx for 11 months and I’m finally quitting,"I (M23) started working for FedEx ground last September, at the height of the pandemic. I was a package handler in a hub, meaning my job was to load trucks that were going to be distributed out to other hubs all over the country. Very physically demanding and fast paced work. But I enjoyed it when I started.

It was fulfilling to get to the end of a sort and feel accomplished in what we finished. And the physical benefits were also great. I was basically getting paid to work out for six hours every day, and over the course of 6-7 months, I lost 50-60lbs. I’m stronger and in better shape now than I’ve ever been in my life, and I have nothing but that job to thank for that. 

I made it through the insanely busy Christmas season, peak season, just fine, and was looking forward to getting back to normal come January. And for about a month and a half, it did kinda go back to normal. But in mid February, things changed. Our hub and sort managers both left, and the new managers were….. less than stellar. There was a tangible shift in morale almost overnight as soon as they took over, and as time went on, shit kept getting worse and worse. The amount of work we were asked to do everyday was insane, and they’d be constantly asking people to come in early, and stay late to help finish it. I was part time, but the full time people would routinely put in 12-15 hour days. Sure they were getting paid really well, but at what cost? They had just enough time to go home and sleep for 7 hours before they would have to get up and do it all over again.

That, and they started pulling random unscheduled “mandatory” shifts out of their asses, even on holidays, and said we needed to show up for them even if it was on a day we normally have off. I never went to a single one. Fuck that noise. 

So I finally decided to quit this week. My friend who worked there too quit last week and so I was there, on my own, in blistering and suffocating heat, trying to figure out anything that would make staying worth it. And I couldn’t think of anything. This job lives or dies by the managers you have and the people you work with. So decided I’m done.

Ultimately, FedEx can be a nice place to work if the conditions and managers are good. Otherwise it fucking sucks and you’d be better off doing literally anything else.

2898,Bitcoin is Anti-Work,"In a fiat money system the value of human labor is stolen through an invisible tax called inflation, which is effectuated through currency debasement and money printing. The system has dug itself so far into a debt hole that we cannot stop or the whole system will collapse. 

In an inflationary money system, the value of your labor goes down every year. The position this puts you in as an employee, is an endless cycle of trying to figure out how to work more, work longer hours,  and earn more literally just so you can maintain the EXACT SAME standard of living that you had the year prior. You have to go to your corporate overlords and BEG them to pretty please give you a higher wage, because you automatically get a wage cut every year due to money printing stealing your purchasing power. 

This brings us to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a fixed supply monetary system that cannot be debased at-will by self-interested monetary overlords. It cannot be debased, and because of the natural growth of technological innovation which is a strong deflationary force in the modern world, under a Bitcoin based money system, we would enter into a deflationary economic environment, that favors the middle and lower classes.

No longer do you have to beg for a raise, you automatically get a raise in purchasing power every year. Because goods and services are allowed to benefit from the deflationary forces of technological innovation, groceries become cheaper, housing becomes cheaper. 

Everything you need to survive becomes more affordable, because no longer is your surplus value and the innovation of technology being siphoned and stolen from you through endless money printing by centralized entities and used for inefficient central planning.

Under a deflationary Bitcoin monetary system, you could work less and have more time to pursue your interests and spend time with your loved ones, because you would be more financially free.

Bitcoin is financial freedom from an economic system designed to exploit you for your value. Bitcoin is freedom from financial slavery.

2915,Hate my job after transfer.,"In February I got a job at a convenience store after being fired the previous year from a 18 yr desk job. I actually really enjoyed it. It was a complete 180, as I am now constantly moving and getting to see and talk to people all day long. I was thriving! No one in 5 months yelled at me, made me feel stupid, treated me like a child, and they were all super nice. The store was non-stop most of the time, but it was very low stress because of how management and supervisors treated everyone.

I transferred back to where I have a support system at the beginning of the month. Yesterday was my first day at my new store. It was horrible. First off I was told before that their store is SUPER BUSY. And it may very well be based on numbers, but they have SO much staff that I had time to literally just stand around several times. It certainly was not as fast paced as my last store. Which you think might be good but the manager was in a constant state of being frazzled, it was ridiculous. I was reprimanded for cashing a lottery voucher that I had been cashing daily for 5 months at my old store because ""only managers do that here"". Apparently it's because the salespeople are seen as too stupid to do it correctly as I was told there ere ""too many mistakes when everyone could do it"".

There is a time from 11a-2pm referred to as AHOD (meaning all hands in deck). For the first hour I was on register and they they wanted me to move to kitchen. So I take a sup of my drink in the break room before washing my hands (something that was literally as much as a non-issue as breathing at my last store) and this was the resulting ""conversation""

Asst. Manager (AM): Olive, what are you doing?!
Me (OM): I'm headed to the kitchen.
AM: no! What are you doing in HERE? (meaning the break room)
OM: ummm... Getting a drink before I was my hands.
AM: this is AHOD, no one leaves their posts. You don't get a drink, you don't use the bathroom, you don't enter the break room for anything.
OM: o... K... I was just getting a drink, I'll head back now.

I then wash hands head to the kitchen and after doing a walk-through stand around for 10 minutes with nothing to do....

At the end of the shift I went to the (actual) manager to ask a question, she snapped ""do you need something?!"" I asked her how she thought the day went and then a question about whether I was allowed to do something or not. (since I was allowed at my last store but *obviously* that isn't a guarantee at this one). She, still a frazzled fucking mess snaps, ""I haven't had a moment to even think about today"" and then waived me off saying yeah whatever to my question.

I am 40 fucking years old. I know how to do my job. I know when not to take a quick break and when I can take one. I'm not about to be told I'm not allowed to take a drink or go to the bathroom, as I am not currently (not have I ever been) incarcerated.

5 months of an amazing job, and in 1 day I know I'm leaving. Came home last night and put in 8 applications. Quite honestly, I'm tempted to text her (as she's obviously too busy for a face to face conversation or phone call) and just saying ""I quit"". And never going back. Or hell, maybe just email HR, tell them everything I've written here and saying I resign immediately.",False,p4cgtv,Olive_Mediocre,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p4cgtv/hate_my_job_after_transfer/,5,1

2918,I can’t handle work anymore,"I’m so sick and tired of working, I’ve had 8 different jobs since 2017 and the longest I was able to keep one was only a year. I’ve worked both full and part time, in fast food and retail but I get so frustrated and burnt out that I either call out to the point of getting fired for it or I end up quitting. I’ve been suicidal on and off because of my jobs. 

Currently I work overnight at a grocery store but the managers are so demanding and there been coworkers shit talking about me (I overheard them on my first day, and again last time I was on lunch.) It’s also really draining me physically. Last time I think I was truly happy was when I was on unemployment last year. 

I’m living with my in-laws and I’m terrified of being a burden. My father in law is a workoholic that would rather be at work than at home, and I’m scared he probably thinks I’m a lazy bum because I can’t handle working. My poor boyfriend has stuck to my side this whole time and has helped me a ton during the times I wasn’t  working but I feel like I’m just a pain in the ass.
Unfortunately I’m also impulsive, I ended up racking up 9k of debt (well my Boyfriend is a part of it, he has his name on one of my cards but isn’t fully responsible for the debt) during a period where I was like “fuck it, nothing matters because everything is gonna crash and burn in 20 years so I might as well enjoy my life now.” But now I’m freaking tf out over the debt. I wanted to try filing bankruptcy but my boyfriend begged and cried for me not to and said he’s gonna help pay it all off.  At this point tho I’m probably gonna file anyways and hope for the best.

I really want to move out of his parents house but with all this debt over our heads, plus the fact that I can’t keep a job and apartments and homes are stupid expensive where we live makes it impossible. But my mental health is draining even more by staying here. (Few examples of what goes on: roaches, dirty sibling in laws that don’t clean up after themselves, my stuff keeps going missing but everyone denies it.)

I got diagnosed with ADHD and Depression at 15 but I don’t have any of my medical info for that, my parents have it but I’m no contact with them. I also have my suspicions that I’m on the Autism Spectrum and have PTSD from my childhood and Borderline Personality Disorder. I saw a doctor a few days ago and she said she would refer me to a psychiatrist, and now I’m also going to a “talk group” starting today, but that’s all that’s happened so far.

I’m currently on leave from my job because my boyfriend tested positive from Covid, I’m supposed to go back in a week and a half ( my leave got extended so I could take care of my Bf) But I really don’t wanna go back. What the hell can I do? Cuz at this point I’m feeling worthless as hell, and even thinking about going back to work is making my stomach churn. 

I want to see if I qualify for disability or something but I doubt I’d get approved (I’m just now seeing a psychiatrist and I heard for mental illness you’re supposed to be on treatment for 2 years before they consider you)",False,p3j6h1,ThatOneNerd776,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p3j6h1/i_cant_handle_work_anymore/,6,1

2940,I automated the vast majority of both my job and my wife's job and now we only have about an hour of real work everyday.,"I made this throwaway account because some of my coworkers know of my original Reddit account and I don't want anyone finding out about this. I have been lurking on this subreddit, but never posted due to that reason.

We both have BAs in Economics and after we graduated, we got decently paying, but extremely boring and repetitive desk jobs where are roles are extremely similar.

When Covid hit, we all went remote and then they decided that aren't actually needed in person will stay remote permanently. This includes my wife and I.

I've always liked computers, but never learned how to program. However, around the beginning of the year, I decided to try and teach myself. I decided on starting with Python and started with a great course I found on Reddit (not sure if I should mention the name, I don't want to seem like a shill). 

I started doing this just to learn programming, but as I went through it I realized that I could use so much of what I was learning to automate my own job. I did the course for about 30-60 minutes per day and finished after about a month and a half. After I finished that, I had to learn a bit more on my own in order to properly write the scripts. After that I helped my wife automate her job as well, and now we both work about an hour per day doing stuff that I haven't been able to automate.

Initially I was thinking of going to my boss and telling him for a raise, but I'm sure they'd just cut costs, have me automate other peoples jobs, and then keep 90% of the profits so I decided against it.

I have been so nervous over the past few months that I'd get caught, but so far I have been safe. No one has noticed at all. I've been thinking of getting a second similar job and then automating that, but I am worried that would be pushing it and I'd be killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. Instead, I might keep learning more programming and doing some part-time freelancing.

I am mostly using Pandas, Selenium, and a few other tools. I don't want to go into too much specifics about what I do exactly just due to a fear of someone finding out who I am.

2951,"IT, Homeoffice","I hope this belongs here. It's about work and not working, simultaneously.

Got up at 7 am, although I originally intended 6 am, but who cares; my colleagues don't, and my manager wont show up until 9 am anyway. Alarm clocks are a thing of the past since the onset of COVID, as I don't commute anymore.

Logged into a variety of remote teamware stuff, so everyone can see that I'm here. Got into some pants, and went outside to get some energy drinks to fire me up. -- Oh, look, there's some pizza left! Yess, a man needs to eat breakfast.

Checked all the news, forum posts etc that accumulated while I slept. This will keep me busy until 10 am, when the great department meeting via Zoom starts. I have no actual part in that, besides one or another canny remark if opportunity arises.

This will last one hour, or one and a half. Maybe some colleague wants to know something, or some urgent test or other special task needs to be done; of course I'll hurry to comply, but that's it. Around 1 pm, I'm gonna log out of everything, and let the weekend begin.


This kind of Anti-work comes with the great advantage of paying rather well. -- It just requires 20 years of (actual) work experience plus a 2 year degree in some engineering magic to keep a rather positive attitude towards ""work"", while not doing very much of it anymore.

In our company, we have some people like that, something like eternal employees. Everyone knows they don't do much work anymore, but they can't be fired because they accumulated too much knowledge -- their experience with products and processes is valuable and dangerous at the same time. Karl Marx called them ""worker aristocracy"": Working class people like everyone else, but in privileged positions compared to all those interns and newbs with too little experience and cunningness to navigate the shitty rat race like a fish in the water.

Some of those poor souls once will rise up to be in such positions eventually, but most will drop out of the race before, burned out and sucked empty.

So I got a call from the HR. I left the job a day after (on 16th July) the msg exchange I shared in the previous post took place.

Storyline: On 30th June they told us they'll be getting us a pay hike from 6k to 10k if we hit the targets in the first week of July. And I did. Infact, I was the best performer of the week. So I was expecting a hike in my pay. I even texted the HR and the VP of Sales in order to get a confirmation on this.

Two takeaways from the call:

1) I was supposed to get the pay on this 15th (15th august). 
HR informed me ""because of an unforeseen issue"" the pay will be delayed by 15 more days. 

2) My pay was supposed to be 12k for the month of July. That I left midway (15th), I was expecting to be paid 6k.
HR informed me (after I asked, ofc) that I'll be getting 3k.

I was working at another place while I worked at this scam start-up. I got a raise at the former place, and I'm quite peaceful right now.  Absolutely have no energy to deal with these morons. Every single time they surprise me. 

The company's name is Foxmula, it's based in Bangalore, India. I'll be sharing 2 more things in the comments below.

I) Receipts of how they have been spam calling a student who shared his review about their products on Quora, and begging him to take the review down. Oh! besides created fake profiles and writing positive reviews.

2955,Doing a good job doesn't pay that well.,"There are some people like myself who have managed to make a living out of doing a certain craft. The  first few months are great . We go out of our way to do a great job. As the months go by this begins to change .Not only do you have to do what it is you do , you also need to do all the paperwork , market your product , follow up payments on previous jobs and a million different things . You realise that the more you try to do a job to perfection , the less your profit margin will be and the less time you will have to do other things . 

  Do I feel bad for lying to my customers to their face ? I do . I lose sleep over it sometimes. But then , I remember that  it is a man eats man society. It is what it is  unfortunately. The only goal of most businesses every day is to squeeze as much profit from their customers as possible . How much profit is ethical , 10 , 20 , 50 , 60 % ? There is no clear answer. Most of the time you have to cut corners . If you do not , you will go out of business. 

There is no room for both passion of a craft and capitalism .They do not blend well. You have to pick one . Keep that in mind the next time you think about monetising a craft you care about .

**Coalminers by Uncle Tupelo**

Come, all you coalminers

Wherever you may be

And listen to the story

That I relate to thee

My name is nothing extra

But the truth to you I tell

I am a coalminer

And I'm sure I wish you well

I was born in old Kentucky

In a coal camp, born and bred

I know about old beans

Bulldog gravy and cornbread

I know how the miners work and slave

In the coalmines every day

For a dollar in the company store

For that is all they pay

Mining is the most dangerous work

In our land today

Plenty of dirty, slaving work

For very little pay

Coalminers, won't you wake up

And open your eyes and see

What this dirty capitalist system

Has done to you and me

Dear miners, they will slave you

Until you can't work no more

And what will you get for your labor but a dollar in the company store

A tumbledown shack to live in

Snow and rain pouring through the top and you have to pay the company rent and your payments will never stop

They take our very lifeblood

They take our children's lives

Take fathers away from children

Take husbands away from wives coalminers, won't you organize

Wherever you may be

And make this a land of freedom

For workers, like you and me

I am a coalminer

And I'm sure I wish you well

Let's sink this capitalist system

myself born into, I require money to do so.

opportunity to make money, doing something I have the

meet my needs and survive in the face of an increasingly
bleak future and difficult economic system.

Your position as holders of wealth and owners of production
currently has you in the beneficial position of persuading me,
practically forcing me, to have to ask you to work for you, in
order to stay alive.

Your company providing that for me, is enough to keep me
on board as any job is preferable to starvation and
hopelessness, and if you provide me enough money to live,
(pretty please, thank you very much) I’ll do the job for you
for as long as I can.

This 2 books enlighted me. They make the case for the fictional economy of star trek.

Basically in star trek they reached a level of technology where they had the potential to overproduce everything for everyone, they realize money was only a tool of social and political control, so they abolished it. Rings any bell?

It's a pity that in this day and age we also reached that level, but we're still too attached to social and political control to give up money.

I told my manager about this last night and he ended up having a massive rant at me and about how what would I do in his position etc. Etc. 

Thing is I'm already massively overworked doing about 40 hours more than I was actually told I'd be doing, regularly doing 3 people's jobs in an understaffed kitchen, where if even 2 people call in sick the entire thing gets fucked over. Etc. Etc.

Point being I went for these forms and booked in my actual appointment and idk if something just finally snapped in me but it reminded me of last night and how just pissed off and at the end of my rope I am with this job. So I lied, if he was going to have a go at me for needing to make a shift shorter to go collect health forms I was going to respond in kind and make it so he didn't have enough staff to run the kitchen tonight.

3028,How can I let this not affect my relationship,"I've been anxious lately and constantly in flight or fight, so I know my current thought process isn't entirely reasonable.

I've been having these urges to end my romantic relationship and isolate myself even though it's a pretty healthy relationship I enjoy. I just can't handle my thoughts; my partner has a good salary, stable job and is in a great country while I have none of that. I live with my family and I'm about to drop out of university, I've never enjoyed it but I tried to pull through do to the fear of ending up with a ""bad future"". I always see those horror retail stories and I know that I'm so bad at managing stress it would probably kill me. 

I can't come to peace with the economic power imbalance between us, with me being a burden in a couple of years, with the shame that's been programmed into all of us for not being able to keep up the pace and earn a living, with the resentment that will occur after the honeymoon phase is over

3031,"I don’t have a problem contributing to society, I have a problem with the fact that I’m forced to give up my life for society.","TL;DR I’ve been totally screwed since birth because of how our society works and I’m bitter about it.

- -

I hate that I have to put my job before my mental and physical health, and before my friends and family. I hate that I have to ask for permission, as a grown woman who’s almost in her 30’s, to take a shit, or to eat.

I hate that I could spend years developing a skill and possibly become an expert at it, and still never get a decent job because I was too poor to go to college to get some piece of paper giving me permission to practice my skill professionally. We are 100% capable of testing people’s skills to determine if they’re worthy of a position, but higher ups only care about skimming papers and can’t bother to lift a finger for anything more. I understand it with life determining jobs, like being a doctor, but there are so many jobs we could teach ourselves how to do but aren’t allowed to. And that just happens to be almost any job that pays an *actual* living wage without you having to slowly kill yourself, or having to risk your life entirely.

I hate that our childhoods determine our future. That if, as teenagers, we go through any kind of hardship that hurts our ability to study, we’re permanently deemed useless and not good enough to even be given the recourses to better ourselves in he future. Nobody cares why you only have a GED, they just care that you didn’t push through getting beat every day (for example) to do your homework. They only want statistics.

I hate that we have no room to find our own way. We grow up being told we can be anything we want to be. They never told us that if we don’t live our lives completely perfectly from birth and aren’t groomed into good futures that we’d have to sacrifice our entirety clawing up the hole we’ve been forced into. And that they think we’d deserve it. If you don’t get a good start then you don’t deserve a good end. That’s how they act. 

If they’re going to force us to constantly contribute to the entire society around us to be alive, they could at least give us the freedom to do it our way, but no, they have to make it impossible for anybody to climb. If you weren’t born with a ladder you have to carve your way out with nothing. 

Shit makes me hate being alive. But we can’t say that either or we’ll get thrown into a mental hospital that feeds us horse shit that you’re forced to eat if you ever want to leave, and doesn’t even bother to wash the bed bugs out of our sheets.

The government doesn’t care about you.",False,p43dvg,commonjane,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p43dvg/i_dont_have_a_problem_contributing_to_society_i/,28,1
3032,The worst place in America is the suburbs.,"So, I was raised well off, not rich, not poor. Comfortable middle middle class. I hate rich suburbs with a fucking passion, and if I ever get rich, I will never choose to live in one.

My uncle is ""rich"" he drives BMWs his wife has a porche cayenne, and his sons are both semi successful and went to good schools. He is a good person, and he overcame a lot of hardship and abuse to get to where he is. I admire him, a lot. 

His neighborhood is insane,  you can't have your garbage cans out for more than 30 minutes,  you have to get your yard cut, you can't have certain species of grass, or a pool, or draw chalk on the sidewalk, children cannot leave toys outside.  

And I hate it. I watch their Facebook lives and it's just so boring. Every dog in the neighborhood is either a golden doodle, a bernidoodle, a labridoodle, or some other fucking doodle subspecies.  The houses are all nice but lack character,  and every evening they all get together and bullshit, get to know each other and gossip. There is no soul, no life. Just meaningless fluff to avoid reality. 

I rescued a fish and nursed him back to health, I loved ugly ivan and put my heart, soul, and paycheck into him. I raised money to help cover his expenses,  and get a new tank, and the ""rich"" eat that shit up. I had people begging for updates and stories and information,  ""oh you're such a wonderful person"" because they want to feel like they helped something that they'd never do themselves. 

One person in the suburb has a 180 gallon tank that he pays $100 a week for a company to fill, feed, and care for. There's no love, no passion, just a box of water with some fish in it. And I hate it. 

I worked hard for my tank, I earned that tank, and I appreciate it. I look at it and go ""wow"" 

And the other person just has one... it's a big box of water to him and nothing more.

3040,I want to grow weed,"I’m a software developer. I was excited to join the workforce when I started. I was automating stuff, making peoples lives easier.

One day, I created a program that would automatically write out a legal document for a team. I can’t give a lot of details, because of my title and the rest of this post, but essentially an internal team of lawyers reached out to me about helping them automate one of their processes.

I got to work with these awesome intelligent people to create a cool program that was suppose to make their jobs easier.

After I was done, about a week after, my manager, with a smile, informed me the company was able to let go the team of lawyers thanks to my program. All they needed was 1 lawyer now.

I didn’t make their lives easier. I made it significantly more difficult.

Im saving my money now. I wanted to make life easier for people, not harder. It makes sense, and I was stupid to be blind that this is what automation actually does. If you think your job is safe because you have a degree, it isn’t. I automate jobs on a daily basis with college degrees. Accountants, lawyers, business analysts.

How do I still do this job?

1. If I leave, I will be replaced within a week. I’ve seen it. 

2. Money is, sadly, necessary.

3. My new dream is to start a weed farm, and I’m saving up for it. I want it to be organic, I’ve been studying microbiology and reading cannabis cultivation books. I plan on buying the cheapest land I can find. I just don’t want to work for anyone. Businesses care too much about profits, and I want to make people happier. Weed has always brought me joy in life and I hope that one day I can grow weed to do the same for others.

My helper who had all the materials was running late so I called him and he said he was 20 mins out so I sat and waited in my work truck with the ac on before getting in a shitty snake infested crawlspace with no room. 19 mins in I get a call from my boss wondering why I'm sitting in my van as hes been monitoring it via gps and can tell im sitting in there ( if you have time to watch a gps for 20 mins have the technology to see I havent opened my doors and am idling that sounds like a bigger waste of time then waiting for materials) he said at the current rate I cost him 15 bucks as thats roughly a 3rd of my hourly pay plus gas to idle. I was then asked to manipulate our manual time sheet to make up for it and refused pointing out alot of construction is waiting be lucky youre not waiting on a concrete truck all day lol. Anyways I finished my job 1.5 hours early but got told to just go home for the week because time theft is a big deal and since I'm counting the time I was at a job waiting to start I'm not working the rest of today or tomorrow got the whole works slow excuse which it is to an extent. Anyways I'm pissed they actually expect me to waste my time and not charge for it. Every day I spend tons of time that I dont bill for cleaning up my truck dumping trash and organizing my tool box.

I have experience doing everything they were looking for in their driver position so I thought I'd be set. Boy was I wrong. Starting pay was $14 (minimum in Cali) but would move upwards as you learned more. I've been stuck at $14 still, yet I have all the responsibilities as those who are above me. The boss, has a habit of hiring his family members.

I've tried discussing a raise with him and he avoids the question like a child. (Sorry I know I said quick but I needed to vent that out).

My question is, there is another fellow that works there who is the boss's cousin. The guy drinks every.. single.. day. To and from job sites. Drives the trucks drunk, and shows up at the customer's house drunk, and belligerent while we handle their household goods. The boss knows.

KEY POINTS

e For many low-wage workers, the tighter labor market
means that the tables have turned with employers.

¢ Companies including McDonald's, Target and Palmar are
offering more pay or new peaks to try to recruit and retain
employees.

¢ Some union leaders and industry watches, however,
wonder if workers' bargaining power will last and say that
the jobs still fall short in offering financial security to
families.

3063,Yay Me,"So a little background. For the last several years, I've been working manual labor jobs, against the advice of multiple physicians. At the end of May, my stubbornness caught up with me and my career as an electrician was abruptly ended. I'm disappointed, as I really enjoyed the work, but it was literally crippling me both physically and mentally. Making $15/hr for labor that was billed out at $65-75/hr wears on a guy and so does chronic pain. I was fortunate to have banked a good amount of my unemployment from my layoff last summer, so I have been able to convalesce without much of the anxiety that would otherwise have driven be batty.

My doctor and all his staff have all told me multiple times how much healthier I look. I've even managed to drop 10-15 pounds despite being confined to a recliner for most of the last 2 months. Most importantly, I FEEL better.

Anyway, I have an interview Monday for an entry level position at a substance abuse treatment facility. While I'm anxious about the possibility of passing a drug test (I have only recently ceased using cannabis as a sleep aid and CBD for inflammation), I am absolutely stoked for the opportunity. I'm an addict in recovery myself, and have always wanted to help other people get clear of that hell. I had to do it on my own, and I do not recommend it. I'm incredibly excited to have the opportunity to leverage my life experience and labor to do something worthwhile for once.

3069,What the heck,"I am out of work and applying for a lot of jobs. It seems pretty much every single job application now has a section of the application, where there are a ton of questions about your gender, your ethnicity, if you're a protected veteran and if you have a disability. It says it's under the fair jobs act and all of these applications that this information is collected on say that it will in no way determine whether or not I am hired or not for the job. I thought these kinds of questions were illegal to ask in an application? This is for service industry jobs, teaching jobs, data entry jobs, call center jobs, office jobs, out of every single job that I have applied for, I'd say 97% of them have this questionnaire. Sometimes it's in the middle of the application sometimes it's at the beginning sometimes it's at the end. Sometimes you can opt out, but if you opt out, sometimes the application won't go through. Am I wrong in thinking these were illegal to ask, and don't they make it super easy for employers to discriminate against applicants? 

 The other thing I'm running into, is even the simplest jobs now have 60 to 90 minute quizzes with tons of stupid multiple choice questions, where you have to pick what's most like you and or what's least like you you can't pick both, and a lot of the questions are just ridiculous. One that I saw yesterday was: I leave my coworkers a lot of extra work to do versus I don't put my best foot forward at work and you had to choose which one was most like you. What on earth does that tell anybody there's no good option! Some of the questionnaires will also have you have to pick the best choice and the worst choice out of a multiple choice answer, and sometimes none of the options are good ones. A lot of times none of the options are anything that would ever be a scenario that you would run into in the job you're applying for. Such as working at a restaurant and a customer comes in and slips on the freezer floor.... I was applying for jobs just a few months ago due to covid and I wasn't seeing this. When did all this start, why is this a thing? It's so frustrating and a waste of time.

Like why are there no posts how to start saving for early retirement? Why are there no posts how to calculate your needed monthly income to calculate when to retire????? Those are fucking basics or does everyone ne here live off their parents wallet? 

Work free life is fucking easy as hell :

1. Dont be a fucking looser in School so you dont fuck you possibilities later in live
2. Either pick an high paying industry to retire early (like 30s) OR drasticly find a way to cut spending
(see point 1, if you are a looser and suck a school then you can only cut spending since its unlikely you will succeed in any industry)
3. Strictly budget you spending and reinvest savings

3078,There’s no “late for work” at my place of employment,"I work for a sporting goods garment manufacturer with about 200 employees in California. You can basically come in and work your 8 hour shift anytime between 6AM and 8PM. If you show up at 6:23, 7:14, 10:19, or whatever, you just work 8 hours from that point on. This way there’s no oversleeping, no having to cram breakfast in, not being late because of dealing with getting kids to school, no need to speed or drive recklessly just to beat the time clock. Most employees have a usual start time window, but nobody expects you at an exact time.

The pay isn’t the best, but not the worst. They do provide good benefits, and everyone is off Saturday and Sunday. It’s also a very relaxed atmosphere with very hands-off management.

3088,Why has the pandemic given workers an excuse for to do a shitty job?,"I am very anti-work and I don't really like working, but it's my opinion if you are employed, you should at least do the bare minimum of what is required. 

In between buying a home, getting carpet put down, and a few other things, I've lost track of how many times people have either given me a window of time of when they will call back or a specific time, and never call back. 

I almost lost out on our mortgage because one employee involved in the process, I literally had to call and track them down a day or two after a time frame was given, not once, not twice, but over 8 separate times.

Go to get carpet installed, and I asked the salesperson when I would expect a call back with a quote, and was told ""if not the same day, tomorrow"". Not only did this person not call back, at all, she fucking went on vacation without giving any of my info to another salesperson. Again, if I didn't take time out of my day to have to call back myself, this would of never been done.

These are just two of many different examples, which have all been given excuses similar to ""well we are in the pandemic so things take longer"".

Alright, I totally understand that, but if the pandemic is making it take longer to do your job, then you need to communicate that with your clients, don't tell someone your going to call them back Tuesday at 2pm if you are too back-logged to do so. Tell them it will be Thursday. 

To me, it's almost like these places are extremely behind, but handing out false promises and expectations like candy in order to create a facade of things being normal.  

I'm very patient and don't mind waiting, but between my own self-employment job and renovating a house we just bought, if you give me a time to expect a call, I can't very well be 8 foot up a ladder with a paint roller and masking tape and take your call, so I set aside some time. Since no one called during that time, that's my own time I'm wasting not getting shit done.

What really puts the dingleberry on the entire shit cake is no one apologizes for their behavior either. So not only is the pandemic given an excuse, it's normalizing it as well.

If you don't want to work, then don't. If you want to quit, then quit. I fully support it. But if you are in the middle of something when you quit, at least have the decency to make sure someone else has that information. 

There is a clear difference between quitting and quitting like an idiot. I honestly don't think some of these people have any empathy to consider what impact their quitting has on other people, it's fine if you don't care about the other workers, but it's the people who depend on that company for their service or product being left behind.

 Because I can guarantee you that if the roles were reversed and someone quitting impacted their life in some way, they wouldn't be very happy either.

3089,Capitalists are all the same after all,"When you hear Norway, you think of a country that provides for its people, where citizens care for one another and where workers arent treated liks crap.

At least thats what i thought.

Its funny how all the mockery by the temporary embarresed millionaires, who take pleasure in working long gureling hours for someone who is ready to replace you the second they figure out how to make firing you profitable, always echoes like they have been brainwashed. 

Always the same  ""You signed the contract"" 
""Once you earn your first paycheck you will be a proud capitalist like me"" and ""You are just lazy and have never done a hard days labor.""

I cannot believe these people feel proud of slaving away, day to day, to earn their boss more money than they will see in their life. 

Infact, as someone who once felt symathetic to the idea of capitalism at first, it was the complete opposite.

Heres my story, as someone who has struggled with both physical and mental health, and was enjoying a simple life making pottery, mosaic art, arts and cratfs as a part of a government program for people on 2+ years of unemployment and partial disability, living with my parents tending to my small field, garden and greenhouse, making the worst mistake of my life. By getting a real job somewhere, i thought things would be different.

I spend all my savings on a dream of being respected as a workers, and treated as a human.

First portion of my money went to fixing up the car, after that i stupidly did not negotiate for a ferry ticket to Stockholm, which was as close to Norway as i could get, without going the long way around.

1/2 of my money gone, the next was fuel, which again, i never negotiated on foolishly. After that a crushing blow to the rest of my savings. 

Quarantine. Not the act itself, the location. A 4 star hotell i had to pay out of pocket (with a suppossd company refund ive still yet to receive). For 7 full days. No company housing option either. In fact, no real company housing entirely ! But il keep that to discuss in comments should yall want deets.

Now, after driving myself into debt, getting financial help from my mom and dad (bless them for all that they are, specially now that some irresponsible science denying person has got them infected before being able to fully vax) 

I finally made it to work. And the hospitality i get on my first day working? ""You are 3 minutes late, now sign these papers with business jargon."" 
My first day was horrible. Work day started at 7 in the morning, wasnt even told when it would end. 

And it was grueling. Standing in one spot next to a conveyor belt for the ETIRE DAY, killing my feet and back. The job i wont go into detail in case a troll decides to snitch, but to put it simply, it involed wrist rotation and applying force. 

Few hours in my entire body is begging for mercy. So how long is the work day, since we are supposed to work 6 days a week ? The clasdic ""dont leave em energy to complain""8?

NOPE ! When lunch rolled around, it was told we would work until 8. 13 hours. BUT WAIT ! ""hey, its busy so you have to stay till 9:30, im gonna be gone by 6 tho"" - Boss man.

It was so exhausting, and taking the word of other workers, it was the norm. Boss man told be its just sometimes, but thats bs.

And now im penniless, working somewhered id thought things would be different, being treated as a machine forced to work 14 hours as i destroy my health trying to at least get my hotel money back and avoid carpal tunnel and further back issues.

3116,Thoughts on the great resignation,"I’ve been seeing this topic on the news lately. After some research, I’ve found information mentioning that in the US, 4 million people have quit their jobs in April 2021. I am not sure if other countries are experiencing this trend. I think there are many reasons for this like employee disenfranchisement, people hating their jobs and returning to office work instead of working from home. 

I wonder if this data is accurate and if it is, then how does this change the working environment. I’ve read that this can change the job market to where employers may adjust their job culture, wages and employee experience. Maybe it will tuen into an employee market. But if people have resigned to this extent I worry that there will be some legislation, event or pushback from big business or economic issue that will result in people being forced back to work. A survey by executive search firm Korn Ferry found that 94% of retailers are having trouble filling empty roles. This trend is most notable in retail and service work but affects all industries across the board. 

I have little faith in this happening long term or employers making significant changes but I am glad to see people giving corporate America and capitalism the finger. At any rate we will see how this affects the economy pretty soon and it’s results overtime.

3126,Labor Revolt of the White River Utes,"So, I’m reading this book on 19th century Native American/U.S. relations (*Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,* by Dee Brown) and came across a bit of anti-work history involving the White River Utes of western Colorado. **NOTE: the following contains sensitive content; discriminatory language and reference to violent events in U.S. history.** 

At the time (late-1870s), the White River Utes were being displaced from their land through a series of broken treaties that allowed miners to flood into Colorado in search of gold. As usual, the U.S. government coerced the Utes onto a nearby reservation, but the tribe still maintained a strong hunter-gatherer culture.

In comes their newly appointed “Indian Agent”—a position tasked, essentially, with communicating to tribes on behalf of the U.S. government. At best an agent could help petition the government for more food and provisions, obtain more consistent annuity payments (for previously seized land), maybe even secure weapons for off-reservation buffalo hunting. At worst, well… meet Nathan Meeker:

&gt;*\[Nathan Meeker\] was possessed of a missionary fervor and sincerely believed that it was his duty as a member of the superior race to ""elevate and enlighten"" the Utes \[...\]* ***In his humorless and overbearing way, Meeker set out systematically to destroy everything the Utes cherished, to make them over into his own image, as he believed he had been made in God's image****. His first unpopular action was to move the agency fifteen miles down White River, where there was fine pastureland suitable for plowing. Here Meeker planned to build a cooperative agrarian colony for Ute Indians, but he overlooked the fact that the Utes had been using the area as a hunting ground and for pasturing their horses. The site he chose to build agency buildings on was a traditional racing strip where the Utes enjoyed their favorite sport of betting on pony races.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*By the spring of 1879 Meeker had a few agency buildings under construction and forty acres of land plowed.* ***Most of the work was done by his white employees, who were paid money for their efforts.*** ***Meeker could not understand why the Utes also expected money for building their very own cooperative agrarian community****, but in order to get his irrigation ditches dug, he agreed to pay money to thirty Utes. They were willing workers until Meeker’s funds were exhausted; then they went away to hunt or attend pony races.* ***“Their needs are so few that they do not wish to adopt civilized habits,”*** *Meeker complained to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.* ***“What we call conveniences and comforts are not sufficiently valued by them to cause them to undertake to obtain them by their own efforts \[...\] the great majority look upon the white man’s ways with indifference and contempt.”*** *He proposed a course of action to correct this barbaric condition: first, take away the Utes’ hundreds of ponies with a few draft horses for plowing and hauling, and then as soon as the Utes were thus forced to abandon the hunt and remain near the agency, he would issue no more rations to those who would not work.* ***“I shall cut every Indian down to the bare starvation point****,****”*** *he wrote Colorado’s Senator Henry M. Teller, “****if he will not work.****”*

Concurrently, the governor of Denver, William B. Vickers, began a propaganda campaign to have the Utes removed from the entirety of Colorado, thereby leaving their valuable reservation land open for the taking. He publicly supported Meeker in the *Denver Tribune*, and made some, lets just say, eerily familiar political/racist remarks about the Utes and their relationship to work: 

&gt;***The Utes are actual, practical Communists and the government should be ashamed to foster and encourage them in their idleness and wonton waste of property.*** *Living off the bounty of a paternal but idiotic Indian Bureau, they actually become too lazy to draw their rations in the regular way but insist on taking what they want wherever they find it. Removed to Indian Territory, the Utes could be fed and clothed for about one half what it now costs the government.*    
&gt;  
&gt;***Honorable N.C. Meeker, the well-known Superintendent of the White River agency****, was formerly a fast friend and ardent admirer of the Indians. He went to the agency in the firm belief that he could manage the Indians successfully by kind treatment, patient precept and good example.* ***But utter failure marked his efforts and at last he reluctantly accepted the truth of the broader truism that the only truly good Indians are dead ones.***

Eventually, Meeker’s attempt to force agriculture on the Utes would lead to a dispute with a Ute chief, prompting him to **WIRE FOR MILITARY ASSISTANCE**. As the U.S. cavalry approached with 150+ soldiers, there was a Ute rebellion that ended in the death of Meeker and his men, along with several women and children taken as hostages. This incident is now known as the [Meeker Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meeker_Massacre). In the ensuing battle with the U.S. cavalry, between 19-37 Utes were killed while the U.S. cavalry suffered 13 casualties. 

Shortly afterward, the White River Utes were forcefully removed from their homeland and relocated to the Uintah reservation in northeastern Utah. **In 1883, the town of Meeker, Colorado was established.**

3131,The barrier to entry is just too high. Amazon work example.,"Amazon are always hiring for pickers in Littlehampton UK. Currently they have a £1k signing bonus because they can't get people to join. pay £10 an hour. A wafer above minimum wage. (Minimum wage is no where near living wage and hasn't risen with inflation in living memory. Inflation doesn't include housing costs, rent or mortgage, because economics is a fever dream of a psychopath.)

Amazon totally created this problem.

There is a city of Brighton 2 bus hours away 1.5 train hours away. They chose to work from cheap land instead. But it's cheap because it's in the middle of no where. This externalizes the transport cost to the low paid employees. 

Commuting 4hrs a day (unpaid work, I wouldn't be doing otherwise) But the cost of that travel is bare minimum £15 per day. That means I'm doing another one and a half hours per shift at amazon before I'm even back to zero. Only after that can I possibly be in profit. (That £1k is meaningless compared to these costs)

Capitalists will claim that is the cost of making the money above zero. I have to invest in getting paid. It's a pyramid scheme. I don't profit from hours and hours of my own labour.

Amazon could run a free minibus (they have plenty of drivers) for shift starts from the local population centers. During the industrial revolution mill owners built whole towns for their employees to have them local so they could recruit. I don't expect bezoz to get a conscience or even start making functional business decisions. He only makes 3 a day before he gets too mentally tired, poor dear.

I could move but as that requires a guarantors letter and months of rent up front. The rent trap forces people not to move.

3134,Why Do Countries Like America Value Economic Growth Over Quality Of Life?,"It seems like the quality of life for like 99% of people could be greatly improved if we as a society valued that over the GDP or absurd levels of economic growth. Besides the very few who does it really benefit? 

The standard workweek is still 40+ hours with only two weeks mandatory vacation which is outdated and absurd, all for the sake of productivity. Yet society could function completely fine if the average workweek was reduced (like 30hrs instead) and if vacation was a minimum of one month per year. Especially because of the added productivity from technological advances and automation. Those changes would make full time employment way more sustainable and be beneficial to a vast majority of people within our society. It would make things harder on small business owners but there are ways around that like giving extra incentives and deductions. Also large corporations that already make billions in profits can surely handle it.

Overall I think making changes to greatly improve most peoples quality of life at the expensive of the few would absolutely be worth it. Do you guys think anything will ever change? Will there ever be people in power who have the same mindset?

3166,How to fight the system,"Hello everyone. I believe the only way we can fight the big corporations is to STOP buying their products and services. Instead of going to McDonalds go support small businesses and local grocery stores. Stop buying things you dont really need aka electronics, Amazon stuff, mainstream foods etc... I know its impossible to completely stop buying their stuff but just try your best to limit it. Once we all start doing it their businesses will crumble eventually and smaller businesses will grow and the equilibrium will occur. 

It's just my thought. I think a world would be a better place once we stop supporting those big corporations.

3167,Job just begged me to come back to work two months after I quit,"I've always been a firm believer of being payed what I'm worth, and when I started my job at (grocery chain) as a clerk, I had assumed that minimum wage for my province (I live in Canada) would be fair compensation for my job. Turns out I was completely wrong, and after working there for just over two months, I had decided that enough was enough. I quit with zero notice and never looked back. 

Now for context this grocery store has been putting up hiring signs since I MOVED INTO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, and that was over six months ago. There has also been a worker shortage in every part of my city for just under a year. 

So what happens when I go out for a walk last night? One of my old co workers sees me and tells me that the hiring manager has been asking for me by name because I was a ""good worker"" and they ""didn't know why I quit"". He told me that they wanted me back to work in a different department. 

I took this as an opportunity to go back to the store to tell them that I would work for them if they gave me better hours and better pay. The hiring manager told me that there would be no way for me to earn more money unless I worked overtime, AND she went off on a fifteen minute rant about how ""nobody wants to work"" (While I'm standing in front of her telling her I want to work), and she says that ""back in my day we dealt with shit wages and worked our way up"".

Half of the people that work in that store are people more than twice my age who hit their wage cap over a decade ago. I couldn't believe the amount of blame that this woman put on the workers and not on the business for refusing to raise their wages. So looks like they're just gonna have to deal with the shortage for a while longer. :))",False,p3eh8w,disco65939,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p3eh8w/job_just_begged_me_to_come_back_to_work_two/,25,1

This applies as much to the work time than to the time off work. You see people who can't help themselves but go out and do things during their 'leisure time', this usually involves activities that force them to spend money, therefore contributing to the capitalist world view even when they are not at work.

Sometimes, it's good to do nothing, just sit somewhere and relax, enjoy the view, the sound of nature of you can, breathe and take it slow.

I went in for an interview back in February, after seeing an ad for Drivers starting at $18+ an hour. I have experience doing everything they were looking for in their driver position so I thought I'd be set. Boy was I wrong. Starting pay was $14 (minimum in Cali) but would move upwards as you learned more. I've been stuck at $14 still, yet I have all the responsibilities as those who are above me. The boss, has a habit of hiring his family members.

I've tried discussing a raise with him and he avoids the question like a child. (Sorry I know I said quick but I needed to vent that out).

My question is, there is another fellow that works there who is the boss's cousin. The guy drinks every.. single.. day. To and from job sites. Drives the trucks drunk, and shows up at the customer's house drunk, and belligerent while we handle their household goods. The boss knows.

I really thought I would have been director or VP level by now, as I was super close with the CEO and upper management over the years, but with every round of funds raised, beyond the controversial parties, C-suite sexual harassment allegations, and blatant drug use, the ""culture"" got worse and worse. Management would brag to me about senior employees complaining about new processes or commission structures, ""let them complain, I'll hire someone younger for a quarter the price"". The C-suite salaries were leaked this year, each of them making a million or close to it in the pandemic but refusing to give most employees raises. Anyways, a couple months ago I was in the hospital unexpectedly for a month. While I was there, they fired a bunch of my friends, said they needed new faces. The CEO tells me not to worry. Then, I find out they hire a guy for my team - I'm a one man team til now. I have no say in the interview and then the icing on the cake is I find out he makes more than me, a lot more. And yet when I come out, he is Jr to me, and my responsibility to train. So I asked for a raise, they said no, I listed all the facts and asked again, they said no again, more aggressively, so I said fuck it. They told me we shouldn't talking about salaries - ""if everyone knew what everyone made, no one would want to work here"". Wow.  My manager was brand new to the company and got aggravated when I quit - like, super butthurt and turned into a baby. I gave my 2 weeks and he said don't bother, tried to fire me right after.

The rich, not having this problem, hope each of their days go by slow in order to continue benefiting/taking advantage of leisure. In essence, the working man wishes his life away while the rich have all the time in the world to be alive and handle things at their own discretion. 

It’s atrocious what we’re doing to ourselves but more importantly what’s being done TO us, intentionally. There is so much more to life then working it away. If we could just get the time to actually live it, we might be able to slow it down and really appreciate our own existence by not living to earn a paycheck but rather, living to earn a life well lived.",False,p21emf,Sociopathhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p21emf/the_perception_of_time/,1,1

3315,My wife is quitting her job soon and I'm really happy for her.,"My wife actually loves working. She used to love working at her current place of employment. But at some point, her co-workers started getting sick and had to take off for weeks at a time. This meant lots of extra work for those still healthy with no extra pay. 

This was the beginning of the end for her love of working there. The higher-ups took notice of everybody's extra hard work. What do you think they offered as gratitude? Was it a bonus? Was it a pizza party? Nope, it was two bags of gummy bears to be shared among the office. That made her feel massively underappreciated.

Recently, she got her vaccination, but it turns out she was a bit too late in getting it. So she's been recovering at home. However, she's made herself far too important at work. Everybody is just so lost without her there. So rather than just letting her rest, she is getting constantly messaged on her phone looking for help. Co-workers, nurses (she works in the medical field in an office setting), and admin all harass her. She has been STRESSING the hell out about work because it just follows her home. This really dampened her mental stability. I think our baby has noticed her decline in happiness, so our baby has been acting extra cranky towards her, won't eat much, etc. This further put my wife in a downward spiral.

She's been crying to me the past few days that she's anxious and afraid that she's going to be depressed soon. She hasn't slept the past few days because of it. She's terrified and stressing about how there's going to be massive amounts of work for her when she's well again.

Today, she decided she's just going to quit. It was like a flip switched inside her, her mood immediately improved. I told her to go ahead and quit. We have several months of savings THANKFULLY. If we didn't, she'd be screwed. She's going to quit and have a full month off to get back to normal. Then she's going to easily find work elsewhere that won't follow her home.",False,p24ari,JaffaRambo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p24ari/my_wife_is_quitting_her_job_soon_and_im_really/,7,1

3317,Anti-work is the oldest ideology in the world - change my mind,"Research has shown, that Paleolithic hunter-gatherers worked far less than people living in agrarian, industrial and post-industrial societies: all the hunting, cooking, sewing of clothes, crafting of flint spears, etc. in just 4 hours of work per day. The rest of the day was spent sleeping, playing, singing, dancing, telling stories, and doing all sorts of other communal activities.

During the Middle Ages, peasants worked a maximum of 150 days a year, as opposed to the 230+ we have to do in the modern-day developed world, like Hungary and the USA. Yet they still rebelled, not wanting to work on land they didn't own, not wanting to pay more than a certain amount of their crops as income taxes, etc.

Not sure about Islam, but the other two Abrahamic religions *(Christianity and Judaism)* clearly state in the Bible, that work is God's punishment for the original sin. Diogenes of Sinope wanted us to reject the superficiality of civilization and return to a simpler, more naturalistic time. Socrates wrote, that *""he who works too much has no time to be a good father, friend or citizen""*. Ancient Greeks clearly despised work, and the Ancient Roman writer Cicero wrote that *""He who sells his labour for gold degrades himself to the rank of slaves""*, basically inventing the term *""wageslave""*. True Spartan citizens weren't involved in any menial work - their only duty was to get military training and be warriors.

Pro-work ideology seems to be a relatively recent invention. The whole *""he who does not work shall not eat!""* and *""idle hands are the devil's playground""* mentality originate in Calvinism, which came into existence during the 16th century. As a matter of fact, I find the term *""Protestant Work Ethic""* highly offensive, since I'm a [Lutheran](https://abolishwork.com/anti-work-and-leftist-lutheran-theology-an-overview-by-luke-st-peter/) *(the other branch of Protestantism)*, and it really is just Calvinist Work Ethic.

3325,What's wrong about working life,"\- It's expected that every people are the same. If you are a little bit different you won't get hired.

\- You have to lie when on job interview (let's be honest, we all work because of the paycheck. Few of us actually care about the company we're working for).

\- You are called lazy if you don't wanna work. 

\- People say work is the most important thing. For who? The most important thing for me are friends, family, getting to explore the world... I would be so happy if I didn't have to work because I think that's a waste of life.

\- Education is just papers who means nothing. People without those papers can perform better than the people with these papers. You are not special because you were brainwashed into thinking youf 13 years of education is normal. It's just a waste of money and time.

\- People think other people are lazy just because they don't have ambitions within work. My ambitions is to live a happy life and do things I like. That should be good enough.

- they only allow 2 days work from home, possibly more with good performance, I came from a full time remote role, which is standard for the type of role
- they said the role required experience, then when I told them my recent salary and my expectations, they kept calling it ""entry level to intermediate"", and asking if I was flexible
- they said next steps would be a one hour video interview because of covid
- they said because of covid that finances were a ""little tricky"", in regards to pay
-I have 5 years experience, but they said there is no role above it but team lead, and you can't start out as team lead

You know, it's funny.  A company makes their roles. So don't tell me you can't make a senior role.  Maybe the job shouldn't be entry level to intermediate. Maybe they should just make an entry level or an intermediate.

My recruiter was very good at her job, but I know all the tricks being I was one in the past. Tell me your company is cheap without telling me it's cheap.

Despite it being one of the less busy restaurants, I still cannot stand it and it gives me so much anxiety that I'll be having a panic attack everyday before work. The managers treat us like machines, the work environment is a small room full of different loud sounds and yelling, the customers get upset when you fuck anything up, etc.

I've already began putting in my two weeks. Once I quit I aim to get a job at a more calming, less stressful store. I'm just worried that a large part of my anxiety may just stem from the fact that I'm having to work somewhere for 8 hours a day. It sounds awful. 

I don't really know how I'll ever be able to function in adulthood. I have a great union job lined up for me due to some family connections, and it seems better than any other job for me right now, but it is still in a fast paced environment (theater tech), and so I am worried my anxiety will still be through the roof and prevent me from actually being able to do my job.

Also the thought of trying to find a new job while jobless haunts me because of this. But I'm wondering if that's what I should just do with these kind of funds? I have a 401k also that probably has another 10-15k in it so it's not like the previous savings are my entire life savings. It's just that idk how long I'll be in limbo of not working if I did quit and idk for how much longer my current rent situation will pan out living with my roommate because he's gotten a serious gf that he might ask me to move out of his house(I'm renting). I also don't know where I would even go to if rent wasn't an issue. This country is so fucked across the board in rent and quality jobs it's seems futile to even try.

3370,"Ernest Becker, ""The Denial of Death""","“There is no doubt that creative work is itself done under a compulsion often indistinguishable from a purely clinical obsession. In this sense, what we call a creative gift is merely the social license to be obsessed. And what we call “cultural routine” is a similar license: the proletariat demands the obsession of work in order to keep from going crazy. I used to wonder how people could stand the really demonic activity of working behind those hellish ranges in hotel kitchens, the frantic whirl of waiting on a dozen tables at one time, the madness of the travel agent’s office at the height of the tourist season, or the torture of working with a jack-hammer all day on a hot summer street. The answer is so simple that it eludes us: the craziness of these activities is exactly that of the human condition. They are “right” for us because the alternative is natural desperation. The daily madness of these jobs is a repeated vaccination against the madness of the asylum. Look at the joy and eagerness with which workers return from vacation to their compulsive routines. They plunge into their work with equanimity and lightheartedness because it drowns out something more ominous.”

My view is that every company should give extra PTO on an as needed basis decided by HR.  And giving more PTO would be good too but won't work for every situation.

3424,"HR, management, &amp; PTSD—oh my!","Little diddy for yall about my partner’s former HR manager, as he was leaving work due to work-induced PTSD. *workplace violence trigger WARNING*

My man was the plant manager, having worked his way up, gone to school while working 60 hour workweeks, and witnessing two worker deaths onsite during his tenure. One he watched get cut in half by a machine with faulty gating systems. The other fell through a hole in the roof to their death. He held the plant together through both—watched the company’s corporate VP of HR shake the deceased family members’ hands while stating the company was not at fault. Literally.

My man looses about 70 lbs in three months; has recurring nightmares, stress vomits during his morning commute, begins having panic attacks. I haul him into our family doctor, who looks at him and says he’s about to have a stroke or heart attack, stop working now or die.

So he tries to talk to his HR head about medical leave (who reports to him, mind you)—a woman who has actively subverted his leadership in the past by narking to his superiors because she hated his informal style (the plant hadn’t made money til my man took over management). Know what she tells him?

“No. You just don’t know what that would do to the rest of us here.”

This is also the woman who, at well over 300lbs and 5’2”, demanded everyone participate in her HR “wellness plan”, telling people to eat healthier and exercise while nearly giving herself a heart attack doing simple stepups and stuffing her face at her desk with fast food all day long. I’m not into fat-shaming, but I would challenge anyone to witness the combination of her appearance and behavior and not think “Jabba the Hutt”.

So I suit up and head in to the office with him, doctor’s note in hand. We pull her into a conference room and TELL her my partner is going on medical leave. Know what this bitch says now?

“Oh, meds aren’t working?”

I dunno if yall know what HIPAA is, but it means it’s definitely illegal to ask an employee about their SSRI inhibitors. Not only that, my partner had been on them and found them detrimental, nearly killed himself weaning off them, and had sworn never again. It was an…inappropriate question.

As I’m helping him process his disability paperwork, HR gal refuses to loop me into email communication because of…drumroll please…HIPAA. It took her a week to figure out that a simple email from my partner asking HR to communicate with me satisfied HIPAA. After violating it herself the week prior.

Yall don’t want to know how disability is going. Those disability insurance plans are designed not to pay out—especially if you won’t take pharma’s meds.

3426,Is it wrong that I almost never stay late at work even though it kinda screws other people over?,"I have no desire to stay later than my scheduled shift hours at my job. I work 8 hours a day, and I don’t financially need to be there any longer than that. However, I work at a daycare and, if you are familiar with those, you’ll know that they’re chronically understaffed for two reasons: 1) they pay like shit, so no one wants to work there and 2) they refuse to have more teachers in a room than is legally required to watch the kids purely because they don’t want to have to pay more teachers. I think all of this is fucked up, and part of me thinks that I shouldn’t feel bad for not wanting to work in a high-stress, understaffed environment any more than I’m scheduled to. So whenever they ask me to stay later, I almost always say no. 

However, this ends up screwing a different staff member over because then they are asked to stay later. I also feel bad because my managers end up having to scramble and stress over trying to find someone to fill my spot when I leave. I justify this in my mind by saying that my managers need to advocate for higher pay for us teachers to their managers, and that it’s not my fault that my coworkers are too afraid to stand up for themselves and tell our managers “no” when they are asked to stay later. It’s not like they’ll fire any of us lol, they are chronically understaffed and need us all too badly.

3434,Thoughts on my current situation,"Hello everyone,

This is my first post here. I've been reading plenty of different perspectives when it comes to work and life here, wanted to see what you all think of my current situation.

I live on my own in a 2 bedroom, small and pretty cheap apartment. When you count electrical and AC usage it's just over 1k/month. I moved in July 2020, and made my first rent payment with unemployment insurance (yay). Since then I've had two 3-month contract jobs, both which I hated (corporate, finance).

The company I work for is currently in the process of being bought by another, larger company. I started in March (graduated college May 2020) and this is a full-time position with benefits and all of that. Once the high of getting out of work at 5pm wears off (around 630pm) I instantly begin to worry about going back the next day. We start at 8am, get 30 minutes lunch, and use a clock-in system so if you take a long lunch they will know. We also don't get any official break time, so it's work from 8am to 5pm straight with a 30 minute lunch window. It is straight desk work with no natural lighting. 

I work 85 hours every pay period and this job is starting to get to me. I am making more money than I need to not only pay bills but save some and invest. I really would rather spend my day/time on projects or side hustles that interest me, and I think I could make money with them one day. 

I feel like as a young person I am wasting a majority of my time either working, thinking about work, or regretting having to go in the morning. I get two days a week to myself, Saturday and Sunday. I don't enjoy my job, just my coworkers. My boss is also nice, but that doesn't help the job. 

What do you guys think? Am I just a lazybones who doesn't want to work or am I wasting 42.5 hours of my week on stress and worry that isn't necessary?",False,p1tel8,timbrizzell,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p1tel8/thoughts_on_my_current_situation/,8,1

3436,Government Union Jobs - Specifically in the University system,"Hello,

I am somebody who is at the end of the line in terms of my ability to productively work an 8 hour day, day in and day out, due to burn out and some mental health issues.  I am in my early 40s and have had a long, tiring career in an industry I do not care about.   I get that I need to have those issues treated, but at the end of the day, it's obvious to me that I do not want, nor am I capable of, any sort of dynamic job that requires excessive attention to detail, focus, deadlines, presentations, strict schedules, etc.  A long break or a vacation I don't believe will move the needle, I am actually starting to suffer memory loss, reduction in the ability to abide by what I would have earlier considered basic norms (I barely even comb my hair and I just wear whatever clothes I take out of the dryer, I care nothing about the comments of my co-workers.)  I literally feel as if I am just in a daze most of the day and this is not sustainable for me.   I lock myself in my office and just do what I need to to get by.    I get no joy from work and feel as if it is a waste of my life.  I am concerned about global warming for the future of the planet and what that means for my small children.  I simply choose not to care about career/advancement/productivity/etc any longer.  This is not a temporary issue, this is foundational to my psyche at this point.  

I have managed to save some money and have been very lucky with some investments that I've made, so I am in a position where I can probably live on $3K/mo. going forward (plus health insurance).  

I live in a University down in the Pacific Northwest.  I am considering going to work there and trying to back my way into a remote job for low-ish pay at entry level.  I have a number of doubts about the prospect of this happening.  I know it's not just going to be rainbows and unicorns, but I feel as though it would HAVE to be better than this.  

My question boils down to, and I feel as if this is a space I can ask this question without being attacked for being ""lazy"" - Can anybody chime in on the reality (or not) of jobs where people, essentially, can have little enough to do that they don't feel like it's even really working hard - or that, if the workload becomes more than I can reasonably handle due to my limitations have union support to help save my job?  I don't want to just sit on reddit all day, but I also want to be able to browse the news, maybe lave the house from time to time and not worry about it, be around my kids.  The key is I don't want to earn a lot of money, I don't want to get something for nothing, but just a basically ""easy"" job would be perfect for me now.

3447,everyone is faking it,"tw: this is kinda depressing so if you’re already on this forum about to lose it I suggest not reading this

I know a big theme in some of these anti-work posts is how isolated we feel, but really everyone has just been conditioned to take it and suppress how unhappy we are. We’re isolated because we aren’t taught that it’s okay to share our feelings and instead have to pretend we’re fine for the sake of the other pretenders and the efficiency of the machine. 
Today I caught one of the best coworkers at my job (living well, always on top of things, reliable, outgoing, successful and with expensive material possessions to show for his success) for lunch (if you can even call it that, he always only gets coffee) and we ended up getting into a heavy conversation about work. He was so distressed and eventually admitted that every day because of this job he thinks about killing himself. He’s unhappy and mad at himself for staying in this career. He wishes he went out to live and be happy. And, on top of that, he said he doesn’t understand why people want to be him or do what he does because he’s so miserable. It really hit me by surprise because you’d never expect it coming from him. He’s the type of person that companies like ours use as the “example.” I don’t know, I just keep thinking about the conversation and how happiness really isn’t guaranteed at all even if we do find ourselves in a situation where we get paid enough lol.

3453,Vent about HR,"And the way employers deal with mental health in general. This was from a previous job which was also WFH, which makes it even more frustrating that it was this much of a fiasco.

So as anyone who has regularly read my posts/comments on here, I struggle very brutally with mental health issues. Depression, anxiety, substance abuse, sex addiction (the latter two started as coping mechanisms for the former two, funny how that works right), basically just a smorgasbord of fucked up brain chemicals. This makes it extremely difficult to function normally sometimes, to the point where even doing basic hygiene routines is like scaling Mt. Everest. Last year I had an especially bad flare up that actually scared me into trying to find a therapist, because I was thinking more realistically about potentially killing myself than I had since my one actual attempt back in 2014. I shopped around but most therapists weren't taking my insurance, and then I remembered there was an EAP program available through my company. I reached out to them, the rep was very polite and supportive and got back to me quickly with a few different therapists she thought would be a good fit for me. I made my pick and we set up the first appointment.

It was immediately obvious that I was going to need to be allowed an hour off per week for these sessions (all virtual), since it was a call center job and there wasn't a lot of wiggle room or down time. So I spoke to HR. She had the idea that we could schedule my appointments on my lunch break (30 mins) and then just give me an additional half hour to fill the one hour appointment schedule. I was like, okay, that sounds like a good idea. HR goes yeah so we'll just need to put in a request for an accommodation.

The way it was worded was already a red flag, but it was even worse than I thought. I was instructed to send my therapist (the therapist I had only had a single session with so far) a multi-page packet detailing extensive long-term therapy. She was to read over it, sign it, and send a copy to me and to HR, who would then put in the accommodation request. That's right, even with all that, I wasn't even guaranteed to get it, and if it was denied, the extension of my lunch would be unapproved and thus eventually lead to me getting fired, which means no more insurance, which means no therapist.

This was for half a fucking hour once a week. I could see them wanting to go through a whole spiel like that if I needed a whole week off every month or something. That's reasonable. But this was just batshit crazy for thirty fucking minutes. When I sent my therapist that packet she was floored that they were making such a huge deal out of extending my lunch by half an hour. She also didn't feel comfortable signing it because we had only had one session and that's not nearly enough time to gauge whether we're a good fit, whether I need to be referred to a psychiatrist for possible medication, whether I just need a different type of therapist, etc. It was ridiculous. I ended up only doing three sessions before giving up because knowing my time was unexcused and thus getting me closer to termination just stressed me out even more. The very act of seeking help made my mental issues worse. I guess that's what I get for trying to find help through my fucking job.

&amp;#x200B;

The point of this whole rant is just to underscore how fucking ridiculously difficult it is to even be considered as ""needing"" help with any kind of mental trauma you're facing, and even if you can somehow get the stars to align so you can find a therapist who works for you and takes your insurance, ***you still have to schedule sessions around your fucking job.*** Of course, this wouldn't be an issue if we weren't ***NEEDLESSLY WORKING NINE HOURS A DAY FIVE DAYS A FUCKING WEEK FOREVER.***

I'm at the point where I've stopped giving a fuck. I'll take my time off when my mental health gets especially bad and if you don't like it and you want to fire me then fucking fire me, you'll be doing me a favor anyway. It infuriates me to no end that in this fucking country of ""freedom"", something as simple as extending your lunch by thirty fucking minutes so you can hopefully not have a mental breakdown and kill yourself requires you to pole vault sideways through a row of flaming fucking hoops being tossed around by elephants balanced on giant balls during an earthquake.

It's a tight knit field of work and everyone in town knows each other. If I leave the business word will spread and my chances of being employed by another firm will be diminished.

3478,I'm just stressed out I guess,"I think I need to vent to like-minded people, more than anything, but maybe some advice would help. This is long-winded and not exactly as organized as I'd like but my brain is a mess.

I have a pretty standard office job, I do 730-4 (1/2 hour un-paid lunch), decent pay, benefits, etc. I am the bookkeeper for small/medium sized event business in Canada. Yes, events.... its been a rough year but I have stayed employed full time throughout the pandemic, even when were at a total shutdown. 

This job was a fluke for me - it's not in my field and they were willing to do all my training, etc. and I worked my way from an entry-level position to the only bookkeeper in the company. I'm now at the top of my job in my current workplace, but not necessarily qualified to move elsewhere as I do not have any official training. I have a BA in Psychology and have previously worked in human services, mostly working with at-risk youth (homelessness, addictions, mental health, etc.). At that time I had to work two jobs to barely scrape by, working crazy hours and brining home the emotional stress of working with these populations on top of having my own mental health issues. I was not doing okay and really just lest effective in my work. When my part time data-entry job offered me a full time position, monday to friday with benefits, I couldn't say no.  I sold out for a cushy office job and sometimes I hate myself for it because I want to be doing meaningful work, but then I remember how drained that left me and still unable to care for myself financially and mentally.  My whole life I had wanted to help people but when I finally got the chance I was far too burnt out. 

This is a good time to thank every human service worker out there - you guys are underpaid and underappreciated. Thank you for your sacrifices. 

So now I am at this point in my life where I don't want to work anymore, not like this - but I have to. I can go look for work in my preferred field, still underpaying and would have to take on shift work if not multiple jobs. I would lose my two day weekend and likely my benefits. But my work might have meaning. I can go look for work in a new field, Domino's locally currently pays more than my current occupation so I figure delivering pizzas is a viable option (only half /s). 

Or I can stick it out here. My first plan of action is to talk to my boss and HR about a four day work week, or at least five days with the fifth working from home. I'm not sure if they will go for this - my boss has always made it apparent that he *needs* me in the office, even though a lot of stuff I could do from home and only come in maybe 2-3 days. But that's the thing, they do *need* me, as I am the only one trained to do some of the work. I feel bad for wanting to leave and potentially leaving them high and dry with no one to replace me, it would effect peoples payroll if they couldn't find a replacement in time. 

Cons with my jobs:

*  I am the only one in my department - this is both nice (I'm an introvert) and shitty because there is no backup if I want to call in sick, so I don't. If I am really SICK I will, but sometimes I need a mental health day and I feel like I cannot take them (I literally cried at work this morning, prompting this write-up). I am the only one here that can do payroll - if I want to take a day off I need to fit it into the payroll schedule.
* COVID - we're an event company and as long as restrictions are on we are essentially shut down. Where I am located we just entered another lockdown. Its been a SLOW year or so, with many days I am required to be here even though there is no work. I've done small make-work projects and organized the shit out of everything but I honestly feel burnt-out from the nothingness that my job has become. That being said - they still pay me full hours for very minimal work - I do have it pretty easy.
* Nowhere left to go - I am essentially at the top of my game here unless I want to go back to school and study accounting (HAHA), I have further up the pay scale to go but the work will not change. 
* Not meaningful to me, I am literally just here to get a pay cheque

Pros with my job:

* easy (I am literally writing this \~essay\~ at work); this last year made me lazy and I am embracing it whole-heartedly here in a way that I likely would  not be able to at another workplace
* standard hours, benefits, pay, etc. (compensation)
* when it's not COVID it actually is pretty good - things are busier and there are the occasional perks like free events
* small business, I work directly with the owner and we have a fairly small staff that I get to know personally. My boss is, for the most part, really great and understanding, but he is still a boss

I guess aside from the vent I'd like a little insight - do you guys think I should stick it out or should I start looking elsewhere? I am going to talk about a reduced work week first, but if they don't go for it, I might be out of here.

A little bit more about me: I'm 25F. I have a few major mental health issues and see a therapist bi-weekly, this is covered by my benefits as is my medication (benefits = important).  I am anti-capitalist, still identifying what exactly that is for me but I hate the society we live in. I don't feel I should have to work to earn my existence.  I went from high school to uni to work, all while working almost full time jobs to get by. I've never had more than a week off from anything in my life and I honestly would have gladly taken a lay-off last year, but they needed me. I'm exhausted. If I could quit my job and doing nothing, even for a month, I would. All of this - I think it all comes down to me needing a true break. But even that scares me because if I'm not working I'm not making rent, groceries, counselling appts, medication... I'd have to use that time looking for a new job, doing interviews - the whole ""break"" would be stress. I'm stressed out.  Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

3480,The Reality,"I love this page and all of these posts. It’s so satisfying to see so many people awake to realize these companies are just out here to use you. But, in the thick of it all, none of us speaking up is ever truly going to change anything unfortunately. When it comes down to it, the 1% will always win. If we chant that we want more, they’ll just take more. It’ll always be an infinite loop of us staying at the bottom and the very few at the top. The only way to truly solve this is to put a cap on how much a person can make within a year. No one person truly needs more than a million dollars a year. Yachts, multiple homes, cars, jets, etc. They’ll always want more if we don’t limit to how much they can spend. With a million dollar cap on any single person, the revenue of the business can reach more of the employees keeping it running. We’re talking trillions of dollars coming down from the top to the hard working. Imagine how much of that money can also go back into the business, investing into ways to make our hard work not as stressful and painful. Employees can go to work knowing they are providing for their family and most likely be able to work less and retire earlier. This is the real way to change everything.

3492,"Joined your ranks comrades, it's been a month.","I have nobody to talk to so thought I'd share here. I used to work as a cop. My country is going through a huge economic crisis and my salary went from being 1000$/month to 50$/month in one year. Additionally, they moved my service from being an English teacher to newly graduated officers to that guy that frisks you at the airport. The hours were horrible the treatment was horrible, existing was horrible, so I decided enough is enough. 

I don't know about other countries, but here the cops are just like the military. I can't say I quit and just leave, so I stopped going to my place of service and now I'm basically a fugitive who is forced into hiding. I hated this job from the get go, we are looked at as numbers and expected to be machines that don't complain no matter what, the collapse and indifference from the government was the last straw. I don't know what to do with my future to be honest.

Got a certificate that allows me to teach English worldwide, but priority in that business is always for native speakers, so I doubt this will help much. Other than that, I am working on a graphic novel but I also doubt any literary agent will take it and I'll probably have to self publish which isn't much honestly.

I don't know really, just lost and thought I'd share. I always believed that your work shouldn't define who you are and your worth, but it's hard to live that way in this society.

I'm also sick of having to do the job of someone else just because the company (after I have been promoted twice) I work for is too lazy to hire new people, but then have these quarterly meetings to brag about how productivity/enrollment is up. 

I also get PTSD whenever I get an email or teams message from a supervisor needing to talk. As in the past, with previous jobs i've been let go due to not reaching a company's vague or unreachable standards. And then management wonders why people get nervous when management asks them to talk to them about anything. 

Also to all the managers out there, when a good worker messes up on something, don't punish them for their actions (unless it's something that was discussed before and it was repeated). People make mistakes, instead coach and train people to get things done, pay them a living wage, give decent PTO and help if it's busy too. 

No one likes at will hiring and firing. It does nothing to help businesses it just gives management an excuse to pick and choose people and play favorites like it's a game to them.

3496,Is my boss exploiting his staff?,"I work part time in a kitchen which is pretty hard on the body and stressful at times. I can’t help but notice the strain and pressure that is exerted on one of my fellow colleagues though. I’ll refer to him as ‘Rob’. 

Rob works 6 days a week as a chef and hasn’t had a day off in years (except for Sunday in which we all get a day off). He hasn’t had a day off in all those years because there’s no one else to cover his position. He’s so absolutely crucial to the business that if he left then the restaurant would surely close. He’s terrified of getting Covid because it would mean him having to isolate, recover, etc. The boss has ‘tried’ finding another chef but to no avail. 

Should I pull Rob aside and tell him he’s being exploited? I feel so sorry for him because he hardly spends any time with his family and the workload is clearly too much. He knows it’s too much but continues to work himself to the bone because he and the boss have known eachother for so long.

3509,Why you should update old content (Part3),"**Five. Make your site more fresh**

[Fresh sites rank higher](https://www.marketingwealthapex.com/keyword-synonym-rank-higher-in-google/).

Sites that post new content frequently will be given a higher ranking by Google.

Ultimately, abandoned sites that are no longer updated do not rank well, even if the articles are of great value.

A site that isn't updated recently will hurt the rankings of all its pages if Google notices it.

By revitalizing this old content, you can dramatically increase your traffic. Your entire site can be validated through a few updates on key articles.

Google will boost your ranking for every new piece of content on your website, since Google recognizes fresh content.

Even if an article isn't correct, Google will interpret it as giving the entire site a higher value, so if you publish a lot, your rankings will improve.

**Sixth. Remove broken links to add value**

A common problem with old content is broken links.

It is often the case that the helpful resources you linked to in the original article are no longer available. There may be a problem with the website or it might have changed URLs.

In both cases, you suffer a drop in Google rankings, as well as a drop in search engine results.

You don't have to worry about fixing your broken links.

Here are two free tools you can use to achieve this. Broken Link Checker is an online tool.

Fill out the URL for your domain there. You can then click ""Find broken links.""

Click ""Find broken links"" and enter the security code when prompted.Click the """" button.

Any links found will be notified to you after a couple of minutes. Those need to be repaired.

Broken Link Checker for Google Chrome is the second tool I recommend. You can install it on your Chrome browser for free.

On the plugin page, click ""+ Add to Chrome"" to download it into Chrome.

Choose ""Add extension"" when prompted by Chrome.

Your browser's header bar will feature a small icon created by this procedure.

To use the tool, just navigate to the post you’d like to check and click on the icon. It will display a small box on top of the page.

By using this tool, you will be able to locate broken links. Various types of links will be shown, including those that are working and those that aren't.

The green highlights indicate that the links are working correctly. A pink indicator will appear on each link that is missing or that leads to a 404 page.

In order to repair a broken link, you need to find the original page you linked to and see how it may be published in other ways. Improving things in this way is the easiest thing you can do.

Taking more drastic measures is necessary if the article is truly offline. Look for another quality resource to link to instead of the other resource.

For those who cannot find the link and don't find anything similar, you may wish to just delete it. An inactive link is preferable to a dead one.

Your page will be considered more valuable to Google if you fix or remove broken links.

My goal is to help provide the best information I can. I do not participate in spam an always look to improve. If this was any help please feel free to join our newsletter for all up to date content.

It pays a decent hourly wage, I have been treated with nothing but respect from my managers and coworkers, and the students are great. Unfortunately, it's a seasonal job that is ending soon and it would be nice to have a little money coming in until next spring when it starts again. 

I naively thought this would be easy since all you hear is how nobody can find anyone to work and I am way overqualified for most of the jobs I am applying for. Well, turns out **not a fucking thing has changed**. Last 2 weeks I've applied for probably 20-25 part-time jobs and this has been my experience: 

&amp;#x200B;

* Phone interview scheduled and interviewer doesn't call.
* Waiting in a Zoom holding cell and then disconnected. No follow up or call back.
* Unscheduled phone calls from unknown numbers wanting to interview on the spot, then no response when I call back and leave VM.
* Text messages to schedule interview and then ghosted.
* One sided phone or Zoom interviews where I maybe say 3 sentences total and the rest of the 30 minutes is the interviewer yapping about how great their benefits are (they're not) and how I can get all of the overtime I want ( I don't, which is why I applied for a part-time job in the first place).

Don't get me wrong, I'm glad these asshats are showing their true colors sooner rather than later. If they can't show basic decency and respect before you work for them, they certainly will not after you're on the payroll.

I showed my boss a series of mean messages she was sending me at stupid o clock at night saying she liked the team the way it was before I started and I’m “up myself” because I have a qualification for the job we do and she doesn’t. The boss told me she’d make sure things improved and then suddenly they told this Karen that an “exciting new job opportunity” opened up in a different department (post room) and they think she’d be perfect for it (which she ate up). The boss tells me the move is nothing to do with me complaining about her.

I am a part time employee and I go to high school so I try to work 2-3 shifts a week usually. However, sometimes I’m basically expected to work 6-8 days in a row. Most of the incentives to work there are gone. We used to get a free meal, but now we don’t for no reason?? We still get half off our food (The food there is superb especially for fast food) but there was literally no reason to remove that benefit. Sometimes if I have events planned and need to book a day off the boss will argue with me and I’ll end up working it. The last time this happened I had to submit my letter of resignation for him to listen to me and let me book off a family vacation. He last told me that he’ll accommodate for my part time employment and there shouldn’t be any more issues like the past if I choose to stay.

3535,"I was just basically ""fired"" seconds after being ""hired""","I am stunned and frankly cannot even make up a good title for this. This might not be the usual content on here but I think this needs to be known. 

For the past 2 years, I have been on medical leave due to a motorcycle accident. My injury took a long time to heal and I'm still not 100% but good enough to start working again. I gotta pay the bills somehow. Since we are in the pandemic, I got dealt double shit cards and I do not qualify for any financial relief currently offered by my country due to my reason of unemployment not being Covid. 

I've been looking for something, anything, for the past 4 months. I have tailored my stupid resume to individual positions, attended numerous interviews, spent hours upon hours searching job boards... I am not inexperienced either. After a while, I got contacted by a hiring agency for a position at a campus bookstore. I thought, why not. I am nearly desperate by now, money is running out. The onboarding and hiring process took nearly a month. There was a complete lack of communication and other than knowing I'm hired I didn't even know my start date.

Que in yesterday. I finally received an email telling me my start date (which was today), who to ask for etc. Short notice but whatever. I get there today and pass through the campus security. No one at the bookstore. I'm early so I wait, thinking someone will show up. Surely enough, I see two employees walking towards me. I tell them who I am and they look surprised. They haven't been expecting anyone new. I tell them the manager's name and they lead me to them. 

Before I even reach the manager's desk they are looking at me and already shaking their head ""no"". Apparently, they have informed the hiring agency they are no longer looking for anyone new. They wouldn't even hear my side of the story and away I was sent, feeling like a total idiot. 

I have provided the agency with my SIN, my tax forms, emailed payroll, and signed up for their clock-in system...This was clearly a lack of communication and chaos within the organization. I am done. I have emailed my recruiter, demanding an explanation and compensation for time lost. At this point, I'm not sure if I should laugh or fucking cry. 

The point being, even if you want to work, if you have to work, the system will still find a way to fuck with you. I feel defeated and totally lost at this point.

3538,"Sometimes this sub wanders into ""I'm 14 and this is deep"" territory.","Here's what I appreciate about this sub and what I think it's really about:

The notion that nobody's self worth should be tied to their job title (or lack thereof.)

That nobody should be working a job they hate just to afford basic necessities.

That those who do choose to work ought to have basic worker's rights and respect, which includes fair pay.

That the 40 hour work week is totally outdated and arbitrary. And that the ""look busy/push a broom around"" if there's no actual work to do philosophy is total insanity.

That the current political climate and economic system of the United States (and elsewhere) is problematic to say the least.

That if you want to go live in a van down by the river and say ""fuck all of this."" That's totally fine and even maybe admirable.

Here's what I don't think the sub is:

Children espousing ""I've never worked a day in my life and I have no intention to start now. I'll continue relying on family and friends to support me financially.""

Demonizing other generations.

Outlandish ideas about how economics actually work. (To be clear- I'm not referring to socialist or even communist ideologies here.) I'm talking ""let's power the economy with unicorn farts"" level of delusion.

Outrageous senses of entitlement.

This is the sort of shit that gives this sub a bad rep among some. And I think this sub is more important than people might think right now. We're in a crucial point in history where worker's rights and worth are actively being reexamined. It seems to be a turning point where the working class is FINALLY sticking up for themselves after decades of abuse.

3564,I’m tired of living this,"I hope no one minds if I rant a little bit, like most of us here I’m so beyond tired of giving most of my life to some job that sees me as a number and keeps me in survival mode. 

I don’t have the worst job compared to others — it’s at a retail hardware store nursery department. The job was better when management was. I’ve always struggled with anxiety and depression, but after completing a bachelors degree and spending my time since in retail, I just feel burnt out. It feels like I can only feel happy on my days off and as soon as I wake up on a work day I’m consumed by dread and misery. My time isn’t mine, money rules everything, and I can’t make enough without hating my life more and more. 

I’m sure in the right field full time could work for me, but in my past experience I just can’t do it. These employers want you to give your literal everything to them and only have a part time life? Fuck that. I want to sob just thinking about it. I had the opportunity to try full time at the nursery and my anxiety was full force the entire time and manifested as paranoia. I stepped down after a few months. Management works even more than that, no wonder they’re sour, unfeeling people. 

Ideally I’d have a part time job that feels better and pays better, but at least in my area that doesn’t exist. I feel so lost and even more so I feel trapped. I try not to complain since my partner works at Am*zon full time to pay rent. He assures me that everyone is different, but if I didn’t have him I couldn’t even work enough to support myself. We live in a world where many people are forced to work those hours and more just to survive, often leading to mental illness. It feels unfair to him and I want him to find something fulfilling, too. It’s disgusting that that is our reality and my coworkers think it’s either novel or naive that I put my mental health before this job. 

I feel like I let my partner down by only working part time and still having breakdowns sometimes. I don’t want to be stuck in this cycle of feeling like shit most of the time and nursing the depression in my free time.

Human beings have been ""working"" in one way or another since day one. We live in a system where money is the middle man for everything we need to survive. Very few of us have to build our own shelters or hunt for our own food anymore, these things have been replaced by buying these things with money now.

My boss bragged about his brand new Ford raptor and his vacation house in Florida and told me a raise just ""wasn't in the budget"" that year. Everytime my manager called me I instantly lit up with anger. I was made to feel guilty for not wanting to work for 7 days a week and was supposed to be happy with running a crew for $18 an hour. It was killing me.

Opportunity arose. I was working on a commercial project building landings to get into pools at a gym and the building owner asked if I wanted to do.some work at his home. I said sure. I wound up making what I made at my job in 2 weeks in ONE DAY. Cash. I ran with it. I quit a couple months later and started my own business. Nothing crazy, a guy with some tools and a pickup truck building decks. My only regret is not doing it sooner.

It's not a perfect life but it beats the shit out of dreading phone calls from managers and bosses in know are getting rich off of me breaking my back. I found it pretty simple. Stay away from stupid materialistic purchases, dont finance a brand new vehicle. Buy a used one and learn how to work on it. Dont max yourself out trying to buy a home. Get a fixer upper. Anything you could possibly want to do can be learned on YouTube. (My mortgage is $825 a month in NJ nonethenless) live small, skip the bullshit and be happy. No credit cards either.

3583,Does anyone else's Boss/Owner/VIP of your company come in to the work place screaming and yelling without any context on a consistent basis?,"To give context, the company I work for is about 100ish people and is involved in construction.  The owner is still really involved in different aspects of the company (especially sales) and this is his baby that he has built from the ground up starting back in 1983.  He is a beast of a man and honestly he has been a cool guy to work for, though he can be intimidating.  The past year however,  I see him come in less and less as he is slowly transitioning towards retirement.  When he does come in, he is just screaming and yelling and there is no context.  I work in the office and it does not make any sense to me.  It seems like one of two things.  The owner is pitching a tantrum or he is trying to give off BDE and show he is still the boss and in charge.  He was recently gone for a month and everything ran smoothly.  He comes back into the office this morning just yelling and swearing like a sailor and I have no idea why.  Honestly, I am at a point where I am unhappy with this company and I feel like there is this constant cloud of pressure of getting work done and done right along with the impending ""when is the owner going to lose his mind on us next.""  It honestly makes me want to quit every time he comes in now.  I have no idea what stresses he has in his life but I know this.  The culture around this place has evolved into one that makes me feel unappreciated for my work and that I should have the attitude that I am lucky to have a job in the first place.

I am going to be leaving soon but I wish I could find a way to stay as I have vested so much time and energy into this place already.  I can't put up with the way people treat each other here anymore.  I am sick of it.  I am sick of the owners rants.  I am sick of managements lack of respect.  I am sick of felling so much pressure and a total lack of job security.  This is not a healthy environment to work in mentally anymore.  I dread everyday and I just want to walk out and never comeback.  I'd rather work somewhere making half the money knowing I could have no stress.  I have worked in this environment my entire life in one way or another.  I am completely fed up with it and I am ready to just blow up on someone.  Not harm anyone mind you but fucking lose my shit on someone and give them a piece of my mind.

Nothing is ever good enough.  If the owner were to come in and start yelling at me right now I would collect some of my things and walk the fuck out right now whilst telling him exactly where he can stick the job.  I am not going to sit here and be disrespected like that.

3593,My manager tried refusing my call out....,"So I just called out to work (I'm a line cook at a restaurant) a half hour ago because my carpal tunnel is super bad today and I am having trouble gripping things and my hands are constantly asleep, even with my wrist braces on (I overdid it at work over the weekend, I'm afraid). And my manager said ""I'm sorry, I can't do that for you, babe, I gotta have you come in tonight.""

A, what a wierd way to phase that: I can't do that for you? I'm not asking you to do anything, I'm notifying you I won't be at work in a couple hours.

And B, I'm not asking permission, I'm notifying you I won't be at work in a couple hours. I don't even think that's legal for them to refuse my call in??

Anyway she told me she'd call me back and hasn't yet. I assume she called the main manager and got told ""yeah you can't tell our hourly staff they aren't allowed to call off. You just have to work around it or else shut down that particular station."" (my position exists independently of the rest of the kitchen so it doesn't really affect anyone else).

3597,Corporations are Experiencing the Five Stages of Grief over Remote Work,"On LinkedIn, I don't really do much, but I do follow a few tags, namely #futureofwork, #returntooffice, and #workfromhome. Over the last almost two years now, I've seen articles trickle in, commented on a few, and voted on various polls. I'm very pro-remote myself, and I support the Optional model. That being said, spending all this time reading articles, I've come to a conclusion:

I believe we are witnessing corporations go through the five stages of grief over remote work.

Now, they haven't gone through all the steps. We're actually just leaving Anger, and beginning Bargaining. There was a poll the other day, with over 600 replies, that said ""What would you be willing to give up to stay remote?"". The only answers were ""Part of my paycheck"", ""Some PTO/vacation time"", and ""Nothing, I'd faster go back!"", each with some cute emoji following it. I don't really know what any of those options did to warrant a fun emoji, seeing as they're all completely horrible, but I digress. What was amazing that, of the hundreds of comments, the vast majority were complaining that there was no option to give up nothing. People really, really hated that poll. And today, there was an article about how Goldman Sachs is giving away food to people who come in, once again with unearned goofy taglines like ""The fastest way to a banker's heart is through their stomach!"". Looking at that article, besides being offended that they think free food is enough to tempt people back during a literal global pandemic, it made me start thinking of the five stages of grief. That's when I realized, this is Bargaining.

Taking a step back, when lockdowns started, the big corporations were still in the driver's seat. There was no labor shortage, this whole thing was an anomaly, and we'd all be back in the office soon. It was unthinkable that we'd still be working from home by May. Hell, President Trump even loudly declared that he expected the whole thing to blow over in April. You know, like a miracle. But then of course it didn't. And worse for the corporates, people were happier working from home. Anxiety was down, productivity was up. So we started getting a slew of articles about how we should all remember that this was just temporary. Jamie Dimon went off about how he hated Zoom, David Solomon called WFH an 'aberration', etc. The resounding message from Wall Street was 'This is not the new normal'; their entire front against remote work was Denial. In reality, they had no control over what was going on. Moreover, with the hurdle of an requiring an office to appear legitimate gone, start-ups found themselves with giant wads of cash and a new perk people loved -- remote forever. ""We don't even have an office!"" morphed into a selling point, and the extra money they had went to scouting top talent. Remote work and Series A startups became a match made in heaven.

So of course, after Denial comes Anger. We've seen this all over the place, mostly with articles headlined with loaded questions. ""Could Remote-Work damage your chances to be promoted?"", ""Could Remote-Work destroy the economy?"", ""Are people who work from home unhappier?"". You know the ones. Article after article just fearmongering and lashing out against remote work. Hell, I'd even include the forced mandates to return-to-office as part of this phase -- such comtempt for people working at home, they demand people come back under threat of them losing their jobs. For a while, it was unclear what was going to happen with remote work post-vaccine. That is, if all of this wasn't actually the ""new normal"", and that we would resume our daily commuting routine as we had always done. But then, bless, the Great Resignation started. People *bailed* all over the place, voting with their feet. Recruiters started shopping around the banks for talent like they were in Walmart. Work from home wasn't a perk, it was a *lifestyle*, and those with a strong taste for it quickly started looking for new jobs. Then, big companies began declaring their intents: Facebook would be Optional forever, Twitter would be Optional forever, LinkedIn would be Optional forever. Even Google, who had originally wanted to bring back everyone in September, reversed course completely and now plans to let essentially any employee work from home indefinitely.

The banks never gave up this fight. They're locked in a war they lost over a year ago to stop all this from becoming the ""new normal"". And honestly, yea, I get why they're angry. They puffed out their chests and demanded compliance, and their best people just left. Worse, they pushed out their wave of anti-WFH propaganda, and it just fell flat. The banks have spent years doing the absolute minimum effort for their workers, putting them in creatively sterile environments and embracing a seating layout somehow worse than cubefarms. Now people don't want to come back and quit when forced, and all the big corporations can do is be upset no one cares how they feel.

All that being said, I suspect we're going to start seeing more 'negotiation' articles. Will you come back for food? Will you let us not pay you if you stay home? Stuff like that. I'm interested to see what other weird angles they'll come at with this. I suspect most of what will be offered will be at best useless and at worst offensive, but it's still a nice change to see corporates attempting to kowtow.",False,p15azv,JoeSwanson,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p15azv/corporations_are_experiencing_the_five_stages_of/,34,1

Hi guys 


After years of saving and investing and working full time living at home starting from age 16 I have officially hit £100,000 in savings and 4 rental properties that are making £60,000 at 22

And I also work in property earning £50,000 a year from my day job 

So my total yearly income is £110,000 with 0 expenses living at home 

Is this good for my age at 22, as I generally don’t know where I sit compared to other people my age.

I have started working very hard at 16 at a very young age and started taking saving money and investing seriously.


 I would like ur opinions of my situation compared to other 22 year olds?

3621,i need advice - is it ok for my work to treat me this way?,"hello! this is my first post on here, bear with me. i’m 19f, a sophomore in college for computer science, and i got a job at what i thought would be a kickstart to getting experience in my field while in school! i was ecstatic to say the least. i’ve been here since may.

this job has maybe 300 employees (?) all in different areas of production. when i got hired on, i let them know that 1) i was in college and i may need schedule adjustments while still staying full time (for zoom classes) as i pay for my own school and it’s very expensive, live on my own, etc. and 2) may need to work remote since i have a number of health issues as well as school, the workplace is also about 40 minutes away from me with traffic and it’s just not worth the drive for $11 an hour.
they agreed and understood both of those things upon hiring me. i got hired on as a remote employee (90% if not more of the employees worked off site to begin with) and i honestly felt spoiled! it was great working from home and getting my needs accommodated for the first time at a job. 

so fast forward a few months - early july, they tell me i need to come back on site and i’m not allowed to WFH anymore for no good reason (which, isn’t a huge issue, i liked the job enough at this time). but the real kicker is, they tell me word for word, that i “need to get my priorities straight when it comes to work and school” 
so i was like ?? what does that mean? they hired me on knowing i’m a college student and they agreed to all of my schedule things and whatnot. a few days previously i had sent an email to my supervisor saying that school was starting back up in a couple of weeks and i may need adjustments to my schedule here and there to make room for class time. 

ever since then, everyone in my department has been super passive aggressive at me, treating me unfairly, and my supervisors are trying to take back everything they told me about working with my schedule/my needs when i got hired on.


for example, at my job we have to meet a quota every day as far as production/accuracy. i’ve been pretty damn good at meeting if not exceeding that quota. i’ve been getting emails criticizing every little detail about my work there that i didn’t get previously, even though my production/accuracy is almost perfect. and it’s all so condescending. 

i got an email also saying they couldn’t work with my requests anymore from when i got hired because it wouldn’t be fair to the other people who have been there longer than me (whatever that means?) 

at work we also have a thing kinda like discord we use to talk to each other, it has channels for each department and there’s one specific to my department to ask questions about things we have to complete work-wise.

now, every time i ask a question i get zero response. every. time. they’ll answer other peoples questions in there though! just not mine, i feel like they’re ignoring me and it just feels so awkward. 

one of my other friends worked for this company previously, and they did some pretty awful stuff to him when he tried to leave and eventually got fired. pretty much the same situation with me. he asked for an adjustment that was previously agreed on, and they ignored him and started ghosting him at the work place as well. 

it goes deeper than that, but TL;DR i picked up a job, really liked it, got my work schedule to work with my school schedule, everything was great until i remind them that my school is starting back and i may need adjustments to keep up with my classes. after i remind them of that, they start treating me unfair and ignoring me.

my question now is, i got a new job offer for higher pay doing something i really like, that will be more convenient for me. i know people there and it should be way less stressful on me.

should i 
A) put my two weeks in and just tough it out even though i’m getting no help at all and everyone at my work is being petty towards me and ignoring me etc., take the job offer after the 2 weeks is up
or
B) just leave, bring their work computers back and everything they lent to me at the end of today, tell them i’m quitting and that i returned everything + explain that working with them was the opposite of a pleasure, and take up the new job which i would start this week.

i hope this makes sense, please let me know if i’m being too much of a baby over this! i just don’t like the weird drama at my work place now for the most part. i email one person, my supervisor that i need an adjustment, then all of a sudden EVERYONE at work starts ignoring me and talking about me behind my back and it’s just not worth my stress.",False,p12n3q,dawnsiey,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p12n3q/i_need_advice_is_it_ok_for_my_work_to_treat_me/,11,1

I am learning it and I have had 2 days doing the job without my trainer (got stuck a few times, but I figured it out). However, having those 2 days (and tomorrow it will be 3 days) totally alone, I realize, this is really not where my passion lies. I wanted to get away from event planning and tourism, which is what my degree and experience is in, but I don't want to work in manufacturing and production. I took the job because the pay was good, the hours were great and the employees/co-workers are the nicest I have ever worked with.

Any suggestions on how I can tell my boss tomorrow that I need to quit? My spouse works at the same company in a totally different department. Mind you, I didn't ask for a job, the boss said, ""Is your wife moving here too? Does she also need a job? We have a position we need to fill."" 

I was thinking of telling him, ""Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. I talked to my husband over the weekend, and I think I need to vacate this position as this isn't where my passion lies. I am glad to have had the opportunity to try something new, but this isn't what I want to do.""  Any thoughts, ideas, better things to say?

3637,"""You just have to work hard for a few more years""","I have heard this phrase since I was 12. In school, it was study hard for a few years and get into a good college. This led to a class schedule of 6:30 am to 6:30 pm, Monday to Sunday ( 84 hours a week) plus homework. 
Don't worry though, I only had around  10 mental breakdowns during this time and only one suicidal episode. 

In college, tI was study hard, do internships, fill every holiday/ break  with classes or work. Few more mental breakdowns but no suicidal episodes, yay!!

Following college, I was told to work hard at my job by my parents, extended family, coworkers and professors. I worked hard, working on average 10 hours a day with quite a few days ending at midnight. I got rewarded with more work and when it came to promotion, I was skipped over for someone who had a masters degree. I later learnt that she was related to the owner

I decided to get my masters degree. Again I  was on the same path of fruitless labor until my roommate(from the same college) killed herself. I found her. I called my unpaid internship to let them know that I wouldn't attend that day as my roommate had just died and what they said was Eye opening. I wasn't allowed to take leave because work was more important than my emotional well-being. 

I was so brainwashed by this garbage notion of working hard that I almost considered going to work. I got dressed.

3653,On being an observer | Chilling TF out,"Workplace politics and workplace drama - a reality for most. Politics is bad enough *outside* the workplace, but somehow it finds a way in via die-hard employees and management. Drama, however, is usually fabricated, more often than not unnecessarily so. It is fuelled by boredom, gossip, petty rivalries and miscommunication. Things rarely end well for any involved and entangled in this putrid, pulsating mass of politics and drama.

Right here is where being an **observer**, a skill often self-taught and perfected over time, comes into its own. Put plainly, ""If it doesn't involve me, f**k it."". This can be used as a mantra of sorts at any time. When a colleague approaches you and *spills the tea* about an issue they're having with another, or a manager is venting about an employee to you - remind yourself *""Does this concern or affect me?""*, the answer will almost always be *No*.

So, it has nothing to do with you. Brilliant! Now you *observe*. Sit on the sidelines and watch the game play out before your eyes, enjoy the *Schadenfreude*. This sounds cruel, but remember this is all fabricated workplace *bovine excrement*. It doesn't mean anything. Take it in, smile, chuckle and be happy that you didn't get involved in any way. Repeat for every case of unnecessary drama, trust me, it's guaranteed to reoccur.

**Chilling TF Out**

Okay, now that you have mastered the art of being an *observer* and not giving a rat's ass, you can fully appreciate the absurdity of those **die-hard** employees and managers. We've all encountered them. Someone who you've worked with and after a while you've thought something like, ""This person is going to be dead by 40 if they don't calm down."". People who take their job **way** too seriously. 

Believe it or not, I used to be up there too. Carrying the world on my shoulders, being a metaphorical *martyr* on a weekly basis. This was a destructive and unhealthy way to carry on. One day, I ran out of *wax for my cross* and found all you wonderful people on r/antiwork. Liberty! Over time I have found these *worker-bees* to be more and more comically irritating. Particularly when spouting off about how no one else works nearly hard enough. You just rolled your eyes, didn't you? Same.

Good. **We** know that it's just a job, that it isn't worth losing our minds and health over, that we only work as hard as what we're paid and that, in the grand scheme, it doesn't f**king matter. This attitude drives these little, well-trained capitalists crazy. It is possible to attain some inner peace knowing that someone cares more about work than you. It just means that you're enlightened and they've yet to *see the light*. Chances are that you'll out-last the *worker-bees* simply by being reliable and doing a decent job. They'll get too tired from *""carrying the team""* and either look elsewhere to live out their capitalist fantasy or simply give up and slowly learn the great truth - **It's just a job**. Either way, friends, you're better off and life will go on.

There is strength in numbers, friends. Our numbers keep getting higher! Thank you all for sharing and spreading the good news to our disenfranchised X-ers, Millennials and Z's. Bring on the great cultural consciousness shift!

3671,How do you keep going? Feeling like quitting.,"Man the past year has been amazing. Take that with a grain of salt as I know all the horrors that have befallen us, but as someone who works in education? Best year of my life. 

Work from home. 2+ hours of commute saved a day. 

Every communication with parents done by email, so verified trail of what was said so no “you lied and said this” excuses were never possible. 

All the students did amazing in my class. I know this isn’t the case for everyone but this post isn’t about the classroom versus zoom debate, it’s about my personal working experience. 

Basically amazing time for me. I was able to save so much money working at home that I now have a decent savings. 

Now? School is back in session. I spent 10.5 hours at the school on Thursday, 9 on Friday. I got yelled at by parents, literally screamed at, over information that we sent out no less than five times via the internet and two automated phone calls. One teacher actually got physically assaulted by a parent. Several others got hit, spit, and kicked on by students that have had a year of no consequences by their parents. 

I’m already over it. Again, this isn’t a post about the merits of school versus home based curriculum, it’s just a rant on working itself. 

This year I’m actually a student teacher, and not just an RBT. So not only do I have four months of this to look forward to, I’m also having to do it unpaid. 40-50 hours a week of this stuff unpaid, or else I don’t get the degree I’ve been working so hard on for the last four years. 

As the name implies, yeah I have an anxiety disorder and it sucks. I’m not allowed disability unless I let it completely let it take over my life. So here’s my options:

Keep working unpaid for this degree via the internship and wake up to a literal living hell in my mind every day as I fight my own demons to keep living life. 

Stop fighting and let it consume me to the point of hospitalization and ruin my life and education, but hey I might qualify for help then.. maybe. Even then it’s not guaranteed. 

What kind of sick world is this I’ve gotten into, where my options are either work unpaid as I drown, or let myself drown for the possibility of government help? The savings I was so proud of is draining fast. 

My university didn’t tell me until too late that there would be no help for me at this point of my degree. If I quit, my $40k in student loans becomes due. I’m not allowed to take another job in the education field as it goes against the university program rules as a conflict of interest. 

How do I cope with this existential crisis of realizing I basically signed myself up to indentured servitude all with the promise of “oh an education is what you need to be able to afford a house one day, sign up now and we will help you!” -the university. They’re purposely bankrupting me and ensuring I won’t be able to afford a house for decades.

In my town there’s not really groups that get together to rally or organize when it comes to being anti capitalist. Where I live is pretty rural.

3677,Employees are always wrong,"Hello everyone.

I'm working as a programmer, working from home because of the pandemic.

I'm not satisfied in this team because:

1 - Tech lead doesn't help

2 - Too many meetings

3 - Other programmers talk trash behind my back.

4 - The tech lead is not good technically and the code is poorly written, in the same time he and the other main developer don't admit the code is bad even if I give good arguments. I think it is because they play politics while working other freelance jobs at the same time (people don't know about them working for other people in the company time).

Because of these reasons I've asked to switch teams in a meeting with the Team Leader. I said it's mainly because there are too many meetings.

The day after he said he talked about it with a higher manager that said it's not simple to switch teams, but they'll talk about it with the CTO. (The company has about 200 employees)

What I think is that they will try make me forget about switching teams and give me almost nothing, like decreasing the number of meetings in a small percentage to looks like they're doing something. I'm thinking about it because the moment I asked they already started talking about this not being simple. 

So I was thinking about how little power we do have. I was thinking about working fewer hours. Now I'm 5 hours positive, I was thinking about change this to 10 hours negative. My intention was to show my demotivation in another way to increase my chances to switch teams.

I've talked about it with a friend and he told me it's not a good idea because the company would see this as something negative.

So, imagine that the company can say: ""We'll reduce the meetings and try to work about it without the need to switch teams because it would be bad for the company to lose you in this project"". In practice, they will do nothing to solve my problem and if I said something like: ""I would prefer to switch teams and I don't like this option"" they will treat me as ""not a team player"" ignoring my history.

It's impossible to win in the corporate game. Companies have the power.

It’s also subtly commodifying time - getting to live by the mantra that time is indeed money.

I was then called again, asking if I wouldn't mind coming into the store, just to meet the person who would eventually be my manager. All good, no problems there. 

I then receive ANOTHER call, telling me I had the job. I said, okay, but this isn't news to me, thanks for confirming. 

Three days later, they call me again, telling me I had the job. I replied saying this is now the third time I've been told this, I'm fully aware that I have a job, can I please just have a start date?   


My induction was supposed to start on 11th. I receive a call today asking me where I am - I explained that my notice period only ended today, so there's no chance in hell I would've been booked to start an induction on that same day. I've received no communication, nothing in writing to confirm when my induction would actually start.   


I've now been made to look like an absolute twat by a company that can't organise its way out of a paper bag. I haven't even started yet, and I'm already looking for other jobs.

tune out completely. 

So without giving much away, we have a particular work task that gets heavily KPI measured, whereas all our other tasks are largely ignored. My KPI for the month was sitting at 99% with 2 days to go. Rather than risk my KPI getting negatively impacted, I proceeded to not do any of the measured task for 2 days and kept myself busy otherwise with menial work.

3723,what should I even do with my life?,"Part of this is a rant but another part of it is advice I honestly need. 

For context: I have a masters degree in a field that has some job openings but it is extremely competitive (higher education), with the possibility of decreasing due to declining birth rate. When you work in higher ed, your life is higher ed. At my current position, you may have to pick up evenings, weekends, and can essentially be on call. There are months where I work 6 days a week, and there is no overtime. In fact they had to increase our pay because a law was passed that required pay increases to jobs where calculating overtime is impossible. 

With a masters degree, I'm making $36k/ year. I'm burned out, depressed, and feel jaded. The parts I loved about my job are significantly smaller than the stuff I do like. I tried to apply for a job in a different department I qualified for and despite 3 interviews and knowing the interviewers well, I did not get the position. And at this point I'm considering leaving the industry because I just want to be able to keep my work and personal life separate. 

But I've been working to get into this field for so long. I applied to 100+ jobs to get where I am now, I get along with my coworkers, but I don't know if I can keep doing year after year of pushing myself for an industry that is so hard for me to stay in. 

I have ideas in mind of what I want to do: communications, being creative, social media, editor and writing, conducting mock interviews, and learning about different things. But every time I try to visualize myself in a new field or position, I just feel I'll end up the same way I feel now. My recent breakthrough was that I just hate work. But I also need money to survive. 

I almost want to try opening up an online store or something but the unpredictability and lack of benefits scares me. I just don't really know where to go and what to do.",False,p13g78,MercuryBitt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p13g78/what_should_i_even_do_with_my_life/,4,1

I got my purse and a cold bottle of Fanta and headed home, on my way I took a walk through a forest. The sun was bright and the air smelled clean. As I walked through I met a cat from one of the houses nearby. We sat together and I played with him before he went on his way. I then saw a huge bumble bee on the floor, I thought it was dead but it was just exhausted. I sat down and poured some Fanta into the cap before watching him drink it and then eventually start cleaning its wings before flying off.

I rediscovered my passions, quit smoking cigarettes, worked out, healed my spirit, kicked ass in school and got all A’s (I was working full time while taking a full course load prior to this), and reconnected with old friends. I was so fucking incredibly happy. 

In any case, I’m working now and it fucking sucks balls in hell. I mean ffs, this job requires a uniform (that I had to spend money on, my employer doesn’t provide it), I haven’t had time to cook because I’m so busy so I’ve been ordering takeout, and I was stressed out so I bought a pack of smokes. What in the fuck is this shit?! I also keep frivolously spending because when I’m stressed, I have a bad habit of blowing money to compensate for my stress. “Treat yoself” if you would. I haven’t even gotten my first paycheck and I’m already $200 in the hole. I honestly am considering finding a fuck easy part time job that pays me less and that’s less demanding instead of this bullshit.

3744,Used to work as a Video Editor for a small company.,"I worked 20 hours a week for a small Bangladeshi owned business that helped kids from abroad get into universities in the UK. I was asked to make 2 videos a day that were basically advertising for the business and their universities. I worked on a standard, basic-ass Windows PC, had to torrent a copy of Premier, Photoshop, After Effects and Illustrator because they didn't supply me with any tools.
My other duties included, filming videos, site analytics, general admin, answering phones and planning my bosses trips, every day for 5 hours.

1. I have no idea how I did this job for as long as I did, my boss had no understanding of how ANY part of the process worked and didn't care to learn, no matter how many times I explained it.

2. They expected me to gather footage from Bangladesh and Kuwait where the main offices were, so I had ask around like 5-6 different people to get anything sorted.

3. We had hour long Skype calls 2-3 times a week so that basically cut down my work time from 20 hours to 16-17.

4. I literally had to babysit the bosses 13 year old son multiple times a week, and work at the same time. He loved hanging out with me but I would constantly get in trouble for not working enough during this time.

5. I was fired for inefficiency. I said I could work better at home where I had a proper editing setup but wasn't allowed.

I don't really know what my point is, just venting. I got a bachelor's degree in Media just to get a minimum wage job. When I took the job I was promised full time hours after the first 3 months but that didn't happen at any point. My partner and I were renting and I had to steal every fucking day to live, and now we're in disgusting amounts of credit card debt as we had to move during that time too.

Now I'm in a job where you have to ask to have your lunch break before being allowed to go, you don't get your bonus if you make a minor mistake during the month. Luckily I'm working from home, they'll bring us back in the office, even though my entire job has been from home with no issues.
The thing is, I'm a very hard worker, I've been top of the board at this company every month, but if I process a complaint wrong on their antiquated, bullshit system, which I haven't had proper training on, then I'll lose my bonus.

3758,Has any US state made a push for mandatory minimum paid vacation days yet?,"I work at a job where I'm lucky enough to have almost a month worth of vacation days with my 8 years of seniority, and it's one of the things I fear losing the most if I ever had to get another job.  I know that Congress probably won't bother for quite some time(if ever) to address this issue federally, but have any US states tried to make their own push on this issue through state law?  I know that some of them require rollover of vacation/sick leave if it is offered by a company, but as far as I know, none of them have legally compelled companies to offer at least a certain amount of paid or even unpaid vacation time, only sick leave in certain states.  It would really suck to think that 0 progress is even being attempted to be made on this issue, everybody deserves at least some recovery time every so often.  I'm just wondering if there's even been a bill that was introduced anywhere that probably died in committee or something.

I feel like the 20 days mandated by the EU is a good minimum to go by, I would hate to have any less than that but from what I've read, it seems to be a regular thing in this country to either offer significantly less than that, or of course just none at all.",False,p0zti4,mjt5689,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p0zti4/has_any_us_state_made_a_push_for_mandatory/,1,1

3767,Just got a job at 7-11. Advice?,"So I worked for about 2 years in 2015 for a local deli, hated it, and stopped working to go back to college. Now, I'm 2 years out of college, and been desperately looking for work. (I'm still living with a parent so I had a place to sleep/eat etc.) I graduated like 2 months before the covid outbreak, which didn't help my outlook or cynicism about the world, but I digress.

I finally got a job at 7-11 (thanks bachelor's degree) and it's bringing up a lot of negative memories from my last real job already. Furthermore, last night I was hit with the fact that I'll be doing this for the rest of my life. Even if it's not at 7-11, I will absolutely have to work for the rest of my life, I no longer have college as a means to escape it. I honestly can't imagine how people manage to go through their lives being demanded and degraded regularly. I'm scared.

My manager gives me weird vibes, he's kinda an angry dude, hasn't yelled at me yet or anything but does swear a lot under his breath when mistakes ate made. How do I get through this? Is there any way I can make this job easier emotionally? And are other jobs really ""better"" than retail work or is that something we just tell ourselves to feel better?

3768,I'm an engineer and I've had enough already.,"I'm a production engineer working at a small family owned engineering firm in Texas. Being the sole engineer in the company, I am constantly on my feet and the work is physically demanding on most days. I used to work on cargo vessels as a marine engineer, but due to personal reasons decided to pursue my masters and switch to shore based industries.

I make $12 an hour. Yeah. That's what my employer pays me and he is a true hypocrite. He talks down to me in front of everyone else on the floor during production hours, my mistakes are examined using a magnifying glass, but mistakes made by others are shrugged off. 

I am constantly told that despite my two degrees I am ineffective at my work and how I keep missing out on tasks that I should complete despite me running around trying to accomplish multiple tasks at once. I have a 10 - 12 hour work day on most days and I'm absolutely exhausted when I come back home ( the walking around I mentioned above easily runs up to 8 - 9 miles a day).

I was told that a performance review would be done at the end of 3 months, but surprise, it never happened. I went up to him and his wife( both share ownership of the company) on multiple occasions to discuss my review and the matter was aways flagged as not urgent( they have a worker shortage - no surprise - because they don't pay skilled workers enough) due to production priorities. 

Blame is always quick to be handed out and one has to keep a constant eye over their should to make sure they are clear. They hire folks for some tasks, but I've seen 4 quit within the first week of employment ( one lady didn't bother showing up after three days). Naturally, they make the reminder of employees cover for the work, don't pay extra, blame them for incompetence when mistakes are made (as this is a fabrication shop and not every employee knows each area of work), and refuse to pay extra for the additional work. I had never worked in manufacturing/fabrication positions before and I try my best every day, but it's never enough. No one appreciates my work, instead I get the usual bullshit of why it wasn't done faster or earlier. 

I cannot take it anymore. I really can't. The bullshit is too much to take at times and my health has been in a constant decline ever since I joined. I can't quit due to financial obligations back home, but I have been trying to switch onto something better. I'm waiting for the day I can just get up and walk out of that hellhole, tell my boss to go fuck himself and that his cherished business is nothing but a dump, and flip off his wife for giving me corporate bullshit during meetings. Just wanted to share this with everyone here. Fuck these owners.

3779,Work(ism) is a religion/cult. Change my mind.,"Humanity's relationship to work can be best summed up as a clear example of [Orwellian Doublethink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink): when you hold two contradictory beliefs at the same time.

Work is the reason why we hate Mondays so much and can't wait for the weekend to arrive, work is the reason why we curse the weekday morning and bless the evening / late-afternoon, mankind's hatred of work has compelled her scientists to keep on inventing new labour-saving and automation technologies.

Yet, at the same time, we have a culture *(so-called ""Protestant Work Ethic"" - a label I find offensive as a* [*Lutheran*](https://abolishwork.com/anti-work-and-leftist-lutheran-theology-an-overview-by-luke-st-peter/)*, since it's actually Calvinist Work Ethic)*, that teaches that a man is only worth as much as he works, that *""he who does not work shall not eat""*, that *""idle hands are the devil's playground""*, etc.

But this is not the only work-related contradiction and instance of doublethink: we as a society hold the belief that people absolutely loooooove working, that it's dignifying and fills your life with meaning... yet, simultaneously, we as a society also hold the belief, that if we implemented Universal Basic Income, everyone would stop working, become lazy, and refuse to engage in any kind of productive labour *(guilty as charged, I'd need a long break to get over the trauma of having been a wageslave for over a year)*. Which one is it, Work-cultists?

Workism is not a rational set of beliefs, but instead a **cult**. **A death cult that has murdered millions of people since the dawn of mankind.**

People often say, that Statism is the deadliest ideology out there, as throughout history, far more people have been killed by their own governments than by any hostile armies - I don't debate that, I accept that statement as true. So I say this: **Workism is the deadliest Death Cult in the history of mankind.**",False,p0dwsy,Metalhead33,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p0dwsy/workism_is_a_religioncult_change_my_mind/,8,1

3803,sometimes it takes a little bit of inspiration and a maverick,"tl;dr. I actually somehow changed my work culture, and learned that it's possible to influence others to make positive changes in work-life.

I worked a job where it was very common for all my coworkers to stay late (well after close, and even if they had completely finished their department's tasks).

(Also keep in mind there were many other abuses, such as neglecting to give me breaks that I was legally entitled to. But that's another story.)
I remember being the sorta new guy (although I'd been there for a few months already), and one night I asked one of the coworkers I had a somewhat friendship with, ""Do we have to stay? Like... I don't remember them ever mentioning this in the job description or interview even though I asked, and I thought they were sticklers for following schedule and the time clock.""

(remember, business only care about their time. not yours)

He said it's just normal and ""you'd appreciate it too if your work wasn't entirely done and needed help to go home.""
The thing is, I was often employee of the month and I NEVER needed this help because I did my work and finished on time like a good time-managing person should.
So one night, it was well over an hour past closing time and I was there again helping some other department.
I asked this same coworker, ""What would happen if I clocked out and left? I'm not trying to be a jerk, I just need to be somewhere and didn't expect that i would be at work this late.""

(Keep in mind that I --like many unfortunate workers--did not own a car and relied on other's help for commute. Don't get me started on how fucking completely stupid America is with its urban sprawl and forced car-dependency. So I was in a position where no matter what I did, it would be rude to someone).

He says, ""I wouldn't leave until we're done. You'd probably get in big trouble, and I don't want to see that happen to you."" Ok, I thought. If I'm still on the clock I'm still getting paid. (Not overtime though, because in order to correct this situation they gave me fewer hours. go figure)

But when this happened again, and it was way too late after close, and I really respected the person helping me get to and from work... I made the decision to leave. 
Everyone around me had either a look of disbelief or resentment. I'm sure there might have even been jealousy. But I wasn't going to divest myself of my own dignity any longer.
So I went to the break room, clocked out, got my stuff, and left.

The next time I went in the head manager had a talk with me and said effectively that he was going to let me keep that job but that I'm on thin ice. And he ended up doubling my workload, in addition to having me train three new people. And fewer hours.
I wasn't having it any more. I planned to leave and never look back. So I informed the scheduling manager that in about a month I would be taking a week off to go out of state.
That date came, and instead of going back to work I simply never returned and never spoke to any of them again.

As it turned out, about a year after I quit, I found myself back, accompanying a relative as she was doing business there.

There were a lot of workers I didn't recognize, luckily thanks to the lovely turnover. But one person was working that I did remember and I asked him about their closing situation and what they do when a department has run-over tasks that they needed to finish before they could clock out and leave.

As it turns out, my leaving that one night inspired others to do the same, and as a result management had to create a solution.
Instead of having everyone stay well over their scheduled time and do work that wasn't their responsibility, or punish employees that worked efficiently and got their tasks done...
they had the managers complete it, and eventually created a new overnight position come in and put everything in order.

In the end, it's never that company's *can't* do the right thing and respect their employees. It's that they don't *want* to, and won't unless forced.

This taught me a valuable lesson. 
No one wants to be the nail that sticks up. No one feels comfortable being the ""bad, disobedient worker"" who will then be reprimanded or get their job (and sense of security) taken away.
But sometimes all it takes is some inspiration. And people, who are emboldened by another's taking the step forward and setting new precedents, can collectively make a change for themselves toward the better.
We can hold better standards, value ourselves higher, and accept less abuse and exploitation.

Change is possible if we take the steps and let it.

And I brought this lesson to a later job that I had.
For so long I envied and longed for the work-life balance of a country like France or Italy, where workers are more at ease and don't have to degrade themselves like people do in America.
So one day I just pretended like I was in Italy, with those standards and expectations.
I didn't let customers walk over me. I acted like my employer was lucky to have me work there, and it was a privilege that they could even have someone do their job well, let alone above and beyond like I did.
And eventually I noticed change in the work culture among my coworkers.
After a year, I got to train people and instill in them the philosophy I had, and how to approach the job. And I even told people in higher positions than me how I think they should respond to certain problems they were having with management. 
I couldn't even hardly recognize this job from when I first started, and it was almost scary to see how much better things were by my coworkers imitating me or listening to my advice.
Everyone was happier, and that made my life so much less stressful.

When covid hit, for whatever reason we got even more slammed with clients than ever before. All the karens and entitled shitheads came out of the woodwork.
But I just reminded myself that my health and safety are important, and it's just a service. It's not actually important at the end of the day, and certainty not worth dying over.

I had money saved up, and with the stimulus check, the insanely hightened stress was just not worth it anymore. I was not going to put up with it.
So I quit. But I was thankful knowing that coworkers I left behind would have a slightly less stressed job thanks to the culture I helped to instill.

Imagine what we could do as a society with higher expectations, higher self-worth, and no more tolerance for capitalist bull shit.
The changes that I helped make were nothing. And I'm sorry if I've sounded like I'm bragging. But in all honesty that stuff is irrelevant compared to the vast systematic problems at hand.
I just want to think that we can have hope in humanity and in each other to make things better and get justice. Hopefully it takes a little bit of inspiration and a few trailblazers.

3814,"Out of money, out of options, no plays in hand, don't know what to do","It's another one of those posts....

I'm a field service technician by morning, and a violin teacher in a shop by afternoon, at least for two days a week. I'm paid a decent wage but only am assigned about 20 hours of tech work a week, because that's the entire volume of where I live, in Asheville. The teaching job also pays a decent wage but also lacks work, so I wind up teaching for 8 hours a week. I technically have another teaching job in another shop for the other 3 weekdays, but it's been about 2 months since I got the job, and I still don't have a single student.

I'm able to get by, just by the skin of my teeth, but there's been some drama at my tech job that is causing problems with that. Let me explain.

Since I work out of peoples' houses, my work typically expects the defective parts to be shipped back to the manufacturer. After having some problems with the return shipping (because I was never trained on it), I discovered that the point of sale system would allow me to mark things as being left with the customer, giving me the the ""processing successful"" screen and allowing me to close the call. I called my supervisor and asked if the system would ever erroneously display this screen, allowing me to screw myself over by leaving a part onsite that actually isn't supposed to be left, and he said no. As long as I got to the ""processing successful"" screen, I'm good.

Well, that was a fucking lie, and despite that I did this for months with no problems, suddenly the manufacturers start wanting the parts back. My supervisor calls me and asks me where those parts are, I tell him I left them onsite and that I confirmed with him that it was okay to do this. He said I was never supposed to leave anything onsite, and that that button was only supposed to be used in very specific circumstances. Later, while they were investigating the issue, they discovered that the system used to not let you do that, but had been changed recently and now allows you to erroneously post parts.

They have me recover as many parts as I could, but I couldn't get all of them, and suddenly work starts talking about docking my paycheck for the parts when the manufacturers come to collect. They assure me that they'll work something out to do it little by little, and that it would be okay, it would just suck for a while, and that they're on my side.

Then, on payday, I get an invoice with no paycheck. A week later I start asking where my paycheck is, and the bookkeeper apparently just forgot, or had something come up, and that she would get right on it. Literally days later, my pay-stub comes in, and not only do they decide *to just roll it into my next paycheck*, they decided to *dock me 300$* for these parts, without ever confirming with me or telling me how much I need to pay off.

On sub 30 hours a week, even with a decent wage I'm still struggling to pay my bills. I have no savings, I run out of money every paycheck, so 300$ takes me from being just barely covered to missing bills. I don't know *how the bookkeeper doesn't know this*, considering that she sees my paycheck and it's obvious that I can't sustain on that amount.

It just never ends. I can never get enough tickets to support myself, but I can't get another day job because I have to leave before 2pm to go teach, and in IT that's a no go.

I don't know what to do... I can't just get another IT job because of the scheduling, and I'm not gaining students at either of my teaching jobs. My degree is in music, and it's what I love more than anything, so I can't just quit, not even 6 months after I actually stumbled my way into an actual job in the field. They even pay a really good wage compared to my previous jobs.

I have such a strong urge to just quit all of it, to give my violin to some needy but talented kid, to never listen to another piece of music ever again, and just move on and try to forget it all happened, but I don't even have any options for this either. I'm already in debt from music school, and on top of that, my partner says that we cannot move out of Asheville and it's non-negotiable (despite being a nurse who could literally work in any town). We don't even have any friends in town, just her family. I *moved away* from my family just to come here to be with her.

I could say fuck it and go back to school to be an aerospace engineer like I wanted to as a kid, but there are no schools here, and the job would require moving out of Asheville. 

K-12 music teacher: No graduate programs here, would need to move to get a job.

Collegiate music teacher: No programs, need to move.

Same thing to become an A&amp;P: debt, can't work in Asheville.

She says to go work at PetSmart or something, which must be easy for her to say, she has 10s of thousands in savings, even after dropping 10k towards a down payment on a car. I end each paycheck with under 100$ in my account.

I'm just trying to be a regular adult, I'm fucking 24. I go to Sangha every week, I run 5ks to stay healthy and I don't drink anything that's not coffee or water. I'm smart, dedicated to my both of my crafts, am really good at both of them, and show up on time. I'm not asking for much but nobody has any place in society for me. It feels like I should just walk out into the mountains to die like I'm supposed to.",False,p02iya,Sarahsota,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p02iya/out_of_money_out_of_options_no_plays_in_hand_dont/,9,1

3830,Thomas Ligotti's vision of what capitalism looks like if driven to its ideal endpoint,"""The company that employed me strived only to serve up the cheapest fare that its customers would tolerate, churn it out as fast as possible, and charge as much as they could get away with. If it were possible to do so, the company would sell what all businesses of its kind dream about selling, creating that which all our efforts were tacitly supposed to achieve: the ultimate product – Nothing. And for this product they would command the ultimate price – Everything.

This market strategy would then go on until one day, among the world-wide ruins of derelict factories and warehouses and office buildings, there stood only a single, shining, windowless structure with no entrance and no exit. Inside would be – will be – only a dense network of computers calculating profits. Outside will be tribes of savage vagrants with no comprehension of the nature or purpose of the shining, windowless structure. Perhaps they will worship it as a god. Perhaps they will try to destroy it, their primitive armory proving wholly ineffectual against the smooth and impervious walls of the structure, upon which not even a scratch can be inflicted.""

3842,I'm tired and I don't know what to do anymore man..,"Hey all,

The world is in such bad shape. Looking back, it's been this way for centuries now. 

I always used to believe I was the protagonist in some hero-like story. Growing older, I realize that I am  more so one of the billions of farmers, slaves and insignificant names whose names have been forgotten throughout history. And it fucking hurts man.

I have been conditioned in such a manner that even in a world where I wouldn't have to work, I just wouldn't know what to do with my life. I have no passion to pursue; no dreams to chase. 

Work sucks. I have tried talking to my therapist about these feelings, but she just doesn't understand. She is, and I am quite happy for her in that regard, very content with the work she does. However, I don't think I will ever be. I feel chained.

I hate how little people care for each other nowadays. Everyone is a zombie only concerned with themselves and the image they project using social media. Real people are so hard to come by.

Maybe I am just depressed, man, but combining everything with mankind's hellbent decision of destroying earth through industrialization and the prospect of never being able to own a house as a person in their mid 20's, it makes me want to give up.

I feel so disconnected with everyone and, possibly even worse, with myself. I am tired of life. I really am.

I hope someone reads this and can relate. Know you are not alone. I will let you know as soon as possible if I do ever figure out a good reason to live. But for now, I am just fucking tired of it all. If only I wasn't so fucking scared of missing out on anything if I were to die.

One of my dogs has several barks: a play bark and a
squirrel bark and other dog things that are normal dog
barks. He also had what we call his “emergency bark”.
The emergency bark is what he does when he thinks
there is serious danger. It is EXTREMELY loud and
makes us jump every time. He usually reserves it for
things like the time | fell down the stairs and he scream
barked for my husband to help, or when someone is in
our front yard, or when he cornered a dorsum in the
backward.

However, since my husband started working from home
this dog barks his emergency bark at my husband if he
tries working past pm. By husband now has learned
to stop working at about 3:50 every day to avoid that
jarring sound.

3850,I (24M) haven't been working for nearly one year,"It feels good, but it won't last forever.

My end of studies project ended in August 2020 (it was a six months internship) and in september I got my computer science engineer degree. The next obvious step, that both my parents expected me to do, was to begin my data science career.

But something felt wrong to me. When I pictured myself working in this field, I felt extremely uncomfortable. My heart sped up each time I read a job offer on LinkedIn, and I just couldn't focus more than ten minutes seeking for a job. At some point I would just close my laptop and stop thinking about it. I was screaming inside my head, but unable to explain precisely what was my problem. Something in my head just kept telling myself *no you won't work.*

I wasn't depressed at all. The strong emotions that I felt wasn't sadness, depression or fear, it was anger.

A lot of bad things happened during my three interships, I couldn't even list all of them. First, I worked unpaid in a factory using dangerous machines with ninety decibels for seven hours a day, with itchy dust on my clothes that prevented me from sleeping well. The following year I've been in a company in which my boss wanted me to work more than what was on the contract (paid five hundred euros each month, this is the minimum in France). For my last intership, my supervisor misled me about how much paid holidays I had the right to take. He then told me something like: “Yeah but most of the time, students write their end of studies report during their holidays, you did it during working hours so it's ok”.

Reading the LinkedIn offers, I decided not to work. I didn't want to live those kind of nightmares again.

**It was the best year of my life. I learnt how to use Ableton Live, played video games, did a little bit of programming for leisure, visited my grand parents, read some maths books, and some days, I did nothing.**

Next month, this very strange year (probably the best of my life) is going to end. I won't give all details, but I'm back to school. This is delaying the beggining of my career (and changing my career plan too). At least I'd rather be at school than in an office.

I'll end up working anyway, which is why I still think daily of how to quit this bizarre society without becoming homeless.

Why is everybody so busy? Early a century ago, the economist John Raynaud
Eyes predicted we'd only work fifteen hours a week. Incomes would grow and
so would our free time.

Except that hasn't happened. Income rose, but we kept working long hours. Why?
One answer is that people like to be busy. His paper argues that people dread

idleness and are generally happier when they're busy than when there’s nothing
to do.

3883,Created a YT channel focused on anti-work. I'd welcome input &amp; advice,"So, I created a YouTube channel despite my lack of any talent in front of a camera, video editing skill, or an entertaining bone in my body.  But, I do have a huge chip on my shoulder about the past 30 years that I wasted working my butt off.  

Quit my job of 23 years earlier this year.  I quit in a huff, but had been trying to understand why I was so unhappy despite having everything that I thought I wanted (3 yrs with a personal coach and then a therapist).  

Slowly realized that what I thought I wanted was what I had been told I wanted, not what I wanted.  I set up the channel to start reflecting my attempt to get clear about what a real, fulfilling and human life should be like... once we stop chasing all the capitalist bull$hit that is.

So far the videos I've created have been focused on my story, plus an academic look at work from a critics point of view.  A big focus right now is on anti-work, anti-capitalist ideas, and I've posted a few book reviews, and will do more.  The videos are pretty academic because that is my style, but I am trying to make them a bit more engaging.  I still suck in front of the camera but my editing has come a long way in the last 5 weeks.  Eventually I am thinking about sharing more personal experiences as I figure out how I want to spend the rest of my life, and experiment with options.

If you've got time to waste, I'd love your feedback (here or in the video comments).  Are these videos worthwhile?  Things to change?  Ideas for other topics?  Should I stick with therapy and keep quiet until my sanity returns?

His machine allows anyone to work for minimum
wage for as long as they like. Turning the crank on
the side release one penny every 4.97 seconds, for a
total of $7.25 per hour. His corresponds to minimum
wage for a person in New Work. His piece is brilliant
on multiple levels, particularly as social
commentary. Without a doubt, most people who
started operating the machine for fun would quickly
grow disheartened and stop when realizing just how
little they’re earning by turning this endless crank.
A person would then conceivable realize that this is
what nearly two million people in the United States
do every day...at much harder jobs than turning a
crank. His turns the piece into a simple, yet
effective argument for raising the minimum wage.

3912,Should I just leave? (20M),"Currently a fast-food chain worker living in Massachusetts, also a college student.

I have been working this job over the summer for the past 8 weeks. Overall meh (it’s fast food, what do you expect) but not the worst thing in the world. Only reason why I am doing it is because my other internship is unpaid (marketing intern).

I came into the job expecting to work only part time (20ish hours a week) but eventually it ramped up to the point where it got to 35 hours a week. It has taken time away that I want to devote to my other job as well. My anger for the fast food job culminated in a week where I worked 4 days in a row over a weekend during a major sporting event, where I became exhausted. Afterwards, I specifically requested that my manager do not work me on back to back days, after which she complied and granted my request, and so far things have been better.

This upcoming week however, I was put on for four straight days - Monday through Thursday, which I planned as my last day (I had already put in my two weeks notice). I am also working the Sunday prior to that week, so I have to work five days in a row. 

I addressed my manager about it immediately. She was going away for the first half of the week and needed someone to cover. She stated that she really tried to work with my needs but could not (even though the are other who could help). I tried to ask her to find someone else to cover and she could not find any takers.

Should I stay or leave? The only reason I ask this is that my manger has been quite nice to me and super helpful in navigating the restaurant and I don’t want to seem like an asshole fucking her over (otherwise, I would have quit outright and not made this post). I don’t need the money and could spend the time doing something else, but I would like to get some outside opinions before I make a final decision.",False,p00wrz,highonjuiceboxes,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/p00wrz/should_i_just_leave_20m/,7,1

3915,"I feel sad and so tired already, and so so alone","No one around me understands how exhausting it is to have to work in retail when being so introverted. I barely leave my house, hell, I live with five people and barely leave my room. To have to go out and be forced to smile and greet for 8 hours is excruciating. They cut my hours, drastically, and I don’t have it in me to ask for more. Working such a violating job drains all life out of me. From the moment I show up I am counting the clock to go home. I have lied so many times to get out of a shift because I just can’t bring myself to get out of bed. I want to quit but I need the money so I just can’t. 

I can’t get a better job either. At 19 with no degree or experience beyond waitressing for 3 months and retail for 4, no one wants to hire me. Office job is out of the fucking question. I’m working toward an art degree, and I’m so scared I will lose passion for the one hobby I enjoy and can be good at. All of my family and friends, even my boyfriend, have the grind mentality. I can’t confide in them about feeling like this. I feel so lied to about how life really is. Working was posed as something we would enjoy, but it’s robbing me of all happiness and joy. How am I ever supposed to have stability? Having children in the future feels more like a financial burden than a choice to continue the life cycle. I won’t ever be able to buy a house, or even a car. It feels like struggle never ends, and this is before I have millions of bills to pay. 

I feel so envious of those born rich, or who were lucky enough to fall into stardom. I can’t help the jealousy I have against people with generational wealth. I sympathize for the millions of people who spend everyday trying to gain a following that they can monetize. The people who have to turn to illicit activity to just feed their families.

They  called a meeting and told me I was clueless, always in a daze, and made  simple mistakes, and ridiculed me for my obviously autistic traits.  This is because I have autism. I still am trying my best and I told them  they need to give me more time and patience. My boss abused me for like  30 minutes straight and then said now go back to your shift and I told  him I'm too anxious now and I can't, and that I want to go home. I could  not work. He gave a firm no and said if I don't want to work right now I  should resign. I said okay, I'm resigning and left. I deserve to be treated just as everyone else. He told me this was one of the best jobs out there for the pay. Even if it was, the value is not there when your boss abuses you constantly for small mistakes.

3947,This sucks.,"I've worked in retail my whole life, and that's not really by choice. The area I live in is primarily comprised of retail and food, so my options are rather limited. I want to get out, for multiple reasons, the main one being my back. I've had back problems since I was a teenager, but the combination of getting older and working retail has taken its toll. It genuinely hurts to even stand sometimes. My family and girlfriend want me to get a work from home job, but I'm having a hard time finding those. I just feel stuck at this point. I hate working to begin with. I always have. I'd almost rather be a bum.

3950,Relationship ended due to antiwork,"Hello everyone,

Found this thread a few days ago and really identified with it- I am feeling a lot less crazy now. I recently was dumped due to my attitude to work. I have worked since I graduated from college until relatively recently , when I quit a teaching job due to an absolutely toxic environment. I met my now ex gf, and we dated for a while. I was always attentive and we had great memories together-planned for the future etc. I always made it clear that my desire was to exit the workforce by starting a business or whatever. Anyway, made it clear that i thought the only point of work (or at least meaningless work) would be to be able to not work. This would always cause major arguments, and is eventually why she ended the relationship-claiming I was entitled for thinking I should be able to live a basic life without working to earn it. I went through a week or two of thinking I must just be an insane asshole, but now am feeling much better.

3970,Thoughts on tipped workers/industries,"I work as a dealer at a decent sized casino in the American Midwest. I have 12 years of casino experience. I deal blackjack, roulette, baccarat, craps, and any number of carnival games. I am proficeint at my job. I hold a bachelor's degree. I have been to Europe, North and Central America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. I have had the oportunity to see and do many things in my life thus far. I am not against productive endeavors. I see nothing wrong with wanting to have a little slice of the world to yourself. 

I don't like getting jerked around or taken advantage of. 

My employer provides me with minimum, state mandated pay and benefits. Therefore, I give them minimal credit. I do not love them nor do I hate them. I wish they would do better. They probably won't. So, fuck em.

I make an ok income for the area.

I work for tips. We call them tokes. My life falls on the hopes, prayers, and whims of John and Jane Q Public. Hopefully, John and Jane are happy, winning, and slightly intoxicated.

In keeping with industry standard, their pandemic response was of the minimum, state required kind as well. I can see the corporate lawyer in their office. ""Gotta make sure we comply with the letter of the law. Nothing more though."" 

We were open for more days than any other casino in the area during the pandemic.
Thankfully, John and Jane have been generous for a number of months. They have been six times more appreciative of my efforts than my employer since I started here in April. 

For every $7 I make, my employer kicks in a buck. The public gives me $6. 

Yes, my employer provides me with health benefits, 401K, insurance, etc. As stated above, they provide me with minimum, state required coverage on all fronts. Therefore, they get minimal credit. They would love to cut my benefits further, but they can't. I would love it if a number of my benefits weren't tied to my employer as well. I digress.

I have recently applied for a mortgage. I am hoping to purchase the closest thing to a home I ever had. My Dad's house. We have agreed on a price. I will pay below market value. He gets to walk away with a little coin in his pocket. We both get to start new chapters in our lives.

The loan application process has made something crystal clear. Tipped workers are worse than wage slaves.

The credit system only gives you partial credit for tipped income. Since it is in a sense discretionary income, banks do not assign it the same value as hourly or salaried income. While I can demonstrate a good total income for my area, one hang up the bank has is how much of my income is tied to tips. I brought this up with the representative from the credit union. I pointed out that I could take a floor supervisor's position. Currently, it would result in a five figure pay decrease. 

Atleast I'd be salaried though. 
That would look better. 
On paper.

It won't resolve the power imbalance between the working class and the wealthy.

We should advocate for the sabotage of workplaces over refusal to work.

Deliver  fewer services. Force your employers to fire you. Befriend your  co-workers and use your firings as opportunities to raise issues that go  unaddressed.

Society will collapse under the weight of consequences ignored by those in power.

We  don't have the ability to refuse to work, but we do have the  responsibility of pointing out the irresponsibility of our employers.

We need to use work as a cover for mutual-aid, clandestinely supporting fellow members of society from the office, from the work-site. 

Use corporate resources to help your fellow human being.

Showing solidarity like this, in front of your co-workers or as privately as possible, will gradually change the culture.

We don't have the infrastructure necessary to engage in a full blown strike.

3976,"""Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way"" - Alan Watts, on Work.","I think a lot of people either forget or try to ignore the fact that they are going to die one day. This becomes more evident when it comes to having a job, or when someone brings up the idea of how fucked up it is that generally you have to do something you dislike for most of your life, so you can keep living (which is mostly doing something you dislike). Most people have been so conditioned to the idea that you have to ""work hard"" to earn the right to live, which is ridiculous. We're all going to die one day so why do we (as a society) make the time we spend alive unnecessarily unenjoyable? We have the resources to take care of all of our basic needs without too much strain and yet, people frown at the idea of universal basic income. It's so sad that most people have been conditioned to love their slavery so much so that when they come across someone who doesn't want to be a slave they call them lazy and a leech, but why? We're all going to die, what's the point of spending our time alive chasing money, which is really only paper we choose to give value collectively? I honestly would rather die than live my life this way, because what would be the point? 

 Everyday I remind myself that I'm going to die one day, and when I face this fact, it becomes hard for me to waste my time doing something I hate for money (which has no ability to make me truly happy). In a better society, from a young age, children will be given the space to explore their talents and what they're passionate about so that when they grow up, that will be what they do for a living.

Labor shortage is stressing
out of restaurant
employees. And it may be
causing more to quit

JESSICA LANGER | NORTHJERSEY.COM |9
hours ago

oo f of &

 

During height of anaemic restaurant owner Chef
Am Round cut his staff practically, but now has been
retiring and training new staff.

AMY NEWMAN, NORTHJERSEY.COM

Michelle Georgescu, 18, had been working as a
server at Calandra’s Mediterranean Drill in
Fairfield for one month before she realized she
had enough.

The understaffed restaurant had been blocking
the new server for full-time hours when she
only wanted to be part time. The lack of
communication among workers, multiple
responsibilities she took on — including
working parties, running food and helping other
tables — and her nine-hour shifts left her
stressed and drained.

While she felt bad to leave the other
employees behind to take on more
responsibilities, Georgescu, a

recent graduate of Montville Township
High School, said she decided to choose
herself and her mental health first by
finding a new job.

Like Georgescu, restaurant employees
across North Jersey said they are struggling
to compensate for the labor shortage,
experiencing increased levels of stress and
anxiety because of it.

I noticed when clients came, she would ask for an advance of several hundreds of euros to starts with. And only of the first bill. A lawyer usually sends multiple bills.

3988,A 91 year old prediction about working hours,"&gt;I look forward, therefore, in days not so very remote, to the greatest change which has ever occurred in the material environment of life for human beings 
in the aggregate. But, of course, it will all happen gradually, not as a catastrophe. Indeed, it has already begun. The course of affairs will simply be that there will be ever larger and larger classes and groups of people from whom problems of economic necessity have been practically removed. The critical difference will be realised when this condition has become so general that the nature of one’s duty to one’s neighbour is changed. For it will remain 
reasonable to be economically purposive for others after it has ceased to be reasonable for oneself.

3995,"I finally have the opportunity to stop working for the rest of the year, what should I do to keep it that way?","TL;DR I quit my job due to burnout. I am financially sound with little to no debt. What should I do? 

**Current Situation**

I've been suffering from severe burnout caused by years and years of sales jobs with little to no breaks. My wife finally convinced me to quit and take some time off since I've been diagnosed with severe depression that has greatly affected me over the past few years since I graduated college. Today is my last day at my job, and I don't have another job lined up because I want to take as much time as I need to recover and get better. I'm so thankful to be able to do this, I understand how rare it is for anyone to be able to do this. It dawned on me that I've been presented with an amazing opportunity: I think I have the time and means to exit the workforce permanently.

**Current Finance**

Right now, the only debt I have is a mortgage with a very low interest rate. I pay off my credit cards each month, I have no auto loans, or any other loans for that matter. I have $20k+ in the bank as well as $60k+ in 401(k) accounts. From my perspective, I am financially sound/stable. My wife still works at her job although she doesn't make enough to keep us afloat without dipping into our savings.

**My Background**

I have a bachelor's degree in marketing with a focus in sales, as well as general business administration. In the past I've ran my own LLC as a property manager. I live in a place where tourism is extremely popular in the summer months, and I have a long history in this community (born and raised). I have lots of family members who live here, some of which have good connections into various industries (primarily fossil fuels and hospitality/tourism). 

**Help?**

I don't even know where to start. I want to make a plan to keep us afloat without needing for me to rejoin the workforce. I'm open to all suggestions of what things I can do here. Entrepreneurship, investment, something completely wild and crazy, you name it!

4014,So done with my broken brain,"So I recently got a new WFH job. It pays better than my last job, the schedule is a bit better, the people have all been really cool, I like my direct supervisor, and the job itself, while fairly intense, isn't something I hate doing. It's a call center role, but far less stringent than I'm used to. So it really isn't that bad, especially since it's WFH.

Here's the thing. My depression has gotten fucking horrible lately. Like, really, really bad. I've been just trying to fight through it and log in and do my job every day, but it is really, really fucking hard to maintain that personable, professional demeanor on call after call when all I can think of is how fucking mad I am that I didn't die in my sleep again. I actually got a mini vacation over the weekend, got to go visit a friend a couple states over, and I enjoyed the hell out of myself, which made the crash back to reality all that much more painful.

I've missed a lot of work this week. I've also been sick, which is probably partially a fucking product of my brain not being normal. I don't even think this job is that bad, but when it gets like this it's a struggle to get up and take a shower. I haven't gotten any warnings or anything yet, but there is no way they're going to just write this off since I haven't worked here very long. I fucking wish it wasn't impossible to get on disability for this shit. It is LITERALLY DISABLING. And when I do log in and force my way through it, I make so many fucking mistakes it would honestly probably be better for me to just not be there at all. Yesterday I fucked up basic privacy because I couldn't focus. That shit could have easily gotten me canned on the spot. But if I can't somehow get through this bs, I'll probably end up fired anyway. And then I'll truly be fucked. No income, no insurance (even though I won't have any for another couple months anyway), no hope.

4015,How do I deal with my work ethic? Please read the rest,"Alright, this is a throwaway as my main has identifiable information. 

**Background** I have the job that I targeted after graduating college. It took me 5 years of ""give everything"" to get here after I graduated. Now it isn't the greatest job in the world but it is something I thought would be doable for me as a career. There is no such thing as a dream job in my opinion, I'd much rather have my time to do as I please every day without having to work to afford my hobbies but I haven't figured out how yet. The money is decent and I live in a very cheap cost of living area so I'm very stable. My health benefits are top notch and my retirement is fantastic (I get a pension and a 401k). So financially all is well as long as I can finish my 30 years (I still have most of them to go). I am only required to work 40 hours per week and I also can work a little under that if I dedicate time to improving my health during those hours. I also get plenty of sick time and over 4 weeks of vacation per year. So my job benefits are actually great, I'm far and away luckier than nearly everyone around me and yet here I am posting to this sub. It also makes it extremely difficult to even think about leaving because I'll never find something that compares.

**Content** I have a strong work ethic and once I get going on a project I will work myself down until I have absolutely nothing left to give. I end up doing this regularly during work hours but it burns me out and doesn't leave energy for my partner, my dog, or my hobbies all of which are very important to me. 

**Questions** Those of you with physically demanding jobs, how do you find energy after work for non work projects or activities or hobbies? How can I let myself feel ok with not giving my best effort during my 40? I still do my job but I'm interested in just trying less hard. My salary isn't changed whether I do the job or do the job so well that I'm considered one of the best. But my mental state suffers when I try less hard and with poor mental health my energy goes down anyway defeating the purpose of trying less hard. Does that make sense.

The issue I’m having right now is that my boss is trying to justify hiring another person by meticulously tracking me and my daily progress.  This involves me tracking with a timer each of my tasks and reporting back with the results.

My tasks vary quite a bit, and each task itself can vary slightly, so the times I provided are not always 100% accurate for every situation, but close.

4030,Written 100 years ago. How little has changed,"When the worker gets his first job the world about him takes off its mask. He sees it as it is. Hours are long and most work is monotonous. Any child or young person naturally very much dislikes this first harsh experience of the world of the working class. His games and fun-making are given up. His physical growth is stunted and his mind dwarfed more or less. Long ago nearly all of the young men who went to work for wages, began by learning a trade. This trade was very often extremely interesting to them. It educated their minds and developed their bodies. If they were apprenticed at eighteen, then, perhaps at twenty one, they were sure of steady work and good wages. Today very few of the working people learn a trade. They work in some factory, store or office at tasks which they perform as well in a month as they do in ten years. If the young wage earner is vigorous in mind and body he revolts at this labor and makes a desperate struggle to secure an education or otherwise make it possible for himself to rise out of the working class. The stronger and healthier his body and the keener his mind, the harder does he fight. But he finds, except in very rare instances, that the doors of opportunity are closed to the children of the workers.

If the young worker learns one of the trades which still remain in modern industry, he finds after he has learned it that it also is being abolished by the invention of new machinery. He may go to night school and complete a course of study, or take a correspondence course in mechanics or some other form of applied science. If he does he will discover that his knowledge, gotten at such sacrifice of time, savings and effort, will not raise his wages. There are now so many educated poor people that their pay is on the average much less than that of skilled workers in the trades. Another hope of the young workers, men and women, is to save money and start in some small business. Others have risenI and become wealthy. Why not they? So, by giving up all pleasures, by overwork and pitiful economies, does the young worker make his start in business. If he has been fortunate enough not to lose his money through, some bank swindle, he at last, after years of effort, tries his luck. The best data we have show that more than nine-tenths of those who engage in small business fail utterly. The small portion who ""succeed"" do so by working night and day, Sundays and holidays. Even they make but meager livings, no better on the average than the wage-workers.

The hearts and minds of nearly all young American working people are full of hope. They cannot conceive that it would be possible for them to toil on throughout their lifetime 'for small wages and every day find the work getting harder. They do not at first realize what it is to be a wage-worker. They are unmarried and hence often have a little more money than is absolutely necessary to keep them. This the young workers usually spend for good clothes and for an occasional holiday. The daily grind of labor has not yet deadened their minds nor crushed their spirits. Plans for advancement are constantly being formed.

Then come marriage and responsibility for a family. Perhaps the care of aged parents adds to the burden. In any case by the time the worker is twenty-five years of age he has lost his grip on his hope for something better. At thirty, with growing burdens, he gets to be quite content to work along day by day without looking forward to anything but his Saturday pay envelope. He is likely to be afflicted by some chronic illness due to the nature of his work or the insanitary condition of his factory or home. Perhaps illness in his family, or the birth of a number of children, so increase his burden that his struggle becomes a pitiless daily conflict to live.At thirty-five years of age these conditions, coupled with occasional unemployment, drive the worker often to despair. But later he gets used to it. Poor food, shoddy clothing, a shack to live in, unemployment-these are his lot in life and he makes the best of it. The old saying of the poet, ""Hope springs eternal in the human breast,"" is not at all true of the working people of today. In them hope dies. At forty or fifty years of age the average worker plods along rather carelessly. If he suffers an injury in the factory he eats without worry the bread of charity. which, twenty years before, he would have despised. lie knows that he cannot educate his children. lie may see them go early to work and injure their health. But he is so happy to receive their weekly wage to help out at home that he forgets that they are young and should be at play or at school.

This man is exactly what the owners and rulers of America now wish him to be. He is strong enough to do the work they want done. He does not demand vacations and amusement, a better home and education for his children. So he will not strike for more wages. The vast majority of the American working people over forty years of age cannot be made to understand their condition. Life for them has lost all light and beauty and hence all desire for more of its good things. Quite as hopeless is the 'state of mind of some of the younger workers. A portion of these, born of parents broken And weary from work, and themselves underfed and sent early to factories, are as careless about their conditions of life as are their parents. But with a majority of the young and a considerable minority of the older folks this is not true. They want more wages and less work. They desire rest and leisure, a chance to know their family and friends better, and an occasional vacation in the country. They wish to read, hear good musicand go to theaters. Above all they crave better food and more of it and they know that their limbs are stiff because of the lack of enough rest and exercise.

To such, and such only, are the following pages addressed. Those who are utterly broken in body and decayed in mind, those who are deadened beyond being moved by the facts of life, those who think that they somehow deserve all the labor and pain and misery of the world and that a few others should enjoy plenty and peace and opportunity, we earnestly request to at once pass this booklet along to someone else. For it can be of no interest to themselves.

We see today a working class bowed down by labor. We see it starved by poverty. We see all its efforts to improve its condition met by blows in the face. We see babies dying because their parents cannot support them. We see tender children enslaved because they toil for low wages. We see strong men committing crimes because they cannot find masters. We see the aged, after lives of long and loving service, begging for bread and craving death.

Socialism is a message of hope. It is addressed to the working class. It will save the working class, or rather, show the working class how to save itself. The world does not need to be cursed by long labor, by low wages, by starvation, by worry, and by disease. Millions now know that these conditions may be completely changed. When enough of the workers understand Socialism, believe in it, and are firmly resolved to have it, the time will be ripe for the change. That change is coming. It is coming soon Every added recruit who will read and think. brings it nearer.

""On we march then, we the workers and the rumor that ye hear Is the blended sound of battle and deliv'rance drawing near; For the hope of every creature is the banner that we bear, And the world is marching on.""

4049,Getting more radicalised by the minute.,"I’m a genetic counsellor (BSc and MGCouns) with cPTSD, ADHD and chronic pain/illness. Despite all this, I have clawed my way into a helping profession that ticks as many boxes as it can for me in the system we’re in. 

I got a glowing performance review a few weeks ago. Great. I wanted to really take the opportunity to think of strategies to work even better, and I could see and openly discussed many areas of improvement, mostly around organisation and time management (especially with a new ADHD diagnosis). 

After a week of leave, without any warning or discussion, I come back to a punitive PIP that strips me of all but one responsibility, forces me on site after WFH for 12 months, requires me to log how I use every minute of my day, and cuts my hours. If I don’t meet these requirements 80% of the time over 12 weeks, they’ll sack me.

I am shattered and so so angry. My manager has always been wonderful and encouraged me to be open about my health and personal life, which has recently involved me cutting my very toxic family off and intensive therapy for trauma recovery.

After the PIP meeting, I took two weeks stress leave because it just sent me into a tailspin, especially given there was no clear explanation and my manager’s demeanour had completely changed. It’s all HR speak now. How can a profession that preaches non-judgment and unconditional positive regard dehumanise someone like this? 

I honestly don’t know how I can go back knowing that this is essentially what is underneath the veneer of giving a shit, and that these requirements will negatively impact the care I’m able to give to patients. I have spoken to my union and they were great (no plan yet), but I’m just at a loss and becoming more and more enraged that most of us have to have a boot on our neck (and seem happy about it) to survive.

The whole time I tried to be pleasant and said that it was a good learning experience and I know what to do now.

4098,I Hate It Here.,"I just need to vent. I'm technically pretty lucky. I have a decent job that I'm good at, isn't too stressful, and pays very well. The only problem is that it's a completely pointless activity. It creates nothing enduring or significant and requires maybe 30% of my ability to do well. In my current job, my self respect is chipped away a little more every day, but at least I'll never have money issues working there. (My mental health is eroding day by day.)

I want to contribute something truly valuable to others and feel like the work I do makes a difference. I'm furious today because I'm planning a very expensive educational decision to make a huge career shift, and I feel paralyzed by the fact that my dream job (mental health counselor) pays less than half on average than my current bullshit complete-waste-of-my-life job (analytics) right now. Add to all this that many of the masters programs I'm looking at can cost about as much as I make in a year in my **current** job. Isn't that just shitty?!?! 

I'm furious that this economy punishes people who truly want to serve and coerces people with  constant debt to do bullshit jobs to make ends meet or to thrive a little bit. I'm furious that I may have to sacrifice security, financial freedom, and healthcare coverage to shift to a career that is actually rewarding for me. I'm gathering the courage slowly, but it's gonna suck so much. 

 I do want to work, like I'm sure many of us do. I want to help make a better society. I want to shape the world I live in, but it may be a long time before I can afford it.

4107,My company is having its managers buy shopping bags for the stores. (Question),"Sorry if this isn't meant to be posted here. 

Is that allowed? I work at a beauty supply store in southern Illinois. Only licensed cosmetologists can shop here, so we're not a major shopping experience for the town. But over the last two months, my specific store hasn't recieved shopping bags from our warehouse. It's lead to us using boxes for customer's items, or reusing bags another customer brought in (Which is a terrible idea because of covid). At this same time we haven't recieved banking deposit bags, receipt paper, or paper towels. 

We've explained to the district manager and the regional manager how we're out of these supplies but they've kept us on read. Literally, there's a group chat on the company iPad with all the managers (that everyone can read) and multiple stores have expressed how they have no bags/receipt paper/deposit bags/etc. And neither manager has commented on it. I'm assuming it's because if they comment then they'll be held liable to actually get something done. 

My co-worker called our tech support about what if we don't have receipt paper, and he explained it would make our store non-operation. He have us a ticket number and explained if we got the receipt paper we'd be owed a payout. I got my payout. 

But! These store managers have also expressed that they had to go out and buy their own supplies (and a store told us she had used over $300 in Amazon gift cards to buy over 6 stores shopping bags.) We put our for down about buying bags.  I'm assuming this is all technically allowed because the regional and district managers haven't explicitly said for us to buy or own bags, but this entire situation feels out of bounds. Like, Wal-Mart wouldn't ask their own workers to buy bags, right? Am I over thinking this situation or is this a reasonable concern? I don't think anyone could get a payout since the company never asked anyone to buy these supplies, but...idk.",False,oyn9z4,AlbatrossWingspan,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oyn9z4/my_company_is_having_its_managers_buy_shopping/,5,1

Based on how I've seen him treat another senior engineer on the team, he treats her worse than me. He has often spoken to her aggressively, raised his voice at her, blamed her, etc. I've also heard him get aggressive, raise his voice at, and blame another senior engineer on the team

I've been trying to leave this job by interviewing elsewhere for the past year with no luck. I think I'll eventually land another offer within the next few months, but I can't guarantee it. So I've been devoting my time and efforts to study for those interviews since I'm aiming for jobs in CS, so the interviews are very technical. 

From what I've researched, it sounds like it may not be a great idea to just confront him now and call him out on his unprofessionalism. Also, if I were to complain to HR or his supervisor, then I could end up looking bad and maybe even get fired. Apparently the best thing to do is to get another offer, and in my resignation letter, mention all the instances this boss has been unprofessional

4136,Western Countries are all Dictatorships,"By virtue of the corporate structure of their companies.  This is not a comment on the state of these countries, but a comment on their structure, you can have very advanced dictatorships relative to other places.  Nazi Germany was also a corporate run dictatorship that was relatively advanced compared to their neighbors.

Western liberals love to smugly point out how ""democratic"" their countries while ignoring the reality:

1. Most of us spend the majority of our working hours earning the means to exist from an unaccountable, privately owned entity at a job.  These are dictatorships, since you do not have any input or true bargaining power on how these entities that control your access to food and housing are run, for better or for worse.  If you even attempt to unite with workers to excise some democratic power in this arrangement you are liable to be blacklisted from ever getting a job again.

2. The power of private entities (again, dictatorships) dwarf the power of any representative government in the west.  Not only do they lobby your government with bargaining power millions of times more valuable than any vote, they build your roads, manage your utilities and healthcare, institute surveillance programs, and manage publically funded research and development like space exploration.

3. They do all of this without any mandate to rule or any period of proving to the public that they are competent managers.  They are given all of this administrative power simply by the fact that they have been successful in some market.",False,oz6221,capnbarky,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oz6221/western_countries_are_all_dictatorships/,28,1

4157,Return to Monke,"Gradually, through agriculture and slavery, through the division of
labor and the inherent diversity of men, the comparative equality of
natural society was replaced by inequality and class divisions. “In the
Primitive group we find as a rule no distinction between slave and free,
no serfdom, no caste, and litre if any distinction between chief and
followers."" Slowly the increasing complexity of tools and trades sub-
jested the unskilled or weak to the skilled or strong; every invention was
a new weapon in the hands of the strong, and further strengthened them
in their mastery and use of the weak.* Inheritance added superior upper-
unity to superior possessions, and stratified once homogeneous societies
into s made of classes and cases. Rich and poor became disruptively
conscious of wealth and poverty; the class war began to run as a red
thread through all history; and the state arose as an indispensable insert-
men for the regulation of classes, the protection of property, the waging
of war, and the organization of peace.

4165,I put in my two weeks but I don’t know if I can make it,"I’ve been working at a private OB/GYN office for five and a half years as an administrative assistant. They call it quirky; I call it dysfunctional. It got worse over time, and I should’ve quit before, but now it’s become more urgent.

I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in October of 2018 after six years of unexplained symptoms. My commute used to “only” be an hour and ten on the bus, but my life has changed, and I moved to my first ever one bedroom apartment last September. At first, I could rationalize it, and my drive to work was an hour from door to door. Now that everyone has returned to work in-person, that commute time has shot up to an hour and forty five to two hours one way. It became completely unbearable as a result.

I fell into an profound depression. I stopped exercising, stopped eating well, stopped hobbies. I didn’t have the energy for anything; I still don’t. I’d crawl into bed just to get up the next day for work, snoozing my alarm until the last minute at 6:30 before piling my corpse into my car to arrive at my job for 8:30, unless multiple car crashes on the highway delayed me even further.

I’m fortunate enough to have now found a new job 15mins from home and I have it in writing. It’s a $4.50 raise and BCBS for insurance after 30 days. I put my two weeks in on Thursday, and I start on 8/24, just after my medication infusion. What I’m struggling with now is that I am still suicidal, and the fact that pain from MS (exacerbated by sitting in my fucking car for 3-4hours/day) is now unbearable. Because I’m sedentary, I can’t walk a city block without extreme pain. I know all professional advice says “yes, you need to finish your two weeks”, but my body screams. I cry every day. All of this for $17.65/hour in New England - what the fuck is wrong with me that I let it go on this long?

I don’t know if I can make it. I don’t even know if I should, medically. I want to start moving again, reminding my muscles how we used to move, stretching, resting as needed, and not flooding my body with cortisol during my commute. I feel like a weakling, like I should just power through. I’m so close to being done. But every night I go home, and my kitchen utensils turn into weapons that I resist.

I don’t know what to do. I hate that the threat of looking bad to some future employer keeps me in this state.",False,oxznta,uglyorganbycursive,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oxznta/i_put_in_my_two_weeks_but_i_dont_know_if_i_can/,9,1
4166,I hate how depressed work makes me,"So I've never really had good luck with jobs, and long story short: after having a severe mental breakdown and being forced to leave a position for both my physical and mental health (almost three years later and still feeling the shit that job did to my body). I was a university drop out and was heading nowhere fast --I didn't even want to live.

After this event I managed to find a grant that fit my situation and went back to school where I officially graduated from a Web and Software Development program. My uncle even gave me a part time position at his business during this, and now this job is the source of a lot of frustration and feelings of being taken advantage of.

Other than the owners and the owner's son, I am the most senior member of staff now. I have learned every aspect of that business (seriously, I have written all of their Standard Operating Procedures). They throw me from position to position to do whatever they want at a whim's notice. And above all that, they gave me a ""special project"" of redesigning and developing their new website.

Now, you would think the website thing would be a good thing, and I thought so too. But it's a job worth $10,000, and I ended up getting paid 800 for it. The website is working out for him too; it has increased customer conversion by 400% since its launch a few months ago, AND they are now front page google search. 

This all sounds like pretty good work despite being taken advantage of for a website, right? Well, I am the least paid there. And half of the things I do, the operations manager gets the credit, despite him having done nothing for the task. For example, I was once in charge of getting a delinquent customer to pay their $120,000 bill. This took a week of work communicating with the customer and developing a strategy plan and implementing a new software into our business. I then trained everyone in the business on the software, and payments started coming through. That friday I remember my uncle going to the operations manager happy and exclaiming, ""Good job, NAME! You deserve praise for this one.""

And because I probably have way more access to their business than what they realize, I also know that after a month of working with us (he was hired in November), the operations manager got a Christmas bonus of $2000 cash. While I was given $100 prepaid visa. And I don't want to sound like I am complaining about a bonus, but I feel absolutely worthless and tossed to the side. 

And my uncle is the type of man to yell. He has never given raises to workers who ask, and quite frankly I am trying to find a job in my field. And here is why I'm starting to get even more depressed.

I have applied to an insane amount of jobs. I have had countless people read over my resume. I even have the live site, plus other web projects for an alright portfolio. I just get rejection after rejection after rejection. I don't know what to do, and I have been having a terrible day. I needed to get this off of my chest, and I've already bugged all of my friends too much with this.

I just feel so hopeless and like nothing I do to try and improve my life will ever work because of how greedy and terrible every job is.",False,oxryzn,DeeRegs,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oxryzn/i_hate_how_depressed_work_makes_me/,19,1

I will express that I am burnt out, get treated poorly, and am unhappy every day. But everyone says I HAVE to stay since I have no other income right now... I actually can go get another job if I want, just haven't found one I want. I sorta have a plan to maybe quit my job this month and do some contract work to allow me the flexibility to do more job interviews. But everyone tells me to think carefully before I make my decision and give away stability. I think about it for 9 hours every day at work as I get reprimanded or do the job of 3 individuals who were laid off. I can't take it and all these people inforcing their opinions are driving me crazy. None of these people who have given me advice have worked a corporate office job or work in my industry. I'm just upset and not sure what to do next since everyone just doubts me! I want to leave this job, I know that. I know I have the option to go do this contract job, just might not offer 40 hours every single week... but I won't know unless I give it a shot.

Today was the day everything got to be too much. I was taking care of customers, and it seemed everyone in town wanted our food and everyone was in a bad mood. I was tired, overwhelmed, stressed, and anxious and everything in between.

For better context into my mental health, I have multiple severe diagnosed anxiety and depressive disorders that aren't being treated because I'm not paid enough to get treatment. Back when I was in therapy, my therapist told me that my only choices were to either be on medicine or be hospitalised. I did neither because I couldn't afford it. My mental illness makes it difficult to function on a daily basis, but I try my best to make it through every day and take care of myself. 

Well, a customer complained and I went back to fix the order so there wasn't going to be a fuss. It was a small complaint that didn't need to be made into a big deal. But, of course, my boss tries to make everything I do into a reason to scream at me. He had already yelled at me right before that for another thing. But then he was yelling at me more about this, saying how dare I fix an order for free. (Even though that's what they tell us at training? The customer is always right and we need to fix orders for free??) 

I broke down and said, i can't do this anymore, and next thing I know I'm curled up on the floor of the men's toilet sobbing like a baby. A ton of customers and my co-workers saw the entire thing. Afterwards he ignored me all day but acted really fake nice towards everyone else. He's like a petty, passive aggressive child in a man's body.

There's a lot of other worse things that happen there. Many of my co-workers have gotten heat stroke and the boss doesn't care. We regularly have people get sick. A girl once cut herself and bled everywhere, she had to keep making food and I just had to mop up her blood. Employees who menstruate aren't allowed to take a break to change their sanitary products. We're not allowed to stop at all and if we even hesitate for a moment to keep our hands busy we're screamed at. I've been told that I don't deserve my paycheck. 

There's a lot of hard, physical labour in this job and every day my back muscles ache horrifically and everything hurts. We all have burns and cuts and bruises everywhere. I had an old hip injury that healed and doesn't bother me much anymore, except when I work long hours. Then it flares up again and I start limping around like an old man. 

There's also weird, dystopian signs on the walls that say things like «laziness is a symptom of dead minds, customers sense dead minds, don't be lazy.» and other odd things. It's just a strange, miserable place.

I was looking forward to only having to do a short shift tomorrow but they just called me while I was writing this saying I have to do a longer, later shift tomorrow. I'm currently crying again.  

I may struggle with my mental health but I can say one good thing about myself and that's that I'm a good, creative, smart person. I had goals of becoming an artist, and living a happy, fulfilling life. But this culture of work and mistreatment has worn me down. Capitalism has worn me down. I'm a bitter, mean person now. I snap at my people that I love. I cry at the blink of an eye. I'm too tired and drained to paint, and when I do it doesn't suit to make money off of so I cry and throw it away. I don't pursue my hobbies anymore because they don't make me money. I don't sleep much. 

Someday I think we can all have a better life. I've even had an idea to track little steps I've taken towards anti-capitalism. It won't be much but if you guys want maybe I can make a monthly post about what I've done. I want to see what actions you guys take too. Let's make it a thing. Let's inspire other people to both better their situation and help other people better theirs. I don't think that's so unrealistic. 

I know a lot of you on this sub have it way worse but I wanted to share what I was going through. I hate this job so much but I don't really have any other jobs lined up although I'm looking. As soon as I get hired somewhere else I'm out without hesitation. I wish I could quit right now but I have bills to pay. 

I ask myself every day, all this for fast food? I don't care what capitalism says, this suffering isn't necessary. This is not furthering the human race. This is making people, particularly young people, angry and disillusioned and miserable. This is destroying the planet and people.

4196,"Quit my job today, felt SOOOO good.","I had requested thursdays off over a month ago so I could see my therapist regularly. work started delibratly giving me work on thursdays to try and prevent me from seeing my therapist.

I had to fight work to see my therapist, which was only causing me MORE stress. 2 weeks ago I called up and quit, only to have my supervisor call and beg me to stay, promising me I'd have my thursdays off. Alright, everything seemed good, for one week.

Today I got a phonecall ""We have 2 shifts for you, 12 hours each, tonight (wednesday) and tomorrow night (thursday) overnight.)""

I grabbed my uniform and drove into the office and was like ""here's my uniform, here's my security license. I quit.""

I called the supervisor to let him know I dropped off my uniform and was like ""I'm done, find someone else. I want my thursdays, I'm getting my thursdays""

He gave me some bullshit about how the other supervisor (there's 2 of them, they are brothers, it is impossible to tell them apart on the phone) thought that I was supposed to have wednesdays off (still tried to give me work on wednesday, so that doesn't make sense) but I was driving away from the office by this point (phone is hands free)

""Okay, don't care. uniform is turned in. I'm done.""

I am sooooo glad to be done with this company. They are really shady and not worth the stress. If I were in a marriage that caused me as much stress as this job I'd divorce my wife, so of course I'm dumping this fucking job.

I was poached to move and take a significantly higher paying job in this field and although it wasn’t mentioned in the interview, I was asked to sign a non-compete after I got the ball rolling to move and take this job.

Now just to put it simply: 6 months of ***quality training*** would set you up well to grow in this field. I had been in it for 3 years by this point.

I’m not gonna rail on non-compete clauses exactly, I understand there are cases when a company has specific and legitimate interests at hand for them. But here there was no “secret sauce” or special gadgets that would be of value.

Naturally the job went south quick and I was reminded I was limited to not working in the same field for 6 months or within a certain radius of the business.

It’s just bullshit that owners think they can lock you out of an industry just because you’re not willing to stay and take the abuse. If you have the experience in a certain field, you should be able to continue in it. Not get forced into accepting something much lower because of a legal enforcement. 

The story does have a good ending though. Nothing legally prohibited me from doing the service work on an unofficial basis.

4224,Mother in law told me to go back to work.,"So my wife got a job driving for an Amazon delivery service partner. She likes the job. Her boss is a good guy that seems truly interested in taking care of his employees and a bunch of his family works there, good atmosphere at work. She likes the exercise and is pretty good at resisting pressure and just does her job one at a time without stressing, a good fit for her.

The main reason she got the job is because our family needs medical insurance. We have two kids still at home and they have mental health issues, depression and anxiety. I was telling my mother in law that in my old job (union craft trades) I did not realize how good I had it with medical insurance. I could not believe how expensive it is at other jobs.

The ACA otherwise known as Obamacare says you have to provide employees with affordable insurance but leaves out family members, it costs a fortune to insure family members and it doesn't cover much. I estimated that with premiums and copays and deductibles for a family with kids that have mental health issues and need to go to counseling once a week it would cost $20,000 out of pocket each year. My wife makes $37,000 per year and I have a pension that is $9,000 per year. 

My mother in law told me I have to go back to work, I am too young to retire. So basically I tell MIL we can't afford insurance and her response is ""make more money so you can"".

I am just wow with this comment. Lots of craft trades retire younger than some jobs because it is so physically demanding. How is a 60 something supposed to keep up with 20 and 30 somethings at work and even if you are still physically able to do it the odds of having something happen that not only would be career ending but also messing up your ability to be active at all after finally retiring are much higher. There is a reason laborer's can retire at 50, you might be young enough to go do something else but if you keep laboring you will wear out your body or break it down.",False,oxusyg,Upper_Vehicle7104,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oxusyg/mother_in_law_told_me_to_go_back_to_work/,14,1

I only worked part time hours but she expected me to do things in my spare time too. As did her family. She also reduced my pay without informing me. Anyway, I quietly quit with a fake excuse. I don’t stick about being a slave for shit money, I’d rather get by on a little (and I know how to!) and have my sanity and free time. 

I’m meant to be starting a new zero hour role doing something I’m actually interested in but the on boarding hasn’t happened yet... I’ve reopened my Universal credit claim to make sure I have some sort of income for food and necessities until I start my new casual role. I know with the old JSA system you had to wait 8 weeks to get money if you left a job, but is it the same with UC? Or have the rules changed with the pandemic? I don’t want to have to state why I’ve left because I know they’ll possibly open up some sort of case. Many years ago when I was 17 I worked with a load of older guys who would have explicit sexual conversations all day and would ask me really, really embarrassing intimate questions. I left that role and signed on too and told them why but got asked for specific dates and times of incidents before my JSA claim was processed. As a shy introvert that wants as little attention as possible, this was hell.

The pay is just slightly above being pay check to paycheck. I just know in the future it will get worse when I have 15+ clients to tend to.

I’m afraid my DR may have to increase my BP meds because the stress is getting worse. I have lost 10lbs and have been eating healthier but the anxiety and stress is through the roof. This all occurred within the span of two months and was stress induced.

4296,Going to stop being a pushover for once,"Recently started work at a local chain bowling alley.

Got my rota for next week today to find out I'm doing 50 hours all close shifts bar one. Well for once I'm sick of it, I always take these shit shifts because of the fear of dissapointing people or fucking people over but for once I'm tired of being fucked over. I'd like to actually get home before 1am once, I'd like for my first 2 hours of work not just to pay off getting a taxi to leave work, I'd like to just be able to enjoy my free time for once.

So I'm gonna say I can't do all the shifts they've asked me to, sure I'll do some of them but I'm going to not ask, but state that I can't work some of the ones they've given me and if they can't find cover that's their fault for being understaffed.

4300,The time I worked at a call center…,"One year I started January with no job and no money, so I got myself a gig in a warehouse, which lasted 6 weeks. It was a weird warehouse in a very old building, close to a subway station, with plenty of nooks and crannies to explore so it was interesting. But hardly a good job.

Meanwhile I look for other jobs, and when the warehouse gig was over, I got called to work in a call center for a cell phone company. Yay. Office work.

Three weeks into training, I got called in the middle of the shift and told to go home while they ""investigate"" me.

Three days later, they call me into the office where a nervous guy I never saw before tells me that I was fired for things I never have done and it was obvious that the guy had no idea either what he was talking about. 

The kid was obviously fresh off the boat from Africa and then it dawned on me that manglement was coward enough to have their firing done by underlings… So I got up, told the kid that they always give the shitty jobs to immigrants and gave him a hug (like they do in Africa), and I left.

When I got home, as I put my key in the lock, the phone rang. It was a recruiter with a job for IBM, which I got, and where it went very well while it lasted, so there is no point talking about it here… (But it was cool one day passing in front of the call center and seeing my old boss on a smoke break outside, and telling him I worked at IBM now and showing him my work laptop - which I had to bring home in case I would have to work from home...

4301,Yep. Fuck this.,"My job is bullshit. On paper, I am a finish carpenter. I get up at 5 AM, typically drive an hour or more and somehow STILL get stuck in traffic, and arrive at whatever job site I've been assigned. OH, and I often don't know if I'm working at all, or where, until, like, 9 PM the night before. Anyway. My hourly rate is dependent on my company's negotiations with the client. If a client has less than favorable things to say, it leads to lower rates with future clients. 

These clients are contractors who do not, and will not, take the time to get to know me or my skill set, so any mistake leads to them bitching to my rep about how much they're paying. Basically, I need to blow them away on day one, but if they only have me doing bullshit grunt work, then they're never going to see what I can do, and if I have questions about more complex projects, they have incentive to interpret it as a lack of knowledge because it has the potential to save them money.

There have apparently been complaints about me from two clients, so far. The first guy was already paying more than my theoretical minimum, and had me doing some pretty advanced stuff. I asked a lot of questions because I'd never worked with him before and I wanted to know how HE liked things done. In the end he was satisfied with my work. He then turned around and told my rep that I had the makings of a good carpenter, but I wasn't worth what he was paying. 

The second guy literally had me sweeping the floor half the time. He treated me like a helper, rather than a skilled professional. There is absolutely no way he could have any frame of reference for what I can do, based on what he saw over the course of a week, but he said basically the same thing as the first guy. Just to recap: this man hired a finish carpenter, exclusively had me doing stuff that ANYONE could do, and then bitched about paying too much. That's like ordering the prime rib, eating the whole thing, and then complaining it was overcooked and demanding a refund.

And now my rep is saying he's going to have a hard time selling clients on me without lowering my rate. I already hated this job. The only reason I didn't quit on the spot is I'm still working on my OSHA certification, which the company pays for. I figure I can leverage that into something that sucks a little less.",False,oxo46g,Outrageous_Detail135,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oxo46g/yep_fuck_this/,6,1
4302,"I'm 24, lost, and confused. Please help me.","I need to vent. I have been crying every night trying to figure out what to do. I feel like I am slowly wasting away at my internship. At first, I was happy to be using my degree but now I hate it. I hate commuting. I hate working 40 hours a week when I'm only really working 5 hours a day. Every night I scroll through LinkedIn and Indeed looking for something else, but I am afraid it will all just be the same shit. I feel like I'm going crazy. I have zero savings. It took everything for me to move out here, so I can't just leave with no backup plan.

I had always hoped for a job that is chill/relaxed, engaging, straightforward, pays decently, and gives good time off. It just seems like all these jobs I am not qualified for. I have been toying with going back to school to get my MSAcc (Master's in Accounting) to get more experience and get more competitive, but this takes time. I would need to finish prereqs at a CC while continuing to work. I don't even know how loans work. But I feel like going back to school to get my MSAcc would allow me to grow my financial skills and that it would open more doors than my measly Comms degree.

I just don't know what to do. I cannot move home, so I need to be able to pay for myself and support myself and that is the bottom line. But as I work this internship, I feel like I am wasting away, bored and not learning anything new. I am hoping another adult with a few years of life experience will impart their wisdom to me, because I am struggling. To make matters worse, I met a boy. I feel I can't because I am just not stable enough, emotionally/financially, and it is such a wake-up call. **If anybody has any words of advice to share,** ***I thank you.***",False,oxscdd,mindonthepath,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oxscdd/im_24_lost_and_confused_please_help_me/,1,1

4318,Something to laugh at…,"I had a chuckle this afternoon. The company I work for has a tendency to leave things to the last minute. Like this event that has been happening over the last few weeks. We are moving from one warehouse, to another and as usual they have left it to the last minute. We have to be out of the warehouse in 24 hours, and the amount of stock that has to be moved is equivalent to almost 30 semi loads. 

Management has known about it for weeks and has not put it in the daily planning. So from this afternoon they were scrambling to organise trucks etc. Most of us work in 8 or 12 hour shifts. Warehouse, office and forklift operators are 8 hours, truck drivers are 12 hours. 

This afternoon at 14:30 the hoist loader finishes loading a truck, parks the hoist and walks out(his shift ended at 14:30, started at 6:00, so 8 hours plus 30min break)
There was 3 trucks waiting in line to get loaded(at about 30-40min loading time per truck)

Right as he walks out our operations manager walks in, asks him where he is going. He says home, his shift ended. Manager loses his shit, saying we have 24hours to be out of the warehouse, everyone is expected to do their part and extra to get the company though this. 

Loader calmly looks at him and says:

Lack of planning on your side does not constitute an emergency on mine. I have to pick my kid up from school, you have not asked or arranged beforehand for me to stay late, so I am going. 

Turns around and walks out, get in his car and drives off. The rest of us chuckle and get in our trucks to continue waiting. Manager got on the hoist and did the loading for about 4 hours until they could find someone to relieve him.

4319,Here's the thing,"at this point i have been on 3 jobs, but couldn't last a week on any of them, and just got paid for the days worked, i wasn't fired or had any fights while working on them, and in fact i do everything properly, but there's always this feeling that tells me i am doing the wrong thing, even when i am trying to earn some money.

but after thinking deeper about it, for most of you guys for example work hours are from 9 to 5, where i live is 8 to 4, but even with those hours, i feel that i don't have enough time to do what i like and enjoy the rest of it, coming back from work takes around 30 mins because lf traffic,, shower another 10 or 20 depending of how dirty i return, and to relax the body after spending those 8 hours standing, barely sitting for a min, then that is another 30 mins or probably more, 8 hours of sleep and then another 30 mins to get everything ready the next morning, but then it seems that there's not enough time to think on the projects i have since i am thinking on what i have to do the next day at work.

the only moment when i feel good doing something even if i end exhausted is when i am doing something creative, been an artist since i was a kid so i know how to do realistic drawings, the sad part of this is that i can't find a way to make money out of it, where i live artists are barely recognized so there's not enough room for the things i do, since it's a developing country everyone is focused on sales, yeah the main goal is for the city to turn into a metropolis.

i was wondering if there's another kind of work, maybe volunteer into something while i learn a new skill, and also leaves me with enough time to keep developing my artistic talent, without having to work for 8 hours or having the feeling that i am slaving my life away for the goal of some dude, i actually want to do something, but with the feeling that i am doing something good for somebody else, and not just for the pocket of my boss and to keep the rich guys happy.

4326,"Is anybody stuck in a vicious, annoying loop?","So just to give some context; I'm an immigrant from Croatia who lives in Canada now. I've always hated capitalism, so after my first job in Europe, I decided to just go to Vancouver for a year and see what happens. I bought a camera, started blogging and doing part time hospitality work (which people usually told me it was beneath me because I have a bachelors and a masters degree).

Anyway, my plan was not really a plan - I wanted to save money to travel and document that, learn videography along the way, and meet people. Somewhere along the line I fell for a trap. I met a girl and envisioned a future with a house, kids etc. So my focus shifted on becoming a permanent resident, while saving money working 3 jobs. Then we got pregnant, had a kid and I needed a job with benefits - so I started working for a bank. First as a teller, then an advisor, now invest by phone (call centre).

My gf and me separated when our kid was 1. We coparent now, with me having him on the weekends. I realized I needed more time in order to see him more, so I'm looking into finding a way to make money and having a flex schedule. Anyway, I started a YT channel that honestly isn't the best and is not what I want to cover, but I can't afford a camera (sold my first one 2 years ago). I use my phone, but eventually I want to film travels and go back to my original idea. It's hard with a kid too.

Basically, I don't save anything, I don't have skills to find a better paying job (and I really don't want to work long hours), time is so limited and I can't afford any luxury like a camera. I maxed out my credit line. So I'm just in a loop - work, worry about money, worry about not seeing the kid, and go back to work. I learn what I can after work from youtube, but ifbI don't have the equipment, what's the point? It was easy splitting rent before, now it's just me and it's killing me how much I spend for rent.

Tl;dr - don't have money or time to invest into learning a skill I want, or buying equipment, just keep working 5 days a week.",False,oxvt2k,roopy_b,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oxvt2k/is_anybody_stuck_in_a_vicious_annoying_loop/,4,1

4351,The retirement age is too high,"Even in government you have to work 30 years to retire. So if you start at 28 you can retire at 58 but if you stay to 62 you’ll get a slightly higher percent pension.

Sometimes I imagine what it would be like if we got our pensions/retirement early. Like in your 20-30s you get paid without having to work and then you end up working 40-60s to pay it back. At least then you’d get to enjoy your younger years when your brain is still sharp and you have energy. Although working into older ages isn’t easy either.

4353,Systemic ableism made me anti-work,"I'm disabled and I've become more and more anti-work over the past couple months. I'm stuck working retail, and the pay isn't too bad, but I'm constantly overworked and exhausted and treated like shit by customers. It's shit, but it wouldn't be so bad if I could at least have accommodations. Or openly mention that I'm disabled. But I can't.

The only reason I was able to land this job is because I didn't mention my disability. Every time I have, I haven't even gotten a call back. I can hide it extremely well, so it's very easy to act like I'm not disabled, but it's like shooting myself in the foot. I can't ask for accommodations, I worry about discrimination from my coworkers if they find out, I don't want to tell customers that it's taking me a second to process whatever bullshit they want because I'm disabled because I don't wanna be called slurs or deal with that bullshit. I can't even mention it to any of my bosses or supervisors because I'm scared they'll can me and then say it was because of some other bullshit reason.

And then they complain that disabled people can't get jobs or that we're all homeless and we need to be put in hospitals. Sad thing is, I want to be able to do work. I do, in fact, enjoy things manual labor. But nobody will hire us if they find out about our disability beforehand, and if we tell them after, they'll give us the bare minimum of accommodations, if any at all, or just straight up get rid of us. Whether it be because they're ableist pieces of dogshit, or they see us as a liability, or they can't properly accommodate us, or we can't function within a capitalist society. And that's our fault, somehow. It's always our fault.

The occasions where we DO get hired or manage to stay employed, it's usually just for brownie points. And we're still the first to get canned if something happens.

I've just accepted that I won't be able to work traditionally. The easiest thing would be seasonal work, or part-time work, or contract work, or day labor, or just work that isn't inherently long-term so I don't get exploited that much. Which isn't all that bad, until we talk about wages. I won't be able to afford rent or get housing for a while, though I've fucking tried. For 5 months, I've worked with numerous agencies to get into supportive housing specifically for disabled people, and the main barrier in each and every one was my INCOME. I can't even afford supportive housing with my current wages.

It's a fucking carnival out here. They don't want to employ us or house us, and then it's our fault when we're unemployed and homeless. Fuck work. Fuck capitalism. Fuck systemic ableism.

The question is - what now?

I know that this is not enough money to live from all my life. I am wondering if I should just spend a few years without work, enjoying life, and then going back to working. 

I am currently doing a job training as a nurse but although I actually like it, it's full time and I just cant work full time. It's just not possible.

My biggest fear is that if I spend like 5 years enjoying life that my ""career"" is fucked afterwards and I will never find work again. On the other hand I dont wanna waste my life working. There run a lot of illnesses in my family so chances are I wont get very old. I am 30 now, and I am positive I will reach 50, but 60 I am not so sure anymore. My dad got cancer with 60.

On the other hand: I've just worked minimum wage jobs all the time anyways - which ""career"" is there to be fucked up? It's fucked up already anyways, right?

Do I keep myself day-current and caught up? Check!

Do I help out the new people whenever I can? Check! (I spent the last few weeks creating guides for them because they came out of training knowing nothing whatsoever and I was getting sick of the questions) 

Do I get minimal complaints and mostly compliments from customers? Check!

Do I make minimal mistakes in my work and produce good quality work? Check! 

But wait…one of my numbers was at 75% yesterday (call answered rate, should be 100%. I’ve been doing fine with it except I messed up Monday). I’m meeting everything else EXCEPT for that because I’m not a robot.

4400,"""It Is No Measure of Health to be Well-Adjusted to a Profoundly Sick Society"" Essay by Charles Eisenstein"," 

**It’s No Measure of Health To be Adjusted to a Profoundly Sick Society** (transcript)

So I believe that is a Krishnamurti quote. “It is no measure of  health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” If you’re  well-adjusted, like, adjusted to what? You know? You’re able to go along  with program. You’re able to make yourself study hard, and get good  grades, take the AP classes, sign up for extra-curriculars, to make a  good resume so that you can get into the good college, where you study  hard some more. and you play by the rules. And you’re okay with that.  You’re adjusted to it. You’re a creature of that system, and that way of  being. Which is fine if we agree that that system is the system that we  should have. And that the world you’re participating in is the world  that we want. And that the direction that you are helping take us is the  direction that we want to go.

If you were, a, you know, a white, middle-class person in the 1950s,  1960s,1970s, it was pretty easy to believe those things, that society  was basically on the right track, that science was solving our problems,  that modern medicine was conquering one disease after another, that we  were progressing. Life was getting better and better. Since then, it’s  become harder and harder to maintain the belief that we are living in  the right world.

This is something that, maybe like really sensitive, prescient people  have seen this for forever. But, I believe that it began to take on a  mass character… I mean, I hesitate to put a date on it… but certainly  when I was a kid, it was starting to wear thin a little bit. I certainly  sensed a wrongness in the world that pervaded everything. I couldn’t  make myself adjust. I couldn’t make myself be well-adjusted. I could…  and well-adjusted can mean going through the motions and at least  complying with the explicit requirements of participation. And I  couldn’t even quite do that. And a lot of people in my generation  couldn’t do that, either.

So we became slackers. Or we became addicted to things. Or we became  fuck-ups. Or we’d procrastinate and not study hard and get drunk, you  know? Like, if you really believed in the program, you wouldn’t be  getting drunk every weekend in college. Because you’d have an aim, you’d  have a goal, you’d have something you cared about. The drunkenness, the  addiction, the squandering of endless hours in front of video games and  mindless pursuits, these are not some problem that must be overcome to  make us better participants in society. These are symptoms. These would  not exist if we were in a life we really cared about.

Without that aim, without that magnetic pole that directs our actions  and that gives us this filter: “Ok, what am I going to do today? What  makes sense?” Without that, then we are lost. Then we kind of reach for  this, we reach for that. And the emptiness that we feel, we fill it up,  we are driven then to fill it up with whatever can distract us from it.  Or maybe we take on fake goals, substitutes for the life-aim, or the  life purpose that we are really craving. Higher levels in World of  Warcraft, or something like that, more points in the video game, more  money, more, more, more. More of something, but not the real thing that  we really want.

So whether it’s laziness, procrastination, addiction, self-sabotage,  greed, materialism, all these things that we judge and say is the  problem. These are the symptoms. It’s not because there is something  wrong with you that you just can’t make yourself get with the program.  It’s that there is something wrong with the program. So of course you  don’t want to participate. Of course you get depressed and just want to  withdraw. And just can’t make yourself do it. It’s not because you’re  unhealthy. It’s a mutiny of the soul.

Or you get anxious. Something is wrong around here. And the  authorities say, “No, no, no, everything is just fine. The problem is  with you. Here are some meds.” Now, I understand that, immersed within  this reality, there may be no obvious alternative to the medications  that enables a person to keep going. This is a very, very hot button  topic. Because many people will say that, “The meds saved me. They  turned my life around. They saved me from depression.” And maybe am not  qualified to pass judgment on whether or not they are universally a bad  thing. But I can see what their general function is. It’s to keep people  operational in the world that is given to them.

And it’s a catch-22. How do you get out of that world? What  alternative do you have to simply coping with it? Simply adjusting to  it?

I can’t offer a recipe for how to get out of it. But I can say that  the desire to get out of it, the question of, ‘How do I get out of it?’;  the prayer to be liberated from it; will be heard and will bring  results, in the end.

4409,Why your sales commissions keep getting cut," 

Here's a cheery little anecdote to share.  
When I was a car salesman, I noticed that more often than not, whenever the owner returned from a ""20 Group"" meeting, we'd experience a pay cut or other loss of benefits. The owner would defend it by explaining ""I'm just trying to stay competitive and our compensation was much higher than average"".

You see, a ""20 Group"" was an assembly of twenty owners of many assorted car brand dealerships across the country but from similar demographic areas who were not involved in head to head competition with one another. It was an opportunity to compare notes, learn from one another.

When twenty dealerships submitted their financials, the individual reports were confidential but the overall averages were shared. Of course, in any random collection of twenty numbers, some will be higher than average, some lower.

When the owner saw that he was paying his sales staff lower than average, he kept that to himself and patted himself on the back for doing such a good job. If he was paying more, that was justification to cut wages. Of course each year as the group met, the average, as a result, would get lower and lower...

I eventually left the car sales business when I pay kept getting cut.",False,oxc09g,BlueCollarBeagle,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oxc09g/why_your_sales_commissions_keep_getting_cut/,8,1

4422,Today I walked away from a rude customer (and it felt. So. Good.),"I’ve talked about my shitty job on this sub in the past, and I basically go through my days on autopilot wishing I could quit most of the time. Today our receptionist at the front desk was sick, so we all took turns filling in.  

So it was my turn to play autopilot receptionist. Some lady came in with a check that was supposed to go to one of her hired vendors, but she wrote the check to our company for some reason. As I’m realizing I’m going to have to deny this woman’s payment, she starts laying into me about the pool at her condo (we work in property management, but don’t have anything to do with her pool.) I listen to her complain and when she was done, I advise that she reach out to the group that can help her with the pool. “Oh, they want to me to pay for such-and-such service and I’m not going to. YOU need to help.” I explain again that’s literally not my job (as in our company is not equipped to fix her fucking pool,) and she continues to whine.

Then she starts claiming she “pays us for all this shit” and references the check. Which brings me back to the first problem: her dumb ass wrote the check to the wrong people. So here’s where I try to interject with an, “Actually ma’am, that’s the other thing. You’re supposed to make your payment to XYZ Contractors because they did the work, not the company you just walked into.” She absolutely loses it. Calls me an idiot. Accuses me of wasting her time and money. Insults me personally because I won’t fix her pool. So, I write VOID on her check, hand it back to her, tell her to have a nice day, turn around, and walk into the back office. I could hear her huff out the front door as I was walking away, but it felt *SO GOOD* to tell some asshole they were in the wrong and just walk away during their tantrum.

e Americans added nearly $4 trillion to their savings during
the Moved anaemic, but most of the gains went to the
wealthy, according to a new study from Oxford
Economics.

¢ Stimulus checks, rising stock markets and fewer spending
choice led to a massive savings boom over the past year,
the study found.

So I was there for two months and applied to entry level positions in multiple engineering companies in my area.

None of the companies even considered me for an interview and I was fired from the restaurant job on the spot- no notice, no warning.

When I went in the next morning demanding to know why I was fired the owner told me he thought I “didn’t want to work.” Without one single question about it at all.

So I decided to start my own business doing what I love (it’s not as simple as just art but to simplify it that’s what it’ll be).

4448,"Why are the people who should be fired, well, not?","Ok I can’t sleep for (insert story) so I may wake up to typos that I will want to fix later. 
But my brain decided to think about this topic for some reason. 

I work part time, but ironically, the hourly pay is MORE than a lot of full time jobs so it makes it hard to want to want to leave when it’s overall easy compared to previous jobs I’ve had and to most available full time jobs I see.

With that said, I do work in an office setting and I work under the HR person (who is my supervisor but I do not do any HR myself). So I tend to see the ppl coming and going. 

There was a department head whose department had some turnovers. I cannot vouch the validity of what I have heard in terms of rumors but I can believe it. 
When you leave you can submit anything directly to the Boss-Boss without your Department Head seeing it. At least 3 times people were writing fucking essays it seems (judging by how long they were writing it in the office). Was this ever person fired? No. 

When a NEW department head got hired (cuz the one with complaints retired): wow, no turnovers at all (yet, but I also don’t hear any rumors circulating)

Now I haven’t had much experience in an office setting besides this job so idk how typical this is but…my expectations for HR was a little higher than what I got as my Supervisor is:

-not the brightest bulb. Is bad at spelling and names (which she likes to remind everyone for some reason? Like that isn’t something to brag about!). Once asked how to spell “recruit” while typing. “R-E-Q…?” And i had to cut in with “C! R-E-C…!” And no, idk how spell check didn’t inform her of this. 

-an employee one time asked me for HR related things but I have no knowledge or authorization for any of that. She confessed that she doesn’t trust my supervisor as HR

-^which i cannot fault them on when my supervisor gossips all the damn time and over-exaggerates her stories.  

-randomly blurts out confidential things and then says to everyone in the office (there’s 4 of us total) to not repeat that to anyone. 

-terrible at communicating problems with technology (she’s not old, she’s a millennial). 

All of the above them makes me…feel a lot less guilty for slacking off at work. I seriously stopped giving a fuck cuz if she doesn’t get fired, I am impossible to fire then cuz comparatively: 

-I know how to fucking spell shit and sound out names (i genuinely feel like she doesn’t know how to sound out words/names…) 

-I absorb gossip but I never do the bad talking (which i feel like just makes people talk to me more about secrets but whatever &gt;_&gt;) 

-i can actually retell an event without grossly over exaggerating something pointless.

-I’m no technologically expert, but as a millennial, I still know my way around. I know how to communicate with IT and our Service contracts regarding our copiers/phones/etc cuz I don’t make up phrases like “phantom ringing” when explaining what the issue is; and I know how to change inks without someone coming out to do it for us (which I guess they had to do before cuz my Supervisor didn’t know how to replace ink???)

-^It’s gotten to the point that I am really good at finding paper jams and fixing copier problems (not all of course; just fix issues that saves us having to call for service.)

Sorry that turned into a semi-rant BUT THE QUESTION STILL STANDS CUZ WTF? 

Please enlighten me with any similar stories. I KNOW it’s not uncommon for unqualified people to keep their jobs (for reasons I don’t quite understand still…)

4460,"For Filipinos, why not address recruitment malpractices?"," r/phcareers is too vanilla for me to post this and want to seemingly attract an employer-focused subreddit rather than an employee one.

My biggest letdown in the vicious cycle of BPO industries is the number of exploitative baits they still flail at you, even if the pool is intelligent enough to sense it. I tried to tap the market just for fun, customer service rep, and I had one of the worst interviews with a well-respected BPO company in PH ( well they do curate images so what do I expect). I got it but declined it without hesitation for alarming reasons, if that was the ""best"", what's left to it?

For starters, they advertised misleading work setups, required me to have a PC, internet (even ridiculed one of the candidates in front of us for not having one, it was so sad) when in fact it was onsite, and the recruiter even said, and I quote ""Y'know, there's no such thing as BPO work from home, are you aware of that? that's impossible, it's not meant to be that way. We will never offer this option"" in a condescending tone while he hisses at his dogs, crying baby, and the screeching cars in front of his house. Maybe for you, I guess? No company help for you during the pandemic? Unlike mine? Why advertise it then?

Anyway, he even gave his high strung opinion on my previous work, ""You won't excel nor grow from that field, I tried it before, there are no opportunities and no learning whatsoever, you should consider this position today I have your contract ready immediately"" do I need to hear your own failures when it's not relevant to the conversation? When in fact I do excel, I am still striving and that's why you considered me for the job and guess what, I'm a virtual assistant who earns more than him, relaxes more than him (40-hour workweek kami), and even has a better-invested set up than him because I care about my job. I'm in awe how he could casually judge a position so similar to what he's doing right now, working all odds against him. Shockingly, their salary decreased by 7k (200$) on their usual offer on JobStreet in a span of 5 years. I've been observing that company for a long time. I couldn't negotiate my salary because they will ""invest more in the safety and work environment of the offices so the base is what we could offer"". Why not give a work-from-home option rather than bothering with that? To end the sour encounter, I sent my letter of declining the offer, and to my surprise, he made it look like I didn't pass! just to save face? The desperation was present in the interview and he made me look like I didn't even qualify, what a power trip big boy. The pretentiousness reeks. What a relief when you try to tap a seemingly good company on the outside but rotten on the inside.

It's freeing knowing that, by the end of this month, I wont ever have to step foot in that place again.

The place that worked me 12 hours a day, six days a week, while claiming government support for lost wages during COVID lockdowns.

The place that can't even put a fucking toilet on site, because the two minute walk to the opposite end of the place isn't worth the cost of installing a sewer line.

I just walk in and learn how to do the job for a few minutes then get on with it!

Never once had anyone tell me to hurry up or do it faster or whine about every tiny stupid things.

All manager care about is everyone put in their 8 hours a day or 40 a week (overtime is allows if requested) and do their job as best as they can. Manager don’t care how they do it as long as they get it done.

It feels so weird at first. It feel like I wasn’t even working because I wasn’t stressed or worried or having someone micromanaging me or anything.

4499,Anyone got stories on work bullying/crappy boss or coworkers?,"Hi. I've got a bunch of stories, but this one is more recent. For starters, my work has been mainly housekeeping hotels, schools, etc. I just started my new job. It's as a housekeeper. Again. Housekeeping is a sucky job. I respect anyone having to do it and it's made me more conscious of how being a messy slobby customer/guest can ruin someone's day and trust in humanity. I think I'd rather wrestle alligators than scrub one more toilet from a yucky guest after they check out. In fact, I'd rather not work at all anymore because of the moderate PTSD janitorial work has caused me over the years.

I was recently paired up with one angry demeaning coworker where nothing I do is correct, they treat me as though I'm sneaky or trying to get by with making them do my part of the job, but they're the ones not doing all of theirs. I was told to clean one side of a large room and they the other. When I was sweeping I saw them cleaning the middle of the room, but as we walked out, they noticed the table was dirty, even though I wasn't told to clean it, so I assumed they did. They found out it was dirty then blamed me for being so ignorant that I forgot to clean it. They yell at me and when I try to explain what happened, they get louder to drown me out, convinced I'm just sneaky and making excuses, so there's no excuse for me to defend my stance. This situation happens Every. Single. Time.  I know I make mistakes, but mistakes in housekeeping are normal. Everyone there makes mistakes and it's not like most of them aren't correctable. It's a high energy, multi-tasking job and you just forget something once in a while. And I know this should be irrelevant, but I feel I need to also point out that I'm the only white housekeeper. I was told the other worker didn't want me working with them so they stuck me with this person that doesn't like how I clean and let's me know all the time.  While a few of the other housekeepers are nice and understand I'm new (this place has different rules than the last job I had) this one other housekeeper and their friend stand around for an hour (while I'm working) and shit talk me in front of me, while I clean, and rant about how crappy of a worker I am that I'm just trying to 'get by doing as little work as possible'. I see one of them looking at me with a frown shaking their head. I get so embarrassed.

I know jobs are hard and most jobs don't pay their employees well, but I think I could handle it better if it weren't for such toxic work environments. Anyone got some stories of their own to share?",False,oxlctl,Temporary_Lake2986,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oxlctl/anyone_got_stories_on_work_bullyingcrappy_boss_or/,16,1

Old has increased its wages for lorry drivers
amid a chronic shortage of drivers across the
industry.

The supermarket chain confirmed the rise
following similar incentive by growers to attract
HGV drivers.

The lack of drivers has caused disruption and
delays in various supply chains, which has led to
product shortage in some industries.

Esch has offered drivers a £1,000 joining bonus
for candidates who join before 30 September.

4528,I don’t understand why work has to be so fucking difficult,"
Seriously, I honestly don’t get why work has to be this fucking hard. I feel exhausted every day, like I came back from a war zone. This shit is never ending. I can’t believe I have to do this for the next few decades, and the only time I can finally “enjoy” living is supposedly when I’m a knobby kneed elder. Everyday, it’s fighting with traffic, fighting with people, fighting with the lack of time to do anything I want to do because my time is sacrificed at work, sleep, and chores. I can’t stand the office politics bullshit, pointless competitiveness of the workplace, gossip, backstabbing coworkers, and all the stupid games people play, just so I can afford my bare necessities. I loathe performance reviews and job hunting with passion. I’m tired of “giving it my all”, contributing to a meaningless pursuit to make someone else rich, forcing a smile on my face everyday only to have nobody appreciate it, and still get yelled at by my boss for something. 

Everything is a fucking battle. I wonder what the point of having kids is if life is this boring and painful. I’m so mad about it but at the same time I feel hopeless. I’m really near my breaking point. It’s made me go into serious depression and I can feel my physical and mental health going downhill. When I was younger I wanted kids but now I wonder what is the point of having them if society will just subjugate them to this shitty rat race life all over again. I don’t want my kids to suffer through it. I don’t understand why the fuck money is so hard to make and why it’s so difficult to just survive. I did everything the books told me to do: get good grades, don’t cause any trouble, get into a good university, get a good job, “be positive and nice to everyone”.  This is my “reward”?!

I’ve worked at minimum wage jobs that pay peanuts and fancy office jobs that pay six figures, but work is still work and sucks your soul. The long hours, insane pressure, stupid “goals and targets”, the constant sense of urgency and hustle culture drives me insane. Honestly people, unless you work in the ER or something, that task/report/goal can wait. There’s no fucking reason why everything has to be done now now now in a rush. I’ve only worked in corporate and customer service, both of which are horrible, but I can imagine working in almost any other industry is terrible and exhausting. Only a very very select few I’ve met in my life love what they do; the majority of people hate it. I’m not opposed to “working” itself, but I’m opposed to how unnecessarily damn stressful it has become in our modern day society, and how big of a life ruiner it’s been for me and probably many others.

It pays A LOT, offers a flexible schedule and would be a leg-up in my career. However, I’ve seen a lot of red flags and I’m not sure I should move along even though it seems better than my current position.

First, they rescheduled my interview the evening before because the head of the department would not be back from vacation as he had expected. The talent recruiter also texted me to reschedule. They used words like “u” or “2” as in “two” and “you.” That was kind of weird as the man is double my age and has been in his position since before I was born. 

During the interview, I was told that they have 3 positions currently available. I mean, if 3 people left at once I feel like that looks sorta bad. But maybe I am wrong and they advanced in the company of something, not sure. The biggest flag, they want to schedule 6 hours of consecutive interviews in 1 day. I told them I work full-time and could not accommodate that with my current work schedule. Yet they have still been emailing me to send them 5 days where I will be fully available from 8 am to 5 pm. That simply will never be as long as I have a job… I hate to see that opportunity walk away but I can’t miss a day of work.

4590,Health insurance in the US is designed to force you to work.,"I’ve thought for awhile now about trying to drop down to part-time status in the future for my own mental health but something occurred to me. Back during the pandemic I was laid off due to my company downsizing (I’m an electrician making $28/hr). Because I was laid off I had the option for COBRA to continue my health insurance coverage out of my own pocket. I have the paper buried somewhere but I literally could not afford to continue paying for health insurance on my own on unemployment (I think it was over $1000/month), which was huge because I have several chronic conditions and a mental disability which require medication. So I ended up on Medicaid which promptly refused to cover my Adderall, which, as an aside, it turns out you can’t pay for a medication out of pocket if you are on Medicaid!

So, essentially, the only practical way to have health insurance is though your employer who isn’t obligated to provide it if you are working less than 40 hr/week. And that’s not even touching the absurd cost of medical procedures.

You can get pretty much any other type of insurance on your own and it will follow you regardless of employment status. But in the US, medical insurance is tied to your employer. It’s a feature, not a bug. And I’m pretty sure it’s why the Affordable Care Act was shot down so fast and so hard. Corporate America didn’t want to lose any leverage over their workers being as productive as possible.",False,owcmg6,FearofFeedback,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/owcmg6/health_insurance_in_the_us_is_designed_to_force/,39,1
4591,Punishment and annoying job statements,"For me as someone who hasn't had a stable long term permanent job since 2018 it really angers me that businesses, companies, employers etc punish you for not having a job every day of the year every single year. Like if you explain to people that you job hunted for a job for over a year and didn't find anything they blame it on you or punish  you for not finding a job or not just taking a job to have a job. Or if you didn't want to work at a job during the period of time when covid19 started out because you didn't have healthcare at that point and the job wasn't offering healthcare and so if you got covid you were SOL...and more so could potentially die from it...but no they punish you and blame you for that. And lastly I want to have a job like I had in from 2013 to 2017 and again in 2018. I hunt daily for jobs like that. And because I am of the mindset that I don't want to take for example an entry level customer service job just to have a job until I can find a job that is where I was in 2018 that somehow that's on me and I should be punished for that. So I work crap retail jobs in the mean time living with a roommate or with friends until I can get back to where I was in 2013-2017 and in 2018.   
But it just annoys me to the highest levels that my job being outsourced in 2018 and me being unable to find a job between the end of 2018 and Dec 2019 is my fault. I hunted. I searched. I applied. I interviewed. I got nothing out of it. And its my fault, the blame is on me, I should be punished because I didn't want to work in an environment where I could get covid19 one and two get covid19 without healthcare. And now that I have been vaccinated and I'm trying to get back out there I should be punished for not doing the above things. Like the retail job I work at could care less about me getting covid, could care less about employees and customers wearing mask indoors or social distancing or even the smallest levels of trying to reduce any chance of getting covid(this was when covid19 first hit and even up until now). But all of that is my fault.   
And in truth all of this makes me hate work, hate how businesses hire, and hate how the people in charge of hiring people handle ALL of the processes involved in hiring someone. I hate all of it...and I hate the people in charge of it.   
\*I know this is more of a rant but it also felt antiwork. I'm just tired of playing these games you have to play to get hired these days.

4608,How I quit the worst job I've ever had,"I recently quit I a job 2 months before then quickly got a job at this local sushi place that I've been to Many times before, and the owner seemed nice. This was when covid first started so I was working at this restaurant when I came in I was expected to know everything right off the bat. Which was weird because sandy didn't even show up until 2 hours into my shift, and I'm very confused to how things work. At the end of the day I was told how slow I was, and I needed to learn the entire menu tomorrow, be fast packer, answer phone, and take customer order with a smile. Luckily I know how to fake it until I make it. A month in is when I actually learned all the sushi roll, and I really didn't see anything bad until someone got fired/quit. It was a lesbien couple who quit because they were tired of sandy's shit. I know they qui,t but sandy said she fired them because her husband doesn't like lesbiens. which I'm pretty sure is a lie, because sandy told me when this other girl quit and she brought her parents with her to get check. Sandy said she was here to shoot her. I later found on sandy told her to bring her parents here. She fired people for different reasons one girl was too fat for her. She fired someone for being black. She caused one person to get so mentally depressed he stayed in the park physically unable to move. When I was fired/quit I was doing my job as usual and sandy came and immediately started hamming on us to clean everything again, and smile for customer. She tried rushing us by helping with sushi , but not one of the hibachi was ready so we couldn't pack the order. When she started helping we had lots of order packed wrong a was given to the wrong person, and she was double checking our orders when it was her orders that were wrong. I got pissed and started cleaning the lobby but I guess I took too long in the lobby because when I came back into the kitchen. She was going off about how could we leave her alone for half an hour and we are disrespectful to her culture.she said one of us is supposed to stay here and one go clean the lobby, but we want to get the job done faster. She was here and we told her we were going to clean the lobby. Earlier that day I went to clean a table and she questioned where I was. I said how come we have to do that when she's here and their wasn't Many orders anyway. Sandy didn't like that and was like are you fucking kidding me? I am owner and I do want I want, and me being angry last you said that you chased away a customer. She started going in on me hard, I got fed up and said I got to go and she said if I go I quit and to not come back and the girl was working with said if I leave she's leaving too. To this day haven't  I've gotten paid.

For context, this is a clip showing a highly talented and decorated engineer going into Wall Street because the money allows him to live a better life 

A totally fair and admirable choice for any human to make 

The point is, if keystroke industries like engineering, design and manufacturing continue to pay talented people so little for their skill sets … they will lose them to the finance industry and perpetually swirl in a “we can’t hire the people” crisis 

Which is very much of their own making 

Media is another industry that beginning to boom and offer attractive pay, Engineers (especially in the UK) aren’t compensated nearly enough

4619,Can’t imagine a life before ‘work from home’.,"Waking up at 6, a 1,5 hour commute each way where I was so exhausted I slept (badly) on the train, waking up every 5 minutes.

Getting into work already feeling groggy and half asleep, sore neck from sleeping sitting up on a cramped trained.

Sitting in work, bright lights and the loud noises of people talking on phones. Feeling intimidated by managers keeping a close eye on me while watching the clock tick slowly closer to home time, all the while feeling the pressure of having to meet a quota or I’ll be considered bad at my job.

Then going home knowing I’ve got the commute again, being so exhausted I fall asleep yet again on the train until my stop.

Getting off the train and walking home, neck sore and feeling as S as I felt going into the office.

Finally being at home and feeling so depressed and exhausted that all I feel like doing is making food, escaping reality with a tv show and Netflix before going back to bed knowing I have to do it all again in the morning.

———-

How did I do this? I can’t imagine a life before COVID. I can sense the anger and frustration of the micro management who can’t exactly sit in my home and torture me. I finally have energy, I’m doing more work at home and I’m happy doing it. It’s quiet, no chatter and no blinding bright lights. I’m sleeping. In a bed.

4633,Capitalism and communism are not the only political/economic systems that can exist. It is NOT a dichotomy.,"I hear/read this a lot both on reddit and in real life. Criticizing capitalism does not mean you support communism, or vice versa. I'm tired of hearing that. It's not a dichotomy. Reality is not yes or no, black or white, republican or democrat, capitalism or communism, mayo or mustard. Just because we haven't completely figured out a new and better way to govern things doesn't mean it's impossible. Systems of government and economies throughout human history change drastically all the time. Every time I see criticisms of capitalism it's always ""wOuLd YoU pReFeR cOmMuNiSm?"" or ""tHaTs JuSt ThE wAy It Is""

These ""just the way it is"" folks are the same types of people that would say the same thing about slavery in the 1600's, or fuedalism. It's the peasant class throwing their lives on the line for their lords and aristocracy. 

""tHaTs JuSt ThE wAy It Is"" ... like... okay, that's the way it is. But the way it is sucks and needs to be improved. So let's try to do that maybe? That's basically the entire point of subreddits and forums like this (which is great).

I hated my boss, being micromanaged, dealing with people all day long, being chained to my desk or in the office 40 hours a week. My hatred for work consumed my life. All I did and wanted to do was complain about my job and the people I worked with or dealt with daily.

I received the opportunity from my job to temporarily work from home. It’s been 4 months since I’ve been WFH. 

I’ve been in this group probably 3 times since then. I’m no longer depressed about work. I no longer complain about my job. I don’t look forward to work, but I’m no longer miserable. I don’t have a boss up my ass all day, I text / use my phone when I want, I can do some chores on the clock, I deal with the public only via phone. No commute, no more fake smiles or pretending to give a shit. I’ve even gone on vacation without having to take any time off, they never even knew I left the state.

Now here’s my issue. This work from home opportunity ends soon. I only have 2 more months and then I have to go back in. I think. I’m dreading this so much.

4650,My stable income work-free life is depressing and I feel useless. Working can change that.,"I'm 23 and live with my mother who receives a pretty generous support from the government due to having a close relationship with my father (not married) for over 20 years when he passed away and so money isn't really an ""issue"", in fact we just received a bonification precatory ammount from a lawsuit we won, so now we have another 40k sitting in the savings.

I can literally just stay home and watch TV, or play games all day, or do whatever I please and wouldn't **need** to work to have nice things or live a middle class life. I can go to the supermarket and get pretty much anything I want and just pay on the credit card, no need to split in multiple payments either (depending on what I'm getting of course).

I don't know if I'm living the r/antiwork nice life, but what I do know is I want to get out of this situation as soon as I possibly can. I find it embarrassing to be living under my mother's wing at 23 and not being able to decide what bigger purchases I want to do myself because it all has to go through her, which she might or might not allow. Basically I'm a 23 year old child. ""Mom, can I get pizza today?"" ""Sure son"", ""what about today?"" ""No son, not today"". This is stupid. Independence to me is being able to choose whether I want to eat pizza everyday or just sometimes, but the important thing is the option is always there. That's my goal. Can I do X? Yes. Do I want to do X? Depends on how I feel like. But whenever X has to go through my ""financial advisor"" called mom because she is the one that pays is beyond ridiculous to me.

And that is where my depression comes from. I don't need to work. I don't need to pay for my things. I don't need to get up early and go to a job to make money. But I can't eat pizza everyday if I want to. What good is it? What if I want to get a new gaming PC? It might happen, or it might not happen, my mother decides. Screw that. I love my mother more than anything, but the last thing I need is for her to have a say in what I buy or not.

How would I get out of this situation? Easy, I must make my own money. How? By doing the only thing this sub despises and is probably going to ban me for even bringing it up. Exactly. Working. I mean, I could place 5k in bets and risk losing it to make 5k more. Will I do that? **FUCK NO**. I could find a way to clone credit cards and use other people's money to my ends. Will I do that? **FUCK NO**. You get the idea. For me, the best risk free way to win my own independence is to work. Period.

Here's the part you're all going to laugh at: I **WANT** to work. Yes, I want to wake up at 7 am, get through traffic, sit in a cubicle for 8 hours, have a questionably unhealthy meal for lunch, go back home and do it all again tomorrow. Why? Firstly because I want to **earn** my own damn money. Second, because that's how I see myself in the next 5-10 years. Wake up, cubicle, lunch, cubicle, sleep, repeat. The profession I intend to work on is more or less like this.

This ""boring"" life sounds much more exciting and challenging and rewarding than my current one. ""Oh but you don't know what you're in for"", I disagree, since I worked for 3 months in a photo editing gig and it was pretty much like that. Wasn't the best job in the world by a mile, but it gave me something to do with my time and some money to spend any way I wished to at the end of the month. Now if I could work in a field that I find interesting, and that the final product would be something to make me proud to work in, you're damn right I would prefer the boring life to my current ""easy"" one.",False,ow9ibl,TBE_0027,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ow9ibl/my_stable_income_workfree_life_is_depressing_and/,39,1

In my current gig I receive $100 per diem, which covers some of my expenses but I still have to cover the bulk of them.  Even after all that a local job pays literally 1/3 of what I make traveling.

Calling places that are hiring in my craft they want to hire me after hearing my qualifications, but refuse to talk about compensation, I tell these people I’m not interested in their opportunity if they can’t be upfront with me.

Some companies are more realistic in their hiring approach and tell me a number, even going into detail about their benefits packages, but they’ve all been so disappointing that I just stopped caring.  My work schedule is stifling my home life and I would love to find a job here, even at the cost of a pay cut, but I can’t afford that big of one, and telling them my required compensation would easily make me the most overplayed employee in their company lol.

Working at 16 makes me realize how fucked up child labor laws are. Several of my coworkers put in 40+ hour weeks, on top of (high) school. I’m expected to stand and move my whole shift, and if I’m lucky, I’m at the registers where it’s just standing. I already suffered from back pain, who knows what this is going to do to my back in the long term.

Anyways, I have a good job at an industry which is very male dominated, I’m one of like 5 workers that is female. I work shift work. 5:30 am start time. The upside to it is I make good money, and I work 4 days on and 4 days off, so my schedule gives me days off. My husband works also in industry, most of the employees are men as well. And he starts at 7 am, if you are late, you get written up, and eventually fired. We have had our first kid in full time daycare for years now. It’s a center. For reasons, we cannot get our second kid into the this center because it’s prioritized to a few companies in town for their employees and I don’t work at one of the those companies anymore. So, we are screwed, because when the kiddo goes to kindergarten, we can’t find a daycare that will bus him to the school.

4669,Department moves - management grooves,"For clarity, I earn a weekly stipend of 50p p/h (pathetic, I know) on top of my wage for additional out of hour services

I recently moved department after a few year in my current role. New role is more suited to me and I'm eager to perform well in it. However, when I put forward my salary expectations for the new role (an additional £400 p/a pretax!) I was told that I would be losing the stipend and I'd have to undergo a 6 month probationary period in the new role to see how I perform before any salary is agreed. As it stands I have no idea what I'll be getting paid, have not signed a new contract and my old role (which I don't want anyway) has already been filled. 

I wasn't told of the potential loss of earning before I took the role and I really can't afford to lose essentially £2500 from my annual salary because my budget is extremely tight as it is.

Everything I have learned about this company and position since working here has made me want to run as fast as I can. The girl who had this job before me had the same concerns I did before she quit I have heard. She said the manager treated her like a robot, she had no free-time and just generally hated the work. I feel the same. Also, they laidoff everyone in the department except 1 other person and she just quit. The position was left open for a few weeks and I have been left to do the job of the entire department. Everyone I have talked to here recently says they are also looking for other work. 

I have had so many job interviews but get overwhelmed with my busy schedule and often cram them into lunch breaks, leaving me feeling stressed and unprepared. I have already blown a couple good jobs but have 3 interviews coming up this week. I am determined to find another job at this point, but I have no boundaries set with my boss to take my allotted break when needed. I will schedule an interview for my lunch and then something will come up and my boss says that needs priority. I feel like I should be able to schedule something for my lunch and take it when needed, not when I can find a spare 30 min in my day. 

I have to do these interviews at lunch and feel like sitting in my car or outside on a bench looks unprofessional. But I live too far away to drive home and back for the interview. Any tips? I have wifi and can do the interview on my phone where the quality looks good, I just want to come off as professional.

4675,Starting to feel despair,"I've always struggled with maintaining jobs, not because I'm lazy or incompetent, but because I tend to give jobs my all and then I get burnt out after about a year or two. I've tried a couple of different career paths, and one thing that has stuck out with me is the pressure not only your bosses put you through but also your coworkers. Not only in terms of meeting demands that seem to grow exponentially, but depending on the field, socially as well. So I said fuck all that noise I just want something that I can do all by myself and not have to deal with  bosses and coworkers. So I found a job as a delivery associate for a certain company run by the richest Prick in the world. I knew going in that Amazon is hell, but I told myself I'd use it as a stepping stone to get into something better. Well as time went on I climbed up the ranks in my position ended up with a Lead role, getting paid more than I ever have. I was expected to work on my own time with no pay, and lecture coworkers who weren't performing as well, and perform my actual job perfectly, the smallest of mistakes would count against you and could get you fired. The demands of the job just wouldn't stop, we were practically doing double the amount of work from when I had started. The culture of this job was so toxic, it made me truly depressed and I became an asshole to my coworkers, who were basically ass kissing bootlickers for Amazon.  I hated my life and thought about killing myself daily. Well something had to give and it wasn't going to be me, so I took a week off and told my boss I would not be coming back after that week. I decided to try and work for myself, doing various gig work and odd jobs. I'm still doing it to this day. I've never been happier in terms of work. I don't have any asshole bosses or shit coworkers and I work when I want (which is basically all the time). Well there just has to be a catch, and that's tax season. I've never had to deal with doing taxes myself up until now and come to find out it's pretty different. I have to file with 1099 forms and report all of my earnings of course that is to be expected. What I'd didn't expect is that the amount I would owe would be so damn high! Now I understand I'm making money that isn't being taxed and for that you owe your fair share, but to owe an amount that is nearly twice the amount I had in my savings has just broken me man. I was barely making enough to get by and that's with setting some aside for taxes because I thought it would be reasonable. Now I have to make monthly payments on my taxes and I'm having to do the bare minimum not to break the bank, and I'm fucking struggling. All I wanted was to earn some money in a way that I could feel content with my life, and I thought I found it but nope, and now I'm thinking of stepping back into the corporate world, and it just makes me want scream. I'm sorry I know this is a long rant but I have to get it out somehow, I feel like a pressure cooker. I'm just so done with this whole system. I've never expected handouts, I don't ever borrow money from anyone, and I actually enjoy doing hard work at times, but I feel like this whole system has chewed me up and spit me out.

New owner is currently sleeping with someone that he just met on-site. His bed buddy is now employed, has a master key to all the rooms, and is getting her room paid for.

Another coworker was just let go due to a back injury on the job. As far as I know, that isn't legal.

Honestly, it's a shite show. All of us are *still* working for minimum wage despite their $800,000 buyout (haggled down from 900,000), and I'm just done supporting it. There are at least three of us quitting, plus the one that was terminated to injury.

4702,Two stories of Companies held together by duct tape and safety pins.,"I worked for a medium sized tech company that had some pretty big clients. 

\-  Everything  depended on this broom closet of old servers to NEVER lose power because they couldn't fit any battery backups into the closet. When the power went out, entire days of work would be lost.

\- There was a page on one of the forms that ANYONE could navigate to, and if they were savvy with SQL they could alter the financial information of all of our clients.

\- The login site was http:// and not https:// and it took many years of clients complaining to change it.

\- An elderly lady that worked in the mail room downloaded obvious ransomware and shut everything down for an entire week. 

\- Instead of storing passwords as an encrypted form, they just had a normal SQL table that had everyone's password in it, and all employees had WRITE access to this table

&amp;#x200B;

\- important financials are dependent on some excel formulas that often get fucked up just because the accountant forgot to copy the formula all the way down.

\- there are so many teams that lots of people are doing the exact same projects in their own ways and not even aware of each other

\- they have so many offices that even before the pandemic they had random buildings that sometimes meetings would get scheduled in, they were so disused that when people showed up for the meetings there was no furniture

4710,Was it REALLY too much to ask to get back to me 5 fucking days ago?,"So, I had a ""potential"" interview with a company today. Potential meaning I asked the interviewer to see if they could accommodate an important need I have so we could proceed with the interview accordingly. I really don't want to go into too much detail with that need, otherwise this would be longer than necessary!

So I waited, and waited, and gone about my days doing normal shit that my happily unemployed ass likes to do. Just continuing on with my life. Do they get back to me in ANY of those 5 days before the interview? No, they do not.

So, I didn't go to their little bull shit online interview session they wanted me to attend to because I literally had no idea if they were still interested in my application and everything was up in the air for 5. Fucking. Days.

So, 30 minutes after the ""interview"" was supposed to be over was FINALLY the time they decided to get back to me and guess what? They basically chewed me out for not attending the interview. 4FUCK YOU TO HELL AND BACK!!!!! And no, they weren't terribly busy, it was for a customer service position.

So in the end, I told them that if they couldn't take 2 minutes to accommodate for 1 single need, they weren't a company I wanted to work for in the first place. Then I hung up and blocked their number.

4729,How the Rich get Cash out of their Shares,"Alright, I'm mad because I just read a post about Elon Musks' wealth gains and the comments are all fucking wrong.

In particular, this idea that oh, ""Musk's 138 billion gains in net worth aren't liquid.""

Somehow, this idea's been accepted by a lot of people as a counterargument despite being utterly wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the reality. Elon Musk *has* converted the appreciation in his stock to cash. He already does it.

Let's start by setting the groundwork first. There are two assumptions that need to hold in order for the system I'm going to describe to work.

1. Interest Rates remain at around 0%. This has been true for quite a long time since 2008, and there seems to be no hurry to raise it up again.
2. Stocks *in general* rise at around 7% per year. This is the long-run trend of the market, including the Great Depression, and I highly doubt this will fail.

&amp;#x200B;

How does he do it? Let's start with simple round numbers as an illustration. 

Let's say you have 100 billion dollars worth of shares in Tesla. You can't sell them because then you'd have to pay taxes, and you'd probably negatively affect the share price if you tried to sell that many all at once.

What do you do? Instead of approaching the Investment Bank to sell off your shares in block orders, you instead go to their lending department and ask for a loan.

You secure the loan using your shares in the publicly-traded company as collateral. A similar process is going to the bank for a mortgage on a house.

In both cases, the bank keeps your shares/house as collateral for the loan. The bank provides you with 50% of the value you just put up with them.

In our case, we've just been handed 50 billion dollars in cash. Sure, we owe the bank 50 billion, but it's secured by around 100 billion dollars worth of shares. It's a relatively safe loan, so the bank loans to us at an absurdly low rate, say 1.4%.

&amp;#x200B;

Go out and enjoy your *tax-free* 50 billion dollars in cash!

&amp;#x200B;

Well, let's say another year passes. Your 100 billion worth of shares has grown to 107 billion because the market generally grows at 7%. You call up the bank and say, hey, I'd like to refinance my loan. And they nod their head and then you get a new loan for the new net worth of your shares.

So this year, you walk out of the bank with 3.5 billion in cash just from the appreciation of your shares. Note that this applies if the company rose by 7%, Tesla goes up by some fucking absurd percentage.

This is sustainable *indefinitely*, so long as the stock market outruns the interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this all sounds good in theory, some of you might state. Well, I'd like to prove that the rich already do this.

 **""Elon Musk owes $507 million to banks helping Tesla raise capital""**

""The combined value of loans made by the wealth management arms of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley surpassed $600bn in the second quarter, up 17.5 percent from a year earlier.""

""This represented 22.5 percent of the banks’ total loan books, up from 16.3 percent in mid-2017.""

""For a two-year loan against liquid investments such as stocks, wealth management clients can expect to pay a rate of about 1.4 percent, according to bankers and advisers.""

""Instead of selling assets to raise cash — and facing a capital gains tax bill — high net-worth clients obtain funding by borrowing against the value of their investments.""

&amp;#x200B;

In short, the rich ALREADY get the benefits of any appreciation in their capital. By taking advantage of low interest rates, they're able to get cash to spend while *avoiding taxes* because they haven't liquidated their holdings at all.

*[…]
But the 8-hour workday is too profitable for big business, not because of the amount of work people get done in eight hours (the average office worker gets less than three hours of actual work done in 8 hours) but because it makes for such a purchase-happy public. Keeping free time scarce means people pay a lot more for convenience, gratification, and any other relief they can buy. It keeps them watching television, and its commercials. It keeps them unambitious outside of work.

4733,Quitting minimum wage job without notice," This is very short notice (ironic) but I am in dire need of some advice

For some context, I started a job in May and it was fine until the job just got progressively worse. Management never responds, we're severely understaffed, I can never find a sub for my shift because no one ever responds, the conditions are gross, and our expectations are ridiculous. This has caused my mental health and physical health to degrade rapidly. I've asked for my hours to be cut down and nothing has happened. I don't feel valued at all.

I came down with a horrible cold which turned into some kind of stomach flu this weekend. I emailed my work, the preferred communication method, and told them I can't find a sub but I'm very sick. They responded with ""you need a sub or else you have to come in."" At this point, I have no one else to talk to and I feel like I'm stuck in a horrible situation. This job causes me so much stress and anxiety and it's dangerous. I know it's rude to quit without notice and it makes me sick to my stomach, but I don't see any other option.",False,ovmi0j,Foxxlyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ovmi0j/quitting_minimum_wage_job_without_notice/,14,1

4735,Unemployment changed my life,"Last year I was obese, 6'1 235+ pounds and extremely lethargic. I had no future, was smoking 3/4 of a pack a day, and thought I was going to just deliver food my entire life. I became unemployed due to the pandemic, and decided to get my shit together. As of today, I have lost 50 pounds, I am now back in college (been on the deans list every semester so far, have 2 more years left), got rid of my smart phone, got rid of my Xbox (had a really bad addiction to fifa), learned a ton about nutrition and cooking (which has saved me tons of money), read/listened to like 20+ books and quit smoking. I now understand why people support UBI. This has changed my life. I have probably added 30+ years more to my life by taking one year off to better myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also side note, the best part of this was getting rid of my smart phone. I have never felt more full of love and positivity in my entire life than I do now. I seriously believe the most negative aspect of my life was social media. It made me feel so judgmental of other people and honestly made me root against others. I need to get rid of my YouTube account and reddit account still, but I learn so much from both of those platforms it's hard to find the right motive to get rid of them.

4743,"How does a society of ""antiwork"" people function exactly? If no one is contributing to society, how does it run?","Title summarizes my question quite well. The only reason society functions as we know it is because people work and contribute towards it in an extremely diverse amount of ways. Whether you're picking fruit on a farm, in construction or an accountant, there is work that needs to be done for the world to operate. And it's not necessarily fun.

Before people get the wrong idea, I'm NOT supporting the current system. Obviously massive wealth discrepancies are a problem - this post has nothing to do with capitalism or the current system. However, all societies need people to contribute to it in the form of work. Even in a hunter-gatherer society people need to forage, hunt, create tools and structures, etc.

So in an ""antiwork"" society, how exactly does anything get done? And if only some people work and others don't choose to work, why should those who choose not to work be entitled to the benefits of those who are contributing? Going back to hunter-gatherer, that'd be like your community going out and foraging/hunting while you lay down and sleep, and then you eat the food they worked to acquire. And you do this consistently. Does that sound like something you want to aspire towards?",False,ovo9tb,wantmytinderhunnies,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ovo9tb/how_does_a_society_of_antiwork_people_function/,83,1

4745,My recent experience with working really long hours and quitting.,"I was working a job as a Heavy duty mechanic repairing construction equipment.  I would work for 3-4 weeks straight 8-12 hours a day. The job was 7 hours away from home. The pay was good $45 an hour but no over time pay. Which I just found out was illegal. 

I was given a warning that I'd be fired for not leaving drip trays under equipment and apparently having too many equipment not in functional condition because of repairs and waiting for parts(which was not true). I found that quite pitty so I just quit in the middle of a shift.

I had been looking for work in my home town but not much luck. The second day i got home I received a job offer just for a month of work but I might have the opportunity to work part time after. 

I wish more people would realize that they have been manipulated and brainwashed into loving capitalism. There are other ways, money and the economy isn't real.

4747,Starting new job,"I do mostly contract work as a freelancer but I have tried ""real jobs"" a few times and it never works out well. I'm a great worker but not a great employee apparently. 

Real job #1 I got fired after 4 months because I ""question authority"" ... 🙄🙄... 

Real job #2 was in a call center and I ended up quitting after me and my work bestie who sat in the cubicle behind me talked about getting out of there everyday, we really hyped each other up. Lol.  She did it first and then I did it a couple weeks after. Job wasn't even that bad but sitting in a cubicle everyday really messed me up. 

Real job #3 was great except I had to drive a lot in my own car and they didn't reimbursement mileage or anything. I went back and forth with my manager on how it's not fair because if an in-office worker makes the same as me then I actually take home less since I have to pay for all my own gas and car maintenance. After I quit I found out that they maxed out my annual salary on hire and I was never gonna get a raise (or mileage) because I couldn't make more than my manager. So basically my manager badly negotiated his own pay and that affected my ability to get paid more. I quit because I couldn't get over the no mileage reimbursement thing after driving like 700 miles in a week. 

Real job #4 starts next week! I'll be working from home so no worries about mileage. But i am worried about a regular 8-5 work week. I signed a one year contract this time so I can't just quit. I gotta make it through the whole year. It's possible I'll get called in mid year but with the Delta variant maybe not. 

Not excited about working in this type of arrangement... However, as we all know, that's the scam if you want health insurance and benefits. Contract work is its own thing.. I do prefer working as I please... However I don't always have health insurance and no sick days. Gotta know how to save in order to pay all those taxes at the end of the year.. yada yada.
