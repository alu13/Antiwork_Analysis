5,Work Should be a Choice For Extras,every person born has the right to a good life  instead we have a society where four billion people live in poverty 2 billion work every day just to survive one billion work 40 years to have a few years of retirement and a few hundred thousand live in total luxury    what we need is a universal basic package  humanity has the means to pay for this why arent we doing it  what i think the basic package should include  1  housing with a minimum of 400 sq ft per person in the household  eg a couple gets 800 sq ft a family of 4 gets 1600 sq ft  air conditioning and heat provided based on the location 2  clean water 3  basic food  rice beans bread eggs milk spices etc 4 cookware  plates glasses sporks pots and pans stove oven etc 5 utilities  gas and electric 6 basic furniture  couch chairs tables beds 7 clothing 8 gym membership or exercise equipment  this will pay for itself with a healthier population 9 transportation  i think the form of transportation depends where you live eg city metro pass minivan for family pickup truck for work but up to 3k a yearyear for getting around is easily doable 10 education  kindergarten through college should be paid for its the students right at the end to decide if they want to pursue working for somebody else or use their education to focus on their own life 11 information technology and entertainment  basic tvinternet package so humans can share information with each other and share cultural experiences eg movies shows sports games etc 12 1 educational vacation per household per year  i dont think on a basic package you should be going to disneyworld but maybe to the beach to learn about the effects of plastics pollutions in our oceans or to europe to gain a better understanding of the horrors of the holocaust  things i dont think should be in the basic package  1 video games 2 meat 3 eating out 4 air or aquatic vehicles 5 alcohol or marijuana 6 movie or sports tickets 7 premium cable  you need to pay if you want faux news  so in my plan everybody gets the basic package and then if you want to add on to that you can go out and get a job for those things  this way youre not having to worry about working to pay the rent or making sure the power stays on  you are working for the extras like a ps5 or a night out with the family,noj5x6

38,My company's latest retention scheme to stop people from leaving,so because employees have been leaving due to shit ass management and lack of proper direction the managers came up with an ultra innovative strategy which sucks ass especially because its shit pay and it comes with a billion terms and conditions  you get paid a certain amount as bonus now after 1st year and after 2nd year its not some extraordinary amount mind you about 2 months of extra pay which is not much after taxes and apparently this is some extra generous deed that you have to keep it a secret oh no  so what are the terms  eligible only if you havent submitted your termination notice before the agreement fair enough  you cant leave the company within that year if you do leave then you will have to pay the amount back for that year lol like i can totally see legal issues chasing you even after you decide to leave the company and paying back a few bucks short also they dont mention if you should return amount before or after the taxation red alert  eligible only if you perform well and get a good score above a threshold in your performance analysis lol its them that decide what score you get if you get lower score they stop all subsequent payments i can totally see them increasing the already high workload expectations just so you will fight harder to get that score for that beautiful compensation like ive been in this company for majority of my career and still i have to prove myself that i deserve that amount of money theyre so generously giving away   you cant be on leave for some amount of consecutive days this is easy everyone knows you can plan illnesses or injuries for the coming 3years otherwise even if you work well before and after that rest period you still wont get the money fuck you rofl manage your illnesses better  also if i get that money itll be spent soon or invested somewhere and it would be more trouble to pay it back if i decide to leave because they dont realise that unlike them people dont have deep cash reserves sitting in offshore bank accounts youd have to keep that cash untouched because god forbid if you have to leave due to some unforeseen circumstances  they dont understand that employees leaving makes them worthless so i dont get the point that they still determine our worth with their expectations its not really a goodwill gesture if its accompanied by so much legal terms  i also can totally see them paying less annual bonus or salary rise because this extra amount has to be deducted somewhere from our own paychecks but of course none of this would be mentioned in the agreement  fuck that im not signing that and creating more trouble for myself that agreement actually made me decide that i should leave soon so no point in taking it and paying back good luck to anyone that signs it,np4ps9

first post on reddit so please be patient with me and mods please if i do something wrong please go ahead and tell me so i can correct it next time  today im a 23 unemployed swiss dude with no papers or graduations whatsoever or accomplishments in his life   im sorry in advance if this is a mess im writing this on the spur of the moment and have never been good narratively  when i was a kid i had a lot of problems as probably like many others i was heavily bullied in the small village i lived in my dad had died when i was 3 years old of lung cancer which apparently had left some sort of trauma in me that i could never notice directly my mom owned a restaurantbistro which had living quarters upstairs and thats were we lived since when i was born i lived with her my half bro and half sis who were both 10 and 7 years older than me as i mentioned i was getting bullied almost daily by the kids in my village i never had friends and was often thrown into the village fountain we had next to the bus stop to go to school which made me backtrack and head back home often to change and had my mom stop work to drop me off there the biggest problem i had and im even today extremely ashamed to admit it but one of my problems apparently tied to my dead father trauma was that i could never go to the bathroom to relieve myself feces and used to wear diapers until very late i stopped wearing them after being a few years old but the problem followed me further into my life  when i got to the age of 8 we moved out of there and started living in a big city where nothing was better i joined a new school where the problems i had were still very apparent i didnt want to be with anybody and would still have the same toilet issues it would smell bad and people obviously disliked it i was then a year later thrown into a special class with only 6 other kids who also had problems and where the teachers would work with us more slowly its a good time to mention that ive never been smart at all or studious i wasnt a troublesome kid but i had nothing good going for me i dont really remember how many years i spent in that school but at some point the problems i had were becoming increasingly problematic for a kid so my mom was forced to put me into a boarding school for 2 years after having spent 3 weeks in the hospital to try and help me out this was a hard time for me having to be separated from home and my family for the week as far as i can remember i had a lot of great experiences there because the teachers were great and the other kids wouldnt really bother me i for the first time had a few people i could call friends with which we used to play pokemon on our nintendo dss and such during those years my toilet problems finally seemed to be gone and i could go to the bathroom and relieve myself like a normal person after those 2 years i was reintroduced into a more normal class in an other school where again we would only be a few kids but we worked more on studies and grades next year was the year i finally was introduced into a normal class again i was at the time 3 years away from finishing normal school it was probably the worst class i had been in yet tho i joined it midyear for some reason and so was put into a class were people knew each other already and had groups left and right i remember i was still very introverted and didnt want to attract too much attention but the other kids let me know very clearly they didnt like me i was very soon put into a situation so difficult that i couldnt process anything when i was at school and my grades had dropped so low that they let me pass the year but put me into a lowergrade class for the remaining 2 years its during that hellish year that my older brother gave me his xbox and i finally had something i could enjoy doing fully i would play mw2 halo reach borderlands and such every time i had the occasion i wouldnt do anything else during my free time anymore i would even wake up 12 hours early each day to play the games some more with people i had met online the remaining 2 years were fine people were nice in my class but i didnt really have anybody i could call friends in it but the ambiance was good enough so i could enjoy it i then graduated from school  but as i still had no idea what i wanted to do in life as nothing seemed to be enjoyable so if i wanted to get into highschool i had to do an additional year with more difficult stuff to learn so id be caught up from the normalgrade class i was demoted from during this year i found what i could call real friends which i still have contacts with today which is good to mention i believe after that year which i passed with ok grades i went into highschool since i still couldnt find an apprenticeship i had yet to know what i wanted to do in life i was at the time 1 or 2 years older than the average kid  here is the part that starts to be a little bit more important in my opinion to todays events but still part of my background  so i joined highschool and the first and second years were pretty uneventful i had failing grades in a few subjects but i still barely passed i had some great times and most people were nice getting to my 3rd and final year something had changed i dont know why and how but i slowly started getting depressed i cursed to hell every day i had to spend there and right around february i lost the strength to go there it started slowly throughout the first part of the year where i would skip 1 or 2 days of school then at some point i just stopped going at all maybe because it was of the stress of finals coming and i knew i wasnt prepared i could never remember anything i learned there for more than a month so i got to my 3rd year without remembering anything i had learnt until now i knew i was going to fail school was very easy i always felt you learned basic stuff and there wasnt much of it but highschool to me was different i always got away with studying the night before because i just didnt have fun learning all those subjects and facts everyday there german history maths psychology i just had no interest or fun in learning any of those things i wouldnt go and would stay hidden in the dark in my room until my mom had left yeah im a pos i knew her and i knew she wouldnt understand she would cursed me to death and would throw me back there by force if she knew but i felt extremely anxious and out of place now in this class that i used to enjoy being part of my mom was very strict in a lot of ways but only to some extent she knew first hand i had a difficult childhood so she gave me space and time for the things i enjoyed doing on the side but its different when it came to school and grades i should have always done more and better to her i couldve been happy having good grades but shed often them me it couldve been better so of course if she knew i was skipping shed kill me i didnt want to see or talk to anybody from that class either anymore and i think it was the same for them all those people i felt close to didnt give a shit that at some point id just stop coming all together the stress and guilt were too heavy to try and go back but the days shed wouldnt have to work id feign going in the morning and hang out in a caf just waiting for the time to pass i was so scared of going back even when i left the house to go somewhere i didnt have the strength to bring myself there after a month of fully not going one day that my mom didnt work we received a letter in the mail saying they hadnt seen my for a while and of course my mom exploded she called me while i was supposedly on my way to school telling me we received that letter so i went back home tried to explain myself and got the beating of a lifetime she yelled cursed pulled my hair and said all sort of stuff youd expect rightfully so my mom legit hated me for a few months because i had lied to her about going to school at this time they sent me to see a psychologist my mom never understood nor wanted to understand my problems but my sis alongside our family doc convinced her to try and send me to one after 6 seances nothing really came out of it i dont ever remember what we talked about with her but we just stopped because there was no point i didnt want to go and talk to her until now i never really felt comfortable talking to people about what i had inside my head without bursting into tears and feeling like shit remember that ive always been introverted to an extent so outside of school and online friends  i wouldnt talk to anyone and didnt want to spend time outside of my room  my mom since the moment she knew i didnt go she just wouldnt talk to me for a long time unless forced to that had me fucked up for a while i was still in a very bad mental state at the time and since i had no other choice but to repeat the year and go back in august which was like 4 months later i just went but i couldnt i went there for a few weeks but i felt miserable all the time i was around 3 years older than most everyone knew each other and frankly speaking i wasnt interested in getting to know them i wasnt interested but i still felt out of place and looked upon as a nuisance or a bug that shouldnt be with them in that classroom so i did it again but this time i caught the letter they sent home and destroyed it i didnt have the willpower or strength to go to school for every reason in the world but i could never face my mom again with the same shit happening the next year after i told her id go i was in a pit hole getting crushed by anxiety and guilt every day and every night id cry on my own and acted as if nothing was wrong because i never felt understood anywhere what would the point be of trying once again to explain my situation i knew how it would end up so i just acted for months until the end of the year and just announced that i had failed even then my mom was pretty fucking angry and would yell at me and would constantly ask herself what she did wrong as a mother as if it was her fault which i knew it wasnt but seeing her like that hurt like hell on top of knowing what i had done this repeated 3 year that i didnt attend and kept hatting myself for a while   still background but im gonna mention my professional life from here on out which is much more important than my school years probably  so after those events i had to go to the armyjune to october 2019 its mandatory in switzerland so i had no choice since i was done with my studies but i felt like it would be a great 4 months i have no idea why but i had positive apprehensions about it boy was i fu wrong probably the thing i hated the most in my life yet more than anything it was hell everyday i felt like i was useless i didnt know how to properly do anything i always had to rely on my other comrades and i was exhausted to 200 everyday i was getting yelled at everyday and the stress was on an other level some of the recruits were nice but the other half were bullies once again they would sometimes be okish nice and others utterly annoying and mean fortunately when they saw i was having a hard time with anything even if they were a bit angry theyd help me out the other recruits who i got along well with were the nicest people out there i was decently obese and asthmatic since i was around 10 so sports werent really my thing but they really pushed me up and helped me out when i needed it even our sergeants they knew i was trying so most of the times when it was something physical theyd be understanding that i couldnt do it as well it seems nice at first but it was still hell this kind of environment wasnt for me getting yelled at constantly having to do things over and over and over learning stuff i didnt like doing out of all things i had to work as a firefighter in the swiss bunkers i was given the little motivation i had in my by my friends helping me out constantly and trying their best to support me but i felt like a weight all the goddamn time and i hated it just as much as everything else i somehow ended my service like everyone else and finally got home  since i didnt have anything my sister found me a job in the shop she worked a few weeks after i was done with the military and i started working there with an extra contract meaning i was an extra and would just do the same work as anyone else but theyd just give me hours of work when they needed another person in the shop i was still very much introverted and didnt want to interact with other at too much but it was fine since it meant i was getting paid well for the low amount of work i had to do i was still mostly happy tho i had just come out of what i felt like was hell and i could finally earn a little bit of money to help out my brother and i were still living with our mom my sister had moved out a few years ago already thats why i could do it only working a few days per week sometimes 23 other weeks maybe 4 and of course for christmas i worked full time but i was still fine with it as it was 1 month and after that i knew i could get new parts for my pconly hobby then covid came and so i didnt have to work for 2 months but during summer we opened again and id go work a few hours each week since there werent many customers coming at the time we got to november of last year and i unfortunately lost my job my sis had quit since she wanted to start new studies and some other of my colleagues did as well so the shop got a brand new staff and since they didnt need the extra anymore as they had enough fulltime employees i was laid off   today main subject  so after losing my job in november my mom told me i needed to find an apprenticeship i didnt finish highschool and had pretty much nothing in my hands but the more i thought about it the more i knew there was literally nothing i wanted to do i had experienced a few things in my life already and no matter where i looked there was nothing i was interested in i had been able to work only a few days per week because at home both my mom and bro were working to sustain us i felt like the least annoying thing would probably be working as a computerscientist so i started sending letters left and right but i never received a single positive answer at 23 i hadnt graduated anywhere and only had a little bit of work experience so no one was interested in me i was actually supposed to find an apprenticeship in 2020 but with covid and me still being pretty confused about what i wanted to do in my life i ended up still working at my previous job without looking for an option   a thing i forgot to mention concerning my health alongside that im pretty fat 100kg and my asthma is that since around being 20 years old i started having a lot of bowel pains and painful long lasting diarrheas after some tests we knew i was lactose intolerant and not gluten so i started avoiding everything containing it but to no avail it wasnt ever too annoying but it was still there during the army there were plenty of time where i felt like i was going to explode and so did the other recruits most likely because lots of waterheavy exercisesbowel movement same during my previous job but they were very understanding it was a small gift shop without too many customersbliss since i dont like having to interact too much with people as mentioned and that i dont enjoy working in retail so i could just go have bathroom breaks whenever i needed them but those past few months its becoming increasingly more severe i had done some sample tests mid2020 that i send to my doc but they all came back negative no parasites no ibd nothing he thought it was either stress or food allergies id like to point out that those would happen very often it could be fine for a week once in a while but then every day for a full months ill be having abdominal pains and would be stuck in the bathroom for hours each day  so after never getting positive answers to the letters i sent to get an apprenticeship my mom was getting pretty mad and annoyed that i couldnt find anything so she started pushing me to find something else like in retail i know for a fact id hate it with all i have the one job i had was a dream job but wouldnt be able to sustain someone on their own with the amount of hours i had  the only reason i thought about being a computer scientist was because i knew a few people who enjoyed doing it and since i was always in front of a computer it seemed fine but the more i thought about it the more thinking about being in that environment scared the sh out of me having to deal with people learning stuff getting yelled at for anything  as the years passes i feel like i wanna distance myself more and more from everyone i dont talk to my 2 best friends i had back in highschool working with customers is hell i quite frankly dont like the people around me the amount of time my family had been unfair to me in so many different scenarios has made me not want to spend time with them more than i need to the only times i enjoy being here is when im online thats the only thing i can say makes me happy not going outside not seeing friends not spending time with family no sports absolutely not working  up until now as i said both my mom and bro were working full time to sustain us my mom especially as shes been working her whole life doing many jobs for long hours as she had to take care of 3 children on her own with a little bit of help from her boyfriend now shes getting to a point in her life where shes sick tired and would like to finally be free in a few years so she can leave and retire peacefully  i understand that i need to do something so i at least tried so when my mom managed to get me an  internship in a multimedia shop through some contacts i accepted its only 2 weeks long and with the experience i got i thought it should be fine but no it actually wasnt i hate it thats my very first full time job in a long time and i genuinely do not understand how people can do that for the rest of their lives wake up at 645am and come home at 730pm being so fucking exhausted you can do nothing but fall onto your bed how how do people even do this i dont want life to be this you just wake up early got to a god awful day of work come back late and cant do anything so you just sleep it would be even worse if i lived on my own and there was all the other stuff you have to take care of in the house i hate how life is about this unless youve got all the money you want in life its not worth it  ive been depressed for a few months now i hate my life i dont know what i want to do i have my own health issues who prevent me from having a normal joblife if i were to ever get one and i dont find enjoyment in anything aside being with my online friends life still goes on and i need to do something but i dont know what and how to my mom is killing herself working until my bro my sis and i find something stable my sister is in trouble as well now but with money and still hasnt finished anything to have a stable job my bro works at 80 but thats the only thing he does he cant do anything when it comes to housework i know its mainly my fault and i hate it but im not able to do anything i couldnt finish my studies i dont do anything interesting i couldnt get a better contract at my previous job i cant keep friends ive pretty much been a failure my entire life everything ive done was trash and ive only been a pest to everyone around me i cant keep a job i cant get an apprenticeship because i know i will not be able to finish it like highschool ive never had the willpower or strength to finish or do anything properly for the few years ive been here i hate who i am and what ive done and i dont want to keep being such a burden to my family  dont like saying it but ive previously thought about suicide to me it seemed like the best option im against a wall right now and it feels like the only way out is banging my head hard enough on it until i drop on one side if i cant find an apprenticeship which my mom made clear was the only path that would lead me to a normal life but i know i wouldnt be able to do it but if i dont my mom is gonna keep suffering from it and she shouldnt i wished many time to not be there not be a burden to everyone around me not be

98,The difference from working in retail to working as a software developer.,hi everyone  to give a bit of a background im 32 never went to college and worked retail jobs since i graduated high school i come from a very poor family when i was 26 i moved back in with my parents to lower my costs still paid rent but it was much cheaper then living in a studio apartment when i was 30 i enrolled in a coding bootcamp and when i was 31 at the start of covid i got my first and current software development role at a small growing startup i still currently live with my parents as housing prices are still climbing despite covid in my area  i started to become pretty miserable at retail i would be treated like subhuman if my manager had to do something he would just say he isnt coming in when i was sick he would text me in the middle of the day to see if i can come in on the second half of the day vacation days were super hard to use he would text me on days off to cover shifts had no consideration that maybe i had plans he would watch to make sure nobody finished lunch 5 minutes late and would check the bathroom if we took to long it felt like prison they would treat us like machines  i almost felt lost when i started my development job i didnt have to clock in people would respect my time i never get a call during my time off when i called in sick the only thing my manager said was thanks for letting me know hope you feel better no extra texts just acknowledging and moving on didnt try to guilt trip me like in retail whenever someone messages me during off hours they let me know that there is no rush and that i could respond when im free the next day nobody cares when i start my day i would often start around noon since i hate waking up with an alarm i got a performance bonus for the year as well in retail nobody would give a shit if i did well at my job bonuses were none  employers should respect their employees,nowoys

161,How I worked at an up-and-coming cult and got out of it,i usually lurk around here this is my first time posting and i want to get this out because this previous job that i worked at made me realize that i dont need to sacrifice my life over it   im a teacher it took me a while to realize that this school that i worked at was a cult i wont go much into the details but it was a school that fell under a certain sect of mysticism the leader of this sect was revered regarded highly among the followers and remained in shrouds of mystery   the first thing i learned while working in a cult organization is that they dont show obvious signs of cultism rather they will welcome you and chant mantras such as were a family not even were like a family but straightup were a family they will shower you with gifts and show the ideal version of themselves they will promise you the stars and the moon   then once the honeymoon period is over they will show you their true selves   for us the honeymoon period was over once the school started the gifts dried up and the promises that they made simply never existed no brand new resources no stateoftheart gym or programs that would be implemented for students we were forced to teach in certain ways but those certain ways were never elaborated clearly thousands of meetings happened but none of them served any purpose other than the admin giving pep talks that ultimately was about glorifying their leader and their sect   the admin tried to break us through the meetings or morning announcements every day all teachers and students were all forced to mindlessly chant about how great their leader was without knowing the true meaning behind it all this time period was only supposed to last about 20 minutes but it actually went over an hour and on some occasion even three hours so that they could praise their leader they would show us redundant videos about the power of your mind how you are a robot and the classic we are all one big family   all of these videos and mantras chanted during meetings and within the auditorium made no sense it was all a total waste of learning time and socialization time for students and teachers   did the teachers voice their complaints yes some of us did including me another thing you need to know about cults is that they dont like it when they have opposition within their community some of the more vocal complaints from teachers were stomped out through forced resignation the school kept us all under control through fear and manipulation it was funny because there were only a couple of students who needed to be expelled for serious offence such as violence but they never were expelled the teachers who tried to work with those students got fired instead because someone needed to take the punishment it wouldve looked bad on the school if they had a track record of students who got expelled but high turnover rates obviously meant crap   they tried to break me a lot they tried to indoctrinate me with their leaders videos and if i didnt comply i would be threatened for not living up to my teaching standards there was high amount of favoritism and passiveaggressive micromanagement from the admin those who were not favored were punished by having the worst classrooms with pests and no resources   we had a couple of teachers who were on near verge of death and hospitalized guess what the admin forced them to do thats right work on their hospital beds and smile at that proudly yes in fact this was what all of us went through at this organization we worked nonstop sometimes for 24hours straight there were a couple of staff members who were so proud of hustling but it was all toxic positivity talk and brainwashing from the cult that made them think this way   at some point after taking brutal amount of psychological punishment i realized that there was nothing that they could do to me after seeing the hypocrisy and lies that the school lived up to instead of teaching proper character development what broke me was actually seeing the school not care about the students i felt like such a fool for believing that at least the admin cared about the students because thats what they always said the admin always told the students how they were regarded as the admins kids and how much the admin loved them yet this admin who said that they loved kids did not provide proper funding for students with special needs and left students alone in classrooms on several occasions this was all later revealed to me after i learned that they falsified their budget reports and heard the news on how they handled substitutes   after enduring mental torture that finally wore me down physically i ended up leaving the school but not before i reported the school to the government i learned that no job is worth your health be it mental emotional or physical watch out for any organization or companies that exhibit cultlike behaviors even if its small you might wonder why i took this job or why i didnt leave sooner well thats what i used to shamefully think when it came to domestic abuse of course i used to think about domestic abuse like that when i was a kid wouldnt it be just easier to leave dont you see the red flags   the point is sometimes you just get so blinded and swept up by what seems ideal that you end up losing whats actually important i thought that in order to chase down my dreams i had to sell my soul to the devil and let me tell you it wasnt worth it  you are important you matter youre not just some organizations little slave you are your own free agent dont be a mere cog in the machine dont sacrifice your soul to places that dont care crap about you i wanted to be a teacher to do meaningful work for society but once i worked at that school my work became meaningless i am trying to reclaim who i am and who i want to be   dont let anyone try to force you period     tldr i worked at a school that turned out to be a cult and slowly revealed its true colors over the years never again you are not your job you are worth so much more than stupid ideals like dream jobs or being on proper life trajectory aka getting your shit together no and who cares fuck them,no1z2t

196,We will never have full employment or full automation because unemployment and handwork is good for capitalism,unemployment is not all bad for the bosses  imagine a society where there is full employment  workers would not fear losing their jobs they would  feel more comfortable fighting for their rights and associating with unions without being harassed and pressured unemployment is a necessity  for maintaining capitalism bosses needs an army of reserve labor force to replenish aways when needed   in addition capitalism in its foundation prevents the total automation of labor as it is human wage labor that generates product value have you ever stopped to think about what society was like before money people exchanged goods for goods but as we evolved we can no longer exchange because we would hardly find someone who would be exchanging what we need for what we have to offer but to replace this exchange system we need some product value metrics for that we have to find a common denominator in every human product which is labor how much does labor cost in a very simplistic way work costs what an average human needs to stay alive keep working in the next day and reproduce so that their children work too   i have summarized an extremely complex theory developed by many sociologists for decades so do not expect that here you will find all the answers but surely if you do some research you will find more material to delve into,nnjbf8

auditing attorney requests for money in this auditing portion of my job i saw massive fraud  attorneys faking billing lying about how much time they spent in the court room lying about how much time it took them to write motionsjust lying all the time i fought endlessly with my bosses about it telling them that we had to acti put my heart and soul into it and for 3 years one of my bosses and i fought and we tried to stop these people from stealing tax payer dollars unfortunately he retired and was replaced with a micromanager and it turns out the micromanager liked to read employee emails and didnt like people shitting on her attorney friends and after 35 years of giving 100 i was fired because i was sexting my girlfriend on my work computer i was dealing with insane depression issues and my parents were about to get divorced  my fault i guess  so i applied for jobs within the court system and got hired a few months later i didnt really level with them about why i lost my previous job because it was too embarrassing  i just told them my position was eliminated from my last job  2 months into my new job i get a call from my boss ill make this story short  my previous boss who fired me went out of her way to contact my new boss told him what happened and so he called me in and fired me on the spot before my probation ended so i had no employee protections  this is when i slipped into a major depression  after 6 months and after applying to 135 jobs and disclosing to many why i lost my jobs didnt want to get fired a 3rd time i got hired the new employer asked me to never talk about why i lost my previous jobs ever again as if i really wanted to i started there and things went great for about 6 months  6 months into the job my supervisor quits and they decide they will not hire anyone or promote anyoneso its now just me doing 2 peoples work i immediately find another place to apply to and i was able to get hired on my way out after resigning my boss pulls me into their office and berates me to the point where i left in tears so thats 3 jobs in a row of me leaving in tears if you are counting  i start my next job and things go okay for the next 2 years  after 2 years of this job there was an incident not involving me in a weeks time we had 2 people quit and there was no one to cover their duties i had been training them so i was reassigned to their work 2 peoples workload i worked 70 hours weeks for many months giving 100 to make it work and i succeeded after months of working long days i had it under control  then my mother almost passed away thank god the hospital saved her life during those weeks i still kept working i didnt want to disappoint my employer because we were so shortstaffed i was giving 100  a few months later my supervisor quits and i applied for her job i was the only internal applicant only internal interview i had 3 years of experience at this place i get a call one morning from my friend at work and he says oh you dirty dog you i heard they sent out a job offer and you didnt even tell me you got it turns out they told people they gave out an offer to someone else before they even told me that i was out of consideration i found out from my friends my boss called me 10 hours later to tell me i didnt get the job  and then a year goes by what a fool i was to stay  and 3 weeks ago my new supervisor quit  and today i find out they are promoting a new person recently hired in the last 2 years to be the manager over methe guy who has been doing 2 peoples worth of work for going on 3 yearsthe guy who worked while his mom was in the hospital how dumb i amthe guy who cleaned up the mess of everyone who kept quitting  it has been a tough day  but ive been fortunate enough to end up on the luckyside of capitalism in my life when i was in my early 20s and just started working at court back in 2012 and 2013 i invested every spare penny i had into tesla stock i had no friends no social life nothingso i just spent my nights reading and learning and i was blown away by electric cars the investment didnt amount to much for the first 67 years because i didnt have much money to even invest in the first placebut in the past year or so ive managed to make nearly 1 million dollars most of which is now cashlifechanging in so many ways for someone who takes home 25k a yearbut yet i never let it actually change my life butafter what ive been through with employers and after being passed over again today im sure as shit thinking about letting this money change my life i also would like to get revenge on 1 employer for a change and make them feel bad for once  what do you think should i continue to be humble keep my head down and ignore the money ive saved or do you think its time to tell someone to f off  im 30 single blessed by the stock market gods but miserable because my employer uses me and never thinks of me for anythingthey just think im a peon  fuck them for thinking im a fucking peon im not some dumb shitbag im worthy im a good person and i give 100 but the employers in this country are evil and are turning me into a monster im mad all the time sad angryits not what it should be at allnot when ive been blessed the way i have  sorry for the rant im so exaughsted im taking a mental health day tomorrow so that i dont end up rage quitting,nmpmm6
296,Return to office...,we dont just have to return to office next week but they also introduced a flexclean desk policy so i wont even have my own desk anymore so i am forced to waste an hour of commute each day again and waste time finding a desk each morning setting up everything i am a very cluttered worker i like to leave stuff lying around i work better that way  i think flex desks are okay if you give people the option to work from home but forcing everyone into the office and not even giving them their dedicated space is just terrible it was one of the reasons i did not take a job once because i hate this policy so much,nmt7fb

308,Why they really want you to go back to the office.,there are a couple reasons why all of the sudden covid is all good now does not seem to matter like it used to time to go back to the office even though your life became greater working from home there is less pollution because of all the travel more time for yourself seemingly at no expense for the company right i mean work output is the same to them so why is it company bosses vs workers on this one well  here are a couple of the real reasons  1 real estate value the basic most capitalist thing we all know about businesses its all about the bottom line money value revenue  costs  profit all of the sudden that nice modern glasseverywhere building loses its value becomes abandoned   2 middle managers and hr what is their job anymore the link between the all mighty executives and the peasant workers looking over your shoulder to see what youre doing organising team building walking around giving the workers praise for things they dont actually understand having pointless scheduled meetings no need for that workers can just zoom call their workloads are slashed and almost made redundant  3 fear of change by the bosses with the old person mindset someone on top of their game should be able to adjust get out of that office space lease fast accept this is how its done now   4 and finally ofcourse there are workers who enjoy the office politics their ability to kiss the boss ass and undercut their coworkers far outweighs actual skills or they might be a good person that let work take over their life and they dont know what to actually do with their spare time,nn6mm3

327,Mental impediments to antiwork ideas,hi  its been quite clear to me that an antiworkcentric society would be far less alienating for everyone and could possibly stand a chance against climate change however the way there isnt easy and people have integrated a lot of political ideology that moreless gaslights them into accepting the current system as it is and basically go to work as expected of them  what are those blockages   any sort of wealth redistribution reform will be perceived even by a large majority of the modest people as a crime against economic freedom taxes that would fund infrastructure and social programs are perceived as parasitic and people who are actually more in need are dehumanized  this is grounded in further unconscious mental structures the idea of merit is central to this for the reactionary ideology to work peoples reallife position at a given point have to be the expression of their moral value through motivation grit seriousness or hardwork  the reactionary ideology has to posit that the rich man has worked hard and deserves his wealth however often inherited and that the poor mans condition results from bad choices bad morals laziness or even intellectual inferiority  now obviously jobs arent allocated out of merit nor intelligence in the realworld determining factors have been scientifically proven to boil down much more to your parents cultural capital than it does to whatever individual faculties you may have   thats why reactionaries love to glorify freewill as an essential part of human nature and tend to reject more deterministic accounts as apologetic for the lazy or other negativelyloaded terminology meant to label the other party as a bleedingheart liberal,nmk6j1

344,"In Labor Sectors, Why Are Bosses, Managers, Supervisors Needed?",in the very early 20th century the teens and twenties and continuing into the 30s if we look at the business press and various publications of the time they were very worried terrified even by a new kind of labor strike the sitdown strike it began in us steel production rather than protest and march to deliver grievances to capitalist bosses outside of factories workers simply sat inside the factories and did nothing they realized that they held all the power because they were the producers many of them began to question why do we need bosses we have all the skills to produce everything ourselves we can be the enterprisers and run everything we can take over and own the factories collectively why have bosses managers foremen etc from steel it went into the garment industry from there it moved into textiles meat packing plants machine shops and on and on the popular phrase we know what to do so why do we need you took hold sitdowns became an effective tool and was predictably met by capitalist with the forced removal by cops it was a scarier form of strike for the employers because the capitalists couldnt simply have workers killed as they had done in the 19th century and so it was eventually driven out of them in various ways mass firings political repression etc  if workers do indeed know how to operate machines and run factories why then are bosses necessary,nmf5tc
345,"""Laziness Does Not Exist""",  the title refers to an essay that is in this subreddits library   i read it and was a bit surprised at its inclusion in the subs library the message of the essay is essentially that laziness does not exist because any failure to work can be attributed to fixable barriers in other words the essay upholds the idea that healthy people want to work and even work in the ways specifically administered by society but encounter obstacles that prevent them from realizing this desire in fact the author states that lazy behavior is not an active choice   to me this message is not antiwork at all it does not criticize modes of work or ideas about work instead it insists that individuals must and want to adapt themselves to working and someone who flat out does not want to work is an aberrationultimately not that much different from the original idea of laziness but instead of pinning the blame on free will the essay pins it on mental health or unfavorable circumstances   i wonder if anyone else has noticed this,nmnwib

353,Anyone feel like it's getting worse?,i feel like in the company im in everyone is being pushed to work more and more and more for less and less money   also the treatment of each person seems to be plummeting treating each person as an output machine and not even holding back on saying it    all this while pushing to pay everyone less and under market value   for instance hr says this position should be a 100k team member and management says find a truly desperate soul to do it for 40k  its horrific    cut budgets and achieve more   fire people and still hit all your numbers  have 810 hours of unproductive meetings every week but still do your job and produce the expected output   do not bring up the fact that the economy and covid are still problems  the made up fucking numbers have to be hit regardless  no one will care if you work more after hours just do all the work no one will thank you    does anyone feel like what they do during the day is the literal opposite of what they would want to do there isnt a single minute of overlap of what i would do with my day vs what i have to do   but this is the best way for me to earn a living and stay alive with enough money so whats the alternative   i never felt like such a slave to the system is it really going downhill and getting worse for anyone,nmxzjz

357,Is a high paying sales job the path off the path?,i just found out that acquisition salez not only get higher base pay than i do working in retention but their commission payouts put them well into 6 figures so i booked a meeting with the least salesy read least full of shit sales guy i know at my company to learn about the role  he has an associates degree in sports science or some shit he went to a regional community college i have a bachelors degree related to our field which overlaps between it and healthcare i went to a top 25 public university  he said he has never had to study our products in any meaningful way he basically studied a three page script and learned powerpoint when clients start asking technical questions he cant answer he just brings someone from product on the meeting or punts the questions i have to take numerous trainings and clients expect me to be a subject matter expert when things dont work my boss wants me to prevent the client from talking to her   im on the phone or in meetings all day long often having to pull ten hour days  commute pre covid he told me he takes a max of three meetings a day to stay sharp furthermore he let me know that since we have a finance team and legal team he doesnt have to do any math or understand contracts someone reviews all his work after he plugs in numbers in my role i have to be able to explain nuances of 10 page corporate legal jargon filled agreements for clients with any number of products and services  i asked him what his workday looked like  he wakes up around 8 am and drives to the gym gets a workout in showers goes home from there he decides if he wants to go into the office or work from home usually around 10 he will start checking emails or maybe have a meeting he told me he has leads assigned to him from a more junior position that does all the cold calling they schedule the meetings but he blocks his calendar off so hes only available between 11 am and 7 pm with a max of 3 calls a day in terms of duties he has to manage the sales process after he qualifies the prospect and may have up to 20 or so prospects to worry about at a time he said that aside from needing to be available for one off calls his working day is about 6 hours long  i made the mistake of asking him how much each deal is worth and he said they range from around 500 in his pocket to 5k once he hits his quarterly and monthly goals and starts getting payment multipliers he said if he hits his yearly goal early in the year which about six or seven people do every year he gets paid out double or more every sale  this guy is in his late 20s drives a brand new charger has a gorgeous fiance and told me he often gets asked to travel the country to schmooze big accounts and network told me last year he took home 170k but he wasnt really killing himself because he had a lot going on at home remodeling his basement for his man cave  last night i splurged on new curtains for my apartment   so my question is is the path to no work getting into a sales position putting in ten years and then fucking off to a low cost of living area and waiting for everyone else to wake up to how fucking horrible our work life balances are,nmwa2z

382,Morality and Shame: self policing a destructive paradigm,i like devoting my time to worthwhile pursuits i would have loved to have been a father and raise a family but our entirely irresponsible standard of living has made that an impossibility for me or at least a choice i could never live with especially since i know my kids would grow to hate me for bringing them into a dying world    which makes me wonder how it is that the generations that have taken a useful future from this planet for their comfort and toys can justify their obsession with people living up to their potential potential to do what hoard resources and burn them to the point of creating a mass extinction how are people still able to take pride in their work now that its manifestly clear that this way of life that theyre so certain is the right way couldnt be more wrong literally if the way you live destroys the ability for future generations to do the same youre living wrong objectively it goes directly against the fundamental goal of life   id love to hear the struggles of others in how visceral people respond to the antiwork idea even as the world burns down under the burden of our consumption i have no problem with work as long as the product of my efforts pushes things in a positive direction but i refuse to play this game where we competitively hoard wealth at each other and declare that as success this all has to be undone if were going to have a future thats livable how do these people still have the stones to judge those that want their life to mean something measured by more than the depth of the scar left on the planet after we leave do i really have to explain to these people why theyve actually been scammed into policing their family for the greater machine thats raping the earth to death i hold my tongue because i dont need to make someone else feel like shit for my life to have meaning but man am i ever tired of hearing about my potential im aware of my potential and im also aware of the consequences of burning fossil fuels and spending money im ready to start working to rebuild the living world at any time but i refuse to make this planet any worse than it is the hubris and arrogance of it all is so nauseating   do i even post this sure why not maybe someone can relate,nlsn6n

443,Dream Jobs,ive seen a fair few posts here that criticize the notion of a dream job but i have to strongly disagree and i want to open a discussion about this  this sub should focus on how many work environments are toxic and that there is a sick mentality in most of the world regarding the role of labor in society the notion of labor itself is not the issue though there is nothing inherently wrong with labor or even wanting to work  it is when you have no choice but to work else die or your employer undervalues and mistreats you wherein problems exist  if you have a deep desire to teach to heal to discover through research or other such pursuits then work may very well be the best path towards reaching those dreams if you want to teach being a teacher or professor will offer you the best opportunities to do so if you want to heal being a nurse or a doctor will allow you to do so in that sense its not the job thats the dream but what you are able to achieve through that work  of course not everyone has such a dream that is best realized through a job if you want to create art employment may not offer you the best path towards realizing this goal if you want  to explore nature a job might not best give you the opportunities to do so thats not to say that jobs that allow you to freely follow these dreams dont exist but theyre not inherently the best paths towards doing so  in summary this community shouldnt be so critical of the notion of a dream job labor is important and people who pursue their dreams through work play an important role in our society it is only the notion that you must have a dream job which should be abandoned as not all dreams are best realized through labor  discuss,nlhir7

500,"[WAGE THEFT] Average minimum wage violation was $64 per week or $3,300 per year for a year-round worker—nearly a quarter of the worker’s earned wages—and affected 17% of low-wage workers....4X the FBI’s $13 billion total annual value of all robberies, burglaries, larceny, and motor vehicle thefts",wage theft and weaker enforcement of labor standards many workers particularly lowwage workers and the women and men of color who are disproportionately in this category frequently fail to receive the wages they are owed31 this is referred to as wage theft and reflects workers being paid below the minimum wage not being paid for all hours worked not being paid timeandahalf though legally eligible for overtime experiencing illegal deductions from pay and having their tips stolen by employers or supervisors a recent example involved amazon which agreed to pay the federal trade commission 617 million because it shorted its drivers tips over a twoandahalfyear period starting in late 2016 greene 2021  how extensive is wage theft the available information shows the problem is pervasive the best analysis is from a 2008 study of 4387 workers in lowwage industries in chicago los angeles and new york it found that twothirds of workers surveyed experienced at least one payrelated violation in any given week the average violation amounted to 15 of earnings bernhardt milkman and theodore 2009  another study cooper and kroeger 2017 examined the wage theft affecting minimum wage workers in the 10 most populous states accounting for more than half the national workforce it found that total wages stolen from workers due to minimum wage violations alone exceeds 15 billion annually on a national basis the average minimum wage violation amounted to 64 per week or 3300 per year for a yearround workernearly a quarter of the workers earned wagesand affected 17 of lowwage workers the authors detail who was affected  young workers women people of color and immigrant workers are more likely than other workers to report being paid less than the minimum wage but this is primarily because they are also more likely than other workers to be in lowwage jobs in general lowwage workers experience minimum wage violations at high rates across demographic categories in fact the majority of workers with reported wages below the minimum wage are over 25 and are nativeborn us citizens nearly half are white more than a quarter have children and just over half work full time  a backoftheenvelope estimate extrapolating from the bernhardt milkman and theodore 2009 study suggests that by 2016 aggregate wage theft was on the order of 52 billion annually mcnicholas mokhiber and chaikof 2017 this estimate does not include the stealing of tips where the wage received is nevertheless the minimum or violations of prevailing wage laws this understated estimate of aggregate wage theft is nonetheless four times greater than the fbis 13 billion estimate of the total annual value of all robberies burglaries larceny and motor vehicle theft  other insights can be gleamed by identifying the amounts recovered in wage theft suits and enforcement actions by the us department of labor by states and through class action settlements mcnicholas mokhiber and chaikof 2017 did so and found 8803 million in 2015 and 11 billion in 2016 for a total of 2 billion over both years this estimate according to the researchers likely dramatically underrepresents the problem of wage theft since probably only a fraction of victims actually file government complaints or are involved in class action settlements  shierholz 2021 details the reasons for the prevalence of wage theft  one reason is workers diminished bargaining power relative to their employers the fact that this unlawful employer behavior is not being competed away underscores that for a variety of reasons workers do not have the ability to quit these jobs as a de facto form of enforcement  another reason is that government resources devoted to combating violations of workplace protections are insufficient and have diminished for instance at the federal level shierholz writes in 1978 there were 69000 workers per wage and hour investigator on average but today that ratio is 175000 to one the increased use of forced arbitration agreements as detailed in a later section has prevented workers from holding their employers accountable both in court and in the private arbitrations they are forced to use frequently without the ability to do so as a class as shierholz 2021 notes  to underscore the importance of classaction lawsuits in our enforcement framework in 2015 and 2016 the top 10 private wage and hour classaction settlements alone exceeded the combined total wages recovered by all state and federal enforcement agencies forced arbitration with class and collective action waivers make it virtually impossible for lowwage workers to get any meaningful type of remedy  last declining unionization enables more wage theft to go unchallenged in effect nearly every option workers have of holding employers accountable for stealing their wages has eroded in recent years there is less protection through government enforcement weaker access to legal recourse and far less union advocacy in workplaces  how much does wage theft affect wages in the middle and at the bottom we do not have an estimate of aggregate wage theft across the wage spectrum or for middlewage workers so it is not possible to assess the impact of wage theft on the median wage among lowwage workers bernhardt milkman and theodore 2009 found that 68 experience wage theft violations averaging 1495 of earnings this translates into an average loss across all lowwage workers of 10232 even this estimate omits certain types of wage theft and we do not know how representative the studys sample is of the national lowwage workforce nevertheless the bernhardt milkman and theodore study indicates that wage theft drains a substantial amount of lowwage workers earnings we also do not know the extent of wage thefts growth over the 19792017 period though researchers judge that there has been substantial growth a speculative estimate is that if wage theft has doubled to the 102 level implied by the bernhardt milkman and theodore study then it caused lowwage workers earnings to fall 5 over the 19792017 period due to weaker wage standards enforcement less access to legal recourse and eroded unionization for midlevel wages theft of overtime pay unpaid worktime and the undercutting of prevailing wages likely also had an adverse impact,nlyhen

532,"After being curious about the sub for a long time, I have finally become anti-work, due to an increasingly rediculous situation of gross negligence and nepotism at my job.",i 22m work as a care attendant at a home for mentally  disabled people there are a few homes in the area i work at taking shifts as needed one home is actually an apartment for a single man who was to violent and unpredictable to be left with other residents  there is one worker at this home that i have no idea how they still have a job multiple cases of violating patient rights reports of texting and driving calling in sick almost once a week and more being a care position this type of behavior just isnt acceptable and thats made clear when you are hired its actually against the law and in my mind should result in immediate termination see we are always short staffed so i assumed the lack of consiquences was due to a fear of the inability to fill the position its somewhat valid but also in my mind negligent to leave the resident in their care knowing their history just because filling the position is hard my company pays 13 an hour btw well below living wage here but no turns out my boss is their brother see if all of the reports of their conduct had actually turned into write ups they would have lost the three strikes youre out game long ago   so a few days ago a comcerned neighbor tells me the bad employee left out resident alone in the apartment on the balcony to go talk to their friends in the parking lot we are not allowed to leave them unsupervised they can be in a different room but we have to be in the same building nothing bad happened but that is a huge nono if something did happen it would be a huge deal this person would probably go to jail for negligence the program would go under investigation and could be shut down if it was found that i knew about a case of negligence and didnt report it i could very well be charged as well   i dont like causing trouble i am very much a person who wants everyone to like me so i go back and forth on reporting i mean nothing did happen i hate feeling like a narc eventually i tell myself its the right thing to do i email my boss saying this is the situation please talk to them about the rules my boss then emails me back saying he accidentally forwarded my email to the person i complained about   let me just say i do really like my boss i think they are an extremely good person and an extremely good manager i struggle to say they did this on purpose if it wasnt for the family relation it wouldnt even cross my mind my boss has expressed they are upset with their sibling over their actions multiple times to me i am rather certain there is nepotism but i just dont know how far it goes   so now this is the situation i am in i cant quit my job or move to another department i am going back to college in just a couple months and wont get hired elsewhere i need the money i could report my boss and the whole situation to hr but then all i get is everyone mad at me  almost all management are friends with eachother and me reporting my well liked boss would surely make everyone upset i am graduating college soon and need the good reference to start my career i was even going to use this boss as a letter of recommendation i am expected to just go back to work and act like nothing happened like there isnt something majorly wrong with a company who can continuously employ someone whos technically committed crimes under your employment by violating the patients rights  a lot of this stems from them only paying 13 an hour we cant hire anybody when every target walmart and mcdonalds pays 2 dollars an hour more turn over is constant it isnt an easy job so many people start and quit before they even finish all their training we hire anyone without a criminal record we cant fire the bad employees when they are all we have ive seen the finances and know we could be paying more rather easily someone is getting rich which is weird because we are mostly government sponsored furthermore this company would throw you under the bus at a moments notice accidents happen especially when you are one person taking care of four disabled people all with strict medication scheduals health conditions and behavioral issues you just arent going to do everything perfect this company would throw you to the wolves to save itself let you be criminally processed although they are the ones who dont hire enough skilled help   it disgusts me that someone is getting rich off of providing mediocre care to disabled people that abuse and negligence even though its minor is being swept under the rug and its so easy too we hire so many pot heads and deadbeats its like im the only one who can see whats happening they are happy doing the bare minimum and ignoring whats wrong they can sit on their phone all day and ignore the residents because everyone else is either just as lazy or youre the only person on staff   fuck the system that allows places like this to prosper all over the country,nkzd0w
533,It’s not the actual subject that I absolutely hate but work culture itself,after having worked in so many job roles from finance to tech to teaching i realized that its not the actual subjectindustry that i despise but everything other than it  im not stupid in fact i pick up things very fast if i have the motivation but every job has always killed that enthusiasm in me and i end up hating a subject i once loved i hate how our dumbass modern work culture is so obsessed with profit productivity and competition nothing is ever enough  i hate reporting to a boss and living in constant fear that my livelihood depended on their opinion of me and their interpretation of my performance   i hate dealing with sucky incompetent bosses with giant egos who never like to admit theyre wrong but have no problem criticizing me   i hate dealing with coworkers and being forced to engage in soul draining office politics   i hate the meetings where everyone in the room is debating endlessly and trying to shove their idea down peoples throats   i hate dealing with the pointless and suffocating company bureaucracy and values  i hate hustle culture and glorifying going above and beyond as a standard   i hate pretending that i loooove working for the company and their pointless mission   i hate that i cant truly be friends with my coworkers and everyones suspicious of each other because the nature of the workplace has naturally pitted us against each other from the start   i hate anything to do with performance reviews because its an opportunity for coworkers to talk shit about each other while padding their own accomplishments  i hate the bullshit job hunting and interview process wasting your precious time filling out over 200 applications with useless cover letters and only hearing back from less than 5 should not be normal   companies making you feel like you need them to survive doesnt feel right   the fact that society tells you there are only certain ways to have a good life get a high paying stem job and that your self worth is based on your job title is wrong   the fact that public education sets you up to be a good office drone by judging you purely on grades instead of your interests and potential pisses me off   i hate it when people say deal with it thats just the way life is   i want to be able to walk outside at 2pm and enjoy the sunshine during one of the nicest times of the day but i cant because im stuck at work   i want to be able to focus on my health and mental well being instead of constantly feeling stressed but i cant because im stuck at work   i want to be able to spend time with my loved ones during the day in the end it is then who will care about me those duds at work could care less if i got his by a bus and died theyd just hire someone to replace me   i wish i had time to spend on my hobbies and pursue what i really want to do without having the thought of being financially poor loom over me   i feel like im just wasting my prime years slaving away for someone else when i could be out meeting new friends and going on fun dates instead of catching up on sleep and chores on the weekend   im tired of feeling tired and depressed all the time because of work   i just want to feel free and enjoy the beautiful things in life,nkje7b

559,A work-free society also for low income countries?,hey everyone i am new here and hope i can post this question here i love all the images quotes and memes people post here as i have been intrigued with the thought of a workfree life for quite some time now i love reading about the success of four day work weeks and similar experiments as they are giving me hope that there is indeed change ahead even if its at a very slow pace i can realistically imagine that workfree living can become a reality in high income countries like the us and most of europe with the adoption of a universal basic income taxes on machines and so on but how would this work for low income countries for example most african countries how would they generate so much income when automation is not even close to the same level as in the west  ps just to clarify when i say workfree i dont mean no work at all i just mean that people no longer need to work to survive and have basic necessities because they get a basic income from the state this frees them up to pursue whatever it is they want to pursue and of course lots of people will still end up working but on different terms,nkgq03

561,Accessable self employment instead of UBI/benefits?,the work itself never pisses me off its the atmosphere the lack of control and being under the thumb of an apparent cabal of psychopaths all working in conjunction to torture the most humane of us   so what if their was a job you couldnt really get fired from you want a break you take a break you want a day off you take a day off never even have to ask anyone you just make that choice  its the freedom that western society champions along with the capitalist nature of earning your keep its very nature could never be compared to socialism or communism so even the hardest right would be stretched for a reason to fight against it   what if our governments had an endless supply of work that needed doing and instead of creating a nationalised industry or outsourcing to conglomerates they instead created the uber of this industry you just show up and get paid per work unit done self employment where the government is your customer accessible to all and job security for life  companies would lose their teeth no more fear culture no more bullying only incentives   i call this change the great redundancy of psychopaths because theyd lose their control over us   the only problem with self employment is the uncertainty a limitless supply of government work would rectify that youd be more comfortable financing things and taking loans you know you can repay   sure the lack of sick pay and pto sucks but thats why you save and take short term zero interest loans its the price for freedom  plus itd be funny to watch the likes of bezos to cry when an even tougher labour shortage is generated  not sure how this would work in america though in terms of health care youd probably have to put in some additional hours at your own pace without pressure and get private health insurance   anyway interested to hear your thoughts,nkau3i

568,Footballers and rich people,we shouldnt have to pay footballers to kick a ball it takes pretty much 0 skill to move a ball into a net its their hobby if their getting payed to do their hobby then i want payed to help people or to play games     part two rich people people who are born into rich familys should at least have to earn it think of all the kids who study hard and fail so they cant make a living then theres rich people who just have money and do what they want rich people should have to work too and footballers should have to have a proper job as well as football im new here so positive feedback please,nk7217
569,Is there an escape?,currently live in the us i have a college degree but im working at a company trying to build up hours to apply to grad school with experience   i work 40 hours a week but my schedule isnt set due to the nature of my work i finally got a set schedule and am working out the kinks of it i switched from 85 hour days to 105 hour days also so i would get more full days off nothing has made me less miserable yet i think working 105 hour days actually made me more miserable because i have even less time in the day and the three days off is only nice when i have them all stacked in a row however i spend all that time dreading the last day off and trying to recover from my long work week the job itself isnt bad it can be busy at times but my coworkers are great some days i literally just sit around and do almost nothing all day and sometimes i even leave significantly early enough while still getting paid i only make 16 an hour but the job is extremely temporary until i manage to get into grad school however i dread of resuming 40 hour weeks after grad school i dread of not having enough money to take care of my kids or take care of myself when i get older if i dont grind on a 40 hour work week now and waste my youth on working im also afraid that all this grinding wouldnt even pay off in the end read the end game by corey abramson im afraid of the alienation that comes with working 40 hours a week i barely see my old friends now and were drifting apart   is there any way out that doesnt involve exploiting other people is there any way i can just work 20 hours a week and not worry about the future i want community and i want time to experience the world and i want to be comfortable and healthy and have access to basic resources such as decent healthcare in my old age    my friends are convinced the only way we could make this happen is by going off grid in a community or exploiting others via becoming a landlord or dealing in stocks and crypto i could be fine with living off grid with friends and family but the other options arent ideal to me,nkyb1w

571,Do you ever take time to think about how capitalism forces people to ''augment'' their bodies beyond their natural limitations to excel in pointless jobs?,the title may be a little confusing so let me try and explain the topic here  recently i started thinking about how we as a society are dependent on various remedies to help us get through the physical and mental stress of our daily lives and how most of that physical and mental stress is caused by capitalist bullshit  ampx200b   are your feet hurting because you had to stand for 12 hours straight just get some inserts   are you slow at work because you cant get a good nights sleep due to constant work and the unaffordability of quality bedding products just get yourself an energy drink or use one of the many drugs that promise to give you energy  are you suffering from depression that is caused by your work get antidepressants   is your back hurting from the physical stress of work get a back brace  ampx200b  i find that most people seem to be ok with all of this these remedies or augmentations to the human body tend to be accepted as a good and natural part of life but to me they dont feel good or natural  to me human work ethic should be based around the personal limitations of every individual people should work according to their physical and mental health if you are in pain of any sort you should rest rather than push through it for the sake of the company  thoughts,nk7vit

619,on the misery of ambiguity and forced pretense,lilian whats it like to have a job like this demoralizing depressing i get most of the meaning in my life from my job and now my job has no meaning or purpose  it gives me anxiety because i think that at any moment someones actually going to realize that nothing would change if i were not here and they could save themselves the money  it also trashes my confidence if im not constantly being met by challenges that i am overcoming how do i know that im capable maybe all my ability to do good work has atrophied maybe i dont know anything useful i wanted to be able to handle bigger and more complex projects but now i handle nothing if i dont exercise those skills ill lose them  it also makes me afraid that other people in the office think that the problem is me that im choosing to slack off or im choosing to be useless when nothing about this is my choice and all my attempts to make myself more useful or give myself more work are met with rejection and not a small amount of derision for attempting to rock the boat and challenge my bosss authority  i have never been paid so much to do so little and i know im not earning it i know my coworkers with other job titles do significantly more work i might even get paid more than them how bullshit would that be id be lucky if they didnt hate me on that basis alone  bullshit jobs a theory chapter what is it like to have a bullshit job,nktvgw

629,I'm writing a book about my corporate experiences,the title says it all im writing a book about my experiences in corporate life and bullshit work of which i have been part for many years now im not going to post everything i have but id like to get some feedback and hopefully at least brighten your day  im actually not going for a snarky tone this is just an account of my experiences so im just writing about what happened and what was going through my mind ive had some people read these and they think theyre somewhat funny but im honestly not even going for funny   anyway here are drafts of two chapters not in chronological order i have about 7 chapters so far in various states of completeness and an outline for about two dozen chapters i dont think i will ever run out of material although for now ive got to keep it vague enough so that i cant be identified because obviously i dont want to lose my job    being a pro  next up was a real career move i got hired at a major professional services company i figured that maybe in this place theyll have me do all the buzzword stuff that i learned to do in college and which you hear a lot about in corporate fluff and jargon now it was time to apply complicated code and higher mathematics and anything you could dream of and id make a name for myself and reap the rewards  after all thats what i sold myself with in the job interview  what follows is a true account of my experience in a major professional services firm that charges ridiculous fees from clients in order to unlock all kinds of value  i was placed into a function that was to provide an it service for a client when i got in the system that was in place was such that a manager was taking requirements from a client but because that manager was a foreigner one of the countries where basically all it gets outsourced he couldnt read the requirements because the client was promised service in their native language even though all parties involved in this service on both ours and the client side spoke english  so since the requirements were delivered in a language he didnt understand he had to forward the requirements to a translation service that was located in yet another country this translation service had no technical knowledge so obviously all technical terms werent translated very well add to that the translated document was incredibly messy and basically every word in the original language was followed by an english translation of that word in a different font color  few people can say theyve read a document where every other word is in english and every other word is in another language ive read these and was paid to read them  so this manager got his translated document and sent it to a team of  software developers in his native country who obviously had no clue what they were supposed to do because these requirements were not only in a messy document they were translated in a confusing manner the  developers couldnt get to work because first they had to come up with an estimate of how long itll take to do the job often this process took longer than the actual job and was also included in the estimate so even if the client didnt approve of the work estimate the client  was charged for just being provided with the estimate  the client was obviously unhappy with this situation and the professional services companys management was tired of the complaints so they made the only decision they could come up with   this was obviously a resource issue and the solution to resource issues is to allocate more resources to it  so they threw me at the problem now you might think as i did that since i could do some programming and spoke both english and the clients preferred language and since i had previous experience from dealing with requirements that it would only make sense we just have me take the  requirements do the necessary coding and thatd be it no need to throw all these people at the problem  if youd think that youd be wrong the client wanted to interface with someone who could speak the language but everything else had to be in english because the developers and their manager only spoke english  so instead of the client sending the requirements document in english they continued to send it in their language now you might think that since i had the necessary technical expertise i could then translate the  document  again youd be wrong my job was to forward this document to the translation service when i asked why i couldnt just translate the document myself i was told im too busy  now because my job was obviously not managerial in nature and the developers had their own manager i obviously needed a manager of my own so the setup was 7 people allocated to this process that i could have done on my own in a fraction of the time and frustration that everyone was subjected to two of those seven people were managers 4 were  software developers and then there was me who again could do the entire thing on my own if i were allowed to  now this overly complicated process was allowed to continue and the managers wound up only making powerpoint presentations about whos fault  it is that everything is a mess they never blamed me i mean they were good managers in that sense but i found it really strange anyway   so the managers spent all day every day writing up powerpoint slides of recorded phone call transcripts to shift the blame from us to the client   premium customer service right there   its also sort of funny that typing up phone call transcripts into a powerpoint with the singular purpose of blaming the client for everything that went wrong was also work that was charged to the client  i also need to point out that the service we were providing was incredibly mundane in nature it wasnt critical at all and often served no real purpose the most interesting tasks that came up in it were  deemed too complex meaning the work estimates were insane and so the client  declined to have them done citing that its too expensive  i couldnt help but agree  i still had no idea what my job really was i didnt really do anything  besides forward emails i even stopped answering calls at one point and asked everyone to submit their requests in writing for auditability i often disappeared for days because i went out to party and binge drink no one noticed my absence  i didnt stick around for too long because this wasnt a healthy place  for me every time i had a suggestion about how stupid the whole setup is i was told i was too busy to think about things like that and that i should get back to work whatever that was supposed to be  ampx200b    foot in the door  when i was about 18 or 19 and wasnt enrolled in college yet i was forced to go looking for a job i remember walking into an interview at a temp agency since i was what people would call unskilled  i figured the interview would just be a formality but it really wasnt apparently getting a job at a warehouse lifting boxes would really require a thorough vetting of my interests and career aspirations   so i walk into the temp agency office and i was greeted by two twentysomething pantsuitwearing hr aces and asked to step into a tiny room i hadnt really been in a job interview before nor was i prepared for one now so obviously i had no idea what to expect so i sat down in an armchair that was so deep my feet almost dangled in the air but i maintained my composure in what seemed at the time like a highly skewed power dynamic   ampx200b  what is your name  sir galahad  what is your favourite color  blue no wait  ampx200b  after apparently making sure i was indeed a teenager looking for a job at a warehouse a position they themselves had posted online they started asking me questions that to this day seem rather odd   ampx200b  gtwhy do you want to work at this warehouse were staffing for   because i need the job well that was my first reaction but i thought that that would be too crass these people are smart and they probably want to hear a smart answer  well im looking for an opportunity to apply myself i think i would be a perfect match for this warehouse  i nailed it that must have been what they were looking for although i really felt like an idiot all i need is a job to keep me occupied for the next couple of months and then i can go to college they had to have known this so why were we pretending this was anything else   ampx200b  gtwhere do you see yourself in 5 years  my world stopped for a minute instant as a part of my soul died   well probably at that fucking warehouse then  ampx200b  i didnt land the job   ampx200b  luckily temp agencies are a dime a dozen so eventually i found one that staffed people to all kinds of call centers and office mailrooms and front desks thats what i did for a while answered phones and sat at the front desk of various offices it wasnt very hard but apparently a lot of these companies thought i did a good job of it although i have no idea how you could measure performance in relation to someone else in a job like that  now these were oddjobs for the most part but eventually i got a step up to do data entry which was a 30 salary bump compared to the mailroom and i felt like id won the fucking lottery  data entry was just that i was handed a piece of paper with product codes and names on it and my job was to type them on a computer thats it its not hard to get it right once you develop some muscle memory on the numpad so i was really good at it   so one time i was handed a piece of paper that would get printed out as a bill of lading or something like that the problem with this was that the data to be entered was too long to fit into the fields the software could handle so i had to truncate or abbreviate the data i was told not to that it wasnt allowed but obviously how else could it possibly be done   so i did it anyway and it didnt matter one bit   now while working in data entry of which i was very proud since none of my friends had a cushy office job i would often run out of things to do so naturally i found my boss and asked her if they had something for me to do because i was done with my work sometimes she had an incredulous look on her face could it be possible its done that fast so naturally i was asked to redo the work since i must have made a mistake if it was over so soon i redid everything and about 20 minutes later i found my boss again and said ive now done this mundane task twice but since theyd hired me for the day i was told i could ask around the office if anyone else had something for me to do   i was very proud of course to be so efficient that now i could learn about other things that go on in the office but it was very rare that anyone ever had anything for me and my asking around was considered something of a nuisance since i would interrupt them while they were doing all kinds of important things  as much as it sounds like a caricature at this point i was once asked to do some filing yes there is always filing to do even if everything is already filed  you can always redo the filing so i did and when that was done i had absolutely nothing to do sometimes i would redo some data entry i had already done because otherwise id just have to wait out the clock i had indeed sold my time so they can do with me what they like even if it is just sit around and wait to go home   so this job was about 30 bullshit now that i write this i see why it paid 30 better than what i had previously made   perhaps i might be onto something,nlcy7v

632,Surprised by what I found in this sub,i guess i didnt dig deep enough through the archives but from the bio i was expecting some kind of revolutionary insight into escaping the rate race instead all i see are memes most of them i like and just constant streams of people bitching about their jobs even before they have started them in some cases  that is probably to be expected given the name of the sub but i feel like i was made to expect some positivity and guiding light ive watched a couple of the videos from the links supplied and enjoyed them but the sub itself is not so inspiring or revolutionary   i agree that big business is corrupt and workers should be paid more and have better conditions and everything else that the rest of the people here want but im prepared to put my mind to trying to make things better for myself rather than just complaining and expecting everything to fix itself   im a proponent of fire and believe wholeheartedly in the principles of gaining your independence from employment and being the master of your own destiny now theres more ways to skin that cat than just fire and thats what i had hoped to learn here   downvote me and throw insults if it makes you feel better but unfortunately the only person who is gonna be able to make a difference is you its probably not gonna matter who you vote for or how much you protest get yourself and some likeminded comrades together and put your heads together to make it better rather than suffer in isolation,nkws3g

649,Bereavement leave,anyone else find the state of bereavement leave at least as it is in this country us borderline inhumane  my current workplace seems to be the most considerate and lenient ive ever seen it allows 5 days off for the death of a spouse registered domestic partner civil union relationship child parent sibling or comparable steprelation 3 days for grandparent fatherinlaw motherinlaw soninlaw or daughterinlaw and 1 day for a relative who is not a member of your immediate family but it still seems so insufficient my aunt just passed away she was my moms only sibling and it was relatively unexpected so my mom needs major support at the moment and i could honestly use as muchmore time off than i needed for any of my grandparents deaths   just got me thinking about how you cant reduce grief or responsibilities to a formulated numbers of days what if someones best friend dies godchild mentor what if they dont have much family the more i think about it the sicker it seems,nk0dtu

662,I never thought merchandising would be easy but I didn't think it was this hard either....,i started merchandising for pepsi back in december andit was ok for the most part i was part time up until about march i believe then i got full time honestly i just dont want to be a merchandiser anymoreit sucks  i genuinely didnt mind the physical aspect of it but when youre busting your ass just to keep yourself on time for the next store day by day week by week it starts taking a toll on you i thought itd be nice way to keep active ive suffered from being overweight my whole life and thats caused severe depression and anxiety in me and i feel like this job is just making it worse  every store ive worked ive seen coke 7up and frito lay with multiple people servicing the 2 big stores in our schedules walmart and krogers ive also seen multiple merchandisers for said companies servicing smaller easier stores but for some reason at pepsi were on our own and when i was in training i was taught to not be the guy asking for help all the time as if having help is some for of taboo and yet as a part time i was bouncing around various stores and would occasionally help out a full timer maybe once a week and the stores would look nicer and be done quicker because of it i just dont understand why we cant have at least 2 people per route  ampx200b  my start time is 530 i had a walmart first and the load didnt get there until 830 i asked for help to keep myself on schedule and there was literally nobody available to help until 100 pm at best so i busted out 7 pallets by 1200 pm essentially sprinting and burning myself out before my other stores and even by then i still had several carts of front coolersingle serve items that couldve gone out but i ended up doing the bare minimum and leaving because i needed to get to my next store to work the load and not that it was his fault because he had his own loads to deal with but my help didnt really get there until 230 when i was almost done with the 2nd store and from then on we did the last 2 together which went quickly because we were together but i didnt get home until 430 that day and thats slowly becoming a normal thing now   meanwhile on my days off when i make time to get groceries ill see multiple sales reps across the stores working it all together i just hate this no help attitude for the merchandisers you can work 712 pallets on your own and leave one case or forget one little shelf space or one little cooler and the sales reps will make you feel like the worst person because of it  i dont think i can handle it anymore the pay and the benefits dont even feel worth it because of this stress im feeling but what else am i going to do i kind of trapped myself thinking this would be a simple enough job to just stock shelves but theres just a crap ton of obstacles that will get in your way in the process and its not an enjoyable experience ive spent my whole life trying to figure out what i want to do with the rest of it but i genuinely dont know,nj7nii
663,What pushed you into an antiwork stance?,my story of how my mindset changed is kinda long like most of us i was conditioned from q young age into thinking i wanted a dream career and all that when i was in college i started to have my doubts after watching friends graduate with good degrees and still work minimum wage jobs while swallowed by debt but i didnt fully switch until i experienced the worse year and a half of my life   i had 3 family members pass all within a year and a half of eachother the first in december of 2018 i never got to say goodbye i saw her after the fact and i was just devastated as i held her cold hand it struck me then that i had missed out on my only opportunity to say goodbyebecause id been at work for a job that didnt care about me   i told them i would need her funeral off they told me i would work when they needed me and they couldnt give me the day off and i told them i quit i wasnt going to let them take this from me also i ended up having a breakdown a month after this and dropped out of my second year of college and moved home with my parents  i didnt even really have time to recover before the next death occurred in december 2019 by then i had another minimum wage job i called out the day it happened and instead of being told oh im sorry of course take this time i was told are you sure you cant come in if the person has already passed what good will you do for them now i was in shock and ignored this as it seemed like the least of my problems at the time as my world crashed down around me for the second time in one year   the third death occurred in april of 2020 i called work sobbing telling them i couldnt come in as i was on my way to the hospital to say goodbye i received major attitude on the other line and was actually hung up on   i received the worst treatment of my life while i was at my most vulnerable from these managers it rocked my worldview and other than the shit wages totally pushed me into being antiwork the shit treatment unsafe conditions and poor pay of working on the front lines during the thick of the covid outbreak only set my stance in stone   so if youve made it this far thank you and i would love to hear your own stories of what pushed you into the antiwork mindset as well,nja0di

674,What's the plan?,i like many other subredditors am tired of the incessant tyrannical expectations put upon the modern worker i could go on for days about the injustices i experience in my place of employment i want to democratize the workplace i want technology to absorb the bulk of our efforts i want to feel valued as a human being instead of being valued for what i can contribute to a corporation  that said i feel stuck and overwhelmed over what the antiwork communitys next move should be i sympathize with almost every post here but i see far more griping than i see action plans i dont have a plan myself but im desperate to come across some insight that might propel our sentiments into actual change  does anybody have or belong to a group or network that could be useful to someone who wants to actively participate in the destruction of todays wage slavery i need to actually do something about these injustices i work in the southeastern us where unions are practically unheard of and adamantly ridiculed when they are discussed ive had the same job for more than five years no pay increase no sick days never got more than 80 hours vacation per year no air conditioning despite the 100 degree high humidity summers i could bash my employer and the entire job market for days but i need something more tangible to lean on  what is someone like myself to do in this situation are there any groups that youre aware of that are seeking to bring about real change in the workplace who might i get in touch with to get the ball rolling i have thought about starting a union at my current place of employment but i worry about the repercussions that coupled with the fact that nobody around here even knows the first thing about what a union is are highly deincentivising prospects any feedback would be appreciated i dont understand how the situation got to be this bad and im shocked at those around me who have been indoctrinated into thinking this is normal,njpysh

701,I’m a Health Care Worker who burned out during the pandemic.,im not sure where else to post this essay and im not even sure why im posting it i guess rantiwork seems like the kind of place where my frustration and disillusionment will be understood and if it doesnt resonate with you thats okay it still feels good to get it off my chest              im a support worker and i worked for a wellknown organization that helps people with a range of disabilities i loved my job i made strong connections with the people i supported got along wonderfully with my coworkers and felt respected and valued by my supervisor it was the first job i had that didnt feel like work i never had to drag myself to the office or motivate myself like in some other jobs the deep sense of meaning i derived from supporting people helped fuel me through the pandemic for more than a year while many others were at home  understandably avoiding the virus and doing their part to minimize the spread  my coworkers and i were sweating through our masks and gambling with our health for the greater good of the residents we often grew to love we left our homes and entered a community that harboured an invisible virus and many of us did it for less than 600 a week        but as much as we deserved better pay it was never about the money i was driven by the people who appreciated me and the powerful connections made by stepping into the lives of people in true need but nothing can polish the fact that the life of a psw is haunted by part time and casual positions fulltime hours are rare and coveted roles often going to those who have seniority companies and organizations keep costs low by creating only a small handful of 40 hour work weeks and the rest are forced to work two jobs or scramble to snatch any crumbs that might fall off the table when someone calls in sick it sometimes felt demeaning  i cant deny it you can work for years and still only be handed 25  30 hours a week and the pay nothing to write home about the job involves monitoring the health of vulnerable people with sometimes complex medical conditions and can require quick thinking and sound judgement to save the life of someone in medical crisis and yet i was paid only 18 an hour to sometimes be the only guardian of more than 10 soulssome in wheelchairs some unable to see or easily communicate their needs 18 to be willing and able to respond to what can sometimes seem like a galaxy of demands 18 to potentially save a life but i did it we did it everyday thousands of psws just like us are making similar sacrifices and are being rewarded with crummy pay and barely enough hours to survive im a 41 year old man and my dad helps me with rent because the organization i work for doesnt provide a living wage and i still showed up until eventually the grind and sacrifice the poor wages and measly hours they began to pollute my appreciation for the job they tainted my desire to come to work each morning the notion that i was making these sacrifices for an organization that wouldnt give me livable pay and hours began to erode my sense of belonging and soon my motivation suffered too the job no longer enticed me in a way that made a day that starts at 5am tolerable i needed more sleep cared less about myself and my life in general and felt like i was sleepwalking through my days off because i was too preoccupied with the next strenuous shift to really enjoy my free time        and throughout this questionable journey i was continuously receiving tonedeaf emails from head office reminding me of the importance of selfcare i was told to sleep well exercise and meditate to help offset the horrible pay and part time hours i was being handed by the authors of these emails they had the nerve to preach the prudence of mindfulness and sleephygiene to the same people whose mental health their policies and treatment were actively destroying the irony sometimes sickened me it all became too much one day and after a particularly nasty and abusive experience at the hands of a new resident i called my supervisor and calmly told her that she needed to come in and cover for me because i was done i had enough being kind and thoughtful she discouraged me from officially quitting and asked me to take some time off to catch my breath i agreed and went home to lick my wounds after a few days of rest i felt more focused stronger ready to possibly come back to work in a diminished role  ideally with less hours so i could ease myself back into work and emerge successfully from my burnout front office even reached out to me requesting that i detail the incident in writing and explain why i left the way i did this person also expressed concern for my mental wellbeing which was the first time anyone had personally addressed the importance of my state of mind i was hopeful for a moment i felt protected and valued by my employer but that didnt last        after writing an email explaining what happened and why i left after being verbally abused i received a call from someone at hr who explained she wanted to hear my side of things i talked at length about the stress the low pay the bad hours and how being bullied by a resident just added more weight to a structure that was already overloaded she feigned sympathy she thanked me for my honesty and promised to call me the next day to discuss my possible and gradual return to work the next day my phone never rang by 530 that night my instinct told me the call was never coming so i checked my email and there it was they informed me i was no longer welcome at the office and that they wished me good luck in my future after all their song and dance about the importance of mental health all the patronizing seminars and workshops they encouraged me to participate in after all my sacrifice despite poor pay and rotten hours they just tossed me aside when i finally burned out and they werent even decent enough to do it over the phone i had to read it in email        i learned a painful and bitter lesson that when push comes to shove they dont care about me since then ive strongly considered leaving the field and finding a job with more pay and less sacrifice i want to find an employer who proves they value me through real action and reward instead of coaching me with hallow emails that lie about how concerned and focused they are on the wellbeing of their staff i havent decided yet if ill leave my career behind but if i do it will be a bitter breakup  i will always feel the loss of the connection to those that support work bonded me to careworkers deserve real pay full time hours and the true respect and support of head office anything less forces even the best workers to seek better employment elsewhere simple as that and you know what really annoys me a month after being let go im still getting those same tonedeaf emailstelling me to eat right and go to bed at the same time every night,njxspi
702,Here's my antiwork plan,i agree with the antiwork movement i hate working too but we still have bills to pay  so ive been trying to get my bills lower so i dont have to work as much all my bills right now are about 900 us that includes a 336 dollar mortgage payment and a 262 dollar car payment i live in rural nc after 5 years my car will be paid off and my bills will drop to about 600 after the house is paid off itll drop to less than 300 some of that 300 is food water and electricityall things i can reduce i thought about growing my own food and selling what i cant eat collecting rainwater for bathing and drinking getting solar panels etc my electric bill last month was 37 dollars so i wouldnt need a big system  if i can grow enough food i might be able to sell the surplus and make enough to cover my expenses or save up enough where i can make most of that in interest then i could give the idea of having to work the middle finger in the worse case id have to work but getting 300 a month would be pretty damn easy if 15hr becomes the law i could work anywhere and make enough to cover my monthly bills every 25 days theres 260 business days in a year so after just 1 year id have 104 months 866 years worth of savings not including taxes i cant wait,nj7wbk

721,Why employers don't care about loyalty anymore.,company loyalty is a relic from the dinosaur age when people would spend 40 years working at the same factory and retire with a full pension today what businesses use is the mcdonalds model of staff turnover   they will take a new recruit and give them on the job training after a few weeks the new hire will be basically fully trained the total cost of training a new hire is therefore equivalent to maybe 24 weeks of entry level pay so lets just say the cost of training a new hire is 2000 as an example   the cost of a long term employee receiving a yearly 3 raise must be calculated after only 23 years it will cost the company more to retain loyal workers than to train entry level staff due to compounding interest also the loyal employee will receive more entitlements like vacation pay sick leave etc  therefore its a simple mathematical equation as to why companies dont want loyalty anymore  x  the base entry level wage y  the cost of training z  years of employment   the value of yx times 103z is greater than the value of xy after z amount of years   it is therefore cheaper to have high staff turnover than to retain long term employees,njmf74

873,"The Small Agency I work for was sold after 2.5 year, now the new owner says I’m a new hire and don’t have banked PTO",hey all   not entirely sure this is allowed so delete if necessary but i kinda need somewhere to rant about some goings on in my life so please allow me to word vomit here   for context i am an insurance agent for a company you all would recognize but for obvious reasons i wont mention by name since september 2018 ive been with a small agency for a while i loved it but the last year has burnt me out at our largest in my time here there were 3 regular agents and the agency owner who didnt do much in line of sales but was obviously back up before covid we lost one agent to being a stay at home parent since covid hit ive more or less been the only agent we would take turns having one person in the office but because i lived much closer to the agency than the owner and other agent i was usually the one here then in september 2020 the agency owner found out that due to an incident that occurred with an agent prior to me starting his license with the parent company was being nonrenewed and he would be no longer allowed to represent the company from that point forward and would need to sell the agency that left myself and one other agent as the sole team here then in early november that agent tested positive for covid and it wrecked them and they started missing even more time than their already super part time schedule had them not in the office leaving just me literally 98 of the time from november through now   as a result of the parent companys requirement that the agency be open like normal and me being essentially the only person at the agency still able to work i wasnt allowed to take my pto im already someone who doesnt take a ton of time off to a fault so it wasnt a huge deal but it all has been really taking a mental toll on me and put me in a pretty dark place mentally during all this ive also been taking online courses for codingsoftware development to hopefully change careers soon and even had to take a leave of absence from that because of how bad things got mentally that class is finally coming to an end but i dont feel particularly prepared for the job search   anyway i was talking to my partner last night about how burnt out mentally i feel and they encouraged me to take some pto now that the agency has been sold and starting in june there will be other agents i put in a request for that starting with 3 hours in the afternoon about 2 weeks from now for a doctors appointment regarding my mental health and was denied because im a new hire and apparently i forfeited all my accrued pto when the agency was sold so i wont get pto for 90 days and even then its 2 hours per pay period and nothing significant until my 1 year anniversary apparently now in may i understand its technically a different agency with the new owners but i was told that it would all be the same   im honestly at my breaking point and have no idea what to do now im not really looking for answers i guess but just need to vent and someone to tell me if im being crazy for being angry and near tears over it or if its even a little justified   thanks for allowing me to get this all out whether you read or not and i hope all is well for the rest of you all   also we dont have an hr department because were so small so the only persons in the office are myself the owner and the office manager out of location as she works at one of the other agencies the new owner owns and is the one that said they see me as a new hire,nh38xd

Atlease for a little while.,the secret of escaping the cycle of shit jobs endless hours and depression  its not college  its acquiring a skill that you can create and sell something of value to a niche audience does not have to be a large audience either  or having the knowhow to find the skill in someone else and market it or sell something say made in a factory and brand it  can be as simple as a cup 150300 sales a month with a smaller investment or crowdfunding  next skill is minimalism cut out all the spending turn your product into your hobby or aquire a hobby that doesnt need excessive spending for me its music i can play my tin whistle my erhu for hours and not spend a dime hiking at parks unplug everything not in use plan out meals dont waste in branded junk food i was able to cut back all my spending to 900 a month now my income is greater  last skill is disconnecting and knowing cut off the social media learn about how marketing and systems work to manipulate you into buying stuff once you know the triggers you then can spot them and ignore right in their tracks sub to reddits and youtube channels that aim to empower you again ignoring the pages trying to sell you shit  this might now work if you have excessive health bills and issues but its how i managed and it changed how i look at working as to what inspired me  i remember the one thing that inspired a feeling of happiness in me and i try to reverse engineer it and for me it was the shire from tlotr simple life disconnected from it all,ngnes3
1120,Just got laid off with no ulterior motive,joined this subreddit a couple of days ago because it resonated with me deeply  worked in quality control with some accounting functions in a rather large industrial complex thats also a slaughterhouse yes someone has to do it  i am was the usual sucker getting there before my usual hour and i took nearly an hour just getting there by car working well with others smiling showing restraint and overall trying to excel in everything i do because i was scared of ending up with no disposable income i had to work with a nasty person sadly this engineer  a colleague of mine told me  she was quite a piece of work and she nitpicked everything i do to an extreme i consider unhealthy he was there for 7 days and 2 hours before they kicked him to the curb  i just got laid off  this very afternoon like a pair of dirty laundry with no significant reason other than we were looking for another profile for this position despite my protests that it was no sound excuse and she just shrugged it aside point being that this other person in management had zero idea what i had been doing since she never set foot in the industrial complex and just had hearsay of her own brother hooray for nepotism and  the engineer  person who supposedly told the management my performance and who gave me training for these past 20 days i was in a trial period and contract specifies they can dump me with no solid reason in this spam of time i feel nauseated after all of this relieved but nauseated i dont know how people can treat others like absolute shit sorry for the rant i feel tired in several levels,ngcu2s

1129,Left my previous job because the pay was insulting. Just got a mass email sent to previous employees saying they're offering more money,im probably less anti work than most here but i do have days id rather eat a bullet than face my grind    so some back story if youre interested    i was a buyer working supply chain for several years  i liked the job and was good at the tactical aspects  but im dyslexic so i made some costly mistakes which lead to toxic work environment  you know  crying in the bathroom kind of thing    so i needed to make a change  got my cdl and started driving a truck  your first year driving is brutal  theres no way around that and youre gonna make about 40k  enough to pay bills but its really hard  i made just under 42k pretty typical    after your first year is up  youve got options  originally was gonna stick with my starter company but my 1 year review only came with a 2000 raise  an insulting amount  so after i found a new job took about 7 weeks  i was being very selective i have my 2 weeks notice    my boss said she was surprised as she could generally tell when people were getting ready to quit  i told her tactfully  she shouldnt be surprised when people quit  because theyre offering pay thats not just below industry standard  but downright insulting    she asked what my new gig paid  i think she was going to make a counter offer  i told her is more than twice what i was making she just said wow  thats really good   that was 3 months ago  i just got the email sent to former employees saying theyre paying more  it was a video message from the company president  i gotta think im not the only one who said fuck you although i was probably the most tactful  truck drivers arent known for eloquence    so yea not being able to keep employees isnt limited to fast food    oh and my current gig is pretty ok they actually give a shit about me,nfb1sj

1136,Why land and house packages are getting smaller and smaller...,hi reddit  im from australia and have been observing that over the years house and especially land sizes has dramatically been getting smaller and smaller   take for example a typical house back in the 60s was 700m2 squared  20mtrs x 35mtrs you could fit a decent house and have a big back yard over time the land sizes become even smaller    650m2 excellent back yard    600m2 nice back yard    550m2 good back yard    500m2 okay back yard    450m2 mediocre back yard    400m2 small strip yard    350m2 no back yard    300m2 nothing only back fence 1 or 2 mtr away    250m2 boxed in with neighbours fence    200m2 concrete to concrete    150m2 which is now the smallest   now its nearly impossible to find anything thats 650m2 without having to pay for both kidneys most houses now are only 350m2 as the standard   the issue is if you have a big back yard thats 650m2 you can ritually grow a garden full of veggies and at least 10 fruit trees which will last you a life time have a few chooks and you will constantly get eggs every week meaning that each season you will always have a replenishment of fruit and vegetables all for free you simply only need the seed and mother nature will do its work for you   but if you limit societies land size technically you cant grow your own fruits and veggies or raise chooks the only way to obtain them is to buy it from the shops which are full of pesticides and all sorts of poison which means you have to pay extra money for food which you could of grown yourself in your back yard for free  what if land size was never restricted but every one had big land sizes to grow their own fruits and veggies  what would happen then ,ng3xf1
1137,"If a few of my coworkers and I share the same or similar salaries, that doesn't mean I can pick up their workload on a whim just because we're short staffed",my official title is office clerk its very bland and doesnt mean much on its own but i do a lot of data entry accounting and copywriting i was initially supposed to just be a data entry clerk but you know how things go my work has doubled since and i do a lot more than that i love it even though im underpaid and yes ive tried to negociate it and they respectfully told me i should starve instead it has its perks we have another office clerk but her work is completely separate she handles a different part of accounting and deals with the main database in a different way sorry for being vague but i think it paints the picture well were also supposed to have a receptionist but she quit about a month ago and hasnt been replaced since   the three of us are paid pretty much the same for the job that we do but the work itself is not the same at all the problem is that the second office clerk was hired very recently and i was expected to take on the workload before she could be fully trained i said i would help her if needed but i maintained that i wasnt going to do the work myself it took a bit of back and forth but they finally asked someone else to do it and that person begrudgingly agreed ive always made it very clear that im not a receptionist and im also not a standin they still expected me to fill in the position of a receptionist temporarily while they looked for a new recruit   a lot of employers seem to use the excuse that employees are interchangeable and disposable when theyre paid the same we see it all the time pretty much every workplace is short staffed but thats okay because their skills are the same so they can easily pick up someone elses workload if the position suddenly becomes vacant they wont bother hiring someone else if these changes arent noticeable   no theyll wait until everyone is so incredibly overworked and exhausted that they quit and theyll ignore their complaints in the meantime we all have the same value in their eyes they only see what we were hired to do on paper and compare that with someone elses job description it means that we can do the work of three people at once because were qualified enough even though it makes no fucking sense   hire more people for fucks sake,ng5w3a

1141,Amazon...,so i have a long history of job hunting and i have easily applied to hundreds of jobs in my field  my spouse who had just gotten an education in the same field had her first interview   this was a supposedly large company that claimed they were always hiring and that all skill levels should apply she told me about the interview and it turned out they were superpicky only people with so many years military experience coding css css for military work seriously   she went on for thirty minutes about their hiring requirements it was mentioned there were only two openings but she should still apply more anyway even though they wouldnt consider her and it sounded like some supersmall company that has zero clue what theyre doing and only has a niche crowd they work for they talked about how you could get as many hours as you want it was salaried so not that itd pay more   further it was a group interview generally only done when companies dont have anywhere near the personnel to interview anyone properly and it was being done to a group of recent graduates with zero experience and he started going on about how much experience they needed even further one person in the group interview mentioned if you only hire exmilitary doesnt that mean your diversity numbers are bad   the interviewer started blustering no we have a robust diversity policy in our contract he refused to answer anything about their diversity numbers after that when asked about advancement opportunities he talked about the possibility of getting moved up in as soon as ten years thats really bad both for big and small companies these were all traits that screamed a small niche company with a tight budget and having to watch every penny of income  so curious what this amateurish startup would be i asked what this company was  it was amazon,nfock8

Always.,sorry its not a meme ive just been really feeling this more than usual lately and figured i could vent here with people who might be able to relate  i am now 30 years old by all accounts im a very successful person i have a graduate degree a wellpaying job a beautiful wife and a kid on the way its really hard for me to justify complaining about anything but im going to  im so fucking tired always i have had a job in some capacity since i was 16 years old waiting tables washing dishes scooping fucking ice cream stupid mindless clerical work in some musty basement wiping sweat off of gym equipment and now high stress complex white collar professional bullshit that is every bit as exhausting and unfulfilling as all of that other stuff   i spent afternoons weekends and holidays in high school and college sweating into an apron so some karen could get her sandwich i sat at tables in windowless rooms in grad school studying and listening to lectures only to head off to another windowless room after class let out to bang away at a keyboard for 10 an hour   in my professional life i have spent countless nights taking quick naps on the floor in my office to meet last minute deadlines ive missed out on events with friends and milestones with family and for what  im not rich if hard work made you rich my father would be a billionaire by now but nobody here is fooled by that folk wisdom anymore  i did what my parents told me i worked hard did well in school signed the loan papers and kept plugging along until i made it but where exactly have i made it to to a place where i have to continue slaving away to pay down the debt i took on for the privilege of slaving away in a suit instead of nonslip dockers   i dont spend frivolously my car is 10 years old the last item of clothing i bought for myself was a pair of running shoes so that i can take an hour a day to do the one thing that brings me some peace without destroying my knees we cook all our meals at home and make our own coffee and i dont buy the newest phone every year so where does all my money go  loans insurance exorbitant rent groceries utilities gas one bottle of whiskey a week because holy shit can i just have one tiny thing that isnt good for me but brings me a tiny scrap of enjoyment  plus all that only takes into account the hours of my life that have bled away sitting at my desk the work doesnt end there the dishes and laundry need doing the lawn needs mowing the bathroom sink is clogged the cars need washing and an oil change and probably brake pads my wife needs attention and affection and my child will need even more to top it all off im  unfortunately  a human being that needs to sleep every once in a while so i dont die   thats how i spend my free time the time im not chained to a desk working to earn enough money so that im allowed to continue existing i spend that time doing work that i cant do while im at work   im not looking for advice or solutions ive analyzed all this to death and i know that the only way out is through ive had much darker moments in my life and like those this too shall pass theres just nobody in the world that im allowed to complain to because ive got it so good so i figured i would dump my frustrations on you folks in hopes that youre kind enough to listen if youve made it this far thanks for reading,nffmf4
1148,"Not just anti-work, but anti-money",i think we should globally do away with money currency credit or any other form of payment im no expert but i feel like one of the biggest holdups on advancing technology is the prohibitive cost of rampd i think if we all gave up money we could pretty quickly and easily achieve automation for all the lousy jobs that no one wants to do anyway as well as most if not all manufacturing transportation and production if theres no money nothing has a cost so if you need it you can get it no strings attached i think there are enough people who do things for the passion of it rather than the paycheck that entertainment and recreation industries could continue albeit in an altered form depending how good the robotics are we might not need human doctors if everything is free theres no reason to steal so crime will go down put some system in place to prevent people from establishing a means of wealth by hoarding supplies and exploiting people to hand it out i know i havent thought of every contingency and some would dismiss my idea as utopian fantasy but i think the only real hurdle is the currently powerful wealthy who would lose what makes them special and so would do everything in their power to keep it from happening,nfiwur

1152,"Y'all, my workplace is going to get someone's pet killed and I cannot fucking deal with it anymore...",over a month ago i sent the office an update for a clients file regarding a new medication regimen for one of their pets including pictures of the medication and detailed stepbystep instructions for administration last week the client called the office to ensure that this information had been added to the file and that they were aware of the service needing to be scheduled  cut to saturday morning this past weekend client was out of town on vacation and since we do not offer overnight services the client contracted another sitter to perform those services including feeding the dogs medicating one dog and feeding the cats the overnight sitter was unable to do the cats medication so the company im currently at was contracted to do only that   cue me getting a bajillion text messages on my day off from both the office and a freaked out client because the person that my company sent over decided to walk the dogs again and give them breakfast and some other stuff they didnt need to do the sitter also failed to do the one thing they were contracted to do apparently do not feed the dogs or cats only give cats name medication were not clear instructions so we have two dogs that have received a second breakfast not ideal but not deadly one dog that has been overdosed on medicine very big deal and a cat that has not received any medication at all also a very big deal to make things even worse the detailed stepbystep instructions that i provided over a month ago were not copied over to the clients file and instead the file consisted of a bunch of randomly jumbled up instructions which were complete gibberish and which absolutely no one could follow   thus i had to go to the clients home and administer this cats medicine very intricate medication that has to be administered via syringes and super fucking difficult to do with a busted stitched up hand hence the reason i didnt accept the gig in the first place then stay for an observation period to make sure the dog seemed okay then come back later for another observation period to make sure the dog wasnt dead   im not mad about losing a day off though i am a little pissed that i had to make use of my busted hand which is desperately trying to heal i am fucking furious that one of my favorite pups could have been killed that is a level of negligence that i will not abide so fuck this place im out just had an interview today should know by next monday if the job is mine,nflm7t

1158,Renting should be illegal,housing shouldnt be seen as an investment it is a simple necessity to live we shouldnt have to live in a society where people who wasted their lives and put all of their money into a building for the sole purpose of renting to another person why is the housing market going through the roof because housing is not see as a simple utility like an electric bill its seen as an investment which means all of the people before you were born are seen as geniuses simply by exist first and buying a house only for it to go up because more people now are alive  the other thing i have seen is the local housing market gets pumped up and then dumped this happens every like 20 to 30 years i have seen,nftf50

1165,Job search stress,so ive been at my wfh call center position for a year and some change i was told last week that ill be forced back into the office soon and its completely destroyed the last vestiges of give a fuck i have left ive called out the last two days and ive been applying for different remote positions most of which are supervisorylevel a lot of them require basic assessments in addition to the application job hunting is fucking draining and theres no way ill have the mental energy to do it after a day at work which is a big reason ive been calling out im considering calling out tomorrow too so i can follow up on the responses ive gotten  its stressing me out because i dont have any pto so if i do manage to hang onto this job im just sacrificing days of pay and its also stressful thinking about potentially losing my benefits because america is such a great place to live in but i will absolutely become unemployed and destitute before im forced back into a shitty stuffy artificiallylit office cubicle so i can do the exact same job ive been doing for the last year while some middle manager stares at me all day fuck your business casual office attire its fucking 80 degrees out fuck going back to worrying about gas lunch and car maintenance costs just because some boomers are throwing tantrums about not being able to oversee the peons every waking fucking second  at this point im probably going to keep calling in until i either land a new position and officially quit or get fired i hate this fucking rat race but i have the skills and the ability to do these types of jobs from my house which is essential to my mental wellbeing and quality of life sorry i like being able to fucking eat lunch with my younger brothers and actually be comfortable while im working instead of adhering to some arbitrary dress code because something something professionalism  rant,nfmxcy
1166,Rant: any day now I am going to snap,warning this is probably going to be pretty long i am so fed up with every aspect of this job long rant incoming  i work at a job where its an inbound call center as well as managing a caseload of clients so basically youre working on your caseload but youre also taking inbound calls for other peoples clients its now permanently working from home which is nice but unfortunately its an extremely busy job where you have 0 downtime whatsoever and our activity is monitored constantly so i dont have that going for me  our caseload is supposed to be around 120 but for over a year its been at least double that they only just recently started hiring more people to cope and to replace the people that have quit since covid started   it is legitimately impossible to manage the call volume  case volume unless a youre literally working every single second with no breaks b taking every shortcut known to man and screwing up your claims andor c transferring every call you get to someone else which youre not supposed to do   were not supposed to aux out more than 33 of the day yesterday my manager sends out a list of aux times for everyone in the office im at 38 averaged over the week prior 510  514 a few people are around where i am at and a few are lower the vast majority of the office of around 80 people is sitting at more than 60 that means that those of us who are auxed in more get a disproportionate amount of calls because the calls are spread out among fewer people so on any given day ill have 2050 calls received on top of my own people calling in and all the other job duties everyone else gets like 1 5 a day because they just sit in not ready mode   so i asked my manager what is being done to address these massive discrepancies i honestly hate sounding like a snitch but it is so unfair that for months on end ive been struggling and failing to meet expectations and taking on extra work because everyone else doesnt want to take calls well guess the fuck what  neither do i anyway she responds everyone on that list that is highlighted is getting an email from their manager  give me a fucking break theyre getting the exact same email i get because im 5 over the limit vs 30 what a joke     ive been going back and forth with this one customer for months ive explained the payment process 100 freaking times and this lady still doesnt get it she has asked for my manager multiple times so i forward the emails to her hey we discussed this lady the other day ive explained this as many different ways as i possibly can and now she wants to talk to you my manager says tell her x y z i dont have time to respond to her today   so you think i do she literally said that very morning she only has one meeting so wtf else are doing for the rest of your 7 hours   so i told the lady what my manager said to tell her a few days later i hear from the woman again still wants to talk to my manager i forward the email to my manager who never responds i figured she took care of it and forgot about it   a few days later today i get another email from the same woman i never heard from anyone blah blah wtf so i forward the email to my manager a third time i said hey i sent this to you last week im not sure if you saw it this is the same person that ive discussed with you several times can you please talk to her so she stops bothering me  my managers response explain the process to her if she still kicks up a fuss send her to another escalated call rep  my jaw literally dropped first of all there is a milelong email chain right there dating back to midmarch where i keep telling the lady the damn process second my manager is literally the escalated call rep for my team because she is the manager is that not one of the basic job duties for managers to handle and smooth over escalated issues now you want me to send to someone else   so i didnt respond just marked the email as read im not responding to the lady any more ive done all i can do of course if she gets to talk to someone else i will be blamed for the lack of ongoing responses but whatever   later on that same day today my manager emails me and says youre above 10 voicemails please address i had 12 at the time she emailed my company has a policy where you cant have any more than 10 vm at a time if you get above 10 you need to drop everything and answer some all must be answered within 24 hours of it being left   no fucking shit i have 12 messages i have 240 claims right now email my lady back and ill answer my voicemails gt is what i wanted to say but i just ignored the email instead     recently ive made it known to my manager that id like to try moving to a different department i asked her what i need to do to do that i was recently passed over for another position so i wanted guidance because i never got feedback as to why i was rejected without an interview   she said one of the biggest things i need to do is make a big crossoffice impact  i said ok well can you tell me what that means i did literally every side project you threw at me last year and you still only rated me as a 3 how would i stand out more   her response i shit you not well none of that extra stuff you mentioned really mattered what we look for is special projects that you develop on your own  i read this email and immediately went on my lunch break and called a friend of mine that recently quit i spent hundreds of hours doing all these extra projects last year just to now be told that actually they didnt matter because they werent special enough no i need to take time out of my already slammed work day to concoct some bs project whatever happened to ya know my actual job how about the fact that i very rarely receive complaints have gotten 1010 scores on customer service surveys can keep myself caught up on my workbook without assistance and meet my numbers every single month that ive worked here except for one no none of that matters to get you promoted or even for a lateral transition because i havent created a special project to work on to make myself look good and this goes without saying but its not even a guarantee that youll be promoted because of this and obviously youre not getting paid extra to work on it   im in the process of looking for another job because we all know its often easier to get another job at a new company than to be hired internally even if its a lateral move obviously its taking forever ive been looking for months but everything just looks like more of the same im this  close to just quitting and taking the summer off i cant take it anymore yall im about to take my work computers and leave them on the sidewalk for the garbage people to pick up

1167,So I had to call out of work awhile back.,i do appreciate my jobs mindset of the managers need to be the one to find the replacement for the call out but there are some other problems depending on who you talk to when calling out for work  so i got really sick one day and had to call out for work and just happened to get the big boss on the phone when calling in his reply was simple fine well take care of it but he sound very annoyed by the whole thing  im not one who usually calls out so i thought it would be ok and i wouldnt get too much lip in response buy hey  guess i was wrong   so next day i come in still feeling shitty but able to work and the assistant manager talks to me apparently he was in the room when i made the stick call and overheard it he asked the boss when he was done with the call dude you sounded so annoyed it cant be that bad to which the boss responds yeah i cant make them think its ok to call out for work apparently im the one in the wrong for trying to keep customers and my fellow employees healthy and not sick,nfg0r9

1183,As long as we need money just to afford the right to live we are not free., the idea that we are free is one of the greatest illusions created by our society in reality we actually arent free first of all we are not free externally because to afford the right to live we need money and to get money we have to essentially sell our souls we have to spend most of our lives doing things that we dont care for and that are so unpleasant that they have to pay people to do them and if youre lucky enough to get a job you will have to spend at least 50 years working continuously   even on the psychological level we arent free because from the moment youre born your parents and the society they live in begin to condition you you dont even have the freedom to choose your own name i mean sure youre free to choose your name when youre older but it costs money just to even have that much freedom eventually your parents send you to school which only exists to teach you things that will make you useful to the system school basically conditions us to just be another slave the less they teach you to think for yourself the better because thinking for yourself might lead you to seeing that you actually arent free and this is bad for business  on top of all this if you see how insane our society is and if you refuse to be a slave the society makes it almost impossible for you to live and it even conditions other slaves to ridicule and shame anyone who dares to question our current system i mean just look at the things people say on reddit whenever someone brings up this sub if you dont want to work people call you lazy and if you decide to end your life so you wont have to participate in this sick society they call you crazy the only way to fit in is to conform so its very clear to me that freedom is one of the greatest illusions weve been tricked into believing but of course the powers that be know that if people think they are free then they will never question their enslavement most people actually like being slaves because they wouldnt know what to do with themselves if they were free they need somebody else to tell them what to do  when i woke up today all these things were bothering me and now that ive expressed it i feel a lot better anyway ill leave you with a few lines from a song i wrote called growing uphttpssoundcloudcomzenbreazegrowingupfeatsula      gtim grown up now i got bills to pay   gt   gti dont wanna sell me soul but it seems to pay   gt   gtit costs money just to live   gt   gtis this really what life is   gt   gtthe cost of growing up   gt   gtis this really what the price is,ng3e5q

1204,Long and annoying recruitment process,yesterday i received an invitation for a job interview that seemed perfect for me however in their mail they went in details about their recruitment process and after reading it i was quite annoyed this is what they ask for   1 send them a video where you answer some questions  they say you dont need to prepare it but you kinda have to   2 test at home which takes an hour and a half   3 interview with hiring manager  and if it had stopped right there i would have been totally okay but     4 half a day doing 4 interviews about 1 hour per interview i suppose  its sad to see that recruiters view job applications as an opportunity to get some good quality entertainment by forcing applicants to crush their self esteem and act like clowns for them  they also probably think that if someone is okay to go through such recruitment process he will be okay with basically anything  doing extra hours for free everyday working on weekends working in shitty office etc  i have been unemployed for months and i would really like to find a job as soon as possible but no thank you,nfipdm

1257,"Give no loyalty, for you shall receive none.",just another story of a shitty employer and my eventual triumph to brighten your day its a long one tldr is at the bottom   i had been working for this digital content company for a couple of years i had recently been married and we were on the fence about moving from il to az  for several reasons financial weather sucks etc my wife was working a retail job at meijer so she was fully on board with moving but we decided to wait until after my 2year performance review to see if i could negotiate a salary that would justify staying put originally i was hired to manage support and deployments for all of the media content players at all client sites which numbered in the hundreds i had an extensive it background coming in but actively sought out this job as a change of pace   cue the bait and switch  they suddenly fired the fulltime it guy a couple months after i started think small company about 20 total employees but it was still a fulltime job for one person what has two thumbs and inherited all of those responsibilities in addition to his own this guy from that point on i was expected to perform two 40k per year jobs while being paid for one which i did admirably i might add no matter i figured that i could demonstrate my value and parlay that into a nice salary in the future boy was i wrong  when review time came they offered to increase my salary from 42k to 45k i brought up the fact that my skillet and hard work had enabled them to trim their payroll considerably and that i had been effectively doing two jobs not only did they scoff at me why do you deserve that money  but told me in no uncertain terms that i was at the ceiling pay rate for my position basically i shouldnt expect to receive another pay raise for a long time if ever in response i threw the hammer down right there during the review and told them im moving out of state they showed no interest in allowing me to transition my role to az so i just put in my notice on the spot  they scrambled to find a replacement for me hired a guy a man nearing retirement age in texas wtf and i found out they started him at 52k double wtf so they actually flew me down to austin to train the guy for a few days i mostly drank titos cocktails and ate brisket sandwiches in the hotel room but i got the guy up to speed i had fully documented the daytoday tasks of the position and there was a full peaceful knowledge transfer anyway i moved to arizona a month later and we have zero regrets   now the fun part i kept in occasional touch with the office manager chick from the media company and i found out that my replacement quit abruptly after a few months and left them in a bigtime lurch it took them several weeks to find someone else and that person had to learn the role completely on their own clients were lost bosses were pissed etc in addition to that they burned through that person and a couple of others in the months that followed it was a big mess resulting in lost revenue and frustration all around it felt really good to learn that their unwillingness to pay me resulted in a vacuum that sucked their overall profitability for a period of time   tldr  left a job that didnt value me they paid the price and then some and it was hilarious any expressed loyalty from an employer is an illusion screw em,nepqt3

1263,Capitalism will never allow a workers market,    no matter how terrible the labor shortage we are now seeing in the economy gets the capitalists will never raise wages much higher than subsistence levels if labor being as necessary as it is got its fair share in a labor shortage then that would mean in a labor shortage it would be workers who get to choose what firm to work for instead of firms being choosy about what workers they get owners would be outbidding one another constantly  every place you apply at would be offering a higher wage than the next one sterling benefit packages would quickly become normal and employers would be bending over backward to keep what workers they have this they say is how the market is supposed to work   but none of this happens instead wages stagnate and owners begin to cry loudly about the dignity of work and of the need for selfstarters and dedicated applicants they have to  if the workers became aware that it is they not the owners that can decide what businesses and opportunities get support that they and not the owners are what make production go  then we would have socialism the owners cant give up the ghost not even once for once the workers find out just how much more they can make without the sky falling as the owners so often claim the workers will never go back to believing the lie  so the owners rely on the phantasm introduced and maintained by the neoliberal project  the philosophy of the dream job with it they fooled so many into believing that the point of life was to work that work was what made one a good citizen it made one moral a productive member of society what nonsense all just smoke and mirrors to dupe workers out of their wages and to distract them from class consciousness all so that the gains from technology and automation went to them and not to us  work is bullshit the whole point of us living together in a society is to be rid of it i dont need other people to heap work on me  i can find my own way of spending my time and yet this is exactly what this economy does  the owners are just coming up with bullshit work for us all to do to keep us from forgetting what neoliberalism spent so much time drilling into our collective heads for only with that phantasm can the people be persuaded into taking the pittance the capitalists offer  so yell it from the rooftops work is a sin the hardworking employee is a fool a clown a naive dipshit who believes the lies of miserly old men the politicians are all bastards  each and every one of them will insist that only those americans who work without complaint are good citizens worth listening to the poor and unemployed are just their wards not their constituents in other words the politicians will serve you only if you serve the masters with friends like these who needs enemies,neglh4

1269,Am I antiwork? Help me figure out what to do.,so lads let me tell you my story i need to share it somewhere and i cant think of a better place than this sub please try not to hate me for my whitecollar perspective on things   i have been in sick leave for an extended time now the doctors consider me unable to work at this time and i am due to depression caused primarily by lockdown isolation but secondarily by some underlying issues that probably would have thrown me off at some point anyway i am making an effort to recover and it seems that i am however i am not sure whether recovering is such a great idea if i never recover then i never have to work again or work significantly reduced hours and i get to keep my income of course the downside then is that i probably will not grow and will not have a career so i am at a crossroads one where its not said i get to really choose the direction but anyway  ampx200b  to provide some details im now in my early thirties have a decent job 90th percentile income in agecorrected distribution with excellent benefits live in a centralnorthern euro country note that i still cant afford a decent house or anything like that so to be honest whether you are 50th or 90th percentile really barely makes a difference the difference is a better car a slightly nicer vacation and a slightly nicer house full stop  ampx200b  without providing details lets say my childhood was pretty fun and normal until starting at 610 years old my selfesteem and sense of selfstarted to become warped i was at 10 years old a philosopher i figured out how what you call green and what i see as green might be something totally different to both of us and we would never even know and many other insights i never read a book about philosophy in my life my father who studied philosophy would always find a way to invalidate my views through some bullshit academic literature probably why i never bothered reading any he did many other things to invalidate me as a person on many different levels long story short i grew up both fearing and hating the world and questioning my place in it whether i was worth one at all this recently became clear to me and i have been living with this defect until now hiding it from both myself and the world this obviously impacted my life both professionally and socially in a very negative way of course this is summarized but lets say that i constantly feel like i am being rejected and bullied even when not and that i figured this out but that it nevertheless takes a massive effort to get through normal daily life this way and to focus on things which are not terribly important to me like this work  ampx200b  in high school i was essentially ignored and i ignored everyone as much as possible i was never bullied but i also never had friends i was just that person nobody knew what to do with and i knew not what to do with anyone i recently considered i may have autism but i feel that autism is a rare condition and that getting where i am and doing so in a way that is both excruciatingly painful and effortless at the same time seems implausible to say the least in any case my social skills and trust incooperativeness towards the world took a big hit  ampx200b  after high school i managed to go to a uni where normally only the offspring of very rich parents go dont ask how my parents are poor divorced my mom is on welfare level and it cost me a lot to go to this place lets keep it at that i and one other kid were the exceptions to this rule and a handful of reasonably but not very rich stock this warped my view of the world even further i saw firsthand how incredibly effortlessly they moved through life how much fun they had how everything that i would have to break my back to have was simply handed to them by birthright how they squandered it how they were essentially for the most part  and i know i am not god and thou shalt not judge but i cannot contain myself  human trash in any case none of them were any better than the normies and most of them were worse my social skills at the time were still very poor and my machiavellianism at a very low level otherwise i might have been more effective and used the opportunity to ingratiate myself with them after all being friends with a guy with a boat is better than owning a boat alas i dropped out after two years  ampx200b  i then tried and failed at a number of normal uni programs always due to a lack of work ethic on my part although my reasoning at the time was i simply want to go my own way f this conformity stuff i dont want to be a sheep and they do not teach anything useful at uni anyway i tried to set up my own businesses or code my own applications to sell and although others would compliment my progress quality of work and work ethic this never amounted to much actual financial success in hindsight it was solely due to a lack of perseverance which went unnoticed both by myself and my environment because i am at the same time quite perseverant in nature its the irony of progress without progress that i still cant explain very well to this day   ampx200b  around the time when i was 26 i had still accomplished very little both socially and professionally and i saw my life completely stagnating i decided i had to do something and so picked up relatively menial work in it i thus experienced what many on this sub experience being treated like a worthless maggot working for someone elses profit i could not stomach the fact that this company would place me somewhere pay me 10hr 14 including all the bennies i would say and then the client would pay them 50hr all the while they assumed no risk because i was a temp anyway i do not mind paying a middle man for stuff thats useful to me like placing me in a working position but you cannot tell me i am worth 50hr to someone and pay me 10 especially because now the client expects me to deliver 50 worth of output while i expect to deliver at the very most 20 so i left found myself a government contract to tender myself on and then i was the one taking the 80hr started at 40 i did that for 2 years until i became too disgusted with the fact that these managers would pay me anything i wanted because they liked me or something and it was just budget they had to get rid of anyway given to them by good honest taxpayers mind you for a job that hardly needed doing unfortunately those government tenders are rarer now and only open to middle men generally  ampx200b  so i left and went to complete my degree after all eventually i graduated with honours with an msc thats extremely employable and effortlessly found a job at what could be easily called an alist employer i grew dissatisfied as i always do and jumped to another job the offer was great and whats the greatest about it is that they offered me an indeterminate period contract right from the start affording me a position of relative power and security  too bad for them i called in sick reasonably shortly after starting  ampx200b  the way i think about it is that for the premium slaves to function their labour camp must have no walls and lenient guards these sheep are smart and so they must feel the premium they need to experience trust i talk to my coworkers in more diplomatic terms about my views on how we are exploited as labour and they all talk about how they are quite happy to be in this position how they are doing much better than everyone else theirour age and so forth and i tell them but you still cant buy a house raise a family support a wife or a husband i am not a gender role purist those kinds of things your parents could do these things and they were much less productive than you how is that fair and their eyes kind of glaze over and they go on with their work they always talk about how busy they are its like they want to be busy being busy is a massive part of their identity busy little bees buzzing in my ear responding to the question why do you enjoy this work i had one respond well you know i just want to be in a good position and i think the world will always have a huge demand for people who are handy at solving problems with numbers excel and so i see this as progress towards valuable skillsets i did not tell him that i think most of the worlds current ills are precisely because of a huge surplus of people who think they can solve problems with excel and society is doing its very best to accommodate them all with bullshit jobs  ampx200b  talking to these people was in fact a major source of my depression because i had always figured that once the string was pulled excessively it would at some point snap never had i thought it could be pulled as much as it has and never had i thought to think it could be pulled even further still and that the snapback might occur when i am well into my 50s done by a different less complacent less childlike generation than mine   ampx200b  in order for me to move from nothing to this premium labour camp i had shut down my entire personality i dont have one anymore my entire view on life i dont have a consistent view my entire will to even live thats mostly gone nothing about me has any personality my furniture has good taste but no personality my clothes are in good taste but lack any discernable identity my physical health is great on measurements yet my posture is not there seems to be nothing wrong with me yet everythings out of place  ampx200b  so now i find myself in a position where i am in a camp with very weak walls and lenient guards if the camp finds me defective the camp will let me out and even bear the cost of my departure fully the camp will afford to me in essence the same privilege as is afforded to the rich namely a guaranteed and reasonably high income forever until death without the need for reciprocation ill even continue to build a pension i can even leave the country and now considering this i find myself in a situation where i am essentially dr jekyll and mr hyde even me even on me deep down perhaps one of the stauncher antiwork antirich types you will find this invisible wall has an effect simply because their hold on my balls is not so iron tight i am more willing to accept a loose grip even if the bottom line is the same i work for someone elses luxurious lifestyle  ampx200b  dr jekyll says  you came so far you are part of the team now finally you are on the good side of this you should stay and do your best  your issues are caused by personality defects from childhood these are not really you good normal people fit in you pretty much fit in now just recover and go on   society is not so bad look at the social safety net and yes objectively it is much better than what most of you on this sub go through and i truly feel for you and those pulling the even shorter straws i almost feel bad for complaining at all  with the covid situation society is extremely unstable right now it is better to be in the building than outside of it i work at a large multinational yes i am a horrible person part of the problem an enforcer of evil etc   i like my team members i like my manager even though they are also corporate drones and bought the fairy tale hook line and sinker i still see them as people and i do not mind being around them   if you continue working you can probably become a premium premium slave and then you can command rates of upwards of 150hr on the free market you will have lots more money yay   fix yourself find your identity while still being a part of this world dont go and sit on the sidelines   ampx200b  mr hyde says  all you ever wanted in life was to get out of the race all you ever do is save up heres your chance what are you some kind of moron why are you even thinking this through  nobody ever gave you anything nobody ever gave you even a nickel that they did not expect to have you return to them threefold you do not owe anybody anything  this country is not for you this societys values are not your values you have no business building a pyramid you do not even like in return for no stake in it while others enjoy its your fruits undeservingly  what are you gonna work for like 45 weeks of vacation a year what you need is 54 weeks of vacation a year buddy   you know very well you would do things with your life eventually do you think you are doing things with your life right now you arent you may not make money doing it but you will never do nothing it is not in your nature to want to contribute nothing   because of my shitty childhood and many many failures in life unfinished degrees shortterm employments etc it will be easy to convince the medical community that something is so medically wrong with me i cannot work and to be frank maybe there actually is  stop worrying and jump   ampx200b  tldr confused guy considering whether he is a true antiwork or a good rehabilitable sheep,nebqib

1330,Advice on Leaving a Toxic Job,hi everyone   i just came across this sub while looking for shared experience and thought it would be a good place to ask for advice buckle in this may be a long read but i really appreciate anyone who reads it through   i work at a clinic i got hired last year and worked for exactly one week before i got laid off due to covid a few months later they asked me to come back on a limited schedule rather than the full time schedule we had agreed to mostly to serve as backup for my co worker who had been a fixture for 13 years   our office manager is the kind of person who wants things accomplished her way no matter who it alienates along the way that often involves staff and at times involves patients her condescending and passive aggressive attitude led to her butting heads with my co worker who was expected to learn a slew of new polices and procedures while working 12 hour days almost always without breaks and reduced lunches due to the impossible workload   fast forward to about two months ago and i get a weekend call from my manager saying that my co worker had been fired and if i could come in and cover her shifts in shock i text my co worker and she tells me it was done without warning and that the manager and owner were needlessly cruel with how they went about it i felt dirty and didnt want to help them move on from their decision scot free but this career path is important to me and i didnt want to no show at the very least i decided i would apply for other jobs in the meantime   except that soon became very hard to do because i found myself basically working her schedule i refused to forego my breaks but still long days where im responsible for greeting patients in person manning the phones recruiting new patients and dealing with insurance companies all at the same time left me completely drained they promised that they would have someone hired within a month but its been almost two with only one interview that ive seen its becoming increasingly clear that theyre expecting me to carry this load for as long as its convenient for them and all without me officially being upgraded to a full time employee meaning im getting no benefits   on top of that they started disputing my overtime pay im in ca everyone ive talked to and every job ive worked at has paid me ot for anything over 8 hours in a single day one time they went in and changed my time card without my knowledge and said that part time employees only get ot above 10 hours in a day or over 40 hours in a week i researched it plenty when this happened and while i found a few sources that confirmed their claims i found way more that confirmed mine when i questioned them they had a page ready to go from the state saying what they were claiming which made it more confusing because i had a statement that said the opposite from the same site feeling drained i spoke to a lawyer who suggested i let the ot build up then file a case once i quit for everything at once   anyway that brings us to last friday a patient was at risk for being charged out of pocket because of an insurance issue their doctor told me to call them and let them know in case they decided to cancel and not risk the high payment between calling the insurance company handling a phone that was ringing off the hook for 2 hours handling patients in person and filing 75 pages of paperwork 7 hours with no breaks had suddenly passed i didnt want to leave my brand new co worker alone too long so she wouldnt be overwhelmed so i cut my lunch in half and rushed back to the office   in the time that i was gone there were 5 more phone calls i had to return and a message from my manager saying not to cancel the patient with the insurance issue unfortunately i didnt see the message until i returned all the calls so by the time i did the patient had already been cancelled simply put she was angry she texted me and included the owner in the thread asking me why i ignored her message i have a timeline of exactly how it went down and i was greeted with messages from both the owner and manager basically blaming me for not knowing any better that i should ask questions if i dont know what to do something i avoid because the manager has yelled at me before for asking too many questions  now my frustration turns to anger because i both did what the doctor told me to do which i agreed with because the patient shouldnt have be blindsided with sudden charges and because ive been directed by the manager to do so i have also seen both her and my old co worker do it in the past for similar reasons to imply it was due to my ignorance rather than the massive workload making me miss the message the short time frame we had to make a decision or the lack of staffing killed me mentally  eventually the doctor listened to me vent for almost two hours and was nice enough to give me a ride home he talked me down from straight up walking out but i decided to use the weekend to cool off and make a more rational decision before i left i made sure to send a lengthy but professional text to the manager and owner explaining how frustrated i was because of the workload how i feel like im just plugged in as a replacement instead of a valued individual and that this environment is unsustainable that things will naturally fall through the cracks and that theres no one individual to blame but an overall failure of management to maintain proper staffing   i decided to give my two weeks tomorrow mostly because i dont want them to label me as difficult to my co workers who see me in a positive light and because my college friend got me this job and i dont want to have my actions reflect poorly on her that was until a little while ago when i got a response from the owner saying hes surprised that i did what i did because training said otherwise again ive done this plenty of times and have seen others do it repeatedly and that its not their fault that were understaffed because theyre not just going to hire anybody no mention of any of the concerns i had like being overworked or set up for failure just more blame towards me and excuses for them   so my ultimate question at this point is should i give them the two weeks its obvious they have no respect for me and i feel like doing so gives up some of my power i wouldnt past them to suddenly fire me like they did my co worker for standing up for myself any other advice regarding the overtime claim or any potential case my former co worker might have for her working conditions or her sudden firing would be appreciated too   thank you,nezg9x

1334,The Founding Americans understood and were pro Collective Bargaining,the two most unpopular taxes when the us was founded were the head tax and the property tax  a head tax is a tax someone has to pay just to be alive and the property tax had to be paid if you wanted a place to live they were unavoidable and the politicians were able to use them to single people out and pit groups against each other   this is why taxes are supposed to be apportioned and not have direct taxes that single out individuals this is the same idea as a company that favors one group of employees over another to prevent unionization when the workers are united then they have much more power than they do as individuals  the founders of the country tried to do the same thing with taxes if everyone has to pay taxes then the people would push back against corruption and an abusive government but if some groups are punished and others favored then it is much easier to divide and conquer the tax cattle  there is nothing new in politics or the workplace stand together or hang separately,nen5zv

1336,I don’t work very much and it’s glorious - my story,antiworkers of reddit there is hope it can be done ive been to corporate hell and back and lived barely to tell the tale more importantly i vowed to design a life with little work and can finally say ive mostly accomplished this dream wanted to share my story for whoever is interested  background ive worked my ass off since 15 years old growing up in a culture of classic american values  namely  work yourself to the bone and identifying who you are with your occupation i had every job under the sun for a young person cashier bagger delivery driver telemarketing for multiple companies food runner waiter and more then i graduated college and entered the workforce initially leasing commercial office buildings then after being fired as a high performer on a sinking ship of a company went to work at a large accounting firm and suffered miserable and long hours for four years after being let go following burnout i tried several more corporate jobs and slowly realized this was not the life i wanted to live and made it my goal to design a different life  next steps to get to a point of making extreme life changes it usually requires an impetus through primary experience and from what i gather reading this sub that is where most people here are now this is what i did first i moved to a low cost of living area and began budgeting on a weekly basis eventually finding the balance of lowest expenses and good quality of life meanwhile i earned my real estate license and found sponsorship at a broker  i did take the time to master the components of being a realtor and this took between 12 years then i went through marketing steps of generating inbound leads and also found a handful of properties to manage for owners who didnt want to deal with it i am not a highvolume real estate producer not even close nor do i want to be like any occupation real estate can consume your life if you let it my aim was and is and will always be to close a sale or two per month which in combination with property management meets my financial needs  current life this is where i am now once a month i have to go through accounting for property management which takes about 8 hours i also work about 2 hours a day on average in real estate this comes out to about 15 hours a week total working mostly all from home for the first time in my life i have both time and energy for hobbies i exercise five days a week and cook most of my own meals i have time and positivity to share with my girlfriend she is in a bad corporate job and we are working on designing her a better life  there is time to spend with my dog visit family and friends and read books on weekdays i have no kids which makes a massive difference and understand this lifestyle isnt always feasible  takeaways i am writing this to let people know there is hope sometimes i see people on here wishing for actual death and i have been near to that point it is absolutely insane how much we are brainwashed to obsess about working all the time even worse is the cancer that is corporate environments which needs no explanation even now on a monday and on other weekdays i occasionally feel guilty for not suffering at work i feel like i have to hide my life from others because of their resentment this eventually fades and the smokescreen of this awful working culture fades with it and one can see this is how life absolutely without question is meant to be lived before we give up before we consent to living this way until death before we fall in line with soldiers in a losing battle please remember we only have one chance to figure this life out and maybe its worth trying to design a better one that makes us happy even if it doesnt work out you can say you tried and if it does well maybe theres a happy ending,neoipa

1441,Honestly at this point the only way I see a good life is returning to the void.('rant'/release),so for starters im a nihilist and antinatalist but for as long as i can remember i chose to observe the world instead of join it this i guess is a culmination of the 16 years of my lifes observation people say im just depressed or that its just a phase bull shit if it were a phase wouldnt still feel these things after 7 years  so far its shit not even gonna sugarcoat it  we dont get a choice in existence we are ripped from the void indoctrinated into thinking life is worth living while also being fucked up the ass by wage slavery and 40 hour weeks on top of that theres the mental and physical shit that can develop further decreasing lifes worth from the day we are developed enough to go to school until the day were too old to work  people keep saying life is a gift life is worth living life is amazing and this and that and this and that and it just keeps going on and on and on and it never ends it justnever ends  you know what the definition of insanity is its doing the same shit over and over again expecting something to change we all work day in and day out expecting something to pay it all off but it never comes the tribulations the indoctrination the ignorance the petty political infighting and for what a few minutes of enjoyment it doesnt matter theres no point in existence now not since slavery and feudalism were created we are born into lives of suffering and lies  we are told everything will work out that everything will get better that we should be happy to be alive but it never will it will never get better we will die be forgotten and thats it nothing more the ultimate end  thats our reward for all the time wasted working suffering crying  death p whats the point in pushing on if the end goal is a return to the eternal void anyway the economy ruins our one chance at life life is an amazing thing to be enjoyed but the system the people before us made ruins it for us it doesnt help when people say to live life to the fullest and then proceed to get forced into slavery that locks you down with cold chains and holds a blade to your throat if you dare move   im drained your drained theyre drained and for what less money that what is needed to survive on top of the plethora of mental and physical disorders we may have is our reward the slave owners the final release from lifes sadistic eyes it doesnt even matter does it death is the only thing guaranteed by the supposed lord above and i pray the final day of torment arrives soon   they say i have my whole life ahead of me that i should enjoy it while i can because high school is the best time of my life if this place is the best time of my life i refuse to live any longer because fuck that why should i carry on huh why it will never get better never be worth the suffering nothing will matter anyway ill be forgotten and returned to the eternal void and cease to exist if i killed myself i would be free if they say suicide only passed on the pain those people shouldnt have decided to make another poor soul suffer the cycle anyway i wouldnt care cause id be dead and free if they killed themselves from the strain then good on them they freed themselves too if it fails and i unfortunately continue living id be forced even deeper into the hole why bother anymore  sorry for the long post needed this off my chest,ne0oqg
1442,I don’t think retiring at an old age is a good thing at all.,there is a very clear difference between an older person who works and one who does not sitting in an old peoples home or a villa they worked for i can imagine it being so so boring your brain activity would really start to decrease at older ages thats very dangerous  this is why often times you see people going out of retirement and back to work  in my opinion the concept of working hard for a long time and then retiring to relax is depressing a more logical way would be to take job breaks from time to time work 2 years take 5 months off before starting another job enough time to get bored of your hobbies what do you guys think,nde9js

How about not glorifying stress at all?,so where do employers get the right to cause anyone stress i remember being a child around the year 2000 and hearing the word stress for the first time i hated that word people started using it as a status symbol just like all other nasty stuff like burn out overworking multiple jobs full agendas and tuhduh drinking smoking and slurping caffeine and eating nasty salads for lunch at a desk   stress is extremely toxic to the body and even when an employee think there is no stress the environment is highly stressful opening an email can cause the same adrenal response as being attacked by z wild animal only here we cant escape from the animal and we are also not allowed to kill our minds and bodies then produce way too much adrenaline which needs to be countered by cortisol either leading to obesity or to weight loss and trembling  and its almost like the worse employees feel and the more obvious the news is half of the population is burned out 8 out of 10 wants to quit jobs the worse the companies wanna make it as if they feel like our limits have been pushed higher and they want to see even more how far they can stretch us  stress during interview stress during commute stress to learn everything then more and more stress to not make a mistake either from the imposter syndrome or from the dunning kruger effect stress from making ends meet stress of bad work life balance stress of bad coworkers stress from lack of sleep not getting chores done eating the same nutrient poor food every lunch derived of any salt fat or flavour   no wonder half of the population is depressed,nckriv

1550,Just some thoughts,so i have been on here awhile i used to work for a megacorp where these concepts majorily apply you end up doing all the work while other people sit around doing not shit pareto principle times 100 in case you havent ever heard about the pareto principle it basically stipulates that the most competent people end up doing 80 of the work while everyone else does the 20 however this gives you a shit ton of leverage with an employer the more percentage of the work you do the more useless your other corporate drone employees are   imagine 90 perhaps 95 or even 99 all while management sits there with way higher salaries how is that justified so i decided fuck that i will just start my own business i wont slave away for a bunch of people to sit there and collect the fruits of my labor i collect my own fruits now  ampx200b  they can go fuck themselves,ncnxf7

1552,Depression is considered a reason you can qualify for social security disability benefits.,i was researching this because ive had lifelong depression that means that work utterly exhausts me and burns me out like all of us right and wanted to see if i could apply for disability turns out you can  obviously i am not a lawyer or disability expert i havent even applied myself yet but several sources say if your depression is severe enough that you are unable to work you might be able to qualify other qualifying mental conditions their words not mine include anxiety and forms of autism   im sure its not an easy process but hopefully it can help some folks here who have diagnoses for these things and might qualify for benefits,ncluxa
1553,Time is our most valuable possession., ive seen a lot of posts lately on this subreddit as i think in the wake of this major pandemic a lot of us have become a lot more in tune with our inner turmoil regarding where we stand societally   im 22 years old born and raised here in the great usa i did pretty well in school had some cool friends and got to take lots of vacations growing up to cool places like hawaii and nyc i never had food insecurity in my youth nor did i ever have to worry about not having a roof over my head i got my first job when i was 16 working part time at the local movie theater i was so excited to finally be making some money and for a first job it was pretty fun i learned a lot about customer service and slowly but surely i was introduced to all the spoils of my labor with my newfound bank balance i suddenly was able to enhance a lot of the things i enjoyed i made my first big purchase after my first paycheck and bought myself a set of copic markers a coveted art supply by many young illustrators and artists   growing up my mother always stressed that there are three ms to live by in life the motivation to market yourself to make money money was here to buy opportunities not things i pondered this a lot in my teens starting to think a lot more about my money and what i really wanted to do with it i still spent very frivolously for a long time but i had at began to open the thought channels  fastforward to a year into working at the movie theater and i was still liking the job pretty well it paid a whopping 725 an hour and i got maybe 2025 hours a week so i was loaded as far as being a teenager goes with no bills to pay or mouths to feed life was cool   things changed when the yearly movie theater inspection came around it was a school night and i had worked a full 8 hour shift after school our supervisor had told us that closing would take a little longer than normal that evening as the health inspection was the following morning and some things needed to be deep cleaned to keep a long story short they kept us there until almost three in the morning scrubbing the walls and deep cleaning the gutters upon telling them that i really needed to go home around midnight they had said that if i chose to leave id be terminated despite the clear issues with the situation this was my first real encounter with the insanity of the workplace i quit the following day by no call no showing   my parents had expressed disappointment in me quitting at the time however they understood why i quit and it wasnt a huge issue i found another job fairly quickly but the movie theater had left a sour taste in my mouth as i got more involved with work i saw more and more things that just didnt make sense to me sick days were okay as long as long you had 24 hour notice weirdly enough i didnt have a calendar of my upcoming flus and was penalized when i called in sick with a high fever to my job working at panera bread i had tested positive for the flu and had all the proper documentation they fired me you gotta love atwill employment   to keep this already longer post a little shorter ill say this id become highly aware of the lack of humanity in the customer serviceretail industry and had become a lot less excited about the three ms and more focused on the one t time was my time being well spent in these jobs was i doing humanity a true service  senior year of high school i tried acid for the first time it was super fun and wasnt a super deep experience on the surface however i strongly believe that at the young age i did it as well as the pathways that had already started opening up in my head from my work experiences i had begun an irreversible battle with work i began questioning a lot more things as well as becoming more and more angry with the inequalities and struggles within the average workplace i became surprised by how much people seemed to obsess over their jobs and was shocked by the amount of stress that came with them it was crazy to me how much turmoil people were experiencing just so generic company title could continue making bank and destroying whichever ecosystem was being threatened that week in the news  my freshman year of college was when this really kicked into high gear having done well in high school and scoring a 32 on my act i had gotten into every school i had applied to i was motivated and really wanted to pursue art as a career because i had seen the way my art was meaningfully impacting others my parents had always told me that as long as i did well and got into the schools i wanted to get into that id have help with paying this didnt end up being the case   art school is ridiculously expensive and with my parents high income and my young age of 17 i did not qualify for grants nor did i have the ability to take out school loans without a cosigner even with the 50 thousand dollar scholarship i got to the school of the art institute of chicago it wasnt a viable option i ended up having to go to the state school 20 minutes from my hometown in a town that smelled of cow shit and regret i hated it despite the full tuition scholarship i received there i had been doing well in my classes and slowly began enjoying it a bit more i met a few friends and began embracing the experience after all i was lucky to be there   at this point i had been doing psychedelics more regularly and had become a lot more familiar with my inner voice at least i was able to be a bit more introspective than i had been previously  my third month of college i was involved in a hit and run accident due to a drunk driver in a stolen car i had been a passenger in my roommates car and the drunk driver had hit us tbone style on my side after running through a stop sign i was lucky had we been a foot further down the road i would have been crushed the drunk driver seemed fine and i do remember him sort of hobbling out the car with a bottle in his hand and limping off into the night very much like some shitty scene in a movie i still very much remember the sensation of shock and pain of our car being hit and then crashing into a pole smoke filling the cabin and flames erupting from the engine i was so scared to move and the next thing i knew i was on the street 30 feet away from the car i had blacked out and some bystanders had pulled me out while the flames grew larger im very fortunate that outside of the concussion and cuts and bruises i was okay   i dropped out of college shortly after having had difficulty with focusing on class following the accident i became very depressed stopped eating and stopped doing artwork my parents had just gotten divorced and upon telling them i was dropping out they wished me luck and sent me off into the world on my own i get their frustration with me leaving such an opportunity but the three ms yet again were turned by the one t time   in the 5 years since i have worked over 10 jobs lived in my car taught english in costa rica was a ski instructor traveled cross country living in my suv and consistently i have been very broke my dad is no longer a part of my life he has been living in hawaii for the past few years and we havent spoke my mom has occasionally been there for me in times of struggle and i even moved back in with her when i threw my back out working at whole foods which required a back surgery that was not covered by workmans comp due to my short tenure there   despite all these great ups and downs i have consistently been labeled as a failure by my mother a failure to launch a failure to commit and failure to grow ive done a ton mental gymnastics trying to explain myself to reach understanding and to be heard in a meaningful way   at this point im absolutely tired of being taken advantage of by companies just because of my financial desperation its expensive to have a job first off you need money to buy gas to get to work and if your home isnt very close you need money for your car and the repairs it will need from commuting every day you need money to pay the obnoxiously high rent that ends up being more than have your income and you need money to feed yourself save money if youre lucky enough you might be able to put away 100 a month but probably not because if you cant afford to treat yourself even a little youll probably erode to the point of not being able to work anyways   so i guess this post is really just me trying to say fuck it im done trying to change my inner flame just so i can help make sure that the corporations actively killing our planet lobbying our rights away and herding the average american into whether slavery can continue to prosper   im tired and im choosing me over them and you should too quit that fucking job make them hurt make them realize that without us theyre nothing otherwise nothing is going to change im not lazy and im not unwilling to work im unwilling to be a commodity to be bought and sold for pennies on the dollar i want to spend my time focusing on real issues people all around the globe are being slaughtered in modern day holocausts i cant spend my time focused on wether or not linda is satisfied with her chicken cobb salad or bob is going to come back after he wasnt satisfied with the experience he had at the whole foods deli counter   time is what matters use it wisely,nchm00
1554,"How School and Work, Actually Work",i detest working its so horrible it makes me so miserable i think we all can relate  i think i understands why this also explains how school works as well  do you remember during school before big exams midterms projects  you feel a lot of stress and anxiety it builds up until you finish taking that exam or finish that project then it feels like you are happy afterwards but i think it is important to note what is really actually happening  you only feel good because you are eliminating that stressful event from your life its not that taking the exam itself makes you feel good it only feels good to eliminate the stress and anxiety that you had shortly experienced beforehand   i think a lot of people mistake this and think that doing stuff will actually lead to happiness but often times it is purely the elimination of the negative state that feels good and is not an actual pleasurable experience itself   this leads to work of course people always claim working makes them feel better etc but really i think work generates in them all these negative states anxiety stress frustration anger etc thus when they finally reach the weekend its tgif right  people think working is fulfilling them but really all that happens is this generation of pain from work which we all know too well and elimination of that stress when projects complete days complete weekends come etc  the problem is that the cycle just happens over and over and over again i think that leads all of us to be very miserable people no longer does the pain elimination from completing anything feel good anymore its just constantly starting back over again with a new day of work over and over again and it is maddening   i think this provides insight into how some people mistake work as being rewarding and how many on this subreddit do not agree a lot of people live in that pain and pain elimination cycle and thus think finishing a hard day of work makes them happy but really its just being done with the bullshit that day that is giving them a sense of relief they make the mistake of pain reduction being pleasure but it is really just pain reduction and thats all,nc8cx4

1631,"""You don't deserve money for leaving us without waiting to find a replacement"" (I worked 2 days for them)",so i worked for 2 days about 3 weeks ago for a small store the schedule was dreadful the salary wasnt equivalent with the work required so i told them i wont show up the next day   they pay the salaries on 13th so i agreed to come on 13th to get my money but they called me today and basically said i shouldnt come for those 50 because i left them without waiting to find a replacement   so yeah this is what you get when every caveman can be a boss and think rules dont apply to them it doesnt sound like a lot but in my country you can avoid starving to death with that money and i was really counting on them i will pursue them for my money since that work wasnt for free but it will take time and i dont have it   so cheers,nbca4j

1637,DAE Feel Uncomfortable Submitting to a Drug Test for an Employer?,i just turned down a job for an employer in a state where weed is completely illegal even for therapy therapy maybe for veterans cant even happen there so i tried to rationalize with hr prior to it like if i show you that the use has been recommended by a doctor can we have a conversation about its legitimacy   no its black and white in the manual  ok bye   but is bodily autonomy not valued in our country you have a right to privacy and why should your employer who is likely getting your labor at a discount also get unfettered access to see whats in your body for free   in this case they did drug tests to show their clients they have a robust safety program and to save on their insurance of course they dont tell the employees they do that they also dont strictly tell them that if they were to get injured on the jobsite the first priority for them would be to get access to your bodily fluids so that they can see if they can blame you for the accident that may have jeopardized your life oh he did blow this pipe falling on his head was his fault again for insurance to be cheaper   its like employers are telling them to cover a certain cost for them if you add up what they save on insurance and the revenue from the client theyve gained for drug testing and divide that by the number of employees possibly weighted by however you want to measure importance youd get the cost that each employee contributes to the company why are they not also being compensated for that   lastly i informed them id do the job on a 1099 basis or as an independent contractor so they could get the employee doing the work the reason they told me they wanted to hire me was because i was the best fit but we could get around that pesky drug test requirement hard no from them so did they actually want me to do the job because id get it done or did they want to be able to completely control the person they put in that position and thought id be the best fir to be controlled   im certain other parts of the world think it would be absurd to provide bodily fluids to an employer so they can gauge how much they can trust you   end of rant,nbh5k1

Please end this madness immediately!!,im a certified massage therapist and ive been doing this for 7 years this industry is so up and down like a goddamn roller coaster and the pay is so unstable if i knew about this before going to massage school i wouldnt have wasted my time and i would have just gone back to university and got in my biochemistry degree i went to massage school because i thought i could make a good living and put myself through university to get my biochemistry degree so that i can get a real career making real money i was highly mistaken  so just recently in the last few weeks i quit my weekend job at this chain corporate spa because i was absolutely sick and tired of getting paid only about 15 per hour after taxes and before tips people dont even tip that well there i put out a bunch of ads and i have gone independent charging up to 125 for a one hour massage depending on what sort of customizations the client wants i have a portable massage table and i do outcalls at the clients homes and in calls at my home i made 1000 cash under the table in the first week and a half but im really afraid that that was just good luck because this week is not as busy and a few people have had to cancel because they either contact me too late in the day and they dont fucking understand that you should book a damn massage in advance like they will literally contact me at 1000 pm asking for a massage right now like are you fucking serious these people have no respect for my time or they ask me if i give happy endings or do anything extra like that which i dont or they dont want to wear a mask when they come to my house i seriously shouldnt have to deal with this bullshit clients dont respect my time clients dont want to wear a damn mask and all the asshole clients that asked me about erotic services   so yeah im just sick and tired of having to make bullshit money i could enjoy this a lot more if i didnt have to worry about having to make money biden needs to hurry up and give me my fucking universal basic income already i want to go back to real school trade school is bullshit and get my damn degree so i can have more options for jobs other than shitty massage jobs before i got licensed for massage back in 2014 i was doing retail and food service jobs and i dont have any other qualifications and i would rather commit suicide than go back to working in retail and food service so im kind of stuck with this massage career that im extremely disappointed with   so yeah i have my own business now but its bullshit i feel like i have to market myself more than im actually doing actual massage and then i have to deal with bullshit from clients really shouldnt have to be dealing with any of this,nbuqss

1740,Actually you are entitled to a job that pays at least satisfactorily in America/Western countries,western countries america being a prominent example have sold themselves as a place where with sufficient labour you can live at least a comfortable existence comfortable means you can afford the necessities such as housing food education utilities and with enough left over for sufficient leisure that is one of the key ideas of the american dream or insert your western country dream   western countries still advertise themselves as this but hang on if theres more and more people being homeless more and more people barely scraping by the middle class slowly evaporating so you only really have a binary have or have not class many people are going to question if the dream is still real the last thing you want people to do is wake up if enough people are falling down that you cant hide it anymore thats when everyone starts to wake up california is a good example of this with many other places soon to follow in suit   so to keep the dream going everyone is actually entitled to a sufficient paying job to live comfortably otherwise western countries will need to change their advertising as a dream for the minority and a nightmare for the majority if theyre honest like that then i guess yes you aint entitled to a reasonable job you can decide if you want to live there   so boomers telling millennials theyre not entitled to a good job is a really dumb idea especially if theyre relying on the younger generations for their healthcare and social security but of course ol boomers think that theyre the only ones who should get the sunshine others exist just to please them   a remember a minimum wage means you can afford the bare minimum with a little left over,nbd4zh
1741,What do you think about a hotel not paying employees a regular wage but letting them live in a room without charge?,they do give money whenever asked like 20 or 50 but theres no regular paycheck  i know this is a pretty shit situation thankfully i have some savings  i think this could keep me stuck here  the reason i got into this situation is because i had nowhere to live  i feel like my bosses dont lose anything from one room being unavailable and they would prefer giving a room to a homeless employee to paying an employee who doesnt need one of their rooms  is this fair or are they taking advantage of homeless people  id feel like im asking for too much if i asked to get paid as much as a typical minimum wage worker  but i also suspect this is unethical or maybe even illegal,nbhcbf

1745,"I don't know if this is normal, but hope its okay",im sorry in advance im not a great writer so im fullheartedly expecting to not express myself the best i find this entire ideology is very poetic and i wanted to share the only thing i have my words  i just want to ask everyone what stops us who is coming between us banding together we are beautiful souls wanting to spend the better of our lives happy why should we not be heard why should we wait for an opportune moment  i think the future is fuel not an opportunity i am half afraid to send something like this because i will look like a fool to you people but that is a token of honesty that i think is reflected by the fear of not being a cog in the bigger society and us feeling as though were on the brink of suffocation but i piece together silly words to maybe show you together we can string together something simple because it doesnt have to be complex it just has to be an honest first step from all of us for all of us  and i apologize for this portion in advance because i dont know if this will resonate with anyone but i think back to whats been going on with hk and with jan 6 and with the current middle eastern conflict and other very similar bells that have been rung and i think to myself we are one people are we not we all bleed red and love one another i say all of this because i hope my words are heard but arent ever twisted i may be no one but i think those like me are happy being no ones and maybe together well all be able to achieve a life simpler than what we have right  we should all work together to not be divided by those whose pockets are directly lined by that same divination   i hope this comes off sincere its so much exhaustion and stress and sadness and it cant be put anywhere else i think maybe this is a naive request that change is done for tomorrow that i should plant the trees for my children but is it selfish for me to want to be a part of a better society too   thank you everyone you proved to me that my life deserves to be lived out with integrity,nc4wyr

1755,employer screwed me over with unemployment,me coming on here for consolation because my job cheated me out of 1800 worth of those pandemic checks which was supposed to compensate for my reduced hours and now im being forced back to fulltime even though 1 90 of the entire building is still on furlough 2 other depts are being allowed to bring people back on short hours 3 my dept for some reason is having a hard time bringing our people back because management is fucking incompetent and is too scared to make a fucking phone call to the people on furlough to come back 4 theyre telling me and my boss that theyre trying to maximize the hours in the dept before bringing more people back which is why we both have to be fulltime which is bullshit bc of 2 and 5 they only made this decision when my boss and i found out that i wasnt eligible for the 600 pandemic check and thats why i havent been getting anything for the majority of fucking april because apparently they made me work just enough hours to not be eligible for it i know its based off last years income or whatever which i also think is stupid because what the fuck does that have to do with what im making right now but now im being forced to fulltime so wheres the fucking 3 weeks worth of 600 pandemic checks thats supposed to compensate for my reduced hours did i just fucking work those 3 weeks for nothing those paychecks i got those weeks wasnt even enough to cover a trip to the fucking grocery store will i see that money or am i supposed to just lick their boots and go back to fulltime even though my whole fucking department isnt back yet bc theyre still on furlough i asked the hr dude about this and all he can tell me that its a business decision lol okay also why do they get to make the fucking decision instead of my fucking dept manager my dept manager literally told me if it was up to her she wouldve had me work 16 hours and just called another person in to work 20 hours since work was picking back up theres no reason why us two should be the only ones in the entire fucking building being fulltime busting our asses while the rest of our dept gets to stay home on furlough collecting the 600  ampx200b  sorry if this is super lengthy but my job has honestly just been a pain in the ass about this whole thing and obviously they dont give a shit about their employees it just infuriates me and honestly i was gonna quit around april and find another job before fucking covid19 until my job trapped me with staying for unemployment only to screw me over with it and now they want me to go back to normal even though they clearly exploited the shit out of me im this close to just walking out and never coming back but i also cant because i do need the money i just dont know how long i can do this anymore because this is fucking with me mentally and i honestly dont know what to do cause theres no jobs out there   1st edit sometimes i wish i did get laid off so id have a reason to leave and get unemployment lol i just feel so alone and beaten down right now,naey4i

1757,The time I got laid off and they tried to come up with a bullshit reason.,i used to work in a warehouse to pick and pack online orders three weeks in i was notified by the boss that i dont have any shifts for the week due to the online shops low sales and it was not enough to pay every employee so i relaxed for the week at the end of the week i did not receive any texts from him to come to work and decided to finally message him only to get laid off for the same reason that their poor sales from their shop were not enough to pay employees it took a fraction of a brain cell to determine that it was a lie because the last time i was working i saw them bring a man in to do a trial period which i now know was to replace me another thing was that their business is thriving during this pandemic so another bullshit reason he said that if there are any changes on his end he will reach out to me months later i decided to ask him but all i got was a literal no   i have since moved on to this new cashier job but cant help but be appalled because it was such an obvious lie and he probably assumed i was stupid too if i am not good enough for the job might as well tell me that rather than try and ghost me then lie assuming i wont catch on,namj1j

1811,"Right-to-work seems a misnomer, more like right-to-terminate. How is this ethical in a system that requires money to survive?",i understand that the intention in these kinds of us right to work laws is to give away the power of those requiring employment to the employer however we are also seeing the downside of employers having that power since they can then legally pay less than is required to live dismal work conditions and overwork where there are rampant strikes and refusal to work for any work that can be automated or done overseas for cheaper the jobs disappear that seems like poor planning on the part of the 1 since people cant buy products amp services  without income and if too many people are not working the system shuts down people get upset and unrest begins this cycle has already repeated multiple times in history and is happening now yet ive seen no meaningful changes proposed besides taking away unemployment to force people to work but if working doesnt actually allow people to pay for basic needs then on some level it makes more sense to just band together with other exploited people and refuse to work am i missing something why not have laws against firing employees for no reason like some other capitalist countries that at least puts off potential unrest and creates a often false but effective feeling of stability in the long run am i missing something  its almost like these policies are misnamed on purpose and also set up to encourage people to revolt a populace of desperate disenfranchised people is dangerous to the ruling classes right,nariw7

1842,my first experience as a meat processing worker,hey guys i started a job at meat processing about 2 days ago and im thinking that the place isnt for me this is my first time ever working on a meat processing plant i have couple of concerns and problems within the job keep in mind that im a full time casual for this job   ampx200b  1 the hours are so long we work for 11 hrs 5am4pm but fridays are from 5am12pm  overtime i havent experienced working on a friday but from what i hear overtime is highly possible  2 the first break goes on for about 15 minutes but the problem is we dont stop until we finished up the batch of animals that was already skinned and on the hooks so we stay there even if the break already started so we start the break late but the problem is that i dont even have 5 mins to sit down and take a breather we only ever eat for 3mins and drink and get back to our post it is the same even with the longest break we have which is supposed to be 30mins but we only get 10mins till we have to get to work i just feel so overworked and not having complete breaks definitely breaks my spirit  3 there were no prior explanationinstructions on what i should be doing sometimes i feel lost  4 they want us to be at work on time but the breaks are never on time  5 when i got my vaccine for the work i got asked straightaway to start but i argued that we arent supposed to lift anything heavy and there could be side effects said the doctor i found out later that we were supposed to wait 15days prior from vaccination to enter any high risk area when i mentioned this to the agency they just ignored my messages i wanted to confirm this with them as i dont think they got me covered when i do get sick   i feel like this job tires me both physically and mentally i do appreciate that i have work but it just feels like were not being treated right and it feels like im being a slave throughout the day   the management feels nonexistent they only contact when they ask why werent you at work or why were you late i dont feel valued as an employee,nand3e

1864,Why work is toxic,i started searching for job 1 year after completing bachelors in computer science i attended the amazon sde interview and i had 8 rounds of interviewafter that i was told i was not up to the mark with sde as i was lacking amazon leadership principles and they gave me support engineer role and they promised me that they would convert me to sde in a year when i joined for workmy manager didnt allow me to attend bootcamp and gave me data analysis and anamoly detection work in the system and i had to design sql queries and data presentations  for customers to tally every month amazon bank balancethus report generation takes like 120 queries to be run and the consolidated one from the results is the reportit takes days to trace back where the problem is when we cant tally  i have been given these repetitive tasks that takes a lot of timeeach query runs for like 30 minand they rejected my request for more resource for fast computation during this pandemic i was in wfh and works like 15 hours a day averageand in the start of the month i had to work sleepless to achieve the goal that they set  my team member lied that he had done the system migration from europe to india and he was taking alot of leaves i found that he been telling lies i could see the reports are generated from data and services located in europe i asked him about this and he lied to me too and started avoiding me i told my manager that it will be a big issueinstead of telling the truth to customer teammy manager asks me to liehis exact words how will the clients know if you dont tell its been bothering me a lot as i was forced to liei was feeling a lot of pressure when i had to talk to customer amazon team manageri told my manager that i am not comfortable at alli was taking leaves to avoid talking to the customer team tooi even told this to my managerafter a month my manager calls me and says that amazon employees should comport the problem and talks leadership principle bsi was blamed for things that they failed to do  my manager lied to them after a month that the system in india is having issue and they have to fix it and starts the migration  after 9 months suddenly i was assigned a coding work to make 2 clii have no experience on amazon systems and i was given 1 week to complete itand the reason my manager gave me was to shift me to sde i had no experience in java i dont know the work environments and there were no documentations for my teami had to nag the sdes for everything meanwhile my manager goes to holidaythis cli work is supposed to be completed in a weekand the customer amazon teams manager is yelling that i am not available to solve their issue tickets and complaining to my manager who is in holiday my manager calls me and shouts at me that i should take ownership and tells the same old amazon leadership principle bs  i was able to complete the cli within the time and after that my manager started shoutong at me for things that i have no control over in team meetings just to put me in blame my maanger told his manager that they completed a goal months back which we didnt actually start just to get high ratings and already published a success story and me and 2 sde in my team had to work weekends and all nighters to complete it  just to make our manager escape from his lies my manager and the customer amazon manager both got promotion for their lies we came to know it from other team  suddenly my manager started adding negative feedback to my career development page that i am not improving and he has been guiding me for long time which is complete bs he started talking to me a month back and had a session of 10 min per week they didnt even let me learn their systems first and expected me to work right away and gives deadlines needed for a  experienced sde  and my manager says that i am not working enough and states that all amazonian work overtime to complete their goals i havent seen my manager work before 11 am and after 6 am in office he  wont even talk with customer team to schedule our teams work also he rejects all my internet bill reimbursement with silly reasons and i stopped applying for them  everyone is getting deskchairs extra montiors and power backup in my team he started shouting in team meetings for everything  i was overworked i woke up one day and was feeling very sick and went to hospital and came back  my manager calls me and asks why didnt i join the meeting and started yelling i told him that i was sick and ill be taking the day off he told me that he dont care about my health and yells the only thing needed is the work to be completed in timei started cryingi dont know what to doits was my first job i was working that day sick after that day i called him and said that i quit he said ok and hang up and not even asked the reason feels like this was his goal after all he didnt even told the team that ill be leaving in a month theres no documentation of the work i doiasked him whether i should create a doc he asked me to do the usual work and in the last dayhe told my team that ill be leaving  and i didnt even attend the farewell video call  its been

1880,I left a Toxic Mess of a Job,ive worked in insurance for 4 years 1 year in auto and 3 in homeowners i had just come off of leaving a boring deadend security job that had left me both unfulfilled and constantly stressed i didnt have enough money to live off of not to mention that security job started requiring more and more frequent hours and my coworkers were growing more and more hostile as the job got worse  i settled into insurance for the first year really feeling valued like my work mattered i was helping people right i swallowed my doubts and did my best but decided to move to a different department hoping to find something a tinge less stressful i found another boring job where i was basically a tasky jockey who would just do whatever the office was asking of me whats more the boredom set in between spikes in stressing out as the very position i was in caused friction with the rest of the department we were responsible for sorting tasks and sending them to people because despite their importance no one had figured out how to dole them out any other way i also struggled to find things to keep myself looking busy and was constantly talked to about not getting enough numbers  so i for a month knuckled down and did my best i applied for a higher position and after some time got it i had to go back through training but i like learning and ive never minded this so i leapt at the opportunity i get on the floor as they say soon after getting out of training and im producing great numbers its stressful i make constant mistakes but i keep it up the first year didnt go amazing was threatened with physical violence a couple of times and if youve ever done insurance adjusting you know that people will lie and misrepresent on a daily basis but i got home at 630 every day and i thought i could handle it until i had enough experience to find another job  my final year in insurance covid hit everyone was sent home we thought its temporary so no one really planned anything out i was still expected to follow strict rules about timing but to make sure that we do they start dropping extra tasks and start watching time not answering calls very carefully by the end of the year i was taking days off because of the stress and dealing with stressinduced stomach problems i had picked up drinking more than i ever had in the past and worse i thought i was weak because youre working from home this is so easy i managed to get on the wrong side of a vengeful agent i made it through by the skin of my teeth and by grinding away and going beyond but im constantly tripped up as more work is directed my way  things started to even out as we go into winter which was when everything slows down for this department i was a part of  springearly summer was when the department was most busy with the lowest amount coming in in the winter  and then during the slow season during a period when we have the least amount of calls and the lowest amount of mail to respond to they called for overtime the excuse was that weve slipped behind that quarter but i started looking at it and i couldnt figure it out we were ahead of every queue i thought it would last a week but i worked overtime on christmas eve and new years eve the whole rest of the month too something was screaming in my head because wed never pulled overtime never   then this year the texas ice storm hit my department didnt even handle those claims but we were expected to answer the calls and pull 60 hour weeksthis lasted three weekswith half our staff moved over specifically to dealing with that i wasnt even given any training for this and people would transfer calls to me i broke down in front of a customer because their house was still flooding and i didnt know what to do i didnt know what to tell them except mitigate and someone would be out eventually the whole reason i had stayed with this job the idea i was helping people and for ten hours a day every other call i was the worthless sack of shit they threw at the problem pants down for 6 days a week   i only made it through that because of my friends i am eternally grateful for every call i made to them to get through that   things went back to normal but i wasnt able to ignore the problems with the job anymore everyday was confrontation everyday was lies everyday was being the bad guy in someones story being a limpwristed burnt out goliath in some davids tale and then at the quarters end they started enforcing overtime threatening if we didnt pick up the pace theyd ratchet back up to 60 hour weeks  ive been unemployed almost a month now didnt have anything else to go to im still feeling the toxicity of that job but everyday im feeling a little better i know i have to go back and work again at some point but man i really pray i never have to adjust another claim   thanks for getting through all this if you did,n9dvi0

I haven't been this happy in years, if ever.",first and foremost im not celebrating the death and misery covid has caused for billions i wish the worldwide near yearlong hiatus for many countries was not due to a virus  nonetheless i think the only way i could leave my miserable job get the mental help needed and regain control in my life was something as drastic as a worldwide freakin pandemic i worked in a job that left me in tears almost daily i started drinking more to numb the pain i stopped trusting people at all my social anxiety was so bad my voice would shake and croak when talking to people i felt trapped id fantasize of how id take my life i googled locations where id do it and how id do it  shortly before my work temporarily closed down in march i told myself next week next week im submitting my 2 weeks notice i calculated how long i could survive off of my savings by a thread before my partner graduated college and we could move in together   i had my letter typed out it was literally just one working day before submitting my notice when work closed down at one point my employers were accepting volunteers it was voluntary but fuck that i thought so i didnt volunteer however at one point volunteering was explicitly stated as voluntary but truly implicitly expected that we return as essential workers this was late may 2020 or so however i received a blessing disguise when hr sent me a lay off notice due to covid but i know the real reason was due to me sending a demand letter for unpaid wages after hr had ignored my multiple emails since january of that year i was committed to filling that wage claim and kept a detailed log  however i was offered severance though meager and thus eligible for unemployment being laid off the stress of depleting my savings was greatly mitigated especially with bonus federal payments throughout the year   during that time i finally got therapy medication and time to actually fucking relax i had been working for 50 hours a week for well over a year i stopped enjoying life i really forgot it all my life was on autopilot my depression was really difficult for my partner to handle too i have never been on unemployment in my life but i had never been this happy in my life   now my last job has fucked me in ways therapy wont completely reverse its greatly limited other career paths i can choose to not make me miserable eg i prefer solo work and made me realize how much i simply do not want to work a 95 the pandemic has given me the time and money needed to pursue something else so i have hope of leaving the rat race and like many many others especially on this sub realize my worth and whats truly  important in this life  tldr the pandemic was the catalyst to being fired but because of it i was eligible for unemployment and got the help needed to treat my terrible depression ive now had the time to pursue something im actually passionate about which will greatly reduce my need to work and contribute to a content worklife balance,n9q3l6
1960,"I'm working up the courage to turn down a ""great opportunity""",ive reached the final stage of a long stressful interview process and im waiting to hear back if i got the job their responses have been really positive and they told me im their number 1 contender so its seeming likely ill get an offer its a fulltime permanent position with health benefits at a big charity organization when i first graduated university it would have been my dream job  but its been nearly six years since i graduated and in that time ive come to realize i am not built for the 95 grind working for charities has helped a bit in terms of motivation im helping to make the world a better place but its still mostly an identical situation in terms of toxic office culture long hours low pay no freedom  my whole life ive dreamed of becoming a published author but ive always been told to pursue a real career ive been told that writing can be my fun hobby but its very unlikely ill ever make any real money from it and its true most writers have a day job so i got my day job and joined the grind  it didnt go very well within three years my mental health plummeted i became extremely depressed and started drinking and smoking weed every night to cope and i stopped writing i didnt write for nearly two years it got so bad that i sought out an addictions counselor i was nearing the end of a fulltime temp office job and extremely miserable when the contract ended my therapist encouraged me not to seek out another traditional fulltime job right away i told her how id stopped writing and she encouraged me to take some writing classes i got a parttime job at a coffee shop and started attending a creative writing certificate program a year passed and i was able to get my substance use under control and start writing a new novel i felt happy again for the first time in so long   since then ive been working parttime contract jobs that make me enough money to get by and give me the freedom to set my own schedule and pursue my actual dream which is writing writing is the only work that has ever given me happiness i know it is unlikely that it will ever make me any real money but im okay with that i would rather be happy and poor than rich and miserable   but the problem is my fiance amp family dont see things this way my fiance understands a little bit better than my family mostly because hes experienced my addiction struggle firsthand but he still thinks i should take this great opportunity he is a truebeliever capitalist workaholic who is very anxious about saving money for our future he really believes that sucking it up and working the grind every single day is the best thing he can do for our future children weve been together 11 years and i love him so much and in every other way we are a great match and hes so supportive but hes having so much trouble understanding why i dont want this great opportunity and my family is much the same   i feel so pressured to take the job i keep hoping for a rejection email part of me thinks that if i get it i should say yes i should at least see how it goes give it a 3 month probation period  maybe it wont be as bad as i think but the other part of me knows that if it wasnt for the pressure from my family  capitalist society i wouldnt have even applied to this job in the first place so maybe i should just turn it down even if no one but me understands why but hopefully you all understand,n9esxr

1993,Free healthcare is not so great how you imagine it,i see lots of people from us wanting to have free healthcare but im not sure if they are realizing those consequences  i live in czech republic we have healthcare that we call free every month i see that government takes my money on healthcare and yeah its good that they wont throw me out if i dont have insurance   but you have no option to not pay it or pay more for better services thanks to this is our healthcare in really bad shape its not like we dont have good universities but good medical workers always run away abroad where they wont make 16 hour shifts for the same as me on customer support  so free healthcare but actually nobody cares yes if id have cancer i would be maybe in best hands we have really great oncologists but if my father has leiden mutation he will get help but not so much   he had twice lung embolism first time nobody knew that he has leiden it was few minutes before hed be dead so they started to medicate him after a month he was back on diet and so on and so on and hes got medicine that he should take til the end of his life otherwise embolism could happen again  this medicine is really expensive and you know what insurance company does to not pay for it whole life after a year they will give you much cheaper and al oat noneffective ones and if you have another embolism you will get more expensive ones  so my father need to have embolism once per year to have proper medication and he couldnt get it to pay for it   luckily he has doctor friend so they figured something out with it but that second embolism was not necessary  its not like people doesnt want to pay more they dont have the option and if youd see our hospitalsive got lice in one   and this is only tip of an iceberg so many awful stories soshould i be grateful when i need to spend another at least 100 dollars per month for fyziotherapy because of scoliosis another 100 for therapy and what about dental its business here and government pays only for something and they wont give you materials that is paid by government they put the most expensive ones to your mouth without telling you then they are surprised that you dont have 1000 dollars in your pocket  think about thatand i hope that its only exception and free healthcare doesnt look like this everywhere i hate capitalism and when i see what capitalism did to healthcare in us im genuinely sad  ps sick leave is benefit here you have government sick leave but you cannot leave your house at all and you will get only 70 of salary so everyones taking vacation when they are sick because with czech wages almost nobody can afford to have lower salary,n9dvul

1995,I realized that the hustle culture kinda starts as a kid where i live.,i live in asia and the culture of studying where i live is kinda bad  like mnay kids have to go to tuition centres for hours after an already tiring school day and some even have many  extracurriculars every week  its bad  probably caused by the fact that at 12 you have to do interviews at many schools and 3 exams from 5th to 6th grade which secondary schools use to judge whether youre accepted or not  also many extra curriculars make you look great on paper so thats a big motivator  exams are often hard that just listening at school isnt enough and you have to go to tuition or youre lagging behind  im fortunate to not have such a jam packed sched but the school im in is also kinda top and the stress of having 16 exams 2 and a half weeks later at 13 might be the reason i was crying in class  no am not making this up  im pretty sure theres kids who have no passions besides scrolling social media because they cant do anything they enjoy every ounce of free time is crammed with study tuition and stuff   all in all the culture of winning at the starting line by parents cramming their kids schedules and doing it cuz other parents are doing so its probably also prepping em for the culture of working overtime without much pay and not having ambitions besides work  kinda depresssing tbh,n9wwpz
1996,I just came to realize how much of my expenses are work-related.,after realizing how i hate working and that retiring early is my biggest career goal i started tracking every expense and adopted a minimalist lifestyle allowing me to live below my means and perhaps retire a bit earlier after doing this for some months i  just came to realize how much of my expenses are workrelated    the biggest one is perhaps renting an apartment in an expensive city since cities with more jobs tend to be much more expensive to rent in rent in my hometown is around 300 compared to my current rent1500 which is the cheapest i could find  the second one is transportation since its nearly impossible to commute every day without a car unless you live in an even more expensive part of the city  since i love cars i would have gotten the car even if i didnt have to work anyway but the mileage gas and maintenance fees really add up when commuting 30 miles a day   the third one perhaps less direct but pretty common is that since i dont have time to enjoy the little things  i tend to spend more on stuff that provide instant gratification or have unrealistic expectations for my weekends resulting in overspending  combine these three especially the first two and it amounts to about 2000 a month extra   while depressing i started to think about the possibilities of moving back to my hometown and do my own thing even if i would earn more in the city the landlords are gonna take it away anyway,n9sciq
1997,Thank you for helping me see,i stopped by this subreddit just to see what was up about a month ago after seeing all the posts it got me to think about my pay and how i havent gotten a raise in close to 2 years worked 3 years total at a corporate retail job after doing some digging i found that not only am i being underpaid to begin with but when i got rehired took a 9 month hiatus after two years for 7 months because i moved they docked me 25c i also found out that the new hire with less experience is making a dollar and a half more than me after voicing my concerns my manager has been avoiding me for 2 weeks by leaving 5 hours early every shift and sticking us with the reduced manpower after all the shit ive done just for him to disrespect me like this this subreddit is 100 right and the only thing i regret is not coming here sooner to see how much ive been getting abused i put in my two weeks today but after the way they treated me i think theyll be lucky if i show up for it tbh   thank you guys you really helped me out and opened my eyes,n9yxdp

1999,"Should I stick it through a horrible job to have a chance at being promoted to a better, less stressful job under the same employer?",earlier i made a post about how im nearing my breaking point well here it is my job has currently gotten even worse weve lost 5 people effectively our customer demand is getting higher as more and more people start coming out of quarantine and summer kicks off  the only thing keeping me here is because 2 days a week i get out of the customerfacing food service hell and i get to work by myself in a one man department that i find very low stress and actually enjoyable   ive been told im next in line to manage that department and have even covered for the current manager for a whole week before  however i have no idea when he is leaving or moving up he seems to be dragging his feet right now its the only route i have upwards because the food service job is a dead end   but i just cant take it anymore today was awful we barely scrape by each day  horribly understaffed with constant customers and no structure from management no lines or signs to help keep customers in check  no one is assigned to do one specific job for the day we just float around hoping that our stuff gets done i cant tell you how many times ive started a task had to drop it for a customer and then when finished had to immediately drop the task again because 5 people showed up out of nowhere all giving me the evil eye because i didnt immediately get on my knees to serve them humans were not meant to be under this much stress for 8 hours   i just dont know what to do i feel like any attempt to have a conversation with my manager will fall on deaf ears because of how understaffed we are   i dont blame anyone for walking out on jobs like this but i really want to have that other job because its   consistent scheduling consistent workload little to no customer interaction 40 hours a week with benefits and pay raise covering for the current manager was the easiest 40 hours of my life but is it worth it to be worked like a dog in the other department until the current manager moves on i just dont know what to do i feel stuck,n9p083

2039,I feel like I discovered a cheat code.,im 27 m i grew up extremely poor in the american south we literally didnt have a front door as a kid i daydreamed about how awesome my life would be living in the big city with a fancy job and 40 dollar haircut and money to blow in my bank account  like most of you all i ever heard was get a good job with benefits work yourself to death for 40 years and move to florida florida probably wont even exist in 40 years  after high school i joined the military to pay for college  when i returned stateside i went to college and ended up with a graduate degree and shortly thereafter moved to california for a great job before i realized what a long con this entire deal is why am i working full time with a 2 hour commute each day to barely afford to pay rent and jam down processed foods that are slowly killing me maybe this situation made my resume look good but fuck a resume if i hate working in general why would i care if this piece of paper makes me attractive to other employers who i dont want to work for i was flabbergasted that having a good job was barely enough to sustain myself and sad for other people in a similar boat most americans work full time and yet most can not afford to come up with 400 dollars for an emergency that is a con  it was a hard pill to shallow that almost every working person is having their labor and time on earth exploited for the benefit of the rich but once you understand that you can change the rules of the game  i created a budget to understand what it was that i needed to sustain a fulfilling life for myself if i could really figure out how much money i needed to make to support the life i wanted i could eliminate a lot of waste along the way even if that meant quitting my job   if i could go a week without any given expense i probably didnt need it and therefore i shouldnt be spending money on it i realized that the only thing i really needed was food water and shelter and novel entertainment which basically means internet connection everything else is just very crafty corporation messaging i think this thinking goes back to when i was a child and living in poverty we didnt have much of anything but i sort of got used to being able to live without much  i also had to figure out how much i could realistically make on the internet in any given month i have several little side hustles that ive picked up over the years i figured that my largest expense was housing and i absolute had to move somewhere more affordable maybe even the town i grow up in since my job iswas wfh i bought a house with 0 down in a rural area for under 100k the mortgage is literally 1500 less than what i was paying in rent in california all of my bills combined average around 800 per month  i quit my job the day after closing and will never work for another employer again   ive been here about a month now and not having to wake up at the crack of dawn to join pointless zoom meetings is honestly just the best feeling i am going to build a chicken coup out back and put up some garden beds and spend the entire summer in my backyard in peace and quiet  the absolute best advice i can give anybody looking to escape the rat race is to buy property somehow cheap and give up the notion that you absolutely have to make millions of dollars to be happy  i will probably crack 30k this year and i have everything i need and more  if you live in the us you can get a usda loan 0 down to buy property in a rural area rural being very subjective depending on where you are and want to live  i plan on becoming aggressive and paying this off within this decade and then life the rest of my life mortgage free so ill have to work even less  i understand that this wont work for everybody but it sure as fuck beats the alternative,n9467x

2170,My Story,ive been a lurker in this sub for some time now and have noticed alot of you are ok with working if its from home so i figured i would share my story with all of you  i own a small tech company of about 100 people and we were like any other company before covid hit we had an office and everyone came to work did there time then went home except i gave the choice of of 4 10 hour days or 5 8 hour days   when covid hit i sent everyone home except for 5 people who run the servers they did what they could at home but had 2 come in each day to check physical things throughout 2020 i met regularly over the phone or through video chat with managers and the coowner and discussed general moral it seemed everyone was generally happier being at home than in the office which looking back at it now i kinda feel like and idiot for not realizing that sooner   3rd quarter of last year the company was doing really well so i brought up an idea with the coowner and i sent out a mass email to the whole company i gave everyone a budget to set up a home office if needed and would reimburse them up to said amount and offered any assistance if needed   as far as my server guys goes i definitely did not forget about them i gave them a choice of either working from home and going in 1 day a week or going into work 4 days and taking a salary increase all 5 of them agreed to take the 4 days and salary increase so to make things easier for them and me we sold the old building and bought a building that was cheaper and closer to all 5 of their houses to make the drive easier to the point where the longest drive is 12 mins   now once a quarter i meet in person with the coowner and all the managers to discuss various things and i told the rest of my employees that as long as projects get done i dont care if they work 1 hour a day or 10   all in all moral is through the roof and i regret not doing this sooner  tldr i made my company almost completely remote and its the best thing to happen to us,n7ia6y

2173,I'm only starting to realise how linked to capitalism everything is,i grew up wanting to be a professor at a university i always got joy from teaching people and readingdoing exploratory work that was the thing that gave me joy  but then i was always told not to because researchers dont actually contribute anything they just make theories that mean nothing the industry is where actual work happens and because of that you get more money too   it only just hit me how fucked up that is the worth of your work is only based on if a billionaire could use your work to buy a private island and sure i could earn 100k a year and be well off but if i put year or more on the project the company uses that to make millions the ceo uses that to give themselves a raise and does an interview about how they are commited to changing the world forbes calls them a revolutionary  are you seriously going to tell me that teaching undergrads to fall in love with engineering is less important than that a high school teacher is just as important as an engineer working for facebook its one thing for there to be a difference in pay but seriously  people want you to believe that elon musk is a revolutionary for making electric cars nope  if he was a revolutionary hed be making those cars affordable right now the only people who can afford a tesla are the people whod normally drive their bmw and on weekends theyd have the hard choice of lambo or tesla he wouldnt mark up those prices and exploit factory workers either hed actually share patents so honda toyota kia and everyone else could make similar cars do you realise how much he could do for sustainability and the environment if he wanted to  if every company had an electric car sold at the same price as petrol cars we could actually protect the fucking environment but instead we get elon musk on snl    they tell us that sex work isnt working cause sex workers are exploited and selling their body ah yes and most underpaid people at call centres are living out their lifes dreams right they arent being exploited or anything not like they are losing sleep every night cause of work hours not like they arent getting abused by their managers and customers  then they say that paying for sex work on of and other sites is simply bruh id rather pay someone directly for her work than pay some big studio like brazzers for shitty porn to let some rich guy get richer    weve been raised to think that value comes from making the people richer than us happy and that anything else is a waste weve been conditioned to accept that someone working for a company is more valuable than a professor just cause of capitalism do you really think that everything a company does is groundbreaking google has had products no one ever used cause they were so shit theyve had a bunch of things they tried to invent that didnt even get released there are so many companies that just rehash what others did before dont act like they  contributed to society they created a new product  do you think everyone at microsoft is doing worthwhile work far from it  weve normalised the fact that bill gates warren buffet elon musk and everyone else could jerk off 247 and still make millions of dollars every month just through underpaying people most people cant refuse to work over time cause they are scared theyd lose their jobs over it,n86k50

2185,These are the words you have been looking for,1 the panopticon  in 1791 english philosopher and social reformer jeremy bentham proposed a new kind of prison the prison was round with cells on the outer walls in the center was a tower manned by one or more guards from the tower guards had a direct view into each cell prisoners had no privacy everything they did was visible   the view into the tower however was blocked so while the guards could see each inmate the inmates could never see the guards this was the first surveillance state a population controlled not by force but by an asymmetric vision the genius of the system was that the prisoners never knew when they were being surveilled and thus had to assume they were always being watched they would therefore surveil themselves censoring their own behavior to conform to the will of the invisible eye in the central tower each prisoner became complicit in their own subjugation   bentham called his prison the panopticon greek for all seeing he described it as a new mode of power of mind over mind in essence the panopticon replaced the social control exercised by an allseeing allpowerful god with an allseeing and allpowerful state apparatus for the prisoners the state had become the new god   2 the electronic panopticon  this was the mode of social control george orwell predicted in his book 1984 in that book the technology is electronic but the principles remain the same the hero winston smith and the citizens of his country oceania are controlled by an asymmetric vision in every room in every apartment theres a socalled telescreen that delivers state propaganda but whose real function is as a surveillance camera that can never be turned off each telescreen weaponizes the gaze of state power  the ministry of truth   oceania itself has become a surveillance state a prison and the citizens assume they are always being surveilled as with the prisoners the citizens of oceania become complicit in their own subjugation censoring their behavior to conform to the will of the allseeing and allpowerful state big brother is watching you   orwell died in 1950 fearing his vision of a totalitarian state order might still come to pass yet today only a handful of societies would qualify as orwellian surveillance states north korea urban china and of course disneyland orwells vision of the panopticon state that exercised control over its population through surveillance and fear never took route in the liberal west orwells fears it seems were unfounded   but perhaps orwells vision was not wrong but merely nave perhaps the panopticon state was superseded by a newer more efficient and more subtle mode of power and social control   3 the real 1984  in the book 1984 a weaponized gaze is directed from a powerful and invisible center to a powerless and visible periphery in the year 1984 however everything was reversed noone had a surveillance camera in their home everyone however had a television which they watched on average sixhours a day   in the year 1984 the center was still powerful and the periphery powerless  but the center is visible and the periphery invisible those in power are visible and omnipresent those on the periphery are unseen and anonymous the population is controlled through the images from the center of wealth youth beauty and sex the basis of control is not fear but desire this is not the hard totalitarianism of surveillance and fear but a soft totalitarianism of consumerism advertising and the mass production of desire this is the new mode of power of mind over mind the reverse panopticon but how does this power work and what ideology does it use to justify itself if advertising is the propaganda of consumerism what does advertising tell us about the ideology it serves   4 the ideology of consumerism  every ideology creates a narrative of our lives a threeact story of problem struggle and reward in christianity the problem is we are enslaved by sin the struggle is faith and good works the reward is heaven for marx we are enslaved by class exploitation the struggle is revolution and the reward is a classless society for freud we are enslaved by neurotic unhappiness the struggle is therapy and the reward as freud himself said is ordinary human misery   in each narrative humans are posited to be flawed and therefore unfree it is only through struggle of faith of revolution of therapy that we free ourselves from our flaws and find fulfillment so what is the narrative of consumerism what is the flaw we must overcome to find fulfillment   the story consumerism tells us is that we are by nature desiring beings the problem is that we desire goods and services the struggle is to work and make money and the reward if we succeed is to become rich and to thereby fulfill our desires the source of our discontents consumerism tells us is not sin or exploitation or neurosis but desire and our endless thirst for its fulfillment   5 the cult of the winner  the standard critique of consumerism tells us that our desires are not natural but rather fabricated by the machinery of consumerism itself thus consumerism does not manufacture products in order to satisfy desires rather its fundamental task is to manufacture desire in order to sell products   but not all desires are equal big cars have a higher profit margin than small cars new clothes have a higher profit margin than used clothes processed foods have a higher profit margin than raw foods so by the logic of consumerism goods that are new or big or processed are more desirable than the small or recycled or raw this is the standard critique of consumerism we are all familiar with that advertising is capitalist propaganda designed to induce us to buy stuff we dont need with money we dont have to impress people we dont know what thorstein veblen in 1925 called conspicuous consumptionhttpswwwgutenbergorgebooks833   yet veblen went a step further for him consumption was not about desire that was a fig leaf to disguise its true nature rather conspicuous consumption was about class hierarchy and social status we do not buy a rolex because it tells time more accurately we do not buy a ferrari to drive to work more quickly rather we buy these things to advertise our place within a hierarchy of status and respectability   as veblen observed the more useful and utilitarian a good or service was the lower its perceived status was thus the lower status conferred on farming plumbing and sanitation conversely the more unnecessary a good or service the more useless and conspicuously wasteful the higher its status thus the high status conferred on diamonds yachts works of art movie stars and postgraduate education consumerism was less about the fulfillment of desire than the pursuit of status through the purchase and display of conspicuously useless and wasteful goods and services to veblen this was the underlying ideology of consumerism that life is a competition for status for respect for the esteem of others and the way we win status the measure of our lives and our worth as human beings is through our ability to purchase and consume as conspicuously and wastefully as possible these values of conspicuous and wasteful consumption add up to a vision of life that might be termed the cult of the winner   the winner owns a big expensive house he drives a big expensive car everything the winner owns is new big expensive and therefore as conspicuously wasteful as possible anyone who falls short of such a life implicitly is a loser   6 the ultimate winner  today the hierarchies of status have evolved there is still the ethos of materialist consumption mansions sports cars yachts but this is increasingly the province of russian oligarchs and the nouveau riche today there is also an ethos of nonmaterialist consumption the elite travel to distant and obscure destinations attend silent meditation retreats earn doctorate degrees they visit museums attend symphonies read the latest bestseller and otherwise engage in the consumption of cultural capital while avoiding the vulgar materialism of the gilded age they nevertheless advertise their status through the profligate expenditure of disposable time and nonproductive effort yoga resorts culinary tours gap years semesters abroad graduate degrees these are the new status markers   none of these things however can make one a real winner to be a real winner today it is no longer enough to be well traveled well read well connected it is no longer enough to be merely rich the ultimate reward in christianity is heaven the ultimate reward in marxism is a classless society what then is the ultimate reward in consumerism here we borrow an insight from slavog zizekhttpsduckduckgocomqslavogzizekampthampiaweb the ultimate want zizek tells us it to be wanted the ultimate desire is to be desired   so the ultimate achievement in consumerism is to become wanted and desired to turn oneself into a product to become famous to be a celebrity within a consumer society this successful celebrity achieves a kind of secular transcendence a holy status by turning him or herself into a brand an object something that can be bought or sold to succeed in consumerism to win at being a winner it is no longer enough to be rich one must also become famous and the more attention you attract the more clicks you generate the higher the ratings the bigger the winner you are   7 the new big brother  which brings us unavoidably to the figure of donald trump the makers of this have no interest in litigating trumps politics trump himself seems to have no real interest in politics per say what he cares about is ratings and reviews and crowd size trump inherited his wealth 400 million from his father but being rich wasnt enough he pursued the spotlight of celebrity and became a household name an image a brand after six bankruptcies he left real estate for showbiz  to be on tv once a week then left showbiz for politics  to be on tv every day he transformed himself from an outer borough rich kid to the inescapable center of the worlds attention economy in doing so he made himself into the ultimate winner   trump exercises power not through surveillance but through the dominance of public attention as such trump represents the ultimate reversal of the panopticon and the final inversion of orwells vision   today big brother is no longer watching us today we are all watching big brother   my whole life ive been greedy greedy greedy greedy ive trapped all the money i can get im so greedy  donald trump  trump is too easily dismissed as his critiques as a vulgar clown the reality tv star who turned reality itself into a show and made himself the star but he may also be seen as a cautionary tale the apotheosis of the cult of the winner trumps entire life is an exercise in branding he puts his name on everything he acquires hotels casinos planes wives children all beautiful wasteful and useless and offers them up for public display   were going to win so much you may even get tired of winning donald trump    his life a mobius loop of television appearances and television consumption of tweets and retweeting suggests a hall of mirror narcissism that is the reductio ad absurdum of our consumerism culture   but this hall of mirrors narcissism this feedback loop of performance and review is no longer the province of the rich and famous today the culture of narcissism is for everyone today everyone can be a winner   8 everyones a winner  in the year 1984 power worked on a broadcast model  stories and images were produced at the center by the rich and famous the rest of us sat on the periphery and watched to be visible was to be a winner to be anonymous was not as a mode of social control the reverse panopticon worked mesmerized by images of wealth and beauty seized by the desire for status and social distinction the population was rendered docile by the hamster wheel of consumerism working longer and longer hours to buy more and more stuff debt and obesity sky rocketed as did corporate profits ceo pay and income inequality   the soft totalitarianism of consumerism proved to be more comprehensive and effective in controlling the population than the hard totalitarianism that orwell feared by 1990  mcdonalds was in red square   thirty years later however the old broadcast model is obsolete today everyone has a camera and a tv station in their pocket today everyone can generate their own images tell their own stories but rather than tell new stories we often retell the old one casting ourselves in the lead role we curate images of ourselves not as we are but as we wish to be seen as winners like trump our lives become a performance  an exercise in selfbranding for an invisible and allseeing audience rather than escape the reverse panopticon we have internalized it and we monitor our ratings as obsessively as trump does how many clicks how many likes how many followers   once the big eye watching over us belonged to god in 1984 the big eye belonged to the state today it is the audience invisible and omnipresent punishing and rewarding judgemental and wrathful allseeing and allpowerful that has become the new god   as exhibitionists we have all become winston smith as voyeurs we have all become big brother   the genius of the old panopticon was that prisoners presumed they were under constant surveillance and so modified their behavior even if nobody was watching today we live in a state of selfsurveillance and modify our behavior accordingly acting out the role of the winner even if no one is watching as such we have become complicit in our own subjugation   9 welcome to the machine  for most of western history the classic virtues were unchanging hard work thrift humility charity mercy chasteness generosity everything your mother taught you   as max weber pointed out  early capitalism derived much of its underlying ethos from the protestant work ethic to be rich was proof of ones hard work and thrift respectability was a sign of chasteness and humility status was derived from charity fellowship generosity in 1889 andrew carnegie wrote surplus wealth is a sacred trust which its possessor is bound to administer in his lifetime for the good of the community he concluded the man who dies rich dies disgraced   today social darwinism has replaced christianity as the underlying ethos of capitalism consumerism has turned these values on their heads instead of restraint it celebrates gluttony instead of modesty  lust instead of generosity  greed instead of humility  pride instead of kindness  envy instead of mercy  wrath instead of hard work  sloth with few exceptions consumerism promotes and celebrates values that were once seen as the path to ruin and despair and so we become ever more anxious stressed distracted depressed overweight sleep deprived in debt dissatisfied so whos to blame for this mess who are the bad guys in this story  at this point the standard critique tends to find an easy villain in the rich and powerful  wall street madison avenue hollywood but this ignores a more complicated truth it is a truism today that fame can be a prison in winning fame one loses anonymity privacy the freedom to move through the world unmolested by the gaze of the camera but the cult of the winner may also be a mental prison for those at the top who like trump spend their lives chasing after the applause of the crowd and the phantoms of status as such the selfbranded celebrity is merely the most obvious victim of the reverse panopticon state as any supermarket tabloid will attest   who then benefits from the system of overconsumption narcissism and selfsurveillance and how does one escape  10 the matrix  remember those movies where aliens invade the earth take over the government and plunder the environment humans are brainwashed and cast into servitude working ceaselessly to enrich their alien overlords in these movies theres often a class of pod people who collaborate with the aliens and enjoy a modicum of privilege and theres a handful of freedom fighters  a scrappy band of misfits who live outside the system and fight back against the soulless aliens and their bootlicking human collaborators   today this is not a movie today this is your life today the aliens who have plundered the environment and taken over the government are called corporations you may not have declared war on them but they have declared on you every second of every day the machine works to make you addicted to sugar fat alcohol caffeine nicotine gasoline debt political outrage and social media   every second of every day the machine seeks to take your money your time to capture your attention and your data commodify them and sell them to advertisers every second of every day the machine works to make you consume as wastefully and as conspicuously as possible food medication goods and services leisure to do so the machine wants you to become envious greedy gluttonous lustful wrathful prideful and slothful a class of pod people collaborate with these aliens and enjoy a modicum of privilege but in the end they are just as indentured as everyone else no one is more servile to the corporation than the ceo   who then are the freedom fighters and how does one fight back  11 the revolution will not be televised  the genius of the soft totalitarian state is that its voluntary we are complicit in our own subjugation but that means we also have the freedom to opt out if you own a lot of stuff big expensive stuff maybe youre not a winner maybe youre a cog in the machine on the other hand if you only own what you need and your stuff is inexpensive or recycled maybe youre not a loser maybe youre a freedom fighter and the freedom youre fighting for is your own   so maybe an apple is better than a bag of chips a glass of water is better than a big gulp a book is better than a tv a secondhand store is cooler than a boutique an old bike is better than a new ferrari a cheap rent is better than an expensive mortgage   in her career dorothea lange took thousands of photographs of migrant workers sharecroppers prisoners in doing so she changed the way america saw itself her camera facing outwards was a tool of art in her lifetime she posed for a single selfportrait in 2015 kim kardashian published a 450page book of selfies it was titled selfish her camera facing inwards was a narcissistic mirror   kardashian like trump is a celebrity a brand a product as a winner in the economy of attention and addict in the culture of narcissism she has made herself prisoner both internally and externally of the reverse panopticon state   like winston smith her life is dominated by the camera and by the invisible audience on the other side of the lens  in the book 1984 power is exercised through fear coercion surveillance being watched by those at the top today power is exercised through the mass production of desire weaponized status competition and the hegemony of the spectator society of watching those at the top   you can watch corporate sports or play sport yourself you can watch corporate musicians or make your own music you can watch a corporate talk show or enjoy a conversation you can take the blue pill of consumerism and spend the rest of your life staring at a screen passive docile a cog in the machine or you can live your life   in 1984 winston smith didnt have a choice the telescreen in his apartment could never be turned off you have a screen in your house on your desk in your hand you are giving it your attention right now  but you can turn it off   12 you must change your life  every ideology presents itself as the natural order of things christianity and marxism are monotheisms that explain the world and give us values and ideals that govern our lives today consumerism has become its own monotheism so invisible and ubiquitous its like the water we swim in what is the point of life if not to be a winner to what should we aspire if not to be rich and famous here the standard critique returns us to the classic virtues kindness charity thrift humility mercy generosity to be a good person like your mother taught you  the makers of this have nothing against the classic virtues or against your mother but perhaps there is something else we can aspire to better than being a winner or a good person perhaps we may aspire to become ourselves  perhaps the monotheism of consumerism can be replaced not be another monotheism but by a kind of ideological polytheism   let us return to the narrative of problem struggle reward for a buddhist the problem is suffering the struggle is meditation the reward is tranquillity and perhaps enlightenment for the scholar the problem is ignorance the struggle is study and the reward is knowledge and perhaps even wisdom for the activist the problem is injustice the struggle is activism and the reward is social progress  perhaps even justice   in each case the self begins as raw and unformed and is transformed through a regime of daily practice the transformation of the self from uncultivated to cultivated from ordinary to extraordinary is a struggle of daily and deliberate practice of exertion and exhaustion of trial and error of selfchallenge and selfovercoming nietzsche called it the struggle to become what one is  the cultivation of the self requires exertion risk perseverance discipline exhaustion and the inevitability of disappointment falling short failure   it requires that you challenge yourself that you become active   this is what consumerism seeks to thwart what consumerism wants above all is to make us passive to make us alienated from our lives from our labor from our friends and family and loved ones and neighbors to make us laze at home clicking endless links while watching other people talk and cook and play their sports and make their music and have their sex and live their lives to make us spectators cogs in the machine consumers   we all have one life one chance regardless of age to become whomever we might be and just as we struggle to free ourselves from sin from exploitation from our own neurosis we may also struggle to free ourselves from the reverse panopticon of consumerism and the cult of the winner we may therefore win the freedom to choose our own path to pursue our own ideals  the christian gives up everything to become a saint the buddhist gives up everything for enlightenment the radical gives up everything to change the world the surfer lives for the wave the climber risks everything for the climb  no one can tell you who you are or what you may become  your life is your life  and you are the author of your self  become who you are,n8cggj

2244,I think I wanna stop working.,so a couple weeks back i made a rather cringey post about a dude i work with and me feeling like hes slowly becoming a drone i deleted the post cause the first reply i got was kind of rude and i kind of regretted saying as much as i did but anyways after that post things with the guy improved a bit so i convinced myself  that maybe i just was imagining it i even talked to some people who were mutual friends or acquaintances with him and like they didnt think that was happening   but i saw it and i pretty much heard it today this older manager was like you gotta stop being a young adult and be an adult  which i think in the right context is perhaps a good sentiment but in this particular context it was like encouraging him to cut ties with his friends  and stop saying or doing immature rebellious things and like stop being lenient with people he was in charge of    which all in all its the just broader idea of all that that bothered me and i was like i dont wanna become like him and i dont wanna see him become that   and well idk it got me thinking more on how just even the nice moments feel so dulled because i work now and like even the nice stuff at work they dont feel so nice like every nice thing said to me feels like manipulation at work even if maybe it isnt at least not always   and i realized that im in school right now for computer science which is a great field and like right now im working a shitty low end job with some great people  or well maybe i even deluded myself into thinking they were great but idk i realized working got me in this stuck mindset and i started performing poor in college  and becoming more like the people i worked with and like work was becoming more of my life than my time off was  like it got so bad to s point where to some degree i crave work like ill just think about work or people at work on my days off and id be chastising myself for my lack of work ethic or ducking up something or saying the wrong thing or whatever   and idk i think maybe i should still stick with college but like  i realized that even if i bounce back from college and get my degree id still just be working a job where im im following someone elses orders and being undermined maybe to a lesser extent or in less shitty way or for different reasons but itd probably happen and even if it doesnt that workforce mindset will continue to take hold of me and i dont want it read that like jon snow from season 8 of got sorry humor but anyways i feel like my individuality has been stifled a bit and i worry that ill never gain what i lost back   this was a long ass post but just how do i become person who doesnt work or at least a person who doesnt work for a corporation i have a desire to work for myself im not sure if thats supported here honestly though i just want a way to get money to live and buy the things i enjoy without slowly becoming a conforming drone,n8ak18

2298,Something interesting to think about.,something i found interesting to think about is if you have any family that lives away from you in a city a few hours away or in general just isnt that far from you but still enough to take some time to prepare a visit  lets say you visit these important family in your life twice every year and lets say theyre 65 and will live to an average of 85 to 90 years that means youre only going to this family only 40 to 60 times before they pass away is that number okay for you and whats preventing you from visiting them is it work is it time taken up from work is it stresses of missing days due to work is it because youre only able to see them on your days off from work are you okay only seeing them this little amount of times  i dont know how normal this is for others but its just something i read i for one dont have any family or a job so this doesnt apply to me but i wonder how much it impacts any of you people,n6r4vr

2384,Blockchain the key to less work?,so much hype in the crypto world right now with dogecoin all over the meme world and bitcoin and ethereum getting mainstream coverage but if you look deeper at blockchain as a technology and the advancement it represents toward personal agency privacy and transparency i think there are a lot of points that align with what i consider less work or anti work this isnt necessarily an original take on the subject but a few areas where there is alignment are below  1 integrity of network and distribution of power currently all monetary transactions have to go through some sort of central database that clears a transaction there is usually a fee to do so and if theres not as they say if youre not paying for it your the product blockchain enables you to transact directly with another person no middle man no fee anonymously so no data leak etc part of antiwork is cutting out the government and corporations wherever possible they arent incentivized to improve our working environments because there is no monetary reason for them to do so this represents a place where they can be cut out  2 security cryptography is a must there is no opting out this affords confidentiality and anonymity in a transparent and authentic way blockchain is public so there is no hiding malfeasance and therefore no social incentive to harm this includes institutions whats yours is yours antiwork to me means cutting out the flab and excess i sign a contract to perform whatever job and you pay me what we agreed to the rest is code  3 privacy for similar reasons to above your data should be private to you my job doesnt need to know all the details of my life to determine whether or not im fit for a job they certainly dont need to know my age gender and skin color the black box of your personal identity can be owned by you in blockchain and it should ring true that you are only required to share what actually qualifies you for that job  4 ownership rights music art media  copyright etc blockchain acts as a public registry of everything confidentially artists can make the money they deserve without a middle man and the rights to that work come with it this is the concept of the nft many people on this sub appear to be artists or the like this allows you to transfer ownership via smart contracts  5 inclusion this creates a system of distributed capitalism where people are not left out there are too many barriers to entry for entrepreneurs and even owning a bank account in some parts of the country even as money has moved online the fees associated with transacting using apps etc keeps people out you can interact on blockchain with no drivers license or birth certificate documents required to participate and are difficult or impossible to obtain in some areas  i think blockchain is the future and on top of everything ive just listed above it favors automation and less work  if this interests you i recommend you read blockchain revolution by tapscott ive summarized their ideas above but theyre eloquence is more attractive than mine thanks for coming to my ted talk,n6q4we

2389,To the outside I look like a failure but really I refuse to work in unsafe conditions,i quit a lot of jobs because i value my health to everyone around me they just think i quit when things get hard i mean yes i am not perfect but the real reason i quit is because if something doesnt check out logically from a health perspective then fuck you end of story  unfortunately thats like every fucking job   worked in a cabinet factory  the air is toxic and its intensely fucking loud   worked climbing cell towers  omg i freaking love climbing so much i love it i love it i love it i love it but its unsafe as fuuuuuck engineers never heard of her also cell phone monopolies would rather their workers literally die than shut down the tower during repairs and shock horror lose cell service in order to oh i dont know not expose people to the highest possible emf just silly things like that you cant see emf so its okay  worked commercial shrimping  tried to rehabilitate herring that had got caught in the bottom dragging net as by catch their swim bladders break because they are caught in the net and depressurized from the ascent im literally crying right now and the stereotype of most esp white fishers being disgustingly sexist has some weight behind it nothing like a 60 year old man who has a daughter the same age as you on some stupid fucking power trip oh and you get to destroy the earth bonus sexism and ecocide faves  worked at a spa during the pandemic  quit because pandemic like seriously what the fuck i needed money but im not trying to die they had steam rooms open hot tubs saunas nothing like cramming 20 people recently flown into a tourist town into a hot steamy room to share each others viruses with each other  what joy of course im the bad guy and the paranoid one lol ok no youre right  wearing masks in the hot tub will solve everything and yes i should be the only one wearing super extra ppe because im so concerned about it mhmm makes sense   carpentry  im good at that i wish i could just enjoy being good at something but if you saw through wood all day and i mean like literally being on a chop saw all day you saw through all kinds of treated with formaldehyde and shit pressboards so you get to breathe that in all day i wore a respirator which is a paranoid move but really its a hey look the air is full of tiny chemical particles move oh and theres wildfires raging beside us but were building fucking condos instead of caring about the forest burning because we need money to live   electrician  i quit because the union is in bed with the government obviously and perpetrating genocide by building a massive hydro dam im not here for it they care more about money than reality and they loooooove green washing lng   dude every job every job is fucked and thats not even 1 of what other people in the world are going through its just that ive always considered myself such a failure for not sticking with things well why the fuck would you stick with something like that makes no sense so if anyone out there struggles with the same thing like yeah i know we all need to take personal responsibility for our actions but i for one know that youre not crazy  maybe youre too legit to quit whats really important to you instead were not crazy for creating change even if it starts super small or for being different from a lot of people who have been temporarily lulled into complacency were all complacent in our own ways anyway constant vigilance  suddenly it makes sense why there are so many people suffering with diseases do most people work yeah its work related disease for the most part that and eating chemical laden foods poisoned water from work fun times no one is crazy for being against that i know im not alone in feeling like a failure we all just need to stop feeling like failures and dont even think of blaming yourself for not figuring everything out and being perfect sooner no one is perfect,n70w29
2390,"Ever since I entered the work force, I have had 162 jobs.",no joke 162 jobs total for ten years and to this day my anxiety was so fucking bad that i would start a job do it for a week two or three if i was really lucky and quit because i simply couldnt handle the stress and the pressure i never considered myself to be disabled in any capacity just that the environment of a job was so overstimulating to me  everyone so fake so critical of everything that i did almost waiting for me to make an error and then when i finally did blatantly making fun of me to my face and outcasting me from the group socially this was and still is my living hell for ten years  the environment of a job for some people no matter what kind of job it is is bullshit being forced to interact with fake ass people who want nothing but to see you fail is so fascinating to me because over the years i could also tell that most of them hated working and were as miserable as i was   it is said so many times on this sub but its a truth that must be reiterated  humanity is not designed to work in and will never thrive in a capitalist economy we are doomed to a miserable life of wage slavery in america i hate to get on here and just vent but to those who have any sort of anxiety disorder who are being thrusted into this fuck ass job marketplace because they have no choice and suffer everyday from it just know that youre not the only one knowing that doesnt change shit but its true nonetheless  this is why people become alcoholics get addicted to drugs develop any sort of selfdestructive behaviors and in many cases eventually end up killing themselves its because they are left option less and cant live in a lie anymore   our government in america has utterly failed its citizens in every conceivable way and they dont give a fuck about you always remember that,n6gtwc

2485,"Fun Question, Do you Hammock Sleep Indoors? I sold my bed and found deep satisfaction.",really curious are there are others that see the bed as a consumerist mechanism  apologies for any feeling offended i would not normally suggest removing an essential comfort item in your life i ask as i saved a remarkable amount of money by only sleeping in a hammock i also have now realized a list of benefits you could enjoy should you see the cultural conditioning of beds as optional  1 beds in contrast to hammocks increase material costs to your personal comfort thus generating more demand costs for comfort on an often unconscious necessary component to a safe and stable life  2 both my wife and i use hammocks for 6 years now full time with many friends using a similar sleeping arrangement from sheer practical value  3 i now own no sheets comforters and linens in in general are unnecessary instead i own a quality lined sleeping bag that ive never needed to replace while being easy to wash and travel with a small travel pillow is all i need now  4 no bed frame to clean around or under with hooks mounted on my walls 13ft apart we sleep in parallel low enough to the ground to simply step over my partner in the middle of the night for a bathroom run  5 when hammocks are not hanging you have nearly an empty room to enjoy various activities as yoga is a favoured one but it can also leave room for a desk or more storage if needed too  6 im tall 65 and my work is tough on my back for 3 years before this we had assumed i was doing something wrong or some chronic movement was damaging and inflaming my back i was so wrong i should have eaten a boot for just how incorrect i was after the first week of finding my hang not groove as per the normal colloquial all my back pain went away no drugs no chiropractor no special stretch just gone in the coming weeks where i push myself or do something stupid like lifting a 120lb box on uneven ground and do truly pull a muscle i lay down and the pain is consistently 10 of the previous evening  7 nsfw the intercourse is the absolute best by a significant margin with hammocks  now looking back and understanding minimalism with my entire lifestyle this square in billions of rooms around the globe is nothing more than another consumerist good meant to waste your effort acquiring i say stop aiming for one and go get a cloth fabric here in canada a company imports hand made hammocks from south america sourced from smaller communities in need of the income and the originator of many of the designs and weaves they use locally for 80 cad i have never made a more comfortable choice of relaxing,n5t0ri

2495,I just have no motivation by Thursday,im exhausted i dont even dislike my job that much but by the end of the week i am usually beat its the kind of thing where my boss says i dont micromanage but really all that means is that he gives blanket statements and expects you to understand we get 15 minutes a day to talk him i was lucky this week he scheduled a meeting with a couple of us to talk about a project but he spent more than half the time on the phone with others and responding on teams so now he gave us this project without any of the necessary tools to actually work on the project without going into too much detail we dont have fundamental programs on our computer but are expected to use syntax we have never used or been trained on to solve the problem i know that a boss cant plan every step of the way but it feels like most projects are like this told to accomplish a task with no real knowledge or understanding of the circumstance    this pretty much envokes too moods from me intense anxiety when i cant solve something and not giving a fuck once i settle down and start thinking the problem is bigger than me theres a nice middle ground every once every 12 weeks where i feel like i know whats expected of me and it logically makes sense but other than that just not feeling great i also have to interact with higher management and that always worries me although much more of a minor issue i dont make crazy money but i make enough 38k annual idk i feel like the stuff that is expected of me with no training is just a bit too much my boss always acts like hes open to listening but like i said impossible to actually ever talk to him    i kind of just want to quit and say fuck it but i know i cant really do that at this moment also feel like all it jobs are going to be like this kind of working in every department just trying to figure shit out looking for a way out seems like a daunting task but maybe needs some thought i cant keep doing this every week,n6blig

2532,How I’ve dealt with a job putting off promised raises for two years.,first of all throwaway for obvious reasons   so i work for a local business and started in may of 2019 the initial help wanted ad i applied to promised 13 starting wage i got the interview and was offered the job but for 10 when i asked about the 13 the owner told me and this should have been a red flag he lost most his staff and was hiring a bunch of people at once and after 90 days when he figured out what roles people would fall into hed be giving raises based on that as well as additional raises every year of employment  well i didnt get that 90 day raise till about 150 days and it still didnt put me to 13 but hey i like the work so i figured id stick around and see what a year brought since i consistently took on new tasks and did extra work amp was raised to believe bosses would notice that sort of thing lol   year one comes to a close and oh no were holding off raises for a bit because covid just hit and the business is iffy i shouldnt have accepted this excuse but i did but with the caveat that i would be working one less day a week and a shorter schedule 4 days a week 2830 hours my two year is in about two weeks and ive still not gotten that first year raise even though i handle shipping and see business is 100 good enough theyve consistently asked when i could work full time again every time ive said just as soon as we talk about those multiple raises and i dont hear it again for weeks its a battle of wills i want money and they want my labor but unfortunately for them i value my free time more than any cash amount   as much as the low wages suck its honestly real nice to have so much free time to enjoy my hobbies and have time with my daughter and my overhead in bills is covered by freelancer web dev work im sure one day theyll put their foot down and demand i go back to full time and in return theyll get a two hour notice cheers yall,n5zrde

2535,So tired of being underpaid,ive been working a job teaching for a whole school year now the first job i was offered in a year after my last let me go just before covid im a teacher a janitor and general handyman making 10 an hour when ive explained that this just isnt enough after being so grateful to just have a job again they said they couldnt give me a raise until next year and couldnt afford to give me more hours ive was barely scraping 700 a month before finding a second job  my second job a contract teaching position pays 15 an hour but i dont get 15 hours a week even while the workplace environment is better and i have more room to experiment and more money to use for materials i dont have enough hours   im good at what i do im an art teacher for both of my jobs but i can also woodwork fabricate and enjoy going the extra mile for my students ive asked for raises and been denied and looked for better jobs but 15 is where it caps around here   i dont hate work i enjoy seeing something come from nothing im struggling though and ive even applied for jobs out of state knowing they would take me away from everyone in my life whatever the reason im not getting bites or finding that job it really doesnt matter inside anymore i just want to quit and marry myself to my work again  no more 10 hour days no more screaming kids and students that already look beaten to death by 14 and no more wishing i could get a raise   that seems so impossible knowing what is coming but finding a better job or just better pay seems impossible too i want to quit the lower paying job and go back to doing what i love for me and not because i desperately need paid,n66v7j

2551,The story of me bailing in the middle job interview,just a little context i already have a well paying job that i enjoy and in my off time i do a lot of mountain biking i noticed one day that my city employs trail stewards spoke to one of them and it seemed like a pretty decent way to earn some cash on the side they do essentially the same thing i already do for fun with some extra digital paperwork for reporting things like trail maintenance its part time and at the time i also lived walking distance from the largest trail in the city so i figured i might as well get paid if all they want me to do outside my routine is carry a phone and occasionally open an app to fill out a form  fast forward to the interview im immediately amused that the person interviewing looks like she has never seen a day of exercise in her life much less ride a bike but i suppose that doesnt really matter heres where they started losing me 1 im not allowed to pick what trail im assigned to ok not the biggest deal in the world i enjoy and am familiar with all the trails they patrol 2 i have to attend a training class on how to use their iphone app again not a big deal at the time i was working for apple and found it funny 3 i have to attend a bike safety class that includes intentionally falling tucking and rolling off a bikeok not that crazy ive fallen off my bike plenty of times without seeing it coming 4 i have to have 4 days of open availability but i only get 12 hours scheduled and you dont get to set preferencesthats when i have up trying to rationalize it and just said alright i dont think we have to talk about this anymore you guys take it easy and walked out  i just dont understand who that is meant for its clearly not meant to be someones side gig unless they are working another part time job that allows for only 3 days of availability then its 12 hours i kinda wonder what would happen if someone gets legit hurt during the safety course because they likely dont have health coverage anywhere else at that point i deduced that its meant for retirees or the most desperate people in the world now when i see trail stewards out there i ask if anything has changed for the better over the last 5 years and naturally it hasnt i feel bad for each one of them  tldr went to an interview to get paid for something i more or less already do daily discovered the absolutely ridiculous work requirements dipped,n5o88t

2575,I actually really like working in a corporate environment,because of how fake everything is the jobs the culture a lot of the companies goals  most of the day consists of lying to make it seem like you actually did something or passing the blame if something went wrong it sucks if the blame is passed in your direction but then you can pass it on to someone else if youre lucky  i actually got my most prestigious job by lying i lied on my resume my portfolio and in my job interview i got to the job and really had no idea what i was doing but i pretended i did and actually got some onthejob learning experience that set me up down the line for other jobs on that note im pretty sure i blew a job opportunity recently because i was truthful i had a little bit of experience in the position they needed when i shouldve said it was a piece of cake and just learned on the job through doing it or examining other people  the other thing is that no one actually knows what anyone else in the company does for a job in my case i was a designer so my job was one where i had to create a product and have something physical for people to see as the result of my labor but no one knew what my job entailed that computer stuff looks so hard i could never do that so i could easily say a project would take 4 hours and then knock it out in 30 minutes   on my end i had no idea what anyone did most people just seemed to write emails avoid phone calls and attend meetings where nothing of note was accomplished they all had job titles but it was just a jumble of words that formed a sentence but had no real world meaning its also kind of interesting that these types of jobs pay more but entail the least amount of work  and the sad truth is a lot of employees dont even know what their companies do theyre just a group of people inside a building that does a set of tasks and somehow money comes in and they get paid this is especially true if a company doesnt specifically produce a product  in the end working in a corporate environment becomes like a game to see how much you can bullshit and still succeed and you know most everyone else thinks its bullshit but its also a game to get together and see who can out bullshit the others,n4pvc0

2645,The boy who cried wolf,the rhetoric where i live right now is that the reaction to covid and the subsequent unemployment stimulus has dried up the market for low skill labor places that have been open since before i was born are making massive changes to cope with the lessened workforce the now hiring signs have gone up more in the past year than the past 15 years i realize that doesnt account for inflation but i still think thats pretty damn significant these places have been min wage with some pepper for my entire life and they suddenly spiked up to 1112 an hour more than that the now hiring signs actually represent an opening and not just a constant fishing expedition to ensure a backlog of candidates to fill a spot asap with all that said i honestly think these places are being genuine about being desperately understaffed   but hold on theyve been saying theyre understaffed for my entire life thats been the goto explanation for responsibility creep unreasonable hours dishonest expectations and most of the bullshit that comes with any job cutting safety corners short staffed not honoring breaks short staffed skeleton crews have been the norm and have stayed the norm despite godknows how many people asking about jobs a day ive heard that nearly daily from every job ive ever had that we need more people but cant get them and now that thats actually true these same places that played these fucking games with us are crying whole ass tears that their permanent skeleton crew bluff got called and now theyre on a desperation crew   covid has been the best thing thats ever happened to me i say that with a lot of bitterness because it took a deadly pandemic to force anyone to do the bare fucking minimal to help the people who have been struggling for as long as ive been on this earth   i say we let them squirm theyve done it to us for decades its about time they know what it feels like,n51wez

2707,Guys I might quit tomorrow...,apologies for how long this is  my job used to be pretty good but in the past year and a half it has gotten a lot worse office monkey type stuff first they switched my very good boss with a new boss who sucks they switched their groups for no good reason probably some higher up thought it was a good idea to make it look like they were doing something i dont know they also do random reorgs for no reason about once a year or two but i digress  with old boss i had a good rapport she was supportive respectful of my time and treated me like a valued trusted employee well all that is gone  anyway so they have had my group working at home for over a year now due to covid occasionally we have to go into the office though the telecommuting rules are draconian and we had to fill out and sign a huge long agreement i think it ran to 28 pages of policies and stuff we had to fill out including photos andor floor plan of our work area and so forth it also states that they can come surprise visit us to inspect our setup etc which i am super uncomfortable with even if my place was tidy spoiler it is not anyway so during the year they have not done that but they made us come in for a meeting the other week and made us update and sign our telecommuting agreements again and told us that they were definitely going to be visiting our homes now first time with advance notice and after that no notice just whenever they want to spring it on us and no indication of how often this can happen  so there is that which may be reason enough to quit idk i feel like it kind of is but also the job has gotten worse itself  more bullshit assigning me more work than i have time for and recently having to train someone to answer customer emails who does not have good professionallevel writing skills like how am i supposed to teach this person grammar rules at this point in her career oof a recipe for badness   and then the schedule shenanigans making me work some partialstaff holidays without advanced notice in previous years they gave us the lists of people who have to work for each of them for the whole year in advance so you could you know plan your off time or get a coworker to switch holidays with you or work in  your place i sent a request to my boss to find out this list for the rest of the year and her response was basically no were not going to give that to you great  and my motivation has just been gone for months now i havent been completing everything being a bad worker i know i just took a week of vacation and checked my email because i was worried the notice that theyd be inspecting my place would have been during the week i was off i didnt see that but my boss sent a meeting invite for just me on tuesday that just says discussion at hq without further elaboration or explanation great so i figure written up at best performance improvement plan or fired so im thinking of just quitting tomorrow monday to just get it over with and not have a termination on my record  there is another thing  recently i have been thinking of quitting anyway and moving back to another state to be near my family my mom is pretty old and shes having increasingly severe health issues and she gave up driving several months ago so i could help her with that and i may just use that as my excuse with nothing further when i explain why im quitting seems a benign reason that they cant really argue with but i dont know how they would react i will see i do have a significant financial cushion that would last until i could find another job and i just could really use a big change in my life im sick of this city and state ive lived here half my life and my reasons for staying are ending child moving out friend moved away etc ive been at this job for over 13 years and i am just so sick of the place  at any rate if i decide not to quit monday and go to the meeting tuesday in the office i think i am gonna bring all of my work equipment and keep it in my car in case i need to turn it in if im firedquit or bring it on monday if i tell my boss im quitting then  sorry this is so long just want to explain how it is and some of the bullshit i have to deal with i told friends  one of my doctors about the whole suprise home visit requirement thing and my doc said thats illegal they cant do that and i told him they made us sign the agreement saying they could and theyve been doing it to the customer service reps for years now my friends and family think its unacceptable too but anyway yeah about to pull the ripcord maybe you cant fire me i quit,n3mygc

2714,The Job Search is Only Fueling The Flames.,had multiple jobs schedule interviews with me over the last few weeks i always get told how impressive my resume is how versatile my skillset isetc and yet this is how my last few job offers have gone  interviewed for assistant manager told during interview that position was already filled internally but i can work for 4 bucks an hour less for part time 2 towns over i asked why i was even brought in if the position was filled was told well we were very impressed by your resume and wanted to meet face to face and work something out i walked out visibly frustrated   interviewed and hired for manager at a tanning salon they call me to schedule my first day and they want me to do my training an hour away for 6 weeks and training wage is 3 bucks an hour less and is only 20 hours per week i inform them that i simply cannot afford that commute for what amounted to almost 60 less pay than i was expecting they say i have no other choice and so i resigned   interviewed for assistant manager at a different business interview went great and i was scheduled to start 2 days later  training day starts and immediately derails the store manager not who i interviewed with seems to be upset that i was hired at all and attempted to get me to agree to being paid minimum wage while being classified as entry level with the manager saying if you can prove you belong here maybe ill promote you  reported him to the person who interviewed me area manager and was told i would immediately be transfered to a different store for my original position its been over 5 days unpaid and still nothing   applied and set interview for a tire store wage and hours were right up my alley was told during interview that my position is not one they hire externally but would put me on a training regiment for 6 months and then would be considered for the job again the training wages were minimum wage   applied for a job that said they were looking for hospitalityrestaurantbartender experience but the job description didnt really explain at all what the job was just reaffirmed what experience they wanted got a call to set up an interview and learned this was for a door to door sales position for a solar company   and then this mornings interview   once again applied for a managerial position store seemed super eager to get me interviewed and on boarded fast and the hiring manager seemed to really like me i get to my second interview this morning and am waiting outside their office for almost 30 minutes waiting to be interviewed only to be told sorry we filled this position over the weekend and have no other openings right now  all of this has cost me almost 200 bucks in transportation lyft busses when lyft is too expensive and endless hours of frustration   is this really the best system we have is this really what thousands of years of societal change and evolution has led to this is pain and i wish i could tear it all at the seams and burn it,n42jfx

2727,The real problem is that not everybody is needed in the workforce anymore,forget experience credentials even shit like cultural fits and personality your grandfather didnt need to spam his resume to 100 jobs just to get a single interview he just walked across the road maybe across another street and boom he found another job   what happened employers needed workers much more so than today before technology it was harder to automate jobs away before globalization you couldnt send jobs to asia before harvard mbas and a corporate obsession with manufacturing metrics like efficiency and lean sigma four workers werent laid off with one worker having to do hisher work plus the four employees who were laid off just to cut costs   politicians wont do anything about it you can occupy wall street main street sesame street its not gonna change they dont care   but with such limited jobs and so many employees the real problem is we dont need everyone in the workforce our capitalistic system assumes everyone who is able bodied can find a full time job and can pay for their expenses those that cant are considered lazy defective or failures   what will our leaders do probably nothing until its already too late and enough people are living in tents and cause the system to change,n2z3vi

2738,Let’s discuss LinkedIn,sorry for the rant in advance  there exists a degree of insincerity in any social media platform each serves as a means to showcase different aspects of yourself facebook is what you may reveal to your family instagram is what you may reveal to your friends and linkedin is what you may reveal to potential employers i find linkedin as a platform particular unsettling because it acts as the link between you and your means for survival unless you are a fully devoted anarcho primitivist employment serves as your only means for survival pre modern conditions fostered the instincts that make it so there are no lengths to which we will not go to access the means of survival so although the system has changed from risking your life for the hunt into dressing up your linkedin page the instinct persists the result is a culture obsessed with subservience to a provider we are biologically wired to continually pursue our means for survival and when that became synonymous with employment we created a culture where professionalism is paramount language is sanitized and real human expression is squandered to me this is most easily observed on linkedin not an ounce of my humanity is represented on my linkedin page its purpose is to seduce an employer into providing me with the means to life i put serious effort into this page because it is my only way of satisfying my instinct to survive its an artificial knockoff of myself contorted into a soulless servant thats fits perfectly into the desires of some corporate hack linkedin offers a great view into our theatrical fucked up reality,n3rq0u
2739,I'm in desperate need of help..,hey guys  being in an for me incredibly hard spot right now im desperately seeking for help at any matter  sorry for my bad english in advance im not a natural speaker and i have a massive headache from crying  ampx200b  let me start with my story when i was 20 after my a levels in germany i decided to start to study to become a teacher while that approach failed miserably due to my lack of self motivation etc i then faced a big problem  ampx200b  what to do with my life  ampx200b  after a long pause and parttime working at a local cinema i still didnt have any clue of what to do i found a promising traineeship that i wanted to start  i started at a location near my hometown and soon was willing to become an eventmanager there  after i invested 2 years of training they decided to keep me because my boss became a parent and they needed a replacement for a year  since ive found a girlfriend there and a few nice friends even a new bestie this was the first time ever i was willing to put in all the effort i had in order to be able to stay there permanently  but guess what   after the year they fired me and left me heartbroken eventhough i offered them my soul and everything i got for a bullshit salary  just to be able to stay  this was seriously a company and an office in general where i wanted to stay for the rest of my life every day i got home lucky and even more lucky when i saw the face of my beautiful girlfriend which has moved together with me last december  since then everything fell apart  i started working for a lasertag startup that was rigged in every way i started as a vize manager and were forced to observe the coworkers and torture them with weird and uneccesary work it killed me so i quit due to a new job offer that i got from a friend  i started a job at a local symphony orchestra which in the beginning was actually not that great but not bad either it then got better after a period of time i got a decent friend there as well and there was no boss blaming me for everything because no one had a clue of what i was actually doing they just let me do what i wanted to do and gave me my monthly salary  i was about 70 happy because i managed to get a friend of mine into the company as well  making my daily routine miles better  ampx200b  but still i was seeking for the last 30 of happiness that i had in the event location mentioned earlier  so i quit there after a year and a half in order to find something better and more challenging i had the feeling that somewhere out there had to be a thing thatd make me happy  i started at a carcompany which turned out to be the fucking hell they were selling cars and they fished me telling me that i would be one of the managers soon it was a big ass company and my brother worked there he told me that all of it was fine and in the end it was hellonearthhttpshellonearth  i needed to quit after 2 weeks in because i was mobbed and absolutely not accepted by any of my co workers who  how it turned out  only tried to survive there as well  in the meantime corona appeared and gave me a hard time to find something new eventhough i have been incredibly lucky and found a new job at a marketing agency where my first day was just today  ampx200b  and how was it     well guess  ampx200b  i had to cry on my car drive back driving home being the disgrace of the day to my girlfriend which to the current moment is the only reason i still want to be alive killed me  its hard for her as well it destroys her inside that i just seemingly cant be happy about anything at all  ampx200b  what would you guys suggest me im turning 27 this year and i feel like everyone else is just so much more strict when it comes to working attitude and stuff like that everyone seems to even like overtime and i hate myself for even entering a new challenge   ampx200b  i have no clue what i should do whenever i searched for a new job it turned out to be worse  or at least it turned out not to be better at all it feels like im stagnating already and im a fucking young adult without any obvious interests had a lot of brainstormings with my parents and girl what i should do and where my interests are but for me it seems there is just nothing that can fit  ampx200b  all the best and thank you for reading  ampx200b  thrillorion,n42m7b

2811,I was fired from a job that drove me insane in less than 6 months,story time last year i was laid off from a corporate job that was really boring but i actually enjoyed it because my coworkers and boss were supportive covid of course tanked the company and they had to let people go i had never been laid off or fired before but for some reason i wasnt eligible for unemployment so i was in a panic and took the first job offered to me it was more blue collar than i was used to but it was in my field and paid just about the same so i went with it  let me tell you this  if you think corporate culture is too sanitary and pc youll be begging for it when youre in a less structured situation run by a highstrung cokehead thats exactly what happened with me sick of pointless meetings try working in a place where theres almost no clear communication from up high and youll either be yelled at for doing what he said with limited information or taking the lead and trying to solve a problem on your own cringing at endless corporate training how about not being trained at all even though he knows you have no experience in this type of field and then he flips out on you for not knowing anything and then refusing to train you every situation was damned if you do damned if you dont  the first month was actually pretty decent but then something changed in my boss i was eventually tasked with doing almost everything at the business on top of my regular work without being trained for any of it because of this inexperience and the fact that i was drowning in work id make mistakes but id never hear from him if i did a good job id only hear from him if i screwed up and boy did i hear from him in fact the only way i knew a project was going smoothly is if he didnt say anything never heard a positive word about my work after that first month his way of motivating me telling me im overpaid and costing him money because of my wages and the mistakes i was making due to lack of proper leadership  at the 2 month mark i began having sleep issues ive always been able to get a good 68 hours sleep no matter how stressed i was but this job put me on such edge that i would either fall asleep and then be woken up 2 hours later because of a work dream and not be able to fall back to sleep or just not sleep at all the entire night even though i was absolutely exhausted the latter happened at least twice a week so i was a zombie but the anxiety of the possibility of facing my bosss wrath made me on high alert and run on pure adrenaline  i actually drank less coffee than i had in years because i was naturally wired  i had no energy to do anything i couldnt exercise and i was eating like shit work was so hectic that i hadnt had a lunch break in months unless you count inhaling a protein bar at my desk while he stepped out for 2 seconds lunch my commute was 90 minutes one way and i racked up an insane amount of miles on my new leased car 2000 a month id get home and just be grumpy and mean to my girlfriend and everyone i encountered my job was one where i had to physically be there in able to perform it but still i couldnt stop thinking about work once i got home my christmas and new years were ruined because the days leading up to those holidays was like a pressure cooker the highlight being when my boss called a 16yearold kid who worked with us an idiot to his face  one monday morning i woke up after not having slept the night before dreading coming back to work after the weekend i was physically shaking i went to go walk my dog with my girlfriend and i just broke down crying prior to this i had only cried a handful of times in the past decade always relating to the death of a loved one my girlfriend told me to take the day off i texted my boss to tell him i wasnt coming in first time i had ever take off work in 6 months and he was none too pleased  the next day i drove 90 minutes to work only to find my desk was cleared my boss walks out stops me and hands me my paycheck he tells me that last week a project i was a part of had gotten screwed up something which couldve been easily avoided had there been a chain of communication or quality control he said i was costing him too much and he had to let me go i kept things civil but i walked out and never looked back  ive been unemployed for a few months now and im making just about as much on unemployment as i did while employed my head was so fucked up from just 6 months at this job that i needed a good month to decompress and get a reality check yes my perspective of myself was so skewed from this den of negativity that i thought i was useless or retarded and would never amount to anything again i had to reconnect with some friends and family and even past coworkers to be assured that i wasnt a complete fuckup  i got some advice from a former coworker when it came to job searching  be picky taking whatever job without doing the proper research lead me to this fiasco so i decided to put myself out there as i am and see who comes rather than me changing myself to please a potential employer its even better if i can get some referrals from people who work at places or know someone who does as that will help me gauge what its like there   this whole situation lead me to this subreddit the job market was tough for millennials quality of life since the 2000s but covid has just kicked the bullshit up a notch you now have to give it 300 instead of 200 since everyones jobs are in jeopardy and chances are a bunch of people in your team were laid off so you now have to take on their work without a raise or if your company made you take a pay cut do it for even less money than usual every job ive found on my search pays less than what i was making before and they expect more work i remember my parents working 8 hours and coming home and watching tv and relaxing but something tells me itll be the norm for my peers free time to be spent either doing stuff for work or going back to school or having a side hustle to make ends meet and even when you do have free time your phone could always ring with a workrelated call because our pocket computers make it expected that we can be reached at any time  rant over,n3zx4g

2827,Our New World Order.,dont be scared my friends this isnt a call for total slavery and mass suffering this is a call for the exact opposite freedom and peace something you and i have never seen and the approach we are going to have to take in order to reach this new state of living is much like the discovery of the atom we need to imagine it first   words and ideas can change the world they have changed the world the problem is we follow the words and ideas that come from truly evil people and forces   we always seem to be following people these days we never come up with anything on our own i kinda get it were comfortable in our ticky tacky little boxes not having to make any decisions any important ones atleast atleast we get to decide between coke and pepsi i guess except every time i choose coke they bring me some flouridated liquid that burns the fuck out of my nose but then again maybe thats a good thing better to have a lowered iq than it is to be depopulated with the fentynal spiced cocaine that has taken out a few of my good friends and countless other so called useless eaters   this is is how weve come to this point though we are no longer makers and doers in society we are followers useless eaters they say we dont choose how this world is ran whatsoever some think they do when their puppet is selected atleast but if their puppet isnt selected they are more than happy to admit that the system is rigged funny how that works eh   therein lies the problem though our trust in these fictional television characters to save us from what we are told is ourselves but really we need saving from them kinda   theydeserving no capitalization certaintly do manufacture all of our problems such as war and poverty but we are collectively just as much at fault for allowing it and this is where a positive change starts by not allowing it it gets tricky here though as we do not have the means to go to war with them i mean sure we could assasinate one of their puppets but they already have another one cloned to take its place and no matter how sneaky you are youll never get close to the castles wall so what in gods name are we to do   tricky as it may be its rather simple just stop inserting coins into their machine quit playing their game   simple but i understand extremely hard for most we have to give up our false sense of security and well have to give up our modern comforts but only for awhile   i believe the answer is forming our own communities within theirs our new world order inside of their not so new world order   basically we need to come together those like us may seem spread out but i gaurentee you are not the only one that despises this system in your city or town i think a lot of people are just waiting for something better once its built they will flock   so the evolutionnot revolution because history has shown us they always end where they started starts with little hippy like communes built all over the world communities where we grow fish and hunt our own food make our own clothes make our own music and most importantly raise proper human beings that both understand and care about this world we need to raise a true leader so that when we finally do hit critical mass we can take over everything and start really fixing this world   none of this will require giving up our families or even our jobs we do this all in our own locals the only difference is we are working and living together ofcourse if youre like me youll happily give up your job though to spend the days contributing to something worth while   im not talking about living in shacks either there is lots of land out there we can build whatever we want we can light it up with solar water wheels and whatever else there is so long as it doesnt resemble a garbage dump we need to be one with nature   dont forget we the decent human beings have more of a right to this land than monarchs and corporations such as nestle   this is our world lets take it back and show it some fucking love my friends peace and love to you all,n3gc89

2891,The story of a quitter,i was heavily depressed yet my parents were so obsessed with the idea of me getting a degree that they didnt want me to quit  ampx200b  i quit college i found a job people higher in the hierarchy shouted all the time colleagues were all into jealousy backstabbing and ridiculing eachother  i quit  i found a job with a great job description it seemed kinda like a technical position tons of problem solving you know great i send my cv i get the job i get into the office its a call center the place was so filled with people that they seemed like a jar of sardines being an inbound call center i had to constantly answer phone calls and since im heavily introverted i was going insane  i quit  then i tried a degree as a medical technician knowing the interaction with people were supposed to be minimal and impersonal doctors tried to exploit the shit out of the students and were super disrespectful insulting and shouting was the norm and the other students thought it was ok doctors instulted and shouted at them and they just continued kissing their asses they also were jealous backstabbers who ridiculed every mistake and reported everything to the bosses  i quit  then i tried working at an optician since it was the only job i could find i have to say the job was a little bit less stressful but such a socially oriented job causes great stress to me in the long term and my supervisor was the most bitter girl ive ever known she would explain things one time very fast and if i messed up she would get totally mad and shout but she would also shout if i asked for further explanations one day when i was having lunch and she didnt know i was already there i heard her telling another colleague that i forgot everything she explained just because that day i made a mistake  i quit  at that point i was absolutely burned out but pressure from my parents led me to get back to the first degree i tried since i did all the exams of the first years and they were still valid for the university despite having quit being burned out i gave no exams i got into therapy i quit therapy i did some exams  i quit therapy because according to me the therapist was just eager to find disorders in my head in order to give me lithium im no way bipolar for sure i changed lifestyle very often but it was just in an attempt to find a way to become normal and just work but i cant fucking fit in i feel like on the job market everyones a sociopath and the environment is so cruel  two years have passed since the burnout im 25 years old if a miracle happens and do everything perfectly ill get a bachelor degree when im 26 but most likely ill get the degree at 27 its even more likely ill never get the degree  right now i kinda got to the point in which i dont want to attempt to go back to the job market hierarchy drives people insane and i dont want to get into hell again my mind wanders from place to place sometimes im satisfied not giving a fuck about corporate life enjoying a walk in nature or a cup of tea sometimes i feel like i messed up am a failure and realize im in a shameful position for all the people and i feel the eyes on me and want to die  i dont give a fuck about richness fame girls i just want to have a small house in a tiny village were i can have walks in nature on my own,n2f3cg
