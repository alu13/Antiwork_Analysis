0,How to convince people that not working or reducing working time/giving more rights is better?,"I was discussing the topic with my mom. She brought up a friend that went to NZ and complained about the Maori people having a lot of rights and ""advantages"" over whites/normal working people there, because she had met one guy that was from that origin and according to her ""didn't do anything"". I understand her frustration, like what happens in other places when people of colour, LGBT, etc. get advantages in some fields and this only creates more resentment among the working class. I told her that it would be better if everyone could enjoy those benefits like ""having everything provided by the State"" and enjoying life, but she responded with the classic ""but this Maori guy is a slacker"" (este tipo es un vago, in Spanish), so, apparently, when people get everything they end up doing nothing.

It's so frustrating, like, she hates the neoliberal Government, she hates her working conditions, she hates that everything costs more... but she cannot comprehend that this system of work is doomed and that we can already be free from it, and that we would want to be free from it. When I debate her it's just that ""I haven't had the experience yet"" and she discredits me because I'm not wasting my life slaving to make somebody else richer than he or she will ever need to be. The working class sentiment is strong, the pride in wasting your life is strong, and then you end up sustaining this system of exploitation and constant grinding in order to get the basic necessities of life. If you do not you seem to be a slacker who ""does nothing"". I'm sure that Maori guy enjoys many things and is a lot more interesting than a lot of wage-slaves, but I can't get my mother or other people for the matter to understand that ""doing something"" and ""working"" aren't the same thing and should not be the same thing.",False,a00p3d,Krasnyy_yug,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/a00p3d/how_to_convince_people_that_not_working_or/,6,1

2,"Even when I work for a small business with a nice and polite owner who’s liberal and I get payed relatively well, I still cannot stand my job.","In essence, there is no job that I’ll get in my life that I won’t end up hating. What capitalist society doesn’t realize is that anyone who’s anyone who works a specific task eight hours a day for five days a week for literal years or even sometimes decades and even until the day that they croak is gonna end up hating it. I work as a part time dishwasher at a very successful small breakfast and lunch time restaurant that has a lot of liberal fellow employees but at the same time, there’s always some other stupid shit that makes the experience next to unbearable. I’m going on 23 years old and there’s this 17 year old high school shit pot that barks orders at me like he’s my superior and constantly tells me how to do my job and thinks he’s smarter and bette than me because he’s been there longer than I have. I *know* for a fucking fact that I’m smarter than he is. He’s a Trump supporting republican gun nut and that alone makes him intellectually inferior to me. I know that sounds harsh but if you saw the way he treats me you’d feel the same way too. On top of this I have to get up early in the morning every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday to work my ass off for the fucking dreadfully busy holiday season that I oh so much loath with all of my heart and soul. This is by and large the busiest time of year and every day is gonna be backbreaking work-till-you-drop labor until about January 1st. I hate mornings and the fact that I wake up tired and strung out from a night of heavy drinking (which makes my current job even remotely tolerable at this point in my life) makes the work that much harder and harder to bare. The only days I get off are Sunday’s where I only get about 13 or 14 hours to myself before I’m forced to go back to work and Tuesday’s and Thursday’s where I have to go to class at my college so I can get a full time job that will be even more stressful and take even more and more energy out of my until I die of a heart attack or cancer at the age of like 55. 

God fuck this work and money obsessed society. I am antinatalist so even if I am ever lucky to land in a loving relationship (which is in and of itself a laughable concept) I will either never compromise and have a kid or fuck up and she’ll dump me because humans are selfish and like to spread the vestigial and terminal illness and tumor to life on this once beautiful planet known as earth like a fucking virus. 

I never asked for work and I shouldn’t have to do it to make a living. I’d love to see the first work free society arise in my lifetime but that’s an unlikely thing to happen.

11,You don't exist,"I have a friend I grew up with. We were always sometimes close sometimes not but lately it's farther in between. Hadn't talked to him in months. Within the first 2 sentences of reconnecting he says ""so you got a job yet?"" Which dominates the rest of the conversation. I recently rejoined Facebook so I was browsing his page (why idk, Facebook makes me paranoid and hate people for these exact reasons, people expose to much of themselves) and it's full of quotes and messages about bettering himself blah blah blah moving on up in the world and leaving being people who aren't doing the same and all that type of rhetoric and some of them are worded oddly specific. Now part of the reason we hadn't talked is because I took a break from everybody for a few months because I do that sometimes but this friend in particular is overly concerned about the job shit and literally won't talk to you if you don't have one. Like what is that about? Before this recent unemployment I had been at the same company for 2 years, granted said friend started surpassing me and doing better than me in his own endeavors but who really cares? Good for him. A lot of it was by happenstance, not necessarily because he is a harder worker, cuz I definitely worked my ass of at my job, but in his mind it probably is due to that (even though at the time he explained to me the happenstance but ok)....... But what does this matter anyway? If I'm not working I'm not a living breathing person?

13,Work is combat,"I came across this quote in Emily St John Mandel's book Station Eleven. She didn't clarify exactly what she meant by this and the book itself has nothing to do with antiwork sentiments, but I thought it was appropriate somehow.

I'd like to hear explanations any of you might have but my thought process was something like this:

Like combat, you are in a situation where you are compelled to perform tasks where the alternative is literal death (don't fight in combat -&gt; get killed by the enemy, don't work to get money -&gt; die of starvation in the streets)

Also no one *wants* to engage in combat (except maybe psychopaths), they just get in there, do the deed and get out. In my opinion work should be the same way: get in there, get your money and get out without attaching yourself to the job itself too much.

Allied soldiers engaging in combat (coworkers) shouldn't be thought of as friends but as emotionless cogs in a machine working towards a specific goal.

Although I guess depending on your worldview you could interpret this differently as a pro-work view in that it's your ""duty"" to fight (work) and sacrifice yourself for your country (company), but I thought it was an interesting thought experiment and it may help others to view work in this way.",False,9y8dtf,timeisart,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/9y8dtf/work_is_combat/,0,1

19,"Having to constantly be ""productive"" is bullshit.","Example:

I work as a web developer. My employers don't know their ass from their elbow and they infuriate the hell outta me. Anyway, I produce and deliver a website that, after some tweaking, testing and revising, perfectly meets the needs of our customers. It does everything they need and the customers are happy. Everything is ticking over nicely and it doesn't need to be fiddled with.

But of course, that can't happen because if I'm not working on it, i'm idle and not producing and my company believe they are wasting money paying me to do nothing. Of course, having delivered a service that people actually like and can use, I am actually generating engagement and income for the company. But they're too dumb to see that.

So of course, they have to come up with stuff for me to do and they foist busywork on me - ""we should change that, tweak this, move that there, style this differently"" etc etc. I protest that none of this is needed, but am ignored. Gradually the website gets crappier and crappier. Customers complain, stop using it and go elsewhere. But the company is happy because I'm producing for them. I'm a busy and ""productive"" employee. Nevermind the fact that your busywork has resulted in alienating and driving away our customers.

A lot of the time we don't need to be busy, its just fucking things up for everyone. There are so many instances where being ""productive"" is not adding any value for customers or employers.

21,How Money Makes You Live," 

Why can't work start at 10 today? Sorry Br4inShredder20, we need you here by 7am. Otherwise you wouldn't make us enough money. You can have a break at 11 and go home at 4. On top of that we will give you two whole days off at the end of the week. You make us lots of money and we will give you a very small portion back in return. You can have a cute little house. Have a nice family. Be tied down for life. Do we have a deal Mr. Br4inShredder20? i don't really have a choice.

It’s not natural to wake up to an alarm every morning. My dog sleeps whenever he pleases. That’s acting natural. I would love to just sleep and eat whenever I want. Do whatever I please. Nope gotta head in to work. Force down this breakfast and have some coffee just to cope. Hey but at least I can come home and consume. Maybe I will take the family out to eat Saturday night.

Why do we keep doing this? It must be because we are trained to from birth. What do you want to be when you grow up? How will you make money? What meaningless role will you fill? I wish we could do whatever we want whenever we wanted. Like summer was as a kid. Act on impulse and have little to hold you back. Nope gotta head into work.

&gt; • Intrinsic value - the value that something has in itself  
&gt;  
&gt; • Instrumental value - the value that something has because it helps us to get or achieve some other thing.  

I feel like most people mistake work as having intrinsic value when in actuality it's instrumental. We work because it gives us money which allows us to survive.  Perhaps for some people it gives them a sense of satisfaction which would add to this instrumental value. A politician boasts about increasing employment because of it makes them look good, again instrumental value. Mistaking work's instrumental value for intrinsic leads to bullshit jobs which are seen as valuable despite the fact that they are ultimately pointless.

For nearly ten years I work in financial department of multinational corporation. Work was always stressful, tight deadlines, calls from manager in the evening, working from home in the evening, no vacation, you name it. During financial crisis there have been major layoffs and I got additional work from two redundant employees. Work became too much for me and I think I have burnt out in the last year. I can't take it anymore. On top of all that I have got daily nearly six hour commute, sometimes even more. I live for the job only. I want to quit so badly, but I have got kids to take care of. My wife works and we could live on her salary since we are minimalists and do not need much. I am a little bit scared of what will in-laws say since they are more traditional and expect for the man to be a breadwinner and that they could suggest her to leave me because I do not support family. 

I do not even have energy to prepare for job interviews and I am happy if I manage to go out of the bad. I sleep in most of the weekends, holidays and afternoons. It could happen I come home from work, fall asleep and then next morning wake up and go back to work. 

I really can't take this anymore and I think life should not be like this. I am sorry to type such a long post.

42,"I'm so tired of people thinking that having no identity outside of a job and ""being an adult"" are one in the same.","Seriously, who came up with this idea? That you're only an ""adult"" when you're mindlessly wage-slaving under people who don't give a 🐭's ass about you. And the more of your time you hand over to these people, the more of an ""adult"" you are.

 I understand that moving society forward via jobs is important, but for goodness sake, can people realize that that's not  what defines adults and gives them their real value. The process sucks; it's draining, corrupt, and disingenuous. Nobody would do these sorts of jobs (as they are right now) without receiving compensation, which makes it clear that people don't take real ""pride"" in these jobs, and that at the end of the day it's mainly about the paycheck. So I will never understand why society tries so desperately to base someone's whole identity around it. 

In my opinion, being an adult is all about your age + your mental capabilities/intelligence. Those are the only two things should define somebody as a proper ""adult"". Like, when I see people who think they're so high &amp; mighty for literally selling their lives away, talk down to others for not doing the same and prioritizing enjoyment/fun/happiness, as if they're children who don't have life figured out.

50,How to un-alienate myself? How to be free from the mental toll of capitalism?,"I have no idea if this is the correct place to ask this, but I'm genuinely concerned about my mental health. I'm not in a bad spot as of yet, but all the pressure to perform, to meet standards (which I always seem to meet, but not without its toll on my psyche) and to be able to survive on a living wage (via having a job) is killing me right now.

I want to be in the moment, being able to go through life without worrying if I fail something or don't get into some job; I want to be patient, calm, relaxed. I can't. I get totally stressed about my academic performance, about getting the job, about having to move to another country (Spain) to see if there's a future for me there. I hate the whole idea of insecurity and having no prospects for the long term, no guarantee that I will be able to have a house, or have a decent quality of life for the rest of my time on this planet. I hate that all my long time goals (like writing a novel, reading books, traveling) will have to be suspended until further notice, that I don't have the energy or the right mental state to focus on life instead of focusing too much on my performance.

I hate capitalism, the pressure to succeed, to be good, to get the job or good grades just to get the right to survive and be treated like a human being. The anxiety... the constant anxiety really is becoming unbearable. I hate the modern world of clocks, time, tasks, constant commuting, zombification, alienation, numbers, numbers, numbers in the bank account. How does anybody get to have a ""normal life"" under this system? I mean having a family, hobbies, keeping up with friends (I rarely go out with them, I just can't when college starts) and being relaxed and open about life.

How do you deal with stuff? How do you remain calm? How do you don't break under the societal pressure and insecurities? Maybe I'm talking to no one, and everyone has these moments... But I want to remain positive and think that a better state of mind is possible, and that it is also possible to go do things without all the anxiety.

67,They don't give a fuck about us. This is why I'm anti-work.,"I'm going to warn you all, I'm very angry right now so I apologize in advance if there's excess vulgarity. 

So, I'm vehemently anti-jobs and as a result of that I made a vow to myself that I would never talk about the place I work at or even waste any time thinking about it, but for just this one time I need to vent to you all. I work with people who have special needs/who are mentally ill (keep in mind, when I say I'm anti-work I don't mean I'm against the people themselves or helping them in general. It's the opposite actually, I'm against the whole job package), and a few weeks ago there was a guy who snuck into the kitchen and grabbed a knife out of the knife drawer (the drawer should ALWAYS BE FUCKING LOCKED but people don't fucking give a shit until something actually happens) and threatened to kill people. The cops were called and they apprehended him.  

So, they sent this ATTEMPTED MURDERER to the hospital and he stayed there for about a week, then they returned him to the place I work at as if nothing happened. Evil motherfuckers man. Fucking unbelievable. So, NOW this fucking place wants to crack down on locking up knives right? Well, I just found something out today. Some residents here are actually allowed to OWN their own fucking scissors. And when I brought this up to this excuse of a staff, they told me ""(Resident's name) is just allowed to have those. Those are (place I work at's name) rules."" Just so you fellow antiworkers know, this resident isn't the same one that pulled a knife on staff, but he's just as bad tbh. He has frequent outbursts over EXTREMELY trivial matters, threatens people, breaks things, BUT YOU FUCKING ALLOW HIM TO OWN SCISSORS? ARE YOU FUCKING JOKING? You want to crack down on knives, but allow people to own scissors and just leave them lying about. Also, tell me what the FUCK will stop that ATTEMPTED MURDERER from grabbing those scissors and going on a stabbing spree? 

These jobs do not give a FUCK about us. I'm honestly risking my life by being here right now. If I get stabbed, the ""higher ups"" at this company won't give me more than a minute's thought. Fuck them all &amp; fuck this place. Careless motherfuckers.

He makes his money from a his production line company (where I worked previously also), the workers there are payed minimum wage which is in Slovenia 4€/h. He spends excess cash on fancy cars which all break down all the time, are an enormous money pit, and he barely drives them and enjoys them, but it's better to buy cars than to spend that cash rewarding employees. He has ENORMOUS wealth (in this case money), yet he still works constantly, makes others stressed, stresses himself, can't sit back and enjoy anything, all he sees is more company growth, more money, etc.

Fuck I worked 11 fucking hours today... I thought 8 was bad, now i got home Im so shook I can't even eat my dinner calmly, I cannot relax, theres no way....
Yesterday my anxiety was thru the roof, I meditated before going to bed, I was in pure bliss, but the moment I woke up it was like I had a fist in my stomach and the anxiety was horrible, knowing im going off to work for 8 fucking hours, well it was fucking 11!!

I'm excited to get the project finally off the ground, but a little bit impatient to make significant progress on it. The project will probably take several years to complete, but oh well I guess!

74,"Currently in final stages of interviewing for a job, worried about not seeming ""upbeat"" and collegial. Does anyone else find it difficult to beg for the chance to sell their labor at a low price?","Hey all, I've been lurking  on this sub for a bit and apologize if this is not the place to pose this question/rant.   


I'm in the final round (3rd) of interviewing for a public job. It's actually not great pay for the area ($53k in the Bay is not much, the city where I would be working has a median 1 bedroom rental price of $2250/month).   


I am worried that I may be too jaded by previous jobs and recent rejections, and my disdain for the exploitative work arrangement imposed on us under capitalism, may be transparent. I have the qualifications, I have literally done a job exactly like this in the past and done so well. my references spoke well about me and actually knew the hiring manager (luck not nepotism, the field we work in is small). Though I think that my ""professional demeanor"" is what may f\*ck me over, if not now, maybe later.  


It's now down to me and another ""candidate"" and I have the sense that this person may have a leg-up on me in some way (extra experience, a masters, etc.) and be willing to sell themselves short simply because of the desirability of the workplace--nice town, lax job, good benefits and an easy way to waste 30+ years of life working.  


I'm broke as shit, drowning in CC and student loan debt, living w my partner and scraping by. I **NEED** this job, but I hate that I need it. I hate that I have to joust for the ""privilege"" to sell my labor to someone else at a cost that would barely sustain my existence. I hate that I have to fake it and put on a face like I am happy to be considered for the job. I should not be happy, I should be neutral at best: I am a college graduate with 100% overlapping, relevant experience, I know I can do this job adequately or better. I do not mean to come off entitled, but I do think that one's basic needs should be easier to fulfill.

78,I quit my job today.,"I worked for UPS for over six months (almost seven). The last few months have been difficult. I would regularly go in feeling exhausted no matter how much sleep I got. I would take the bus ride in the morning and start to feel depressed about the fact that I had to go back to this same place over and over again. Yet, I kept going because I had to pay my bills.

Eventually, I started feeling suicidal. I would daydream about killing myself. Maybe that's just how my brain processes stressful situations, I don't know.

I didn't feel like the management there listened to me, or valued my work. I felt like I was eminently replaceable. I saw lots of people come and go in a parade of unfortunate souls who would come for the paycheck and then leave once they found out how it really was.

I should preface this by saying that I bought a 15 dollar pair of shoes from Wal-Mart knowing that they'd be torn up and beaten apart by all the walking around on concrete (and walking as part of my commute) that I would be doing. I had worn this same pair of shoes for about five months. Yesterday, because they had a new staffing coordinator trying to learn the job and such, she pulls me aside and tells me that I can't wear these shoes to work anymore because it's ""a safety issue."" Which is really odd because you'd think someone would have told me long before that if it was a serious concern.  


So at this point, I know they're just messing with me, trying to get my goat. During the conversation with the staffing coordinator, I'm trying not to pass out. I'm trying not to think about the box cutter knife sitting on the table behind me within arm's reach. Soon after that, I clock out and leave thinking that, since rent is due within five days, I'm going to have to go back to wearing my older, more ratty pair of shoes to work for a few weeks. But whatever, I said to myself, I guess I'll do it.  


So the morning comes and the first thing I feel when I wake up early so I can start preparing for my work day is, oh geez, I'm going to be stuck here forever, the only way out is to take my own life. And I think about doing it, right there in my own house. That's when I decided to quit. I had to put my continued existence over keeping this job. I had to sit down and weigh the pros and cons of this job.

Here's how it went:

Pros:  
\-Getting a regular paycheck

Cons:  
\-Having to commute three hours every day by using the bus, or fifteen hours a week.  
\-Feeling suicidal constantly at work  
\-It doesn't matter whether I work well or poorly.  
\-Management doesn't care about me.  
\-My shoes are not the problem. Or if they are, I should have been told long before this.  
\-I'm tired of always being tired.  
\-I'm not really paid well enough.  
\-I don't get health insurance, holiday pay, sick days, or paid time off. I don't get anything.  
\-And so on...

So put all of those things together, and I just had to quit. Nevermind that I might have to take another horrible job just to support myself. I suspect they're all horrible. But at least I won't have to go back to that same damn place again.",False,a0x6pf,WinterTrabex,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/a0x6pf/i_quit_my_job_today/,30,1

I work in a tech related industry where you are expected to go above and beyond for this career, I did a whole month of unpaid overtime at my previous position and they still treated me like dirt when I decided to move on.   


I've been unemployed for a few months now while I wait for my next job to start (They offered me a position much later in the year as they didnt have any available initially, I got in through a reccommendation from someone else working there).  
I've dealt with depression for a great deal of my life but these past few weeks it has really been dragging me down. I havent been able to successfully complete one single personal project during my time and I didnt realise how much of my worth I had tied to my career. I don't even think I know if I enjoy this career anymore or if I want to do it, but I know for certain that I don't want to expel anymore energy doing this sort of work outside of necessary work hours but it almost feels like I'm committing a crime admitting that?  


Most of my old work friends went on and on for days about all the projects I could do with my personal time when I had these few months off and that overwhelming guilt is seriously damaging my mental health. Have many of you dealt with this before? Is it okay to treat a 'fun' career like a regular job or am I being incredibly ungrateful?

99,How to find happiness and a good job?,"Hello. I feel like I have no passions or desires. I like animals, but failed at an interview with the animal shelter as my husband and I share a car and I can't work the hours they would need because of that. I worked at a call center for about 3 months but after my first 2 months, I started crying every day at work so I gave my 2 week notice and quit. I'm lucky my husband can afford what we have but I hate staying at home just playing games. I've tried to apply for many jobs but no one has gotten back to me and because I have SAD, autisim and am an introvert I don't go to the places hiering as much as I should. I'm not wanting to do babby sitting, dog sitting  or cleaning. When I was a nanny at the age of 19, the people I worked for didn't pay me and I've had other experiences where I've had to beg for payment from a job. 

I've gone to college and have a bacilors in communications with a emphasis in Public Relations and can't find a job. I don't want to go back to school and I doubt I could afford going to trade school. I'm too fat for the military (272 pounds) and wouldn't want to join anyway. 

I want to find my passion but don't know where to start. I've been selling crafts for about 4 years but buisness has been shit lately. Many many problems with people.

101,Are Millennials dropping out of the labor force?,"[From here](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/the-missing-men/488858/):

&gt;Something is rotten in the U.S. economy. Poor men without a  college degree are disappearing from the labor force. The share of  prime-age men (ages 25-54) who are neither working nor looking for work has doubled since the 1970s.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.S.’s labor participation rate for this group of men is lower than every country in the OECD  except for Israel ... and Italy ...  Today, one in six prime-age men in America are either unemployed or out of the workforce altogether—about 10 million men.

The article suggests the two largest factors in this trend are declining industrial employment and mass incarceration.

107,Could working for Teal companies make me less antiwork?,"I've been antiwork for a long time, and I've been trying to analyze why. I started in the, ""Working today is modern slavery, "" place, having watched the Stephen Molyneux YT video which shows an image of factory farmed cattle beside an image of rows and rows of cubes. Oof, that was an eye opener and a bad place to be, mentally. 

I left MegaCorp. I couldn't take it anymore. I thought perhaps I just don't like being told what to do by a manager that won't listen to or doesn't care about my input/personal goals (I don't). I had a manager that made me feel like a cog, that really just wanted to squeeze as much as possible out of me. Simultaneously I had so much on my plate I could only do crappy work with low quality for everything I was being *told* to do, which was demoralizing as I did not want to do a crappy job. If I was going to spend the majority of my life doing this work,  I wanted to do it well. I tried saying NO to some things that were getting added to the pile, but apparently no *does not* mean no in Corporate America.

But there are others who truly love their jobs and just cannot even understand where I'm coming from. I thought the just didn't get it. Then I found the idea of organizational evolution by Frederic Laloux. I realized I'd worked in what he calls Orange organizations, where the company's goal is to beat the competition and make the most money, whatever the (human, environmental) cost. This leads to employees being overly monitored to be the most efficient as possible. People come to work as partial people, wearing a professional mask and leaving part of themselves elsewhere while at work (most of their lives!).

But he speaks of Green and Teal companies which have evolved psrt dog eat dog competition, and more towards working for transcendent purposes, to truly help people and the world become a better place. Companies where the people manage themselves and teams self organize. Where you can bring your whole self to work and don't have to don a professional mask. 

I wondered, if I worked for a teal company, would I be so antiwork?

What do you all think? Take a look at the article. 

https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00344?gko=10921

I've never even witnessed a Teal company, but know people at what he calls a Green company and it's a mixed bag. I think those I know at the Green company with managers that come from an Orange mindset still are not happy. The direct management's minds must shift /evolve as well. 

But if organizations do evolve, might work become more meaningful? ",False,9xod5t,dak4f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/9xod5t/could_working_for_teal_companies_make_me_less/,15,1

i am in grad school now (which is work but with less pay, it's bullshit, don't go!) and I like the nature of the work but the people are dreadful.
