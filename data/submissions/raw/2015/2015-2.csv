2,"What would you be willing to do to abolish work? Yes, you, /r/antiwork.","I'm tired of reading (actually i'm not, that's not possible), tired of imaging how society could change reading *The Abolition of Work of Bob Black*; tired of dreaming on living in *The Phalanstery of Fourier*; tired of seing how absurd is my life reading *The Right to be Lazy of Lafargue*; tired of understanding the history of societies and the mind of the human and his relationship with work and free time in *Pray of Iddleness of Bertrand Russell*; tired of seing myself and my will for autorealization reflected in *The soul of a man under socialism of Oscar Wilde*; tired of believing that technology used to serve human being proposes can make us free in *The End of work of Jeremy Rifkin* but it's making more slaves; tired to pledge ""Not Guilty"" while reading *Ravachol’s Forbidden Defense Speech*. I'm tired of having understood too much reading several manifestos against labor, studies about gatheres and hunters societies, the absurd of property, the crazyness of living in state of competition between humans, medical studies about anxiety, depressions and percentage of people using antidepresants, studies about how 90 % of people hate his job or don't think it's useful at all, mass of people identified with *Fight of Club of Chuck Palanihuk*, Nietzche..., the economical ideas of André Gorz and others, tired of reading interesting blogs about antiwork, inspirational threads in this subreddit and dozens of short essays and articles or books of lot of other thinkers rubbing in my face everyday the senseless of my life. 

SO tired of reading, so tired of thinking and imaging, not that tired of discussing because it's very difficult to find people willing to abolish work in their lives and society, tired of old ideas being sold like new ideas like basic income and tired of reading something I found really novel and revolutionary to discover that it was writen in the XIX century or 20-50 years ago and those revolutionary thoughts had no impact at all in today's society. I'm willing to DO, i'm still on the road and still have much to change and to learn, i'm on it, but although i know very interesting people in this world of leaving in their own society, i feel like we, each of us are fighting in a every man for themselves strategy, most of us came here, read, dream and go back to work.

Is the abolition of work a personal choice and a personal struggle, or a fight against work can be organized by groups of people? If so, I think we are a 1062 people group here and I'm in, what do you propose, what are your ideas, your thoughts?
