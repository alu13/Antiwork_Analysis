7,The death of the 8-hour work day,how many people even work 8 hours anymore  i've only worked hourly  which seems what most people get nowadays  and it always comes with the asterisk of an extra 30 min to hour of lunch  it's never 9-5 anymore  it's 8-5  or 9-6 30   it drives me nuts  it's so negligable  but it's ultimately a slap in the face to the 8 hours to work  8 hours to sleep  8 hours to do as we please  never enough to truly relax  of course  often not enough to let you even go home  just enough to fulfill a quota to let your employer off the hook  while you spend that extra 30 min to an hour at the end of your shift so desperately wishing you can go home   hourly is supposed to be part-time  8 hours includes breaks and lunch for salary jobs  it's one more example of employers taking advantage  and it pisses me off the more i think of it  40 hours a week is a big difference from 45  and when you think about all the overtime and the time it takes to commute  it adds up and you can very easily be working about 50 hours a week    though as far as employers would have you know  that's just how it's 'supposed' to be  makes me angry when i think about it ,c6fb25

10,People sacrifice intelligence for money,there is no possible way you can spend 40 years working and come out the other as smart of a person as you would have been if you spent that time for yourself  learning and exploring life in the way you saw fit  this is why so many struggle with  what they'd do without work    in reality  they have had their ability to use certain parts of their brain  those parts have been snuffed out and replaced by the ability to do things against their will daily  they literally never learned how to have fun or think for themselves  i see this in almost everyone i meet  shells of their full potential    giving up 40 years of your life is a detriment to the well being of our species as a whole  and makes for much stupider  less fun and more depressing humans in the big picture ,c7c2ej

47,"Antiwork journey, and frugality",great subreddit btw  what was your antiwork journey  what caused you to become antiwork  did it or does it now involve frugality  if so  how does that cause others to react to you    first off  i recognize that poverty and frugality are often overlapping and there is only so much spending that can be reduced  and that sometimes people get into situations that make it hard or impossible to be frugal  so in this post  i m talking about limiting spending to the maximum degree possible  as a matter of antiwork even though it may also be by necessity    i realized that minimizing costs is a main factor in minimizing the amount of work that one has to partake in  i refuse to engage in major consumer purchases  or really any consumer purchases other than cheapest rent possible  food and drink  and thrift store clothing only when needed  my ultimate goal would be to work towards vandwelling or stable communal living  high amount of roommates to minimize cost    no kids  adamantly childfree  i realized my childfree ideology is mainly an antiwork ideology  witnessing many coworkers and friends seriously struggle financially and be absolutely chained to working jobs  unable to quit  or have multiple jobs to pay the absurd child raising costs  as well as constant stress    i really want to drop out of society  i m trying to drop out by proxy of spending as little as possible in order to minimize work needed to cover living costs  honestly  so many  working people  will look at you like you re batshit crazy if you simply say that you believe society and by proxy  work  is a scam and a trap  people always shame if you don t want kids  a mortgage or  a career  they also look at you weird if you are pinching pennies in order to avoid work having so much power and control over your life  my antiwork ideology was born when i witnessed others be so stressed and trapped chained because of high costs to pay in their life  freedom is the motivation    for me antiwork is mainly about avoiding ever being trapped in toxic or soul crushing  workplaces  i want the freedom to just walk off the job if needed  i want the freedom not to give a shit if i get fired  ironically  despite being antiwork  i m actually a pretty decent worker in my field s  and scored top 20  of the company by kpis  and have actually been named employee of the month before  i assume many of you are the same  but i have no desire to move up and deal with more stress  more hours  and more bullshit   i did enjoy my jobs to some degree  actually  but for me it s been an absolute nightmare to deal with any instances of workplace bullying and getting up early for work which is debilitating  why do so many jobs start 8am  fuck that    i ve built some savings and follow various antiwork and anti life script subreddits but to be honest just one major financial crisis or illness would screw me over  so it s not like i m rich or have some great strategy worked out for never working again but i ve certainly become frugal in an antiwork spirit  and a societal dropout  associate with other frugal  anti lifescripters    what about you ,c6i60y

98,Mandatory unpaid internship hours for my girlfriend's Master's degree.....,this has got to be the biggest load of bullshit i've ever heard of  but we'll get to that    amp x200b   my girlfriend is currently getting her master's degree in social work  a requirement of this degree is 1200 hours of internship hours  i appreciated the fact that they were ensuring that she gain experience in her field  today she got an interview for a full-time job in her field making  16 50 an hour as a peer counselor  she said that this would conflict with her internship  i said that it would stand to reason that your internship could be done in the place your working  she said the school won't allow it  why   it has to be unpaid  1200 hours of unpaid labor  so she's gonna have to play a bunch of games with a job that is amazing for a 22 year old undergrad because higher education likes to acclimate young people to not being worth anything more than the time of a supervisor  is the university that is mandating unpaid ahours paying her a living stipend  no    amp x200b   at what point are we allowed to call a spade a spade and abolish this slave-labor bullshit  she pays enough money for her education that i'm not happy with them feeling as though they have the right to tel her how to make a living ,c2zrcz

105,Best careers for people who majored in languages/liberal arts NOT good at maths/IT,i am a mid20 italian girl with a bachelor's degree in foreign languages and communication  english and japanese   i chose this major because i love studying foreign languages  i have previously studied french and german  i have strong linguistic skills  i learn languages easily  and i am a big japan nerd  i have advanced english skills  ielts 8 0  and intermediate japanese level  n3  plan to do n2  i did study abroad in tokyo during my bachelor  also  i have done 2 free interships needed to acquire credits before graduation  one of them was related to teaching italian to exchange students   still with a bachelor's degree i did not find any decent job neither in italy neither in japan   in italy because most post graduate paid internships are for people with a masters  also i can not teach as teaching is only for people with a masters  same for translating  they do not want someone with just a bachelor's  i was unaware of that as our professors said that a bachelor's was enough if we did not want to become academics at uni   in japan either because my japanese level is still too low  visa problems and because i got discrimination due to not being native english speaker  italian is much less popular than it used to be so i never got the chance to teach italian in japan  unfortunately   i got offered just free internships which required 60  work hours or waiting tables with night shift  i said no   i therefore decided to enroll to master's in order to improve my chances both in italy and japan and globally   my masters has some optional economic classes and exams  lately i see some job adds for people as accountants or finance like jobs  but  sadly i checked the mock exam and the textbook and it looks quite advanced and complicated  i was never good in maths  i was good in anatomy and biology  but never in maths or physics   i also do not have it programming skills  only computer graphic or blogging skills  and i am worried i might not find any decent career salary because of that  i so wonder  what other careers can people with a humanities degree can follow which does not involve maths economics  aside teaching  do i really need to work on my maths skills not to be doomed to poverty  in my situation what do you recommend me to do   thanks in advance,c3rhrz

115,Renting out property for a work-free life? thoughts?,i know being a landlord is inherently unethical  as is our entire capitalist system  but does that mean we should still moralize the economic decisions individuals make  i've seen a lot of posts recently against landlords  yes i agree they're generally parasites  but the same leftists contend that one should  go get a real job  and not live off the rent of others  kind of reminds me of conservative arguments against people on welfare tbh  which is also what a ubi would be  i e  making rent from others production  but that's a different story   but if one was to seek avoiding a life time of drudgery and misery from slaving away at 40  hours per week through say   making investments in a property and renting it out  with the goal of cutting away hours at your normal job  or retiring early  and using that time to pursue passions and do something socially beneficial  would you folks see it as inherently evil and to be completely avoided   this is my hypothetical  buying out a small apartment building  not a house someone could buy and live in  renting it out below market  signing a good contract that legally obligates you to be a decent landlord  like being prompt with repairs  no harsh rules  etc   not evicting people for being late with rent  and donating the apartments equity to the tenants until i'm comfortable without the rent  or when i die  whichever comes first   i kind of see it like being a manager  a position that shouldn't exist  but if you have it  you can try to be a good one  otherwise someone else will just do it and may end up being shitty to workers and super exploitative   i definitely wouldn't wanna be a landlord  but in this capitalist shithole  it seems like one of the few ways to a work-free life  if we go beyond good and evil  albeit a temporary solution until the utopia is ushered in   thoughts ,c5trij

136,Nothing makes me feel as awful as money.,i keep trying to get a job for years already but i am so depressed and have such bad social anxiety that either i quit before or after the first day of work  the constant pressure of being a burden to those around me leaves me being suicidal everyday  i just wish they wouldn't be sad if i killed myself  i just can't fucking sustain the constant pressure of having to earn anymore  i do have the option not to work  but it makes me feel like shit because of not co tributing anything to my family and wife  my wife keeps telling me that it's okay if i don't work but as i said  i feel like shit simply not contributing anything    i tried so many times with medicines and therapy but i will always be unable to work and i just want to die but can't because the ones close to me would get hurt so i have to stay alive and suffer for them  i just know i will never be happy as long as there is that pressure of having income ,bzdfob
137,"I've been a NEET for a year, and tomorrow I'm starting a job in the career I've hoped for, and I feel kind of like a condemned man",i'm just not sure if there are any other forums that would be receptive to this particular issue  so bear with me and my lame-ass middle class neuroses  so i'm 29  i've spent the past decade or so since high school as a full time failson  living with my parents  still do  and fucking up in various ways  developing a drug problem  fucking up school  etc  about seven or eight years ago i got my shit sort-of together and finished my college degree  last year i finished my master's degree in the same field after finally seeking treatment for my drug stuff in late 2017f  got into rehab and haven't relapsed or used once in the year and a half since i started  i'm lucky enough that i was a graduate teacher's aide while doing my ma and my parents paid for both my brother and i's undergrad degrees  so i'm incredibly privileged in the sense that i'm debt free - so i'm broke but at least i don't have a negative net worth or anything   anyway  the last year i've been a legit neet  living in my parents house and persisting on money they gave me  savings from grad school  and little part-time contract jobs i got here and there  but it was never much money at all  basically i've been flat broke my whole adult life  working retail jobs part time  or doing college stuff  or just being an unemployed piece of shit  obviously i've spent this year hunting for jobs and it was rough  i applied for a lot of garbage  including a few retail positions and adjunct professorships with no chance for advancement   anyway  to make a long story short  i got one of the jobs i applied for that was actually decent  it's in an institution i like and want to work at  there's room for advancement  lots of benefits including the regular ones like insurance and paid vacation  shit i've never had before  and it starts in the high thirties where most of the stuff i applied for was like the mid twenties  so its objectively great for me  everyone i know congratulated me  i'm supposed to be super stoked i can be an independent normal person now  and i definitely am    so while i'm glad i've got an opportunity to do something less soul-crushing and better compensated than so many people  who work incredibly hard  harder than i'll ever work  i'm sure  for fucking peanuts  i still feel terrible right now  being a neet sucks in a lot of ways  people think you're pathetic  you can't really go out much  you can't date  it's hard to live a normal life  but  simultaneously  you can really indulge in the things you actually enjoy  if you're the right type of person  i've spent the last year exercising  smoking weed all day  playing videogames  reading  and just generally pursuing my many interests  before that  i did my own thing in college  and it was fun being academically successful without having to spend all my time at it   this post has gotten far too long  but i'm sort of mourning my neethood right now  if that makes any sense  it's supposed to be a fantastic development for me that i have to wake up at six and haul my ass into a fluorescent office to do something basically unimportant  but it just isn't - i'm gonna spend the next thirty five years doing this  and that's incredibly difficult to really face   anyone else feel this  was the transition from shitty failson unemployment to a  real job  jarring and depressing for anyone else ,bz3n4i
138,Life should have option to live peaceful life with modest stress levels and have a life outside of work,let people who are willing to work hardcore like scientists engineers  doctors  etc do it and give them massive money and status for it   also people who are into hedonistic lifestyle with big apetites  who are willing to sacrifice huge portion of their life working to get money and live their dream life thing too   but there should be an option for an average person wanting to live peaceful life to do semi-work and have modest life  we dont need big money  just basic salary for basic living expenses and medical care without hardcore work hours and stress   hopefullly in some future computers will take care of entire society structure and take care to distribute work to each individual based on his predispositions and real work needed to be done  with everything balanced based on needs and resources   because humans alone cannot build decent society  we absolutely suck at it ,bzwhi7

140,I've found the right community,all of you are expressing the exact same feelings i've been having for over a year  and perhaps most of my life  i had a severe mental breakdown at the end of my tenure as an ma tenure  had to take an incomplete the week before i was due to graduate  from there  i have worked one job for 2 months  a shitty production job at a shitty screenprinting shop where i worked with a number of undocumented and very hard working hispanic women who were overworked and severely underpaid  i have no desire to work  i feel broken at times  especially since i come from a working class family who values hard work  my grandfather is still working at 73 in an old dye plant building with zero air conditioning  thankfully  my 24 yr old brother is there to help  but mostly  i feel the same as you guys do - not wanting to be a burden  but wanting to have my own life  it's hard not to feel guilty about wanting a life with a job that wont take as much as the jobs of my grandfather  father  and brother have taken    i appreciate this subreddit  though it is difficult to know what to do  besides blowing my brains out    zero savings   57k in student loans  mental illness caused mostly by poverty and this society valuing wage slavery  some credit card debt  and both of my parents are expected to be in poor health the rest of their lives    what can i do to ease the pain  and how the hell am i supposed to find a job when drug testing is common  i live in nc  when i need weed to perform at a job ,bzu4cu
141,You know what’s worse than having a job? Trying to land a job. Anyone else agree?,i made a post here a few weeks ago about quitting my retail job because it was making me depressed and that i might give college another shot  etc etc etc  won t go into it again  does anyone else find it even more stressful anxiety inducing actually trying to land a job than actually working  at least at my old job i just rocked up and went into autopilot until the shift was over  my anxiety was at zero all the time  i suffer terribly with gad  and even applying for jobs is absolute hell  after sending an application off i feel constantly sick for days after  waiting for the phone to potentially ring for an interview   but the worst part of all of it is being expected to kiss a companies ass just to get a job  no  i don t care about your company  i care about the money you re going to pay me  i don t care about your  company values  or any of that bullshit  because at the end of the day they could just replace you instantly    i wish you could just go into an interview with a no bs attitude  and when asked  why do you want this job  reply with something like  well to fund my college endeavours  but instead i m expected to lie about how much i love the company and how much i would  love  to work for them,c1at27
142,The way females talk at work,i don't know if it's just me or not but i really can't stand the way females talk to each other at work  and no i don't mean it by hearing them spew nasty things at each other but just their girly voices and how fake they all sound   omg really seriously  me too no way  i cannot believe it in their high-pitched giggly tone  i'm a girl myself and i guess i'm just an oddball but i don't talk like that  i keep to myself most of the time and even if i'm talking about something exciting i don't shriek or giggle like these women do ,c0b4ca

146,Think I'm gonna quit,i've been a trucker for 10 months now  was kind of aiming for a year since that's a requirement for other places  oh well  another soft goal was to save  12k  and then i could either live in a cheap apartment with basic comfort for a year or get land and back to living in my van but this time with land to park it on instead of having to move every night and be hassled by cops etc etc  and i basically reached that  i got a 2 5 acres for 8k and have 5k now    i lived in my van for 2 years before this  on basically  50 cash and  190 food stamps per month  i adapted to the poverty once  i can do it again  freedom is more valuable  i just need to exist long enough to see if yang wins and we get ubi or not  i was never going to be able to work for long enough to exist for very long anyhow  only sticking around now because of that  all these years i've been talking about ubi  if i died right before we got it it'd be hilariously ironic  not that i'm very hopeful   it kinda sucks because if i didn't have mental health issues i might be able to have a normal life and be a trucker for a decade and save up and retire to a comfortable life  there's a lot of things about it i enjoy  but when you hate existing to begin with  having the demand to endure 60  hours of more torture is just not doable for very long  it's like having one hand on a hot stove and then someone demanding you place your other hand and your face on the stove too  i've tied my bedsheet to the top bunk and around my neck a dozen times by now  but it always seems too painful  i get regular episodes of feeling paralyzed and spending 2 or 3 days in bed in the truck without going outside  it's time to quit    i almost bought weed yesterday since i was in colorado and a weed store was like 100 feet from my delivery  one time use would dirty my pee for about a week  we're liable to get drug tested randomly at any time  failing a drug test doesn't just get you fired  it gets added to your dac which is basically a credit report for your driving record for truckers  with a failed drug test you're basically black balled from the industry for years  it's not because i ever particularly loved weed and really want to get high  it often dried my eyes and mouth and nose out too much and was unpleasant  and when i had regular access i would irregularly smoke like once a week  it's just  who are they to say what i can or can't do in my free time  i really hate arbitrary rules and obedience to an authority who would make arbitrary rules  freedom is the most important thing and having it stifled makes work even more intolerable  i bring it up because it's another symptom of it being time to quit  that i'd consider taking such a risk    i'm an anxious and neurotic person  i've been agonizing over the decision to quit or not for the past 3 weeks  if i was sure i was going to then i might not have posted this  just venting my anxiety in a long meaningless post  don't mind me  it wouldn't even matter much if i were normal because there's so many trucking jobs you could get a job same day very easily  but my anxiety means once i quit i'm not easily going to start a new job ,c20wxg

191,Coming to terms w/ ”loving” your job,tl dr i love my job and today i nearly collapsed from exhaustion - what do you do when your work is your passion  where is the balance   i love my job  i really do  maybe it s because i ve had so many terrible ones  it might be a case of basic decency amidst a sea of exploitation but really it s not just that  i  love  my job for all the right reasons  i am doing something i am passionate about  i can make a difference in my community  i get to set my own hours i love my coworkers i am empowered to do a lot of what i want to do i have a lot of autonomy i have the best benefits i ve ever had   but i do not make enough money  i really don t and everyone knows it and i genuinely honestly know that my board cares a shit ton and wants it to be different and believes i deserve to get paid more  we simply do not have enough money  i know because i ve run the numbers and have access to all of our accounts  the long and the short of it is i have willingly exploited my own labor because i care so much about what we are trying to do    anyone who has worked at a  not totally unethical  nonprofit or as a social worker  teacher  nurse  doctor  public defender  caretaker  counselor etc  - any place where you are helping people  or trying to  maybe even saving lives or changing things for the better probably knows this struggle  because any place that is doing important work ethically probably doesn t have enough money to pay its team what they deserve   or you work somewhere that isn t the most ethical - maybe your company or organization is run by greedy people or receives money from harmful industries or doesn t value its employees enough and just decides not to give them what they deserve - but you feel like what you do matters and if you walk away you will stop being there for your students or patients or clients and this vast problem that you tackle in your profession won t go away so someone has to do something about it   and if you don t do it  maybe no one will or they ll replace you with someone who doesn t care enough or will only give the effort that your salary warrants - you go above and beyond and work way above what you re paid and your replacement won t - and probably shouldn t    so you work and work and give and give and are exhausted all the time and constantly think about work  if you re lucky you  love  your job and find immense satisfaction and joy in what you do  like i do  but you are constantly drained and can t do anything without connecting things back to work  or maybe you hate something about job but you re helping people and following your passion    if the above applies to you and you hate your job  quit - save up a bit of money and quit  that s what i think you should do at least and i know there s a lot of reasons why it s not that simple- plus you probably spent a shit ton of time and money to get to some education or experience to get where you are so you can t just quit    but to me the harder question is what if you love your job  i ve worked over a year straight no time off and now i end up going in on weekends most weeks and i m so tired    i have a two week vacation planned next month that i ve spent all my money on so i am going no matter what  but what about when i get back  there is always a reason to come in on the weekends or stay late or go the extra mile and  no one makes me do it but me    frankly i m terrified of what would happen if i did get paid enough money because then i know i d still work too much and never tear myself away because i care too much and there s always more to be done and if have no reason to blame it on needing the money   but i m also terrified of that time when there  isn t  more work to be done  when the chaos subsided and the place runs smoother and problems are solved more and more  because i don t even know who i am without this place    what do you do when you love your job where you do something  good  or helpful or important  just work it forever until you die  how do you learn to rest   how do you make time for other things  i had to come home today from work because i almost collapsed i was so tired - i m working too much    and i know that what i do isn t saving the world  i know i m just one person and nothing i could do would possibly be as important as it feels to me  but if i tell myself this doesn t actually matter then how do i keep going  i m not a nihilist i believe that what we do while we re alive has meaning if we want it to  but if my  passion  to help people is just filling a void so my life has meaning and i m not overwhelmed by my own mortality then that isn t meaning it s just helping me to keep going   why can t i tell myself do your best to make a difference but never put it above your own needs  how do i force myself to take more breaks and do more exciting stuff while i m alive instead of sitting at a desk and going to meetings  i m a workaholic  but it s the promise of doing something to make this shitty life better for other people that keeps me addicted to work  and i don t want to give that up ,bz63ix

193,The in-order-to mind,there is one  maybe somewhat subtle way  in which full time employment can poison your entire life  by all conventional standards  i've done pretty well for myself  i'm an md  currently also doing on a phd during residency  working in a stimulating and engaging field  i even have the privilege of working with understanding bosses  and having 'decent' hours for the medical field    -50 hours per week for my normal job  what happens during work is not the problem - i kinda enjoy the challenge  work hard  play hard - right    amp x200b   as we all know it's not that simple  we all know that work stress  and even unfinished projects etc  can carry over into weekends and free time - but that's not what i want to discuss  there's something else that has been bugging me and it's only recently that i've been able to put a finger on it    amp x200b   my gripe is  even when you've finished your work and  don't take it home with you  it will continue to dominate your life  when you've got a challenging job and get home absolutely mentally exhausted on friday  you'll relax on the weekend  maybe do some fun stuff with the money that you've earned    in order to  be fit to work again on monday  whether you're conscious of it or not  it's a driving factor  if you've got some mental energy and motivation left  maybe you'll take those art classes  but in the back of your mind there's always this question  is this relaxing enough so that i can be maximally productive on monday  after a couple of months of non-stop work  maybe you'll take that vacation    in order to  relax and be productive again when you come back  i find that on a certain level  this in-order-to mind sucks the creativity and spontaneity out of a lot of activities  the enjoyment of a thing in and of itself as i used to know it in my free time has been replaced by a colder  more utilitarian reasoning   how can i  use  this to be more productive    amp x200b   sure i'll meet with friends  take a walk  do some sports   but all of these things have become  whether i consciously want it or not  subservient to the all-pervading goal of productivity  i find it's a very hard cycle to break  just wanted to get it out of my system  thanks for reading ,bzub3g
194,Do not trust employers when they reccommend certain contracts.,so last october i travelled to japan to start teaching english  im still here and am going to hand in my final notice soon  the country has been great but the wage slave life has been overwhelming and had a huge effect on my social life    when i got here duribg training we were given the choice between a normal employee contract and an 'independent contractor' contract  when explaining the difference they completely bullshitted us  saying that independent payed more  gave you more freedom and more flexibility  i foolishly trusted them and signed the independent   after a few months i noticed a 'rental fee' which completely offset the extra pay  supposedly as im independent i have to rent the classroom making the 'more money per lesson' angle a flat out lie  i also have no extra flexibility in fact i have to pay to take sick leave  not as in not recieve the money for that day  i have to pay my company to find my replacement  i have no benefits or paid leave  employee contracts do  and i have absolutely no control over my schedule which makes the 'flexibility' angle another goddamn lie   im stuck doing a full time job with less freedom because the employee contract is bound by enployment laws in the country  but for independent contractors benefits are optional  which mwans they are nonexistent   tl dr  my employers told me one contract payed more and had more flexibility  this was a lie and they dont have to provide me basic workers rights   does anyone else have any horror stories of being tricked into signing away benefits or options because you mistakenly trusted your employers   i wont even be making that mistake again ,c0y47h

199,The whole career thing,do some of you think you were never made for a career  i've chased entry into 2 different careers based on what i had an actual aptitude for  visual effects and academia and have failed utterly at the former and probably at the latter based on my track record so far  i feel incredibly envious of people who are far ahead of me at my age  however  at the same time i have always utterly detested 9-5 and the bs socialising that goes on at workplaces  i have been an outsider and patronised  with good reason probably  and though i thought in my 20s that i could possibly conform in my own way  i think i'm always going to be an outsider  i will never relate to other humans  i would like a career only insofar as it provides a layer of security but i think i'm doomed to menial working for others even though i did my fucking damndest  but not enough compared to others  not to be in that position  this isn't to slate anyone btw who does menial work  as 99  of work is bs anyway and the most worthless are the ceos and execs who are parasites ,c1f9sd

210,Parents forcing me to work a job that makes me depressed and miserable,so i'll try to make this as concise as possible  i'm an 18 year old male living with my parents and planning to attend a university in the fall  last summer my dad used the wonderful power of nepotism to get me a job at the company he works for  this company is a managed it service  basically they run the it department of other companies  firms  hospitals  etc  my job was to take calls from the clients and log their issues in the ticket system  my hours were 8-5 monday through friday and it was honestly torture  everyday i wanted to quit but feared how my parents would react to this  i felt uncomfortable and out of place being the only 17 year old in the office when everyone else was 35  i felt horrible knowing that all my other friends were out enjoying their summers and i was stuck inside staring at a computer screen     amp x200b   somehow i made it through the summer and vowed to myself to never do that again  throughout the year  my dad must have asked me if i would be working there again next summer at least 5 times  and every time  i made it clear that i do not want to work there again  in about may  he asked me again and again i said no  he basically gave me this ultimatum that if i did not secure an alternate job within the next 3 weeks i would have to work the same job again  i had no success in finding a job during this time because i was more focused on my school finals and graduating high school  last week  the local starbucks called my house and offered me an interview  my parents lost it  they called me ungrateful  stupid  etc  when i bring up that the job made me miserable they brought up stories from their childhood about hard jobs that they worked and that i have such an  easy job  what they don't know is that i have social anxiety and depression and i don't feel comfortable talking to them about it because they constantly make fun of me for being anti-social  they deem my introverted behavior as  rude  and for being  mr  mope-a-lot    amp x200b   so they won't let me take any other job offers because if i bailed at this point it would make my dad look bad  he told management that i would becoming back in the summer despite me assuring him multiple times that i have no interest in returning   yes  my parents are straight r insaneparents material  my dad even threatened me-  don't show up to work on monday and see what happens  purposely try to get fired and see what happens     amp x200b   so now i'm supposed to start tomorrow  i'm having anxiety just thinking about it  i just want to be a normal teenager and work a part time job at the local fro-yo place or something  and let me preface by saying its not about the money  we're not struggling financially  my dad even said   it's not about them money  it's about the experience     amp x200b   i'm financially dependent on my parents and without them i'm not sure how i would pay for my college tuition  i just feel so helpless in this situation and just wish my parents would not be control freaks so this whole thing would be avoided  what would you guys do in this situation ,c1dwq9

213,My dad is being written up for using the bathroom,in all the years he's worked security he's never been written up  and he's endured many worker violations for little complaint  he's not a revolutionary thinker or anything  but he doesn't put up with anyone's shit and raised me the same way saying if he's ever in the wrong don't listen to him  that he wants what's best for everyone but isn't infallible  that takes a mature mind to admit that to their child where we see boomers in general aren't capable   well my dad has to pee a lot  he's getting older  he has injuries   not work related  he hurts constantly and he doesn't ask for much just to be left alone and he'll work hard if you just tell him what you want done   but see modern society doesn't tell you  they just expect you to know and live in a constant state of fear  oh you can bet someone will be there to tell you wrong  but never to explain in depth what could have avoided this  now as we establish my dad admits his mistakes  like his boss got on him one time when i picked him up for work because he was leaving as the other security was in the bathroom  that was his relief but until that relief physically plants themselves down he is not to leave the premise  he was like ok i understand  it's never come up again and he just asks me to park to the side and wait and he'll walk to the car despite how he hurts   but the man pees like every half hour to an hour  he can't be waiting around for someone to permit him to go to the bathroom and sit in his spot when there's only like two guards  so i was there when it happened as i just dropped him off  he ran to go pee  comes out  and his boss is bitching at him in front of everyone and he was like  i'm not even technically signed in yet  but since there was no officer at the gate house  his ass was to be right there whether he had to pee or not  he tried to defuse the situation by mentioning how he never got his new uniforms or there were some items missing  but they saw right through that trying to change the subject  so after he said they were gonna write him up for you know  having basic biological needs that can't be avoided for long  he was like fine whatever   he needs an income  but like i said he's a stubborn one  he was mad the whole night but as soon as he got home he started packing bottles and his hookah in my old school backpack  i was like what are you doing   they don't want me to leave  i ain't leaving  i'm going to smoke the whole god damn night  i'm going to piss in these bottles  and if there's an emergency sorry  can't leave the gate house for any reason   last post he was at he said it felt like being homeless anyway 11 hours outside rain  snow  or heat  so if they fire him oh well  he only works because he doesn't want to be a burden on us and make his own money  and that's where trying to do right by other people gets you  stepped on and a gun pointed at your head at all times   he's the first to admit fuck boomers  they ruined literally everything and no modern convenience measures up to half the bullshit put up with to keep it ,byghtr

223,SHOWER THOUGHT: Automation will create mass unemployment in those countries that cannot artificially stimulate jobs growth,the usual retort to the prediction that automation creates mass unemployment is the fallacy that new technologies can create new demand for workers  economists who make this argument typically ignore how dependent jobs growth is on government deficit financed stimulus    but most countries are no longer able to finance economic expansion through deficit spending  italy and greece are examples  throughout the third world the situation is even more dire  this suggests that as automation begins to spread widely  those countries without large trade surpluses or able to sustain large fiscal deficits will increasingly become the sites of mass unemployment  data may already show this    am i missing something here ,c1nj9y

mostly rich countries  enjoy record-high employment among 15- to 64-year-olds  in japan 77  of this group has a job  up six percentage points in six years  this year britons will work a record 55bn hours  on current trends  germany is enjoying a bonanza of tax revenue following a surge in the size of its labour force  see  article https www economist com finance-and-economics 2019 05 23 should-germany-borrow-to-invest  even in france  spain and italy  where joblessness is still relatively high  working-age employment is close to or exceeds 2005 levels   the rich-world jobs boom is partly cyclical the result of a decade of economic stimulus and recovery since the great recession  but it also reflects structural shifts  populations are becoming more educated  websites are efficient at matching vacancies and qualified applicants  and ever more women work  in fact women account for almost all the growth in the rich-world employment rate since 2007  that has something to do with pro-family policies in europe  but since 2015 the trend is found in america  too  last  reforms to welfare programmes  both to make them less generous and to toughen eligibility tests  seem to have encouraged people to seek work   thanks to the jobs boom  unemployment  once the central issue of political economy  has all but disappeared from the political landscape in many countries  it has been replaced by a series of complaints about the quality and direction of work  these are less tangible and harder to judge than employment statistics  the most important are that automation is destroying opportunities and that work  though plentiful  is low-quality and precarious   our jobs market is being turned into a sea of insecurity  says jeremy corbyn  leader of britain s labour party   again  reality begs to differ  in manufacturing  machines have replaced workers over a period of decades  this seems to have contributed to a pocket of persistent joblessness among american men  but across the oecd as a whole  a jobs apocalypse carried out by machines and algorithms  much feared in silicon valley  is nowhere to be seen  a greater share of people with only a secondary education or less is in work now than in 2000   it is also true that middle-skilled jobs are becoming harder to find as the structure of the economy changes  and as the service sector including the gig economy expands  by 2026 america will have more at-home carers than secretaries  according to official projections  yet as labour markets hollow out  more high-skilled jobs are being created than menial ones  meanwhile  low-end work is becoming better paid  in part because of higher minimum wages  across the rich world  wages below two-thirds of the national median are becoming rarer  not more common   as for precariousness  in america traditional full-time jobs made up the same proportion of employment in 2017 as they did in 2005  the gig economy accounts for only around 1  of jobs there  in france  despite recent reforms to make labour markets more flexible  the share of new hires given permanent contracts recently hit an all-time high  the truly precarious work is found in southern european countries like italy  and neither exploitative employers nor modern technology is to blame  the culprit is old-fashioned law that stitches up labour markets  locking out young workers in order to keep insiders in cushy jobs   elsewhere  the knock-on benefits of abundant work are becoming clear  as firms compete for workers rather than workers for jobs  average wage growth is rising  pushing up workers  share of the pie albeit not as fast as the extent of the boom might have suggested  tight labour markets lead firms to fish for employees in neglected pools  including among ex-convicts  and to boost training amid skills shortages  american wonks fretted for years about how to shrink disability-benefit rolls  now the hot labour market is doing it for them  indeed  one attraction of the jobs boom is its potential to help solve social ills without governments having to do or spend very much   nonetheless  policymakers do have lessons to learn  economists have again been humbled  they have consistently underestimated potential employment  leading to hesitant fiscal and monetary policy  just as their sanguine outlook on finance in the 2000s contributed to the bust  so their mistaken pessimism about the potential for jobs growth in the 2010s has needlessly slowed the recovery   the left needs to accept that many of the criticisms it levels at capitalism do not fit the facts  life at the bottom of the labour market is not joyous far from it  however  the lot of workers is improving and entry-level jobs are a much better launch pad to something better than joblessness is  a failure to acknowledge this will lead to government intervention that is at best unnecessary and at worst jeopardises recent progress  the jobs boom seems to be partly down to welfare reforms that the likes of mr corbyn have vociferously opposed   the right should acknowledge that jobs have boomed without the bonfire of regulations that typically forms its labour-market policy  in fact  labour-market rules are proliferating  and although the jury is out on whether rising minimum wages are harming some groups  such as the young  they are not doing damage that is large enough to show up in aggregate   the jobs boom will not last for ever  eventually  a recession will kill it off  meanwhile  it deserves a little appreciation ,bxk3ap

294,No motivation to work,so im 18 with no gcses and no a levels  basically no education from year 9 10  the main reason for this is because i was a troubled student and went to about 6 primary schools and 8 secondary schools  and left education without anything to show for it   i do want to work but tbf i don't have the desire drive to get my qualifications and get a job   so i don't know if this is the right place to post but how can i motivate my self to stop living off my parents  i contribute  250 a month for rent  and get the desire to work    i have had cash in hand jobs that paid from  2 50- 5 that were terrible experiences tbh  edit  i have adhd  autism  not life affecting  and depression ,bxx1g7

298,Life sort of feels like Dark Souls now (spoilers),short synopsis of dark souls for those who don't know  a dude named gwyn and a bunch of his buddies defeat the dragons and then use a magical thing called the first flame to establish the age of fire  later though  the first flame starts to fade  and the age of fire comes to an end  gwyn  in desperation sacrifices himself as kindling to keep the flame going  but eventually  even that isn't enough  so gwyn's remaining buddies set up a gigantic obstacle course and have a bunch of random undeads try to go through it  the reasoning is that only the strongest would be able to make it to the end  and thus serve as powerful kindling to restore the first flame   at the end of the game  there is a profound sense of being fooled by all the various characters that guided you along  you're constantly referred to as the  chosed undead  but you soon find out that you're not the only one  in fact  if i remember correctly  progress that was made by any previous chosen undeads that fail in their journey gets reset deliberately  in the first half of the game  you have to ring two magic bells  you find out from one of the side characters that he was also a chosen undead  and that he made it as far as the first bell  but then gave up before the second one  doesn't change the fact that you have to re-ring the first bell  this makes the entire journey feel like an arbitrary and meaningless test   when you finally get through all the crap that the game throws at you and reach the first flame  all you get is a short anticlimactic cutscene in which your character gets lit on fire and burnt up   so how does this relate to antiwork  well  the old wealthy people of the world have built their own little golden age for themselves  however  to keep it going  they need a constant supply of workers to sacrifice to the system  during the first twenty or so years of most people's lives  they're told that they are special  that they have great potential and that they'll change the world  but to the capitalist overlords  no one is special  if someone burns out and gives up  they can just toss them out and replenish their employee supply from the millions of other  special  people out there   but that's not all  before we even get the  privilege  of becoming disposable tools  we have to jump through a bunch of hoops  many of which are arbitrary and nonsensical  even the lowest paying jobs require you to fill out a needlessly tedious online application  do a phone interview in which they ask a bunch of questions that have nothing to do with the job  and then attend an on-site interview where they ask more questions that have nothing to do with the job  higher paying jobs require college and graduate school  which typically involves at least six years  tens of thousands of dollars of debt  and several unpaid internships  and what do you get for all that hard work  a job that eats up all your time  and leaves you as an empty husk of a human being   don't let that discourage you from playing dark souls though  it's a great game with a depressing ending ,bwckmm

304,Convincing adults to share is eerily similar to teaching it to toddlers,that's why i like to keep my ideas simple  people deserve food  water and shelter because we're collectively more than capable of making sure that happens  without forcing anyone to do an unfair amount of work  anyone interested in their own species does not believe laziness  stupidity  weakness or anything else is just reason to let anyone go without the basics of a human life    humans don't start at 0  we all start needing food  needing water and needing shelter  that means all humans starts in need  nobody in need  did it to themselves  the second humans became a post hunter-gatherer society  everyone of our excuses went out the window  if we have enough food  water and shelter for everyone  but our system doesn't allow us to take advantage of that fact to help our own species  then something is horrendously wrong    i understand that under our current structure we can't just print infinite money    money doesn't grow on trees  but food  does ,byan0s
305,Just watched Hotel Mumbai last night.,i will start off by saying it was a great movie and i enjoyed it for the most part  it was intense as hell and had me biting my nails at several parts throughout   now  onto my complaints about the movie  i think it is important to emphasize  that i am not trying to discredit or trivialize the sacrifices some of the employees made since it was based on a true story  but man oh man do i have a problem with the employees' portrayed motivations in the film  these people were serving some of the richest people in the world  granted i'm sure some of them were perfectly fine people  but there is one part in the film where they explicitly state one of the guests is  extremely difficult to deal with  further on in the film the head chef tells his employees that they have a chance to leave if they want to  they all reply that they are staying because  the guest is god   i've worked my fair share of retail in my life  i have had some customers that were great and others that were not so great  am i a bad person for saying that if i was in that situation i wouldn't necessarily risk my life for some of the more  difficult  guests ,bydbxz

332,NEW TO THIS SUBREDDIT. WANT TO SHARE MY SENTIMENTS,i am currently unemployed  it has been 2 months since i resigned at my former work  i left because the salary is low considering the graveyard shift and all  i am a bachelor's degree holder which seems pretty useless unless you are a modelish type  i say bs  i do not want to apply for another unfulfilling job anymore  i'm tired pleasing other people and settling to a low paying job when you know you are meant for something bigger  i tried running an online business but it has been months  and i still haven't got any sales  i am loosing hope on it to be honest  it seems like the only option i have now is to jump into another job just to save up money  but thinking about it makes me feel so weak  my friends are all in the corporate world  they have been working for 3 years or so  my family is also wired into thinking that a responsible adult needs to be in a 9-to-5 job  it's just how things are supposed to be  this is the reason why i never opened myself up to them  but it's like i've already seen the tragic of being in a rat race and the fact that i do not have to be in it and neglecting it makes me feel so stupid to turn a blind eye to the truth which not everybody knows or acknowledged  but i also do not want to be seen as lazy by my loved ones just because i do not work the way they want me to  i am so confused  it's like i know the right thing to do  which is to not be a part of the society's rat race  but i do not know any other option to survive or save up money other than being a part of the rat race - again  do you guys have any suggestions ,bxtebx

336,Another downside of needing to work,i ve been lurking for a little while and this is my first post  sorry if this doesn t follow the guidelines of this group or if this topic has been covered a lot before  but i m new here so i don t know the ropes yet    so here s my rant  my friend recently started helping me get into the career field that she recently started working in  so that was nice and thoughtful of her to think i would be good at this job  right  well  recently  she has been promising that she will recommend me to potential clients that she thinks would be a good fit for me  and then she has instead recommended her other  friend  to them  i say  friend  because she has known this person for literally a week  i have been friends with her for 5 years    this is just one of many inconsiderate and exhausting things my friend has done recently  and frankly  i need at least a small break from talking to her   so as i m contemplating this  i m thinking about how at this point  the only reason i m not confronting her about her behavior is that i need this job  and i don t want to jeopardize my contact for the job  this is making me realize how much needing to work to have money to feed and shelter myself involves so much emotional and mental manipulation of others  and i absolutely hate that aspect of it  i want to think of myself as an honest  sincere person at all times  but it s so difficult to maintain that under capitalism  has anyone else here experienced something like this or thought about this conundrum ,bvug7j

340,Theory about how all organizations are dysfunctional,so while going through a particularly bad 6-8 months in my last role  i stumbled on the gervais principle  its a semi-humorous take on organizational psychology  but over the last few months i've observed it does work in real life   essentially an organization is three layers   losers  which is the rank and file which actually produce  they've struck a bad economic bargain and trade their time for a paycheck    they know their place in the world and are smart enough to be wary of the organization  they do the bare minimum because they know that extra effort won't be really rewarded  they try to find meaning of life in engaging with other people   clueless  is the middle layer  these were the types who put in extra effort at loser layer despite no reward  the employee of the month aspirants    they're marked for their dumbness  they worked too hard despite a bad economic bargain  and promoted to middle management where they can be used as fall guys  they're married to the org unlike losers   sociopaths  is the top layer  the will-to-power kind  who actually steer the organization  like losers they are wary of the org because they want to dominate  not be dominated   the gervais principle goes    sociopaths  in their own best interests  knowingly promote over-performing losers into middle-management  groom under-performing losers into sociopaths  and leave the average bare-minimum-effort losers to fend for themselves   this is a very barebones view of the idea  the actual idea is fleshed out in over 6 chapters   mind you  its a long  dense read  as with most things  you may not agree with all of it  but it will explain a lot of things going on in offices   link  https www ribbonfarm com 2009 10 07 the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office ,bybwoa
