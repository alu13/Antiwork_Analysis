1,“Jobs” are just more debt that banks use to profiteer from!,fiat currency and the way the elitebankscorporations actually turn profits from debt are relatively well known concepts these days   im fairly certain at this point that whatever word magic was used to create the whole system also now applies to jobs   even supposed well paying jobs careers tm as theyre referred to in the kings english dont actually create or produce anything of value and rarely fulfill a purpose with any measurable result   jobs basically exist nowadays as a column in a spreadsheet that accountants use only as a means to derive profit think interest bonds investments    ,98l95u
2,"I want to quit the corporate life, but feel awful about it.",hi all as you can see in my post history ive written a lot about my unhappiness in my current job ive done everything i can the past month or so to look for a new job in a different field something that would suit me better yet havent landed anything   i cant help but feel jaded with the whole process at this point of dealing with corporations and being tied to them to be able to survive i dont want a cushy corporate job anymore i know this for a fact however id feel awful about quitting it because of my father payed for almost 90 of my college degree it was a very expensive degree too and im very lucky he supported me in it so i feel very conflicted about this issue i know what kind of a lifestyle id like to pursue continuing with my side gig of serving and possibly dancing as well as starting work as a nanny and i know i could make good money with these pursuits but guilt holds me back from doing it   guilt for not adhering to a business woman stereotype like my dear father always wanted me to be guilt because he paid and sacrificed so much to get me through college guilt because he wants me to be stable but i hate the stable 95 life and im already disappointing him by not adhering to my former religion i want to give back to my father and mother and make them happy but i feel this would be taking it a step too far especially seeing im from a traditional workoriented background does anyone have any advice for me,98wj7t

10,So what do we do about it?,just found this sub love it but all of the posts i see are just propagating discussion over the problem  my question is what do we do about it everyones situation and goals are different so im not looking for a one size fits all answer the world is the way it is i suppose we could start a movement but dont expect our culture to change in our lifetime a good amount of jobs out there have to get done or the infrastructure we live in will crumble ie someones got to do it but that someone can be some other brainwashed worked who thrives on exchanging his best years for a wage  still though  if you have no job youve got no income how then do you continue your way of life or how do you alter it to be sustainable  there are groups like rfinancialindependence and rsimpleliving out there that discuss their own strategies but financial independence entails hustling and grinding for a good 15 years before you can live off of your savings and simple living may or may not be the answer depending on where you live and your situation and you could very well not be interested in either as a solution to our antiwork predicament  so then what do you do lets talk about it,982jpd

12,The reason why I'm so passionate about separating work from life.,hi guys i joined this sub a little while ago and have really been loving it so far i wanted toget a little personal with you all about the reason why im even here and why i have the views and attitude that i do towards jobs  just to give you folks a little background i am a 20 year old junior in college who believes that a job is absolutely nothing more than just a method of making money it is not your life it is not what defines you and it does not set your worth   basically from the time i was born up to when i was 17 years old i was a very all around joyous guy i just loved life ask anybody and theyll tell you john my name youre always smiling  john i love how much you laugh john everytime i see you you just make me feel better john youre always so happy  honestly i really was just a happy guy if i ever did get sad about something id get over it in literal minutes life was just full of light   note this next section im about to share with you all is something i never talk about bc i like to act as if just never happened due to how traumatizing it is but for the sake of this post ill share some of the details   but when i turned 18 years old everything started to become dark everything  the main reason for this is that i got my first big boy job that label is such bullshit btw a job is a job and thought this was a huge accomplishment in life i thought i was on my way to making it in life because i got a better paying job as a result i based all of my happiness on this job and saw it as who i was thats the norm in society anyway i was finally able to fit in  go me this job was everything to me i saw my coworkers as my friends i could trust them  the supervisor was always right too nobody should dare to question her she cared about me because i was a proud employee  well every single time i went home i let everything that happened at that job get to me i was no longer john i was employee   i thankfully forgot that cursed number my coworkers who i thought were my friends all started to talk behind my back and just see me as another pair of hands not john  and you know what they were right whoever that person was that was not me i sacrificied my life to a job thinking that this was it and that work always came first no matter what  and no matter how well i tried to do the higherups at that job always found something to scold me about i became depressed for the first time in my life the guy who was notorious for constantly smiling and lifting up people around him was now having increasingly darker amp darker thoughts until they became suicidal i felt worthless at that job i was nothing and outside of it i had no life my life was the job i had stopped loving my passions and the things that used to hold real value i just felt empty all of the time at the time i didnt understand why i just thought this was growing up and i should be proud that i was so devoted to that job   what a fucking fool i was  it wasnt until that same supervisor i loved terminated me after i worked there for a year because i called in due to a severe stomach ache that i finally opened my eyes its a day ill never forget july 15th 2017 thats when i started the process of becoming myself again  i used to get terrified at the thought of losing that job yet when it happened i felt fine i felt perfectly fine as each day passed i felt happier and happier and happier until i finally realized that feeling i constantly had before july 15th was depression the real deal  the thing that i thought would never happen to me when i fully realized what had happened to me i sat down and just thought very hard  thought about the true cause of it and how to never lose myself like that again   the biggest revelation i came to was that a job is not my life its not who i am my life is literally everything outside of that place i rediscovered my passions my values and who i am i became myself again  and stopped letting a place im only at to make money actually have any meaningful  control over my life i stopped putting any real emotions and care into jobs and everybody there because to them im just a tool theyd never admit it but i dont care if they do or not bc i know the truth  it was these realizations that i made that saved my life and allowed me to become myself again its been over a year since this has happened and everything is still awesome  the job ive worked since then has had absolutely no effect on me bc of what i just mentioned  i learned to revolve my life around my life and not some hellhole i dont even be at in the first place  i get my money and go because ive got a life to live      ,98z8mi
13,What would you do if you really didn't have to work anymore?,im asking here because i think that you all have probably thought about this way more than i have and my life is kind of in a tail spin right now  im early forties and i dont have to work i was let go from my job last year due to the department closing but i was encouraged to come back as a fill in at the main hospital i decided that i am too old to be working a mix of nights and days full time some weeks no time others and at the whim of everyone else  i had always made about 3 times what my husband made so my working was essential to having a fair to good standard of living but due to wage stagnant in my profession and a huge raise for him over the past few years he now makes enough to cover the necessities  his job is something that he would do even if he didnt get paid he just loves it even on the hard days mine was a sacrifice i made to get the money i wanted so we decided that i dont have to work if i dont want to  i dont know what to do with myself anymore i didnt realize how much of my self worth was tied to my job i see every help wanted sign as a prod to be productive but the wages offered are an insult  what reading material podcast youtube channel or whatever can you recommend to change my perspective i need a wake up call that says stop feeling sorry for yourself and take advantage of this rare and wonderful opportunity  sorry if this sounds all humble braggy or insults people still stuck in the struggle but i did work hard for many years and if i didnt have an equal partner with whom i have always shared everything i would not be in this position i know how lucky i am ,983my2

17,Just had a great vacation,seriously not that i traveled anywhere and stuff just went home to my folks and my good friends earlier summers ive had some work days here and there and no uninterrupted vacations this time my horizon just consisted of time that i could spend doing whatever for the first time since i was much younger and thats what ive donesocializing went to some hikes in my area helped my friend moving some shit after a social event fishing in the ocean and just gave it away to people who wanted it ive been pretty poor due to my vacation but ive been spending very little money  man vacations are really awesome ive never felt healthier more complete more emotionally secure ive been sleeping like baby active creative more sure of my identity and had better and more fulfilling connections with people ive come to realize that capitalism actually robs workers of this natural vitality and turns it into profit leaving us sick damaged and miserable seriously extracting profit from our health why should it be considered a vice to demand more leisure i thought the whole point of technology was to give us more free time to just be human beings we seriously need to fight for its abolition as soon as possible so that living loving hoping dreaming feeling human hearts all over the world dont have to be churned through this alienating grinder  sorry just found this sub and felt like sharing this rant i hope its appropriate,93zsgj
18,"My problem with the term ""day off"".",im sure that most people who use this word dont really think that hard about so please guys dont think im trying to call you out with this point just raise awareness i will admit that this is a small annoyance but i still think its post worthy lol  people tend to always mention how much they look forward to their days off and act as if theyre some rare treasure that should be viewed as a privilege to have  please please stop days that you dont go to a job arent your days off these are your days this is your life who you are days that you go to a job are your days on  those should be seen as the foreign events that are treated differently not the days that you actually live the life you were gifted with  to me when someone says day off its like theyre saying that their life is now in the back seat and the days they go to some shit job are now the main focus of everything no no no  do not live to work   ,9852l5
