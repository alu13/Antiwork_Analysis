1,"Don't you hate this kind of ""arguments""?",i'm talking about those arguments that sound lefty but are not more than a continuation of the exchange-value society and commodification of human lives  for example  when debating access to healthcare or education  most would say you  deserve it  because you  produce  instead of arguing in favour of it as a basic right of every human being  therefore just reproducing the logic of productive and unproductive labour  or the disciplining of human lives for capital's sake  as a  permit  to ask for use-values  even when defending inmigrants  the left is prone to say  but they are workers too  or  they pay taxes too  which is just missing the point   this reproduction of the work-ethic and abstract labour power sickens me  maybe i'm just an idealist  but i know we can go further than just criticize distribution or exploitation of the working class  we should strive to criticize the basis of our society  our mode of producing and thinking about labour and our lives too  this is the big challenge today more than ever  and with the decline of formal work  it will be the debate to come and to win ,8y2jzf
