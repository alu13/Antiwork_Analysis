3,Feeling helpless and exhausted,"I know this isn't a therapy subreddit or whatever, but I figure yall will understand me and won't just call me lazy and shit. 

I fucking hate work. Work is hell. I dissociate all week and then spend the weekend recovering from the misery of the week that's ended and mentally, spiritually, and emotionally buckling up for the week that's about to begin.

It's hard for me to imagine any job that doesn't make me want to kill myself. It's not the content of the work- my job right now is bullshit, I work 25 hours a week but only really have maybe 4-6 hours of actual work, the rest of the time I fuck around on reddit mostly- and I can think of a few things that I would actually love to do that I could also make a living doing- rather it's the nature of work itself, the inherent alienation of work; the fact that I *have* to do it to survive. Even if I was doing something that in itself I genuinely loved, felt passionate about, dedicated to, it would become lifeless and oppressive in the very fact of it *being work*. 

I'm so tired of working. I'm just a young kid and I've got my whole life ahead of me and I'm already fucking sick of it. How am I going to live my whole life spending most of my waking hours working? How do yall deal with it?",False,76q6pa,vilennon,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/76q6pa/feeling_helpless_and_exhausted/,22,25
4,Capitalism doesn't offer motivation to work,"Today, whether you work or not, it does not matter. Your country is going to be parasited by the usual parasites. Whilst, in a socialist system, you know that every day you go to work, counts. You know that after years of work, you will see your country change and your life change. Capitalism does not offer such a motivation. Why try anyways?! Maximum i will try is to bring this system to its knees",False,78xmbr,yes_no_username,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/78xmbr/capitalism_doesnt_offer_motivation_to_work/,36,15
