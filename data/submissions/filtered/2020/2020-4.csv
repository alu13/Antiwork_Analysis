1,Front Line Bosses?,him billon  timjdillon  it would be nice to see people starting to open parts of the economy safely but lets do the undercover loss show now too like what better time to put the ceo on the front lines with the workers right seems like a fun time for that show im sure ceos would do it right ,g8fn3e
2,My manager edits every task I do,okay so i got my first fulltime job in comms 4 months ago and my manager has been editing every single task ive been doing so far the edits are usually not even improvements i think but a different way of putting things is this sth all managers do when hiring a junior it really demotivates me and makes me feel like whatever i do is not good enough and needs to be changed this is not my first work experience for the context,g9lapg
3,Questionable decisions,were all stuck at home and the company that i work for forced us to use up our vacation hours before june 8th why they didnt say the vp said in a videoconference that they deemed their decision fair and equitable which is in my opinion exactly what someone who made an unfair and inequitable decision would say  my guess is that a lot of people are paid without doing their usual workload like me which means that theyre probably just being paid for wasting time so my company had the absolute genius idea to force everyone to take their vacation now instead of in the summer when they would have normally taken them   how are we supposed to take our minds off work when we have all been working from home and were stuck at home how is it relaxing that our reality literally wont change at all when we do go on vacation how do you expect people to enjoy their vacation in a time where they cant leave their house you know your employees wont be able to enjoy themselves and you dont care all you care about is making money and youre losing more than youre gaining at the moment which makes you take dumb and selfish decisions like this one   but should i be grateful to still have a job should i be grateful that i get to do my coworkers job because shes on vacation even though it was completely unplanned and im untrained and unprepared for it i never asked for this  fuck this company fuck the plans i had to look for another job in may fuck all of this,g9nsyu
4,Linkedin is garbage &amp; I'm paying for this,debating on deleting my paid subscription for linkedin i really dont know if its worth it   before the pandemic it was ok i mostly used it as a tool to see whats going on within the industry but now its nothing but an asslicking contest and it makes me sick i understand this has been talked about on reddit already but i really need to blow off this steam as well  its almost as if youre a lazy pos during covid if you dont start learning at least 1 language write a book take a class and post about it too not to mention all of these shitty graphics like leaders never stop learning  makes me sick and im making myself sick look at me touting other people for learning and bettering themselves i love to learn i loved it even more when i was younger i was so excited about science engineering space meteorology we shouldnt be down on people who are bettering themselves     but is this really bettering yourself i feel like it isnt its a lookatme fest its a factory line are they really learning because they want to or are you posting about reading a book and taking a radio frequency online class because your connected with the ceo and want him to see or connected to other upper management and feel like you want to oneup them  ampx200b  its almost like im a total piece of shit for not doing this garbage part of me is depressed and the little girl is me is like what are you doing but this isnt for goodness or good intentions or returns anymore  my pandemic has been full of writing and playing skyrim in a work of capitalism and watered down returns in the jobs of today its not worth going out of my way to lick the soles off of a boot right now ill get nothing in return  ampx200b  meanwhile i can lie and said i did something during covid and make a similar claim of something totally impressive that i did ive witnessed that most people who got ahead in my workplace lied lied and lied again most money making places ive worked for have this one thing in common lie,g8fotl

8,What I hate about non-remote work: Physical and mental discomfort,just a pointless rant from me i dont know about you guys but what i hate and absolutely despise the most when it comes to conventional full time nonremote jobs is the horrible discomfort that comes with spending 8 hours a day in a place that isnt even designed for this purpose to begin with  1 you cant grab a normal full meal for breakfast and dinner in most of the workplaces  youre forced to eat cold andor unhealthy snacks that only fill you up for a moment i always end up with chronic upset stomach after a few weeks of working non remote and all of these starchy snacks give me bad breath add coffee to the mix and i end up with zombie breath oh did i mention the normalization of caffeine intake turn your life into an anxious depressed mess with daily coffee or energy drinks because otherwise you will drop from sleep deprivation 2 depending on what kind of person you are and what job you have you might have to carry a shit ton of stuff every day with you i need a fresh tshirt because i sweat so fast lots of food and water laptop mouse cables chargers a coat because its freezing in the morning and hot in the afternoon some hygiene products im a woman this all adds up to several kilograms of shit i have to carry my back is ruined because of this even though i use only backpacks 3 toilet anxiety  nuff said some people unfortunately including me have a very hard time using toilets anywhere else besides your apartment 4 being forced to stand for whole day  bless every poor person that has to do it my first jobs were all retail and we werent allowed to sit down besides the 15 minutes of break we got every day ruined back and physical fatigue in the name of what selling goddamn food and clothes which client cares about your posture 5 being forced to speak to unpleasant people  this is turbo anxiety inducing for me being required to nag customers in retail is another level of awful these people dont want to speak to you most of the time and they want to run away from you so both parties involved in this mess are uncomfortable but the manager will insist you ask everyone what theyre looking for and nag them with product suggestions because you need to increase sales nobody wants retail workers harrassing and nagging them and yet we as a society still insist on making people do it and lets not even mention being forced to talk to unpleasant managers and coworkers 6 lack of proper sleep  unless you go to sleep at 9 pm and thus never get any time for personal lifehobbies you will be sleep deprived i feel like the society will never stop forcing people to wake up at ungodly hours in the name of some absurd shit that doesnt even matter in other words we dont have free time we only have work and time spent on either recovering from or preparing for work this is absolutely fucked up  what are other things that bring you discomfort at work,g81ay8

11,4 Days Left Until I Return to Slavery,our president announced that some most industries will be allowed to operate after the 1st of may weve been on lockdown for just over a month     ive been working from home despite not receiving payment from our company and will apparently receive payment from an unemployment fund from the government ive been interrupted on weekends and public holidays to cancel invoices and add items to catalogues but i would take that over having to return to the office     when im at the office i cant glance at my phone without feeling guilty and being nervous of my manager and coworkers scornful glares or worse the panic when my boss walks in and my heart stops     i have to snap to the demands of at least 10 other people on any given day while being on standby for answering the phone and having to ensure my own work is completed and fulfill any customer request for statements invoices or the completion of documents its fucking ridiculous my time isnt my own in the slightest its rare for me to even get an uninterrupted lunch break     im dreading going back to being exhausted day after day this lockdown is the best thing thats ever happened to me and i will never be so lucky ever again from here on i wont ever have more than 2 weeks at the end of each year where my time will be my own,ga63oy
12,It frustrates me that I'm not pro work,i get asked so what do you want to do you have to get a full time job etc etc and while my mind will flirt with maybe writing or art or childcare i never make anything of these ideas which is a big seperate issue for me  long term there is nothing that i want to do sometime i think about quitting my job that i have now just to force myself into crisis mode though id probably just fuck around  it scares me thought i winding up in a shitty fill time job until im 70 and can retire and have societies permission to live my life worst is i dont think theres anything ill ever excell at i just dont think my mind is configured that way the alternative is ill wind up doing nothing anyway since ill have little money all my life,ga2wzu
13,"About page of ""your next holiday"" site",hi all  slightly different than most of the content on here but my friend made a when is your next holiday sitehttpscanadaholidaysca that tells you when your next day off is depending on the part of canada you live in  its got a short but amusing abouthttpscanadaholidayscaabout page description which aligns strongly with the theme of this sub  i get it coping with a bad system rather than changing it but hey it made me smile  ,gaic2m
14,Why do people show such a staunch reluctance and opposition towards change?,seriously it seems that many people view wage slavery as an intrinsic part of human nature rather than a construct of a capitalistic state whenever you mention that not everyone thrives in or enjoys such a system they compare your ideals to those of failed regimes accuse you of advocating for a world where mass starvationpoverty is rampant while ignoring the fact that these things already exist in the world today and that people want a solution to these issues that our current system isnt providing   go to any major city and you will see many of the impoverished or homeless being treated poorly due to the pejorative attitude that these people didnt work hard enough having spent many of my teenage years in lowpay retailfood industry positions i can assure you that those people work harder than a lot of individuals with respectable jobs they are just unfairly compensated for their labour there were people who would walk miles to work everyday because they had no car only to be on their feet for 810 hours with minimal breaks and even if you did take a break the managers would be watching you like a hawk   we would all have swollen feet and sore feet from walking and standing on concrete all day when many people could have done their jobs better if theyd been allowed to sit down every once in awhile but no thats idleness nonetheless i havent worked there in two years and i still have issues with my feet and back im only 20 years old  managers knew they could bully people lower in the chain i was called retarded for having autism chastised for not finishing all my work when we were understaffed  and told that if i stayed longer i would not be paid i helped people when i did not have to and they took advantage of my kindness i lost my job for calling out when i was frequently sick back when i was naive i thought all that i needed to escape this cycle was to get a stem degree and work for a company that paid more than peanuts oh how wrong i was  if youre autistic chances are youve faced lapses in education or employment in a lot of situations that sort of hardship is a deal breaker for an employer because it supposedly shows you are unreliable which in the working world is code for you arent going to bend over backwards for the company or you have some sort of condition that requires us to accommodate you we just wont hire you instead   i get rejected from every internship or apprenticeship i apply to despite having a not terrible 36 gpa learning languages winning awards in academic clubs constantly doing shit i dont want to do to try and compensate for my disabilities bad interview skills and lack of attractiveness and connections the only time i got temporary employment was under a scheme for underrepresented lowincome and minority students in stem and that quickly ended   my heart sank when i realised all this effort is for nothing my degree will be in the biological sciences which means i am confined to shitty office roles or minimum wage lab tech roles ive been working unpaid in a research lab for months because i have no other way to get experience the best part is that i dont really enjoy anything i just find the laboratory work less mind numbing then office droning or physical labour and i can sit down when my back aches  i wanted to go to graduate school then i realised you essentially live in poverty for years while working unpaid overtime for the benefit of your pi and university academia is cutthroat and relies heavily on good ole boy culture much like how industry relies on illusory professionalism and knowing the right people who can vouch for your resume to make it to the top of the pile  yet the majority of people seem complacent and content with this to speak out against a world where your worth is tied to how productive you can be to an employer is almost social suicide i have been told to just get an attitude adjustment to suck it up and work harder and to find a career i enjoy   most jobs are difficult for me due to having autism and ptsd even if i was interested it isnt that i dont want to work at all its that i am incapable of working 8 hours a day which is nothing but an arbitrary standard that does not correlate with productivity   like i said skilled lab work pays close to minimum wage anything that i used to enjoy like programmingproblem solving becomes stressful in a fastpaced workplace environment where mistakes are not allowed things i took pleasure in as a child such as painting gardening and sewing arent profitable especially not at my skill level   i think its natural and expected for a lot of us to be unhappy when we live our lives on a ball and chain to the almighty dollar you sacrifice your passions relationships your time to line someone elses pockets with cash work culture has ruined my relationship in a way as my partner has changed dramatically since he got a 95 cubicle drone job he has called me stupid for saying that many jobs like his are useless and that i think its unethical for him to work 12 hours a day sometimes due to flexihours where he may be allowed to leave early one day if he works longer shifts in return oh also im lazy and want free money according to him because i think many professions are asinine   he thinks that his profession is altruistic simply because its in the public sector and that i am selfish because i dont see the benefit to humanity of someone filling out excel spreadsheets and having meetings all day  ive been called nasty and selfish because i said that you shouldnt bend over backwards for bosses who dont give a damn about you they underpaid him for months because he was hired through a disability agency now suddenly its okay because he finally got promoted theres nothing i can say or do because he is brainwashed into the autistic person pulling themselves by the bootstraps to be successful by having a respectable job  narrative  why are people so reluctant to see the flaws in this system or want to change it why is anyone who dislikes it considered a whiner who simply didnt grind enough i really dont get it,gazc6n

24,Anyone else wanting to just check out of classes n' stuff? (Rant),   background junior in college  im a fairly lazy person i have adhd and i physically cannot sit still and read a book unless its really engaging i procrastinate to all hell especially when its work that i know or think i know i can do well on within the last minute as an aside i do have ocd general anxiety and i likely also have depression but that remains to be diagnosed      so with that said the quarantine has made things go from oh this is manageable i can still contribute and be a good student albeit not a model one to fuck it i dont care i just want to die i feel dread about having to make an arbitrary number of 150 word posts every week for classes go to zoom classes and talk to people and i just am generally depressed being online as much as i am is shit for my health and ability to talk to people too despite being a really introverted person i would rather do nonacademic things such as modding or writing lore for roleplaying games and i am generally happier when i do those things  i feel horrible for not wanting to do this work but like part of me is annoyed that my fellow students are expected to just be able to function im sure some of us can but not all of us and i think  thats acceptable when theres a literal crisis going on      so uh anyone else feel the same way why not just cut this semester out and do it next year everythings fucked up anyways so whywhy not,gaj4we

(Rant),there was a ask reddit post that said basically how did you escape the 95 hell there was plenty of good advice but one guy suggested four ten hour days instead of five eights i said its your fantasy dude you can work four or six hours for four days doesnt have to be 40 hrs  the next guy to reply to me was like her der why not just not work why not get freeeeee moneeeey but of course he was taking himself seriously   like a universal basic income yeah man that would be great  i dont think anyone should work more than 20 hrs a week tops and even then there are caveats you should be paid fairly good benefits interesting work etc and even then capitalism is jank and i hate it but thats another post    i think a ubi would be great i dont think working four ten hour days is an improvement over five eights  i didnt want to feed the trolls but i did want to rant why the fuck do these people value their home lives and personal well being so poorly why are they so invested in working every fucking second of those forty hours like dude you can like your life you are allowed to have gasp fantasies that are not in service of your middle manager of a boss good god people better is possible work is literally the worst part of life get a fucking hobby,gaf1ss
28,Sick of work and the neverending to-do list,okay im definitely not the first one to write about this but i need to rant  whenever i talk about how i hate working to my friends and family 99 of them will say everyone hates working suck it up   but then a lot of them ended up complaining about how bored they were after like two days of quarantine  meanwhile i feel like it has been going by way too fast although i still had to work part time and do schoolwork online and like im in paradise  anyway i got news today that i might be going back to the office soon and i am just dreading it i am 25 and have tried several career paths teaching translation office jobs etc and part time jobs   i recently quit my customer service job for an office job and thought it would help my mood because i hate dealing with obnoxious people and although i do feel less annoyed i also feel wayyyyy more bored and zombielike sitting in front of a computer 8h a day   it seems like nothing ever satisfies me enough to not make me groan when my alarm goes off or not make me spend my life waiting for the weekend i always end up getting sick of everything its not the job its having to work period  i sound like a lazy ass but i really am not i do all my schoolwork ahead of time my home is always neat and clean and i am a very reliable and hard worker i just hate the obligation like i love reading but i would hate being forced to read 8h a day 40h a week   i hate having to exchange hours of my life when the work could often be done much more quickly just so i can live with a bit of comfort and be so exhausted at the end of the day that i dont even have time to do things i actually enjoy not to mention that in many jobs you need to wait years until you get decent salary and time off   i dont want to spend my life waiting for the weekend and retirement but i cant help it  i have a lot of different interests but a lot of them dont pay and i need some kind of stability and no matter what job i do nothing will ever compare to the freedom of doing whatever i want whenever i want  i just want a little  house in the woods and free time i have so many things i want to do i could retire tomorrow and never be bored i want to write read watch series play videogames do puzzles learn languages learn to draw play the piano dance travel spend time with loved ones and 2 days a week and 23 weeks off is not enough for me i just end up feeling overwhelmed by all the things i want to do    anyway right now im aiming for work at school librairies to at least have summers off and be surrounded by books but even that might not make me happy for 40h for 30 years plus getting a permanent job is going to take a while too  i guess i just needed to get this off my chest or im hoping someone would give me some miracle solution or at least tell me they feel the same way i feel like there should be more to life than this stupid routine and todo lists   until then ive resorted to buying lottery tickets every now and then  ,gafowy

35,The overreaction is helping companies put us in our place.,every time the american economy gets going good we programmers can start demanding close to executive salaries buying the cars they buy vacationing in italy like them buying houses like theirs eating at restaurants like theirs etc  executives hate that but more importantly owners and investors hate that so each time the job market heats up like that and programmers become hard to find those at the top start training more nonamericans to be programmers in order to keep us in our place they could train americans but they train nonamericans instead and when that doesnt work they crash the economy to keep us in our place but this time even those two tactics arent enough so they had to force an overreaction to the virus  now that has enabled them to cut our salaries too the ownersinvestors could take a loss which is part of the risk of investing in or owning a business but instead they are making the employees take a loss they could take on debt but instead they are making employees take on debt they decided to take a riskier path instead of becoming an employee and employees decided to become an employee instead of taking all that risk but now owners are breaking the deal and making employees take all the risk  things would be different if there were hundreds of thousands of companies and thus far more competition among them but government has created an environment for decades now that empowers a few crony corporations to suck up all their competitors and which makes starting a new company too difficult with all the laws regulations lawsuits banking rules selective enforcement corruption government contracts nepotism and poorly educated labor pool who attended government schools if that isnt enough what do you think the cia would do to any outsider company that was a threat to an insider company  the federal government alone spends 4 trillion dollars per year and yet some people think the solution to government is more government but government is a problem masquerading as its own cure  imagine how much the cronies would like to make us all as dependent as possible on government then they could really keep us in our place,g865ha

39,The amount of encouragement for antinatalism on this sub is getting annoying...,it feels like every other comment is pushing antinatalism and that one cant be true antiwork if they arent antinatalist like what i was under the impression that most of us are antiwork because we see the beauty of life and that the current status of work prohibits us from spending enough time with our family friends hobbiespassions and just living life in general   even though i personally dont agree with antinatalism i am not here to debate against it you have your outlook on life and i have mine my issue is with the comments or posts on this subreddit that are strong pushing antinatalism and the idea that if you are antiwork but not antinatalist then you are a hypocrite,g8ihzy
40,Terrified of lockdown being over/unsure what job to work in,hey everyone i dont know if this kind of post is okay or will get any attention really i guess i might just need to vent a little   im 19 years old from austria i struggle with major depression anxiety and i have very frequent migraines all of them since around the age of 10 school has always been horrible but i still finished my higher education which means im trained in office jobs and sales jobs   ever since i finished school ive worked 3 months as an office person which was absolute hell company also put me in a wrong department which probably made it a lot worse so i quit there after getting suicidal again i was without a job for a bit joined a training course for photoshop lessons in january thought maybe media design would make me happy and since im well versed with any drawing program i get most of my money from digital art it was super easy   the course was also hard for me mentally but it was only half days 4 days a week and i met the love of my life there and we could stick through it together the course was also about applying to jobs which was prob the hardest thing no knowing what i wanted except maybe tattoo i was encouraged enough to try my luck at an tattoo parlour after none of the media design jobs wanted me and i actually found a studio   being an apprentice there was great at first no moneyinsurance or anything the studio owner wasnt much older than me and struggled with depressionanxiety as well i learned a lot there for maybe 3 months then things started to change quickly they only said horrible things about the tattoos i made no nice words at all his wife the piercer there suddenly also wanted to tattoo etc etc basically i got suicidal again and the bullied me a lot i wanted to pull through tho until winter that year cause then id open my own business and work in his studio aka he cant tell me anything well i was wrong i was basically treated like dirt for a year and nothing ever changed my parents bought me out of the contract  im terrified to tattoo or draw at this point im terrified to work my already low self esteem was completely crushed there im slowly picking up drawing again and i think atm my favourite job would be a freelance artist but surviving on that is super hard im also not gonna have insurance end of next month unless i get a jobpay for it myself or marry my bf lolso im really really lost i though of tattooing again but it scares me so much and im not good enough i thought maybe an office job but phone calls give me major panic attacks or maybe a sales job but my social anxiety and not being too good to work under pressure dont mix well with that  so my big question is what can someone like me do is there even hope for a job that wont destroy me something maybe where i dont have to do much and can draw so i can maybe escape at some point,g90h20
41,From The Consumer by Michael Gira,the ideal worker  it work im dead flesh waiting to be eaten i enjoy feeling that way i want someone else to inhabit my body i want them to use me by time otherwise is useless when im given a specific task im not punished with my mind which i despise i need my superiors because they save me from myself by only ambition is to become more pliable more inert i want my mind to be open to my superiors i want them to be able to read it at all times when theyll punish me for my involuntary hatred of they punish me correctly theyll wipe my mind clean that will feel good  1984 ,g99lsr

53,Why do a lot of people hate people that choose to coast in life?,i am a self admitted coaster myself i am not ashamed to admit it  although i coast i still work very hard in the right circumstances i just do not believe in unneeded toil  i do work i am in the army but even here i am basically going to stay in as minimally as possible while obtaining as much certification as possible that will lead to a somewhat cushy well paying job in the civilian world i view it more as a relatively fun business opportunity that i am not totally emotionally invested into  even still i try to do things as much my way as possible and not over stress in basic training for example i would pay people that didnt care about getting caught to burn shine my boots a method that takes about 20 minutes at most and makes them look significantly shinier than the other recruit who spends hours spit shining them during this time i would instead catch up on some much needed sleep i dont feel like the pointless toil would of made me any more disciplined  and i excelled during important physical portions and weapons training stuff that actually mattered    another example about 3 times a week  we would all get together for group pt its usually pretty much cross fit anyway one guy in our unit has the give all effort for everything attitude that i find largely obnoxious and pointless for such irrelevancy and of course he injures himself twice missing out on opportunities while i am coasting though setting unit records because i have smartly built my cardio and strength at my own progression over the years   i used to own my own business before the army i am not to proud to admit that it failed pretty much due to inexperience and personal crisis even still i worked very hard 100  hour weeks and had established a moderately successful sales business that was mostly passive i also attended networking events with other entrepreneurs and many had the same mentality work insanely hard early for an easier ride later on when i start another business inevitably this is the end goal have an easier life and more passive income that is essentially what owning a business is of course another minority of these people took no interest business loans from their already wealthy parents so it was always a coast  one person i always look up to is an old forex trader that was a friend of my ex girlfriends dad i have dabbled in forex myself and asked him for tips and opinions on my charting he thought i was on the right track and shared much of the same mentality i do i told him how people would laugh at me and mock me for trying so hard to learn how to trade stocks because of my background and apparent lack of education he responded to me saying he had experienced much of the same scrutiny until he started making it big and that the average person likes to drag you down because they are preprogrammed to do so because the media makes it seem so unachievable without already having a level of education unachievable to the common person this man is multimillionaire with no formal training and spends all his time traveling going to his cottage playing guitar with local bands and smoking pot i strive to be able to do pretty much the same thing  i am not ignorant to the fact that a lot of people do not like me for what i am or what the perceive me as i have been slacker based insult both to my face and behind my back but a lot of people do like me as well and from what i have experienced already in life the 40 hour plus workweek is pretty much a trap and the vast majority of successful people i have personally met people that live off a passivesemi passive income and are well off not people making six figures and working themselves to death share the same mentality and try to separate themselves from unnecessary toil and actually enjoy life,gajxel

55,"We're being taken advantage of at work, what should we do?",ive worked at a company thats been going downhill for the last few years it was a toxic work environment and there was a lack of work even before this ongoing economic crisis happened i was laid off a few weeks ago and ended up receiving much more through unemployment due to the recent cares act than i ever did working fulltime a few weeks ago i recieved a call from an hr assistant sounding like they were reading a script  hi is this name im calling from company name to let you know youre rehired   weve had problems with others not answering us so we called from a separate number to increase the chances youd pick up you are unable to reject an offer of employment without losing your benefits if your performance is unsatisfactory during the time were rehiring you you will be fired and youll receive no benefits  weve received a loan which is contingent on rehiring our old staff we acknowledge most you are now making more money from unemployment but we wont be matching it we want to inform you that the loan only covers the next few months and well likely have to lay you off again when the loan runs out so please make necessary arrangements unfortunately this would also be when the additional unemployment benefits from the cares act goes away so you wouldnt be receiving any extra money than either unless new laws are passed   everyone is upset about this the feeling is that we were tricked into working for a worse version of unemployment and we have no leverage our supervisor continues to talk about bringing more people back despite the lack of work its not a tradeoff of financial aid for job security for most people and ive been extremely stressed  do you have any advice for me or suggestions on what youd do in this situation,gb4ntp

129,Should I even apply for 9-5s after the pandemic?,hey all this is going to be a long super personalanecdotal vent so i hope its right place for it if not im sorry in summary i dont know how to motivate myself to apply for jobs anymore or even if i should   i hold very strong ethical positions which has made retaining a 95 increasingly difficult a few years ago i was the assistant manager of a retail store and our branch called a meeting in early november i was making 2 over minimum wage at that time and all of our employees who were not agmsgms or above were making minimum wage and being forced to work split shifts on a tiered system where none worked over 30hours a week they were contractually obligated to not moonlightonly work this job during the meeting the manager said a memo had come down from head office which indicated there would be no time off given from november 15th january 3rd and those who worked over the holidays would be given 15x rate of pay everyone in the room became really gloomy because we all knew that this also meant split shifts would be used to ensure nobody actually made more than their regular rate anyway a girl who started a month earlier raised her hand and said she was from the other side of the country and always travels home over the holidays to see her family and that she had already booked her nonrefundable 600 tickets for 3 days over christmas our manager said sorry my direction is that if you choose to take a vacation anyway there wont be job for you here when you come back this girl lowered her hand nearly in tears at that i raised my hand immediately after and said i quit then walked out of the meeting and returned my keysuniform the next day   i cannot stomach situations like that where people clearly dont matter and are as good as slaves i feel physically ill when im forced to participate in something so contrary to humanity and my beliefs and have quit a number of jobs because of similar scenarios even when they dont affect me   most recently i found a dream job that paid a lot more in an industry im passionate about the company clearly cared about people and made huge efforts to be the best employer of its kind i loved going to work every day then we were acquired by an umbrella company higherups who were behind the people first decisions were suddenly being let go and the direction of the company turned to profit we laid off huge numbers of our retail staff and created a tier system where only 12 staff could be on the floor at a time whereas it had previously been 45 so essentially the retail staff that remained were doing twice the work for the same pay as before the sinking feeling in my stomach began to creep up again   then the pandemic hit because of the dream position i was in i became a part of the decisions about the actions we would take as a company in response without getting into specifics the decisions that were being made were entirely about profit and very clearly put our staff and customers at risk i was the lone voice of opposition to these decisions as a result my boss had several phone calls with me where they reinforced that our goal was to make sure our stores were making us a shitload of money as safely as possible but the safe part of that was completely mia and everyone knew it my opposition to decisions became increasingly heated as employees started contacting our head office with complaints and some simply stopped showing up for work   i made an anonymous comment on a reddit post that was titled do you think your employer is handing the pandemic correctly wherein i didnt state the company name my name or specifics of any kind but just said no i dont think my company should even be open as were not essential what i refrained from writing was that i didnt know if i could sleep at night understanding that decisions i was a part of would likely get people working for us making minimum wage killed eventually   to my surprise but in hindsight not really a taskforce had been enacted within the company that was reviewing industry social media to identify employees who had a problem with the companys response they had randomly found my comment and traced it back to me and then confronted me about it i quit i should have quit sooner but i was idealistic and remembered the company as it was when i joined it not as it was now   my issue now is what comes next how do i motivate myself to give a shit about a 95 ever again knowing that when push comes to shove it will inevitably place profits and growth above its people i want to help people i got a degree in a field with the intent of doing just that but of course there were no jobs i honestly feel like if i have to keep rinse and repeating this situation with employers my mental health will be at stake which it already is and not to be melodramatic but i could see myself spiralling pretty quickly into a suicidal state   i havent been able to force myself to apply for anything or even consider job hunting since i quit at this point where all the cards on the table and clear to read i believe that contributing to this sick system actually hurts more than it helps and i have considered instead turning to the black market and tor and maybe participating in credit card fraud or something to put food on the table and only targeting the ultra rich that would be more of a help to the world and make it a better place that being a cog for a shitty corporate overlord that is greasing our path to extinction and total ecological collapse   what other choices do i havewhat are your suggestions   by the way i realize how privileged this sounds millions of people would be clamoring for the opportunity just to have a job and my jobs werent all bad but thats exactly why i feel the way i do i have enough privilege to choose whether i have to work for a shitty company or not without immediately facing starvation so how can i do anything but choose to oppose it those millions of people dont have a choice they will work those jobs and not have the ability to gawk at something as first world as vacation limitations or the ethical repercussions of what theyre supporting but i can having been lucky enough to be born where there are some social safety nets   why not use my privilege to make the capitalist machines life a bit harder instead of what its

136,Any lawyers here? Former Lawyers? Law Students?,what a rat infested salt mine of a profession eh currently in law school going into my final year if i werent on a full scholarship i would bail i thank god at least once a day i didnt take the offer at the swanky school wherein i wouldve been paying money to subject myself to this shit show i clerked with a big firm last summer and it made me want to blind myself before jumping out of the 16th floor window i thought i was being punked when i was introduced to the partners surely it was a cruel joke that i was supposed to treat solemnly and respectfully these obscenely dull insentient morons whove traded their whole life force and souls for an awful jobto become a caricature in a tailored suit and as a result hate themselves and everybody else for itqueue bowies life on mars and bring out the hidden cameras  by thursday on the first week i realized i was going to spend the summer getting as many free lunches as i could drinking all the gourmet coffee in the lobby and fucking off out of there as early as i could everyday without getting canned on an up note what they paid me was startling and it was enough money to cover my living expenses for about a year and a half i live frugally i deliberately provided them with fuckall in terms of work product my own humble personal contribution to the fight against the dying of the light however insignificant it may be   the most disturbing part of the whole thing and the what brings me to post on this sub is the fact that legal education and the legal profession actually cultivate a completely unbalanced and toxic work culture and then proceed to uphold it as a badge of honor toward which lawyers should strivewhen its actually a piece of calcified shit that has somehow become rancid and needs to be thrown in the trash in some cases this macho work culture is weaponized and used as a litmus test barrier to entry as in if you cant hack it you dont belong argh its all very fanatical and disturbing its as if being a basket case who is estranged from their family friends community and selves is actually something that is admirable and the mark of a dedicated professional its stunning and if i wasnt living it i would think it was straight out of a funky dystopian paperback   i think the hardest part of this whole thing has been watching the psychosocial train wreck that has been the metamorphosis of my 150 classmates from what seemed like for the most part decent wellintended humans into sycophantic anxious insecure and hysterical workaholics whove developed such severe myopia that they have trouble seeing that the jobs theyre all hitting each other over the head to obtain are actually destructive for the people doing them and for the communities in which they are operating  so any lawyers or law students on here exlawyers wouldhavebeenlawyers that had the wherewithal not to take the plunge thoughts from everyone are appreciated of course i want to say that what i love so much about this sub is that it is the antithesis of everything that law school and the legal profession stand for sitting in class in a room full of 150 of the most careerist apple polishing boot lickers ive ever met its surfing this sub somedays that keeps me sane be well and godspeed everyone,g5ukma

166,The last weeks have made me realise employers give 0 shits about their employees | Pressured to agree to have my hours cut.,like so many others my employment was affected by the covid 19 measures im a barista before the government announced the mandatory measures we already had noticeably fewer guests so i got less hours even before we closed  then my boss decided to close the store completely for the time being except he didnt even bother telling us i read it on the companys facebook page the cafe is part of a chain so that was great really respectful way to treat employees that have been with the company for years s obviously   i was desperate for a new job and applied to a couple of job listings for supermarket and drugstore jobs no word from them applied to a few more got a job offer from a temp agency through which i could work at a drugstore  they were sort of shady from the start during the job interview they made it seem like id always be in the same store which quickly turned out to be untrue within the first few weeks they had the right to end the employment with 1 day notice i live in a country that has laws regarding the amount of notice but temp agencies have extra laws so i always felt on edge and like i could lose my job any moment luckily im now at the stage of employment where they have to give one week notice  the person at the temp agency thats responsible for telling me about my shifts is completely disrespectful and intrusive like when i dont pick up the phone fast enough on my day off he accuses me of staying in bed all day he has called me during my shifts multiple times then gets annoyed when i dont pick up i always get calls on my days off followed by annoyed texts asking why im not picking up  most recently he called me while i was out running errands and lowkey threatened me by saying the drugstore has been making fewer requests for temp workers implying im somehow making a mistake by not being available on call on days off  then claiming i forgot to sign a part of the work contract last month he asked me to come into the office the following day i had a bad feeling in my gut and felt uneasy going there alone but no one had the time to accompany me so spontaneously turned out i was right i was supposed to sign paperwork stating i agree to have by almost 35 starting april 1 right then and there at the reception desk one of the employees went on to explain they have been getting less requests from the drugstore chain than expected resulting in all temp workers having their hours cut if i hadnt signed they would have had to pay me for the hours they had offered me in the beginning but i probably also would have been fired so i signed  i feel so stupid for signing the agreement i was tricked into coming into the office so it would be easier to pressure me i freaking hate being expected to bust my ass and to give up my personal life only to be treated this way  lied to and deceived  and be paid the bare minimum then even getting my hours cut,g7ex5a

187,No human being on Earth ought to be allowed to have more than 25 million dollars - I did the math. What do you think?,is there a rational logical practical or sensible argument to be made for the existence of multi billionaires i never found it to make any real actual sense for any one human being to just hoard immense obnoxious amounts of wealth i mean other than ego boosting nonsense what does it actually even do you your when you have 18 lamborghini and 14 mansions and 5 big fancy boats while 20000 children starve to death every single day on this planet unnecessarily not due to tangible scarcity of food or other resources being produced in the world but to to lack of an elaborate fiction called money in those areas  if a person had 24 million dollars  they would in effect have available to them 21 thousand dollars a month  every month for 100 years  isnt that enough why would anyone need more than that  with 21 thousand dollars available to you every single month  for up to 100 years in to the future  arent you good   you can live in a nice place and have good food clothing transportation medical care etc  is there any good sense and to justify that any human being on earth should have more than 25 million to their name   is it in any way shape or form acceptable to hoard hundreds of millions or billions on a planet with so many homeless and starving people,g5fws5

189,We Cannot Go Back to Normal!,this pandemic has paused ended or restructured a lot of our daily lives we are setting a precedent for new ways of being  some healthy some unhealthy some the same some different  it is now in this space of uncertainty and novelty that we must choose how we want to live we have the power now to choose and reshape our futures  personally professionally economically and politically  notice what aspects of this quarantine you are enjoying maybe its having time to dedicate to something you enjoy whether its spending time in nature with your family calling friends practicing a skill jumpstarting a project having the space to just be cooking meals or whatever it is big or small petty or amazing write it down now what in your life these last few weeks have you been enjoying what has made your life feel new meaningful refreshed or special   give yourself this time and write       now the flip side what about these last couple weeks during this pandemic in quarantine has made you feel off  scared frustrated depressed stressed worried weird insecure etc  be as concrete or abstract as you need to be think about anything tiny in your daily life to large in the system things that you may not like agree with or are uncertain of make a list of those things now   i know its hard to switch gears take a moment a deep breath in clear your head then focus on that gut feeling you have been trying to avoid and write what is contributing to you feeling that way take this time      ampx200b  life is scary confusing and hard life is beautiful impactful and important we are here today simultaneously protecting ourselves our loved ones and society from a virus we are here today following orders obeying authority isolating and worrying we can be dichotomous things at once embrace the contradiction  from my own perspective i am afraid of living in a society that values intangible things like wealth and production over real beings living creatures i feel that is a warped set of values that doesnt meet the humanlevel needs of a society needs like food water shelter community and health we are told there are a lack of resources which is why we must fight with our dollars to secure our basic necessities we are made to believe that we must step on the weaker to secure our place on top we are living in a society that values competition over cooperation and that competition keeps us busy and distracted  takes away our time and emotional resources to step back and realize this may not be a society we want to support  some of us have the time and space right now whether we want to or not to step back and look at what weve been living in to see where the system has benefited us and where it has made it harder for us to be the people we want to be  who do you want to be deep down if our society didnt exist the way it does now  if these pressures expectations assumptions and money werent a factor  who do you want to be  i dont have a concrete label but i have a vague sense i want to be kind i want to help others i want to be in nature more i want to learn about the world i want to be a part of a loving and supportive community whether its a group of friends or a family  i want close relationships where we truly care about one another i want to be a part of a society that empowers individuals to pursue their dreams advocate for their needs and validates their feelings i want community understanding and empathy for differences in experiences and how that translates into ways of being and thinking i want a world based in accepting and uplifting members of a society  i write this feeling it deep in my bones this is where i want to live and fearing that its too utopic to work but why cant it work is it because weve been told that taking care of our communities as if were all family isnt the expectation is it because were told we must fight in order to survive what if we worked together to survive what if we banded together and fought things that hurt our members like waging a war against famine pollution homelessness depression and disease  i want to dethrone the dollar we cant continue to disempower those with less financial support remove their ability to take care of themselves and only allow access to a livable life to those with wealth get rid of money as king and replace it with quality of life not in the way that those with a high quality of life have power but in the way that we as a society value quality of life  obtaining it for ourselves and ensuring that every member of our society is provided a life worth living  food water shelter community health mental and physical   it is important that we realize what we truly value as individuals what do you want and need it is important that we advocate for ourselves no matter the pushback or ridiculousness of our needs it is our society that dictates what is ridiculous no matter how valid it truly is it is our responsibility to take care of each other especially in times of hardship and distress it is our responsibility to ask for help and seek out support when we need it we must ask advocate and fight for what we want and need in our lives for what we know is true and right for what we value and prioritize its not going to be handed to us if we dont ask for it first  pay attention to those that are threatened by the idea of you living a quality life what are they afraid of its not fear of the safety of others  its fear that you might empower people which threatens them being better than you their poor egos empowering people to ask for what they need is crucial and important to creating change it only serves to benefit societies uplift each other and lets create a revolution,g6q3to
190,"Unionizing my workplace during a pandemic... any organizers on here who could offer advice, tips and tricks?",im not really sure where to post this but i have been planting the seeds of sedition in my workplace the past few weeks as we have been deemed essential and thus forced to go to work at considerable risk to our health during the covid19 pandemic i think the seeds are beginning to take root in some of my coworkers five so far are a definite yes having said that they would sign the authorization cards  the thing is i have never worked at a union shop before and have no experience dealing with them at all let alone trying to organize a workplace as i was thinking and talking with my coworkers tonight during a 12 hour shift i realized that we should probably come up with a list of specific demands we want to improve our situations at work and outside of work as best we can but we also want to be realistic and shoot for goals that are reasonably likely to be achievable im not even sure which labor union we should be looking to join to be frank theyre categorized by industry correct  i hope i havent bitten off more than i can chew here i firmly believe that we need to organize here we are working during a goddamned pandemic and we dont get sick time our health insurance sucks and most of us make only 50 to 1 more than minimum wage 12hr minimum wage in maine other situations have happened in the past and i dont want to mention specifics on the off chance that someone would be able to figure out the place and alert management but lets just say they involved callous indifference to human life on the part of the owner he has proven time and again that he does not give a shit about the people who make his fortune for him im not sure he even has any empathy at all towards his fellow humans  so anyway what steps should we be taking other than the fact that we have to pay union dues are there any downsides to union membership as i was talking to some of the people who were there when the current owner took over the plant i learned that the guy has threatened in the past to close up shop if we ever unionized how often do those kinds of threats materialize and how often are they just blowing smoke out their butts  that was long and im getting tired if you got this far thanks for reading and thanks in advance for any advice you can offer ive got another 12 hour shift tomorrow so goodnight all,g722pc

201,All Freelance Work is a Joke,apologies in advance for the long rant but i gotta get this off my chest because none of my other friends and fam understand where im coming from when i talk about how much i fucking hate work hoping to connect with other people who have had similar issues on here  so i started  freelance writing because i thought it would be a great way to monetize my passion and get me out of the corporate world which i loath last year i finally got to a place mentally and financially where i could make it my fulltime gig i thought it was going to be amazing id  be a free agent work when i wanted have tons of time for dream projects and i wouldnt have to kowtow to corporate bullshit  yall i was a fool   turns out that all work is absolute garbage   ive tried different clients and different approaches even becoming more aggressive than i normally would and none of it matters because companies dont see you as a person especially if youre freelance  for one thing no one pays writers market rate anymore because all writing is social mediacontent shitposting they dont even hire writers were all content creators my main client pays me 20hour which sounds decent until you actually look at the numbers for example i can write 70 product descriptions and only see 466 for it because they decided that product descriptions should only take 20 minutes to write   on top of that they assign projects with insane turnaround times because faster is always better there have been many many weeks where ive spent 5 straight hours every day at a computer to get things done and handed in on time so i dont risk my income do these project managers spend their full 8 hour work day at their desk doing work doubtful so why do i get assigned a 20 hour project to be done in 5 days because capitalism   i landed another client who accepted my 50hour rate and i thought i hit the jackpot   they ended up being worse than my low paying clients they asked me to come in fulltime for 23 weeks as coverage i accepted because i thought about all the money i would get imagine my surprise when i was told to only invoice for the hours i spent on the actual project i lost money because that didnt account for travel to and from the office and the hours i wasted in meetings and other office bullshit   i took the hit as a lesson they came back to me earlier this year with another job i asked repeatedly for project scope timelines hours etc so i wouldnt get jacked again and because i had other work on the go they wouldnt give me any details but asked me to hold 35 hours a week for month because they were pretty sure they could fill it  like really you expect me to turn down other work on the prospect of maybe full time work what happens to me when those hours dont get filled i got a little testy and then they blamed me for leaving them in the lurch at the last minute i offered solutions and they ghosted me  now theyre back with another ridiculous offer that i am offended by they want me to work for one of their clients exclusively for months meaning i cant take on other work again theres no hours or rate attached so i have no idea how much ill be earning and theyre asking if im interested  who in their right fucking mind would accept a job offer without a salary no one right so why the hell am i expected to take a freelance gig with no monetary sum being offered as well   i have no idea what to say other than show me the money what am i a charity i give you work and you fucking pay me any offer of freelance work without project ratessalaryhours attached is insulting i have a skill dammit   doing this fulltime made me realize how absolutely soul draining the work force actually is i used to think it was just me and there was something wrong with me i look back at times when i was so stressed out by work culture bullshit and i wonder if i may have been on the verge of a fullon breakdown   but i kept going trying to make it work trying to find a better job dealing with repeated bouts of unemployment taking low wage jobs just to make it work and for what i make less now than i did 10 years ago i got paid better as a summer student in high school than i do now  the only good thing to come out of this is me realizing that i dont actually want a job i want to write and make art hopefully when all this is over i can make the transition to doing that,g7ggfq

222,"How I boycott capitalism, and why you should too!",as many of us know in here we are tired of the corruption rampant in the systems that we live under essentially its practically the same thing globally so i dont think that its necessary to specify any nations or specific struggles  were all aware that the struggle is there and at least some of us have come to the conclusion that the reason the struggle is there is because people choose to participate in the system that causes that struggle  we often feel coerced into servitude by artificial scarcity and find that its easier to buckle down and participate in capitalism while condemning it  this is why i say that if you are within the means to boycott capitalism then you absolutely should  now what i mean by within the means is this you are independent no family to depend on you and believe that you could handle the life that you would live in poverty as a result of boycotting capitalism  now im not saying that you should be homeless or that you shouldnt have a source of income im not even saying that you cant have a job but it would require your own determination for how your boycott of capitalism would play out but i will tell you how i do it  i am schizoaffective and i am unable to work a job without risk to my health so i will admit that i am privileged in this regard but i do believe that my lifestyle is possible for other people but definitely not for all  i am on food stamps and cash benefits while waiting for disability but this is not necessary for everyone that is trying to boycott capitalism and this is only a temporary solution anyway  i am in subsidized housing i used to be homeless so i had a pathway into subsidized housing  i spend very little money and what money i do spend is spent on things that i believe to not contribute to the exploitative aspects of capitalism as much as possible that means that the majority of my cash goes to buying things like pot because i havent seen evidence that the cannabis industry in my state is explicitly exploitative  if there is something that i want or need i will attempt to purchase it second hand before purchasing directly from the source this isnt possible for all things but you can use your own discretion to determine whether or not you think it is worthwhile to spend money on something  now the last thing that i do as part of my boycott and this one is the most important i take the time to understand what i am up against and why and i work to refine my arguments and discuss the issues of capitalism with other people  that is part of my contribution to the world and its a big one in my opinion the world needs more people that are willing to stand up for what is right and to learn about the issues we are facing and work towards solutions  i boycott capitalism not because i do not like to work but because i want to work for people not money  edit i just realized that i implied that i would give a reason for why you should boycott capitalism and i hadnt quite given that reason so im going to do that now i apologize for putting this in the edit because i know that some people might miss it if they see this before the edit  the reason we should boycott capitalism  capitalism as we understand it is a system by which we use a monetary system in order to trade goods and services  this in theory is an excellent system when you believe that there needs to be payment for every service and good provided  i am of the belief that people do not need to be coerced into doing things to continue their own survival as well as the survival of their community i dont believe that we need to be held hostage on the premise of collective survival i believe that the reason it is so common for people to not want to work is because work isnt what its meant to be work isnt a means to continue your survival and comfort if that were the case then all jobs would be essential there would be no starbucks or movie theaters or car dealerships there would be no tobacco stores clothing stores or theme parks there might be some of those things but the premise is that if work was about survival then there wouldnt be so many people working jobs that contribute nothing to our survival  that is the problem i have with work  but thats the thing there are so few people needed to produce all of the essentials of our world that when we think about that fact it starts to look like we would have one class of people working and one class of people benefitting from the work that is not the system i would advocate for rather i would advocate for a system that removes many of the barriers of entry to various fields of work to make it easier for people to follow their passion and also removing necessities from the list of things that we need to pay money for  necessities should be free regardless of the fact that someone needs to work for them i would be willing to volunteer much of my time to producing the necessities for our world if we were no longer living in a highly exploitative system and i think that you would too i think that most people would i think that the same people that are working now under a system of coercion would also be working under a voluntary system,g2mll7

225,"By the entitled trying to thank the essential workers, they are only trying to clear their own conscience.",i work in the basement of a skyscraper and am constantly reminded  your thoughtful greeting cards and pleasantlyworded emails and 5 pizzas dont mean anything  they arent making our situation any more tolerable  i believe those gestures only serve to clear their conscience of whatever guilt they pretend to have over working from home without a disrupt in their daily life  working at the bottom means most of these welldoers are my superiors or direct clients so we all grin and bear it laugh at their tired jokes and listen to their stories of important people they know all around the country suffering as well  in the beginning of the crisis we peons were given the speech that we must support those now relocated to working from home because this is a tough time for them too  the simple fact that these people feel as if they should make good or provide handouts is demeaning  honestly i dont have a better idea of what would be more helpful but please knock it off with the crappy togo lunches and kindly worded emails that take zero effort,g1wu7s

232,Wait... that's not right... POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT WHILE UNEMPLOYED?!,i dont mean to flex on anyone with this post im just not used to things genuinely getting better and wanted to share a bit   im 30 and was forced to move in with my grandmother a couple years ago i kept working with untreated bipolar disorder and undiagnosed ptsd and had a breakdown less than a year later after the worst job i ever had stay away from the veneer industry folks things were ok for a couple months with treatment and working part time i then also started a trade school program that was basically full time i wasnt passionate about it just wanted to get out of poverty with an it job and between its insane workload and the dumb life draining retail job i had my mental health unraveled again no breakdown but i got fired early january after i snapped and argued with mgmt over time theft fuck hardware store chains i dropped out of the program the next day  since then ive been taking advantage of what little luck i have to get monthly ssi checks and have been working on getting set up for college in the fall looking to get an education that helps me grow food and would also help me get into the cannabis industry i was struggling to find another job think i was too honest with my resume then covid19 happened and i gladly said fuck it i could only get warehouse and service industry jobs and ive wasted enough of my life on them so im focusing on bettering myself now and for the foreseeable future and i dont think its coincidence that my mental health has improved dramatically these past few months despite a deep phobia of disasters and the end of the world im actually kind of thriving right now  my sleep is great im getting over old hangups reading more and getting back into playing music and writing ill start working out soon thinking next week and im slowly regaining long lost confidence  i know how oddly fortunate i am so i cant say i have much in the way of advice i guess this post is something like a ouija board message from heaven sort of a taste of life without pointless toil probably more a rebuke to the workaholichustle culture propaganda im only hustling to be the me i want to be and its so much more fulfilling than trying to get into the highest possible tax bracket weve been lied to friends were worth so much more than the value we create we deserve incalculably better in both work and leisure  i dont know how this pandemic is going to pan out no idea how long this streak of mine will last but at least now i have a taste of what to struggle grow and maybe fight for the crazy part is that it could be much better than this  i wish you all more fortune than ive stumbled upon we all deserve better and i think we can get it unfortunately its probably going to take a lot of hard work and pain so please stay safe stay strong stay informed and stay you do what you can to look out for your fellow workers and if you have to work now keep your dreams alive dont let capitalist conditioning snuff your spirit  take care and dont toil too hard love ya,g3zwdw

289,Why the rush for everybody to go back to work?,i think i know why you see the billionaires funding right wing protests for people to go back to work now the extra 600week payments on unemployment have just started for most people now depending on the state average maximum unemployment rate is 450week some states are more generous like massachusetts with a maximum benefit payment of 823 for an individual or 1234 with dependents some states are horrible like mississippi with a maximum benefit of 235 each payment is for a weeks worth of benefits average payment is about half the regular wages for those on the lowest income tiers they are going to make more on unemployment than if they work while you cannot quit your job and collect unemployment there are now exceptions if you reasonably feel unsafe working you can many grocery stores have been working overtime to secure ppe install sneeze guards for the cashiers moving to one way aisles and stuff like that they do not like having to spend this money but theyre doing this so they do not have to worry about massive resignations and people collecting unemployment   now here is the thing if youre earning near minimum wage youll likely qualify for 150week in unemployment add the extra 600week and youre looking at somebody who was earning less than 300week now making 750week people who are making closer to 15hour are now going to make close to 900week instead of the 600week not as drastic but still better for the average unemployment payment to match the extra benefit payment youll need a wage of 2088hour in mississippi and 4585hour in massachusetts if people get used to this payment over the next two months they will not want to go back to earning between 725hour to 15hour  theyre scared of a revolution and we all know its going to come sooner or later they want to push it back as far as they can they want us to think that a better world isnt possible,g3tst5

328,Every job I have ever worked made me feel like a slave after a while.,im nearing 40 have been working full time over 15 years in order asst building superintendent home improvement tech and now plumbing tech the work is physical hazardous and dirty but the pay is supposedly but not really good my back hurts every single day i never go out or do anything after work because just remaining standing hurts my back a lot like constant background pain 247 and it makes life even worse lack of good health insurance means ill never be able to afford to fix that if it even is fixable i damaged my back slowly over many years by working for managers who would say things like scared money dont make no money or i didnt know i hired a lightweight or what are you weak or if you cant do this thats fine i can get jose to carry twice as much as you do and faster etc etc so i did whatever they told me to do year after year just to keep my jobs until i just carried too much one day and something tore in my back and its been hurting every day since even when im just carrying a 20lb box i learn to live with the pain but i wont lie it makes every day this much harder  i get up every day between 5 and 6 am head to a job an hour away and dont get home till 7 or 8pm  the pay is supposedly middle class but where i live this barely only pays rent food and healthcare nothing else there is literally not a penny left over for anything i have not been on vacation since my 20s  i could spend the next 5 years getting a plumbing license to increase my income a little bit but honestly after all expenses to maintain that license i wouldnt make much more than i am now and thinking about doing this for more years when i think about that every morning after i wake up it makes me wish i didnt wake up at all  i looked at other places to live that are more affordable but the jobs in those areas pay alot less basically cancelling out any savings this means whatever i do wherever i live in this world i will have to work every day for other people until i die  is this how everybody lives checktocheck only making enough to pay for a place to sleep and eat so they can keep working every day until they slowly get older get sick weaker lose everyone they knew growing up and then die in some nursing home alone  how is this not slavery i dont know how to keep telling myself to go on like this every day and i hate how everyone else seems okay with this hey this is life yes but this is not a free life this is slavery life  i dont want to be a slave anymore i dont care how much i get paid and promised i just dont im done with this i want to live my life for me i dont want to spend my only existence helping greedy strangers accomplish their goals by screwing other people out of money i feel like a slave and a tool and to top it off eventhough i do essential work i feel like im making society worse by charging these people the outrageous prices i am told to charge them i think this is what society is all about people trying to screw the next person out of as much money as possible for things they need to survive and the person who does this the best is called successful so like billionaires doctors lawyers etc  how do you guys do this how do you keep going how do you escape the slavery,fxq9jw

331,A Race to the Bottom,written for abolishworkcomhttpsabolishworkcom august 26 2018          for a while now mainstream articles spurred by keynesian economic thought have decried that middle class jobs are disappearing that is to say those 40000 dollar or more per year jobs upon which one could live if not happily then at least within a modicum of comfort while automation and the new gig economy in which stability is a thing of the past are partly to blame another more insidious factor is to blame   in his seminal work wealth of nations adam smith wrote that people want to spend as little money as possible for anything they buy employers want to spend as little money as possible hence maquiladoras and sweatshops while customers of any business want to have more savings to sit on rather than less it hardly need be explained in detail how there are coupon clippers and bargain hunters everywhere trying to squeeze as much as they can out of their shopping experience   while smith failed to mention was that employers seek to buy the labor of the people who work for them labor is a commodity an individual person can be sized up like a used good at a thrift store different people from a human resources perspective can appear to have different values it often happens that an employer will play favorites within the workplace promoting a newer person that they like better over someone who has been there longer and has been known to be dependable evaluation of people is a subjective process often prone to error its impossible for one person to completely know another person let alone judge their potential   however it is not only possible but likely for the boss of any company to look at the balance sheets and discover how much money is being earned how much is being spent statistics are far more knowable than individual people it is for this reason that bosses the world over choose the bottom line over their employees ie profit before people dollar amounts are just easier to work with   it might come as no surprise then that many workers are just earning less money nowhere is this more apparent than the new stultifyingly burgeoning online freelance market workers in india who can bid for 3 to 4 dollars an hour get jobs over american workers who bid 20 dollars an hour for the same position the boss quickly looks at the numbers and comes up with the following conclusion spending 16 dollars an hour less means spending 640 dollars less per week given a 40hour work week this leads to a per annum savings of 33280 dollars naturally any boss who spend tens of thousands of dollars less on employment costs is going to do so it will take those same workers from india getting wise to the situation and realizing that they too can charge american rates until things really change   as for the traditional brickandmortar jobs the situation gets bleaker with each passing year no matter the experience time spent within a company or the skills that an employee has acquired along the way the boss doesnt have much incentive to drastically increase pay for any one person supposing that the period of employment for example two years the employee has generally worked well and helped the company make money the boss has no reason to believe that the state of the company will worsen if raises are not forthcoming as a result there is a glass ceiling in wages a certain point beyond which people cannot get past without changing careers   although this is good for bosses its not so good for employees with inflation increasing every year taxes increasing everything becoming more expensive apartment rent is at times ridiculously beyond what anyone can afford student loans are so high that they might as well be called ponzi schemes at this point everything costs money and there isnt much indication that bosses are willing to hand over greater shares of their profits to help fund the lives of people who just happen to work there theres a race to the bottom to make as much money with a business as possible while spending as little as possible the phrase you get what you pay for doesnt necessarily apply in such situations not when an employee is compelled to try their best or else facing having nothing instead of very little though the unfortunate result in the short term is increasing poverty and a disappeared social mobility in the long term the result appears to be a bit more fortunate talent will always go where the money is if there isnt any money to be had working in any particular one job then people will go elsewhere if working for a boss isnt profitable people will become their own bosses what employers today do not realize for they have no incentive to think of business in such a way is that wages being suppressed in an information age inevitably leads to people changing careers internet startups are on the rise because people would naturally have more money rather than less people are selfteaching themselves how to program so that they can release apps through the google play store to make money selfmotivated individuals who can learn and grow are slowly walking out of the traditional economy the people who are left are those who finds themselves stuck in those jobs due to whatever odd circumstance   i can personally attest to how it feels to be stuck in a job wishing to go elsewhere not finding any opportunities come open for a confident wellread educated individual like myself it begins to feel like the system is rigged in favor of those who have massive amounts of capital and resources to call upon and rigged against those who do not   a cursory glance at the american constitution provides a glimpse into the mindset of those who were the upper class of society trying to make their own rules about how things should go they declared that only male property owners could vote ie have a say in how the government worked women could not vote poor men could not vote though they were most often affected by government decisions people of color were considered 35 of a person in the usual insane governmental attempt to redefine reality itself via legal decree   it was only through prolonged agitation struggle and general unrest that all of those restrictions were removed fortuitously no such effort will be required to for employees to improve their own conditions on the job they need not go on strike and form unions to obtain higher wages though many undoubtedly will they need only put down their badge clock out take off their uniform and start working for themselves rather than for others   this process wont be easy many wont be able to adjust yet in order to avoid the perpetual race to the bottom all any employee needs to do is leave the track and stop running both financial freedom and financial success are increasingly unlikely to be found by the supposedly beneficent hand of a supervisor and more likely to be found by selfmotivation and selfdirection   the old saw really applies here if you want to get something done right you have to do it yourself,fx82js

413,Two wrongs dont make a right but it made me feel good.,a decade ago i used to work for a big supermarket we were asked to arrive 15 minutes early unpaid so we could count a till ready for the day and they made us stay an extra 15 minutes after our shift unpaid to count the till with a manager and make sure it balances i couldnt stand the job and i couldnt stand that they were forcing us into working for free and i mentioned it a bunch of times and each time they said it was the way it was and the way it will always be  i decided not to make a big thing about it but to make things fair i would take the equivalent of 30 minutes of my hourly rate in products roughly 5 i often worked the bakery so that was one perk as i would often bake a few too many cookies and eat them while baking the next batch for customers sometimes id grab some meat or cheese and write it off on the till as damage and walk to the bins but just eat it probably the worst was during a bad day when i was going through some personal stuff i took a bottle of wine from the shelf and drank it in the bathroom on a break what was i thinking i only got away with that because i was baking bread in the back and nobody could see me being tipsy  i never had the balls to take things home i was never searched in all my time there but still didnt want to chance it security wasnt that lax there as a few got sacked for stealing from tills and another few got sacked for returning items that were not there and pocketed the equivalent cash so the till still balanced  not sure how they catch that  anyway what i did wasnt good and it was clearly theft i felt they were stealing from me so my actions were justified but in retrospect it was just a silly risk that i was doing on principle  it makes me wonder how common this stuff is and if a lot of people were doing similar things,fzp1vw

504,I returned to work this evening.,first of all let me fill you in a little on my background as it will help you understand my decisions so i used to be in the us army as a 74d or chemical biological radiological and nuclear operations specialist the unit i spent most of my time with specialized in mass casualty events think bombings chemical and biological warfare radioactive fallout   so this covid 19 pandemic would have been right up our alley fast forward to about a ago im at my current job a manufacturing plant ive been watching this virus spread like everyone else i tell my wife that we as a country are fucking this up we arent doing anything we should be doing   so i go to work and ask if they have any plans to shut down or layoff to help curb the spread here i literally get laughed at so i scheduled every single bit of my vacation in the hopes that by the time im supposed to come back they will have understood the severity of the situation   i find out through facebook while on this vacation that we were considered an essential business and while that may be true in an extended scenario if we were to just close the doors for a month or so the world would never notice we manufacture parts for semi trailers   so this evening is my first day back on the door theres a paper stating that visitors must stay 6ft away from us employees must take their temperature an hour before their shift and call in for anything 101 degrees   or higher  and must wash their hands or use sanitizer on every break i get to my pre shift meeting that we have every shift and my supervisor tells me that for the past week our plant has had atleast one person daily have to go into quarantine   yet here we are still making trailer parts risking our own and eachothers lives because of rich people not wanting to lose out on any money i wish that i could bring myself to just walk the fuck out but i still have things to pay for my landlord doesnt give a fuck about the virus my citys water doesnt give a fuck my internet provider doesnt give a fuck only my electric company has decided to defer payments   is it time to take to the streets in massive numbers yet  im so ready,fvnea4
505,Mom tries to push me into jobs I don't like,so i am currently in the status seeking apprenticeship welfare program so i get about 200 paid directly to my family child money and health care until im 25 i cannot get the real welfare program called hartz iv rent paid health care  470   im living in a town and theres just bullshit jobs like grocery stocker legit underpaid too drawn out hours because capitalism does its capitalism things   literally all jobs in town are some bullshit honestly im not made for the traditional bullshit job im not interested either so i cant just force it ill get next to zero production done after i get bored which gets easily to after just a few hours  also theres this other problem that i sleep until 9 am otherwise im sleep deprived so i cant do the usual 9 to 5 or 10 to 6 job nor do i want to because im seeking to do my hobbies otherwise life is boring its a real issue which is why i thought staying forever in this job program however it might hurts my family because im not the only one my sister has to sit out a few months to be officially 25 so my family pays her health care and she could be in the same status as me but theyre apparently too proud to and so when she hits 25 she wont go in probably i said she should several times so maybe she actually will  so all in one its nothing i can do about every day im forcing myself to learn japanese a bit and english grammar so that i have a chance in translation later or writing a story by the way im not a native but im a sucker in my native language   so in my point of view i can only try to force myself to stay into this welfare for my own sake and health school was already hell for years i forced myself through it and burned out pretty much   anyone else got another perspective,fvaltu

524,"The Virus Is a Reminder of Something Lost Long Ago; In rebuilding a broken world, we will have the chance to choose a less hurried life",gtthe frightening covid19 pandemic may be creating such a change nowby forcing many of us to slow down to spend more time in personal reflection away from the noise and heave of the world with more quiet time more privacy more stillness we have an opportunity to think about who we are as individuals and as a society  ampnbsp  gthabits of mind and lifestyle do not change easily without noticing we slowly slip into the routines of our lives like becoming so accustomed to living on a noisy street that we cannot remember our previous neighborhood and a time of silence some powerful force must strike to awaken us from our slumber now we have been struck we have a chance to notice  we have been living too fast we have sold our inner selves to the devil of speed efficiency money hyperconnectivity progress   ampnbsp  gtsince the industrial revolution the pace of life has been driven by the speed of commerce and business and the speed of business in turn has been driven by the speed of communicationthe resulting increase in productivity in the workplace coupled with the timeequalsmoney equation has led to our acute awareness of the commercial and goaloriented uses of time  ampnbsp  gtwe have created a frenzied lifestyle in which not a minute is to be wasted the precious 24 hours of each day are carved up dissected and reduced to 10minute units of efficiency we become agitated and angry in the waiting room of a doctors office if weve been standing by for 10 minutes or more we grow impatient if our laser printers dont spit out at least five pages a minute we cannot sit quietly in a chair for 10 minutes and we must be connected to the grid at all times we take our smartphones and laptops with us on vacation we go through our email at restaurants or our online bank accounts while walking in the park  gtwe have become slaves to our urgent appointments and todo lists and addiction to nonstop stimulation by the external world a momentous but little discussed study by the university of hertfordshire in collaboration with the british council found that the walking speed of pedestrians in 34 cities around the world increased by 10 percent just in the 10year period from 1995 to 2005 and all of this has happened invisibly little by little the noise and speed of the world have increased so that we can hardly remember an era of slowness and quiet when we could let our minds wander and think about what they wanted to think about when we had time to consider where we were going and what we believed in  ampnbsp  gtsuddenly we find ourselves alone with our thoughts excluded here are such people as the heroic workers in health care and in grocery stores and parents with young children or elderly relatives needing constant attention  ampnbsp  gteven for those who continue their professional life working online schedules have become more flexible demands have retreated daily routines have been interrupted we suddenly have unstructured freefloating beckoning time this terrible disaster has freed us from the prison of our timedriven lives at least for a few months we have the chance to slow down in the past weve had little opportunity to do so swept along by the rushing tide of prosperity and speed in the modern world  ampnbsp  gtwhat might be regained with a less hurried life as many people have noted there is simply the needed replenishment of mind that comes from doing nothing in particular from taking long mental walks without destination from finding a few moments of quiet away from the noise of the world the mind needs to rest the mind needs periods of calm such a need has been recognized for thousands of years it was described as early as 1500 bc in the meditation traditions of hinduism later in buddhism an ancient passage from the buddhist dhammapada reads when a monk has gone into an empty place and has calmed his mind he experiences a delight that transcends that of other men  ampnbsp  gtpsychologists have long known that creativity thrives on unstructured time on play on nondirected divergent thinking gustav mahler routinely took three or fourhourlong walks after lunch stopping to jot down ideas in his notebook carl jung did his most creative thinking and writing when he took time off from his frenzied practice in zurich to go to his country house in bollingen switzerland  ampnbsp  gtin a 2007 clinical report for the american academy of pediatrics the physician kenneth r ginsburg wrote that play allows children to use their creativity while developing their imagination dexterity and physical cognitive and emotional strength yet many children are being raised in an increasingly hurried and pressured style that may limit the protective benefits they would gain from childdriven play  ampnbsp  gtbut there is something more to be regained something more subtle more delicate almost impossible even to name that is the restoration of our inner selves by inner self i mean that part of me that imagines that dreams that explores that is constantly questioning who i am and what is important to me my inner self is my true freedom my inner self roots me to me and to the ground beneath me the sunlight and soil that nourish my inner self are solitude and personal reflection when i listen to my inner self i hear the breathing of my spirit those breaths are so tiny and delicate i need stillness to hear them i need slowness to hear them i need vast silent spaces in my mind i need privacy without the breathing and the voice of my inner self i am a prisoner of the frenzied world around me i am a prisoner of my job my money the clothes in my closet what am i i need slowness and quiet to ponder that question  ampnbsp  gtsometimes i picture america as a person and think that like a person our entire nation has an inner self if so does our nation recognize that it has an inner self does it nourish that inner self listen to its breathing in order to know who america is and what it believes in and where it is going if citizens of this nation like me have lost something of our own inner selves then what of the nation as a whole if our nation cannot listen to its inner self how can it listen to others if our nation cannot grant itself true inner freedom how can it allow freedom for others how can it bring itself into a respectful understanding and harmonious coexistence with other nations and cultures so that we might truly contribute to peace and wellbeing in the world  ampnbsp  gtsuch selfreflection such tending to the inner self is not a onetime event it should be an ongoing part of a life lived deliberately to use henry david thoreaus language and that deliberate living requires an enduring change of lifestyle and habits at some point the coronavirus will passfor years we will be trying to rebuild the broken world but perhaps the slower lifestyle in these months can help put the pieces back together and perhaps a more contemplative deliberate way of living can become permanent  ampnbsp  my sincere apologies to anyone who might feel slighted by this post anyone whos life has been thrown into chaos due to sudden unemployment suddenly being overworked even working from home etc  anyone who may not be able to enjoy the idea of a slower paced life which this article sheds light on,ft22b2
