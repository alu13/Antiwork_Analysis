0,I actually love being unemployed,you know what im not going to lie i love being unemployed sure the money is a little tight and i had to sell some stuff which i havent used my old amp a guitar and a mixer id prefer to have that stuff but i couldnt continue with my job and my emergency fund didnt cover an extra month off   that being said i love staying at home and doing what i want to do i go to the gym and actually feel refreshed and content because i dont need to immediately head to work afterwards i can study something which i actually love studying and can see myself progressing every day a second language i feel wellrested more extroverted and more loving to the people around me   i think there is a misconception that the unemployed dont want to work i tutored for a week and plan to tutor next week as well i really like working but my preference leans more towards 15 hours a week than 50 hours a week   honestly i have a substitute teaching job and im a little nervous that one day ill have to step up to be a fulltime teacher to support my family its so stressful i wont have to time to learn what i want to learn and i wont have time to excercise to be healthy   i am praying for some monumental thing like a windfall to allow me to work at a more leisurely pacemore of a marathon than a constant sprint i dont care about the status of work and i dont care about making way more money than i need hell all i really need is my computer food and my apartment and im happy  when i first became unemployed for a month out of university i felt this enormous stigma like it was a tribal society and everyone was pushing me away from the central fire i dont feel like that anymore i feel like this is the way for me to live leisurely happy content   ive studied about 34 hours every day consistently during my unemploymenti love working but i dont love trading my labor and my life to a corporation with foreign leaders ,3i7ksa
1,I am anxious all the time because of the pressure my family puts on me to get a job...,they shame me and see me as lazy is it so bad that i would rather spend my time rather than sell it to someone else   i dont see myself as leeching off society since i dont take benefit payments i would rather save it for someone that needs them any advice on how to get over this crippling feeling of anxiety ,3hzmjb
