26,Manager attempted to give me criminal record,so i used to work at a chain restaurant we werent fancy  we did burgers sandwiches steak and fries etc i think the most fancy thing we ever did was a risotto during a spring twoforone meal deal the servers were expected to do everything there were no bussers or designated hosts and rather than it being the kitchen porters job to polish and clean the cutlery it was ours instead normally i wouldnt mind this but it was always busy and one manager in particular  lets call him kevin  would always be on our asses about how lazy we were  when i started i was in recovery from an ed and pretty severe depression i was feeling better and i needed money to propose to my girlfriend so i got a part time job getting paid 656 an hour which is the bare minimum wage for someone my age im an energetic guy so i didnt mind all the running around but the customers would regularly treat us like dog shit and the managers would never back us up we had to fend for ourselves there were so many unspoken rules we werent even allowed to slouch when we sat down for our break because it looked unprofessional   my part time job quickly became three days per week doing eight or nine hours and then it became three eight hour shifts and one twelve hour and then two eight and two twelve at no point was i offered a raise we had to order food for our break meal that was under ten pounds which meant that i was running around for eight or twelve hours with just a salad and a protein bar from home to sustain me  it started affecting me mentally to the point where i had a terrible relapse i decided to hand in my two weeks and then shit went down  its the middle of a busy saturday shift i had just finished taking care of four or five tables start to finish with absolutely no assistance i was also expected to train a new hire who while he was sweet was thick as pig shit i got a new table who were rude and didnt speak good english dont get me wrong i am very patient with people trying to learn english its a hard language  but they were treating me like i was stupid and refusing to answer my questions when i tried to clarify what they wanted  at the time my sister was in hospital so i was already overwhelmed i stopped behind the bar to have a two minute water break and just take a second to process everything so while i was lost in thought and sipping water kevin asks me cant you see were busy i sigh and follow him into the kitchen where he starts laying into me i mean he was yelling at me about a foot away from my face so i told him to get the fuck out of my face and pretty much quit on the spot because i could feel a panic attack coming on and i realised it wasnt worth it for under seven pounds per hour  i got called back in a week later for an inquiry a customer made a complaint about kevin because theyd heard him screaming at me from the restaurant so they had to do an investigation well in an attempt to save his own skin he had alleged that i threatened him with a knife which was completely untrue luckily my gm knows hes full of it so nothing will happen to me but i was sure scared for a moment,pymfxk

53,Help me Understand Your Philosophy,up until quite recently i was almost unaware of the antiwork position i knew that some people are put off by the anxiety of job seeking and the stress of being in the workforce but i had no idea that a sizeable minority of people on the internet believed that employment ought to be abolished   i have some questions about the antiwork position i strenuously disagree with leftism communism and antiwork advocates but i want to engage in a dialogue and ask this sub some questions   1 are you communists   communism is a workeroriented movement    he who does not work neither shall he eat 2 in your ideal antiwork utopia would the people sustaining the rest of civilization enjoy more luxuries or be compensated more   all the production planning and heavylifting would be delegated to a small group of individuals would they basically live like gods since they would be working to keep all of you alive while you are idle 3 why does the rest of society owe you free stuff   there is a material cost to everything that material cost is reflected in the price the quantity of the medium of exchange with which the labour must be recompensed why do you get to force people to make your things without compensating them for it  4 besides the potential threat of automation what made you identify as antiwork   automation is the only compelling argument against work in my opinion 5 how do material progress and technological advancement occur with an idle population or would all the scientific heavylifting be delegated to a small population of intellectuals 6 if capitalists are exploiting workers by taking unearned surplus value how are you not exploiting me by demanding the fruits of my labour without giving anything in return   you sitting around enjoying the fruits of other peoples labour while doing nothing is inherently exploitative,pyydpa
54,I was intimidated by my boss on my birthday.,i had a meeting with my boss on my birthday recently he gave me a card that some of the people in the office had put together and apologized for not realizing that it was today he then proceeded to tell me that the company had been considering letting me go due to my attendance not because i had missed a lot of days 12 days a month called out but because murphys law seems to strike when i do im in it and its essentially just me in my role so problems can become bigger if neither me nor my supervisor are available to handle them but you know what thats not my fucking problem all that means is the company is understaffing my position not that i need to never call off sick  he then acknowledged that i am very good at my role and that everyone in the office loves having me around which he reiterated pointing to the card saying he had nothing to do with it   i work 100 hours a week between this job and my other small business i need both to survive the fact that my boss is comfortable casually threatening my livelihood on my birthday because im a human being who doesnt feel well sometimes is fucking appalling and it sickens me,pyvjsu

59,"It's becoming increasingly clear that the ""Please be patient, we are seriously understaffed, since everybody is too lazy to work in this restaurant"" horseshit is failing to pass the reality test.",we live in a large tourist driven region with a huge amount of restaurants the official count is typically quoted at 900 of them in the county  the wife and i are guilty of spending way too much time and money at these restaurants  over the last few months we have noticed a real divide taking place when it comes to who is successfully running a thriving operation and who is crashing and burning   obviously all of them suffered to some extent over the pandemic once things loosened up it really didnt take long for the tourism industry to get back on its feet and the hotels and restaurants to be back up to near full  capacity  as this was happening we noticed that most operations smoothly ramped up and seem to be running well with a high daily traffic count and no huge service issues others are failing horribly we have two national chain locations  within sight of each other one we gave up on since we cant sit for 40 minutes to wait for our cold food as a grossly short staffed and abused front of the house runs like lunatics to try to keep up the other place is packed for ten hours a day and still has no issues with service or quality we see it in everything from local diners and pizza joints to the fast food that is now limited to drive through with a dark dining room since they cant find enough staff to operate it    im no economist but if the majority of the restaurants in a region that is overrun with them are doing quite well yet a significant minority are literally failing grossly understaffed empty and pissing off customers left and right  there is a problem that has nothing to do with all the imaginary lazy people that are hiding somewhere there is a problem with continuing to under pay under value and abuse your staff period the free market has determined that this is no longer acceptable and workers voted with their feet yet strangely some of you managers and owners seem to be willing to make this a hill that you are willing to die on  good luck with that might be time to throw a clean shirt on and do a bit of dining at your competitors since you  are driving your place off a cliff and they are doing just fine,pynetn

I've been warned.,disclaimer i actually enjoy my jobs daily tasks programmer but i hate the constant bullshit i hate corporate jargon and culture so fuckem and fuckem deep sorry for the long post but its kind of a warning to other people  i wont name the place germany based digital marketing company pretty big maybe four months ago everyone gets an email announcing a new merit system its basically an application integrated into our network were you can publicly kiss your superiors arses  i could smell the bullshit right away as im sure all antiworkers would too so i ignored it the company is big enough to let some unsophisticated peasant sewer dwellers like myself go unnoticed in these soul crushing social apps thats how some people in the company see me and my team i love it were like a necessary evil to them  i forgot all about that stupid app cancelling its email notifications right away helped with that few months pass one of my bosses calls me on teams conversation went something like this  boss  you havent been active on the arsekissery platform you must have tons of arsekisses to use why dont you go there and congratulate your teammates and all the others  side note i had been receiving these credits for months i can use them to well kiss some arses  me  sorry i forgot all about that since that first email ill check it later on not really my thing though so maybe ill pass  boss  what you mean its not really your thing everyones there  me  sorry im not very much into social stuff online  boss  but dont you want to recognize other peoples work this is the new tool for that and it might have beneficial outcomes for some in the long term  me  i prefer to congratulate people in private ive done it in the past so i really dont thing im gonna use those arsekisses  boss  i think you should reassess your position on this issue some higherups may not like to know that someone in this team has something against arsekissery  me  im not gonna use it  boss  ok well talk again in a few days to see if you changed your mind  so this is where im at boss was getting nervous with our conversation im kindly waiting for our next talk regarding this dystopian app  honestly im enjoying this saying no to your superiors its always a pleasure however i know i can tell them to fuck off and ill get another job in a few weeks if this actually escalates i kind of hope it does what pisses me the fuck off is that more people will probably feel the same as me but will have to comply   after our little chat i actually went to the arsekissery platform to check if it was as bad as i imagined well it did not disappoint i seriously have a hard time understanding how little self awareness some people can have who do you think youre fooling with those stupid posts congratulating others for working 80h weeks congratulating one self for working that much blatantly lying about stuff endless virtue signalling and boy dont get me started on the emojis  you know what i feel like doing spend every credit i have by posting links to this thread in asskissery i know i probably wont but let me fantasize about it  warning to others if you work an office job then this might be coming for you also dont use it unless youre completely desperate for money and cannot find another job now its not enough to work your ass off you have to post how much you love it and how wonderful your superiors are so that everyone can see its not the future thats a dystopian nightmare its the freaking present,pyr02l

explanations for karl marxs famous opposition to capitalism  fundamentally though marxs reasoning comes down to something simple  happiness he believed that capitalism made people unhappy by treating  them as part of a machine in which the person is expunged and only  productivity remains the spontaneous activity of the human  imagination of the human brain and the human heart operates on the  individual independently of him marx wrotehttpswwwmarxistsorgarchivemarxworks1844manuscriptslabourhtm  in his 1844 essay estranged labor it belongs to another it is the  loss of his self workers are objectified in his view made into  miserable shells  whether or not you agree with marxs assessment  of what the capitalist system does to us many of us indisputably do  what he describes to ourselves too many people who work hard and strive for success selfobjectify as excellent work machines and tools of performance  strivers  seek professional success to deliver satisfaction and happiness but  selfobjectification makes both impossible setting us up for a life of  joyless accomplishment and unreachable goals followed by the tragedy of  inevitable decline to be happy we need to throw off these chains we  put on ourselves  when it comes to happiness marx was right objectification lowers wellbeing research showshttpsscholarscarrolleduhandle20500126473769  for example that when people are reduced by others to physical  attributes through objectifying stares or harassment it can lower  selfconfidence and competence in tasks the philosopher immanuel kant referredhttpsplatostanfordeduentriesfeminismobjectification to this as becoming an object of appetite for another at which point all motives of moral relationship cease to function  physical  objectification is just one type objectification at work is another  and an especially injurious one in 2021 three french researchers in  the journal frontiers in psychology developedhttpswwwfrontiersinorgarticles103389fpsyg2021651071full  a measure of objectification in the workplace based on the feeling of  being used as a tool and not being recognized as an agent in the  working environment as they note workplace objectification may lead to  burnout job dissatisfaction depression and sexual harassment this  can happen if a boss treats her employees like nothing more than  disposable labor or even if employees see their boss as nothing more  than a provider of money  ed zitron say goodbye to your managerhttpswwwtheatlanticcomideasarchive202109managerworklifechanges620096  the  case against objectifying others is fairly straightforward less  obvious but equally damaging is when the objectifier and the person  being objectified are one and the same humans are capable of  objectifying themselves in many waysby assessing their selfworth in  terms of their physical appearance economic position or political  views for examplebut all of them boil down to one damaging core act  reducing ones own humanity to a single characteristic and thus  encouraging others to do so as well in the case of work that might  look like judging ones selfworthpositively or negativelybased on job  performance or professional standing  just as our entertainment  culture encourages us to selfobjectify physically our work culture  pushes us to selfobjectify professionally americans tend to valorize  being driven and ambitious so letting work take over virtually every  moment of your life is concerningly easy i know many people who talk of  almost nothing besides their work who are saying essentially i am  my job this may feel more humanizing and empowering than saying i am  my bosss tool but that reasoning has a fatal flaw in theory you can  ditch your boss and get a new job you cant ditch you  so  far i have been unable to find any published studies on the wellbeing  of professional

retirement i went from whos who to whos he  are you a selfobjectifier in your job or career ask yourself a few questions and answer them honestly   is your job the biggest part of your identity is it the way you introduce yourself or even understand yourself  do  you find yourself sacrificing love relationships for work have you  foregone romance friendship or starting a family because of your  career  do you have trouble imagining being happy if you were  to lose your job or career does the idea of losing it feel a little  like death to you  if you answered affirmatively to  any or all of these recognize that you will never be satisfied as long  as you objectify yourself your career or job should be an extension of  you not vice versa two practices can help as you reassess your  priorities   1 get some space  maybe you have been in an  unhealthy relationship or two in your life but only recognized this when  you had a break from it whether voluntary or involuntary indeed this  human tendency probably contributes to the fact that most trial separations lead to divorcehttpswwwjstororgstable24582807seq1metadatainfotabcontents especially when they last more than a year space provides perspective  use this principle in your professional life to begin with it should be the main goal of your vacationhttpswwwtheatlanticcomfamilyarchive202106vacationhappinessplan619275to get a break from work and spend time with people you love as obvious as this may sound that means taking your vacation  and not working during it at all your employer should thank you for  doing so i have been a chief executive and can assure you that i wanted  only employees who worked with their whole heart and free will if they  needed to leave i wanted them to leave  read plan ahead dont post and seven other rules for a happy vacationhttpswwwtheatlanticcomfamilyarchive202106vacationhappinessplan619275  related  to this is the ancient idea of sabbathkeeping or taking regular time  away from work each week in religious traditions rest isnt just nice  to have it is central to understanding god and ourselves for in six  days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that is in them  and rested on the seventh day the book of exodus reads therefore the  lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy if god rests from work  maybe you should too  such a practice doesnt have to be religious and can be done in a lot of wayshttpswwwresearchgatenetpublication323008919rediscoveringmodelsofsabbathkeepingimplicationsforpsychologicalwellbeing  besides simply avoiding all work on saturday or sunday for example  you can take a small sabbath each evening by proscribing work and  dedicating all your activity to relationships and leisure   2 make friends who dont see you as a professional object  many  professional selfobjectifiers seek out others who admire them solely  for their work accomplishments this is quite naturalit makes me feel  good when a person i meet for the first time recognizes me as a  columnist for the atlantic rather than as some random guybut  can easily become a barrier to the formation of healthy friendships  which we all need by selfobjectifying in your friendships you can  make it easier for your friends to objectify you  read the best friends can do nothing for youhttpswwwtheatlanticcomfamilyarchive202104deepfriendshipsaristotle618529  this is why having friends outside your professional circleshttpswwwtheatlanticcomfamilyarchive202104deepfriendshipsaristotle618529  is so important striking up friendships with people who dont have any  connection to your professional life encourages you to develop nonwork  interests and virtues and thus be a fuller person the way to do this  goes hand in hand with recommendation no 1 dont just spend time away  from work spend it with people who have no connection to your work  maybe challenging  your own selfobjectification makes you feel uneasy honestly it  freaks me out the reason is simple we all want to stand out in some  way and working harder than others and being better at our jobs seems a  straightforward way to do so this is a normal human drive but it can  nonetheless lead to destructive endshttpswwwpsychologytodaycomusblogstarvingthebanquet201105dreamingbeingspecial many of my students have confessed to me that they would rather be special than

into cogs in a  machine of our own making in his 1964 book understanding media  marshall mcluhan famously said the medium is the message he noted  that in the famous greek myth narcissus fell in love not with himself  but with the image of himself and so it is when we professionally  selfobjectify our work is our medium and it becomes our message we  learn to love the image of our successful selves not ourselves as we  truly are in life  dont make this mistake you are not your job  and i am not mine take your eyes off the distorted reflection and have  the courage to experience your full life and true self,pyltdu

130,Why not fix your situation?,before i begin im coming in good faith and im genuinely curious about how people feel here  it seems to me that this subreddit is a lot of justifiied complaining about work and the boring 95 life i never see any motivating posts about people working towards a better and more free life starting to work for themselves in their own time  it seems more about people wanting to ran without much emphasis on improving your life for the better  it seems this subreddit is rightfully pissed off but their anger is directed in a not very useful direction  as someone who hates work equally as much but adamant they deserve better and doing everything in my power to be financially free i wanna hear what you guys think about this,pyrr3h

177,Passive Income vs Work,there seems to be a large number of people who are under the delusion that wealth is a product of work however that is not necessarily true in fact more often than not wealth is a product of ownership and investment almost no one gets rich from working we antiworkers are rebelling against a system where people at the top grow their wealth by investing accumulating assets and receiving passive income from those assets while billions of people are forced to work low quality low wage jobs under the threat of destitution  its interesting that given this dynamic so many people choose to defend the passive income class while decrying antiworkers as lazy apparently not wanting to work a crap job is fine admirable even when youre rich but when youre poor and dont want to work a crap job youre just lazy ironic  but what really separates an antiworker from a member of the passive income class is access to capital without access to capital you cannot invest you cannot accumulate assets and you therefore cannot receive passive income although even if access to capital were more available investment is still inherently risky  there will be winners and losers and most likely far more losers then winners typical for gambling so basically the passive income class is inaccessible to most of us  but even if i had access to capital and luck on my side i wouldnt want to be a member of the passive income class contrary to what many people think about antiworkers i do not want to sit on my ass all day while everyone else does all the work that is not what i want what i want is a world where everyone contributes what they are able so that everyone can have what they need including as much free time as possible and a decent standard of living nothing extravagant im not asking for a mansion and a yacht just a decent place to live nutritious food clean water high quality healthcare high quality education quality infrastructure public services public transportation green space etc for the least amount of compulsory work i would be more than happy to contribute as much of my labor as is necessary to make that society function but i am not going to work one more damn minute for the benefit of the passive income class and if they dont like that well what can i say other than stop being lazy and become productive member of society,py64tt

195,the implications of higher wages/working less in the US?,i think the standard of living is horrible for a good portion of us citizens so im all for raising wages at the expense of companies but where does the money corporations make go all these huge corporations are publicly traded so now im down the rabbit hole of looking at the shareholder distribution for companies like amazon it looks like bezos owns 11 of amazon which is actually an absurd amount but the rest seems pretty randomly distributed with no big stakeholders apart from mutual fund type companies which dont count because they are investing on the behalf of middle class joes right so say wages increase amazon makes less money which results in its stock price declining obviously bezos wont be affected but lots of average joes will be a bunch of people relying on their money tied up in the stock market for retirement will be screwed   ok so after that reset yeah a bunch of middle class oldies will be screwed over but what else at that point less money going towards ceos through their huge holding of shares hmm doesnt seem so bad i suppose cus im not an oldie abt to retire  also i have basically no knowledge regarding the economy this is so elementary ik please somebody explain it to me better,pybkql

198,"what is ""minimum wage""?",tldr the federal minimum wage is so criminally low that most minimum wage jobs need to pay more than that or nobody would work there  i work at a popular coffee shop the one associated with green aprons and a lot of folks call it a minimum wage job when i make 12hour thats technically more than the federal minimum of 725hour but still not enough for me to move out of my neglectful alcoholic parents hoarding house after working 3035 hours a week for 2 years so it is kinda minimum and i understand why people refer to retailfood service jobs that way across the board but we should consider that the federal minimum wage is so low that most places cant pay that little or nobody would work for them  i feel like its a scam to convince us that were making more than the bare minimum so we should be greatful but i certainly am not i work so hard for that place those drinks are expensive and im sure that the profits were creating far exceed our wages especially at drivethru stores where there are orders coming from three different directions caf drive thru and mobile theres some talk about our pay getting raised soon but i have yet to see any significant raise this job takes soooo much training and energy i just want to be recognized for it financially in my wallet please i enjoy making beautiful beverages and the perfect sweet cream foam but im soooooooo tired of having panic attacks from how busy it gets and how some customers dont care that im already working as hard as i can     also ps stop paying for other peoples orders at this chain and tip the baristas were so overworked and understaffed we appreciate those couple extra dollars so much those folks signed up to pay for expensive drinks theyre fine i am not,py7e9v

230,This sub has put into words what I’ve felt for a while. I’ve completely given up at my job.,ive worked at a factory for two and a half years as a machine operator and im over this shit which is sad because i actually like the work itself all of my coworkers and i have an excellent supervisor   but i absolutely despise the company i work for its practically a running joke that if you work any overtime you need to check your paystub to be sure you were paid correctly weve all been shorted at some point but no one has ever accidentally been paid extra to my knowledge the pay is such shit and morale so low that temp companies no longer send anyone our way and were constantly on a skeleton crew meaning mandatory overtime on the weekend is a regular thing so i have one day a week to get done with every chore i have to do   there was a snowstorm earlier this year the entire city was shut down and i couldnt even dig myself out of my driveway we all got calls from our supervisors saying not to worry about coming in that week and we wouldnt be getting points on our attendance monday morning we come into work and find hr notices posted all around the building saying that in fact we would be getting points which for the week was enough that most of us would be pointed out and fired and we would have to use our vacation time to cover the week   right after i had gotten my yearly raise my supervisor sits me down and shows me an email from hr stating that all the machine operators in my department were going to be reclassified as associates which translates to a pay cut i was so furious i started looking for jobs that day after window shopping around i discovered that i could hire in at almost any other company making more than i would top out at my current job   and to top it off we actually have a union ran and populated entirely by boomers sitting behind a desk collecting a salary and watching the rest of us drown   im considered one of the best operators in our entire plant when i started this job i worked 7 12 hours a day taking one break even though were allowed three and busting my ass now pffft i work maybe three hours every day i keep my lines running and dont touch anything else i abuse the shit out of our point system so hard that when i get one back my supervisor expects me to take a day off within the week i now spend my free time at work applying for other jobs i cant wait to get out of this shit hole,pyifno

269,Need to vent,not sure if people come to this subreddit to read others sob stories i dont and it seems like most posts here are commentary on image macrossocial media posts but i thought id share what happened to me today because its just another punch in the guts to this disillusioned prole  anyways not to go into an inordinate amount of detail but ive been unemployed since june when i declined to resign my contract with my previous employer and had a halfbaked dream where i would start making content for social media full time  to be clear i think that this is a viable career path for some and perhaps even the solution to breaking out of traditional ideas for workincome and monetising individuals creative potential on the internet  but it just isnt for me i lack the discipline and the vision so i started to look for another job    at the end of july i interviewed for a job and got offered the position signing a contract for a position starting at the end of november  there were some red flags from the beginning the ad that i responded to was a bit of a bait and switch because it listed multiple positions open including one in august but when i asked about that they told me that it was filled  even after i had signed the contract i continued to see the ad posted online up until very recently  so i wasnt totally shocked when i got a call from the recruiter who had been the gobetween for me and the employer and he told me that the position i had signed a contract to fill no longer existed  apparently the current employee would be continuing on in the position  so i spent two months under the false impression that my job search was over and now i might be deprived of several more months of work as i begin from scratch i was unknowingly used as an insurance policy for a company that effortlessly cast me aside when i wasnt needed  i come to this sub to get a sense of solidarity with working people so i hope this story resonates with some of you  we need to keep telling ourselves that theres nothing wrong with having a job but that you can never trust an employer because you are just a tool for them to use and discard  stay strong fuck a job,pxsnjr

288,Well if it isn't karma for my own thoughts {long},so a year ago the hotel i devoted 7 years of my life to got sold out from under us right after a coworker and great friend of mine introduced me to a position at their small business that sounded amazing a year later my one year anniversary is the 29th and im dealing with a lot of mental struggles   in this year ive been on two different antidepressants neither did what i needed it to a few mental breaks thrown in all out screaming at my boss man coworkers husband and a complete disregard for my working career later i was finally feeling on september 15th that it was almost time for one of those grippy socks three day retreats   but alas i refused   so much so i went out to the bars with my husband and some friends that saturday night    monday morning rolled around and i could barely get out of bed a hangover no a dreaded sickness best to be described as that one time i got mono but spicier  hubby went to work i stayed home from work first time calling out right before my shift in over a year felt so wrong i did tell boss lady that hubby jokingly said the dreaded covid but i really didnt think it was that   this worried her   now her and her husband have not gotten the vaccine not my body not my problem our fourth worker and i did get the vaccines in the modern red variety however i do frequent help desks of little old fellas and ladies so i didnt want to bring my possibly covid infected body near work plus a break sounds nice   so tuesday i go get a test its the spit and mail kind like a dna test simple enough   wednesday the state labs receive it i feel reassured its not actually covid just a cold   thursday i get my results its the covid im now out four days of work and looking at many more   fast forward to today next tuesday and ive missed 7 days of work i feel 100 better but i still must wait for a negative test which with my luck wont happen for a couple of weeks   all of this to say i now desperately dont want to go back to work but how do i explain that ive got a crafting business ive not had time to focus on i have some pretty bad depression to work on ive got a lot of house renovations to catch up on none of these are compatible with my current job setup   having 11 days off to be a homebody not wear tight clothes and not have to talk to anyone but my husband has been amazing i want to be a stayathome wife now   so i guess tldr if you need a grippy socks retreat take it or suffer from the effects of not prioritizing yourself,pxn0om

307,A Week Away and Suddenly I Can Eat,tw physical illness vomiting  hello i just joined and am now addicted to this subreddit while lurking i read a story similar to mine and it made me realize just how bad this job is treating me  i had a week of vacation this month the last one i took being in february for the same amount of time for context my schedule is monday wednesday saturday and sunday for week 1 and wednesday friday for week 2 so while i had only really had 3 days of vacation i was actually out of office for a whole week   now a month or so before my vacation i literally had to stop eating before my shift because i would throw up without fail even if i ate generally considered safe foods i would end up throwing up minutes before leaving for work and sometimes even at work i went to the dr after much pushing from my boyfriend and they didnt have a clue soon i resigned to bringing a lunch to work and munching there which actually worked but i had a lot of anxiety about eating while at my job for multiple reasons  i take the week off that entire week im able to eat at any point even that same time i would have before my shift and not throw up once i didnt correlate it to my job at all until i read a similar story on here  is it really so common to experience physical illnesses due to stressful jobs,pxpznv
308,Got my first job. Want to quit after first shift,so i thought having a job would be nice i am not being forced to work or anything i just have expensive hobbies and thought id be self sufficient i got a job in food and yeah not a fan i am so awful at it   i also dont like my manager very much i work at a small christian restaurant and during my interview i forgot about how you need to dress up i came into the interview dressed how i usually do i was wearing a comic tee high rise acid wash jeans with rips from the top of my thigh down and fishnets underneath i also had an early 2000s grunge hairstyle which means i blew it out and teased it a lot without any combing and tons of hairspray   the black nails chains and heavy trad makeup probably wasnt doing me any favors either i only got hired because my friends mom is the assistant manager and my friends boyfriend also work there its kind of a you know somebody youre in kind of thing around where i live but during the interview the manager told me that i should know its a christian business and that all employees are expected to be dressed clean and no profanity is allowed so i didnt like her even before i began working there  she scheduled me closing every single day i work not to mention i work from 48 i get home from school at 335 and live half an hour away from work im a full time minor student and this is my vet first ever job i told her it isnt possible for me to be there on time and she said its not her problem and its my responsibility to relieve the person working before me   oh and on my first shift ever she didnt give me a single break until 10 minutes before closing time my shift was only 45 hours but i thought minors were required breaks even then she told me if i want to leave early i should get to finishing the pre closing duties so i took my break texting my mom telling her ill probably be getting off later than i thought i was going to be originally since i had so much cleaning to do  my friends are telling me im being selfish for wanting to quit after only one shift and that i will get better after i work more and get the routine down but i hate the food business i just wanted an easy job to do after school that didnt make me stay after 12 hours after my scheduled time to clean dough and old food out of mixers and bowls,pxn106

353,It's never been as bad as it is now.,im rather struck by how much anarchist and traditional thinkers have in common with regard to criticisms of capital and of the supposed labor ethic ill go ahead and do a little bit of contrast from what ive read of those authors to put the horror and abnormality of our modern situation into perspective  in antiquity labor was not a virtue no such thing as a labor ethic existed instead it was seen as a divine punishment one of the traditionalists points out that the etymological root for labor which is the latin word laborare denotes suffering a remanant of this meaning is carried forward into modern english by the term labor as applied in child birth  in the past they believed that being born a peasant or a slave was ill fortune today its everybodys misfortune in the modern world there is no differentiation at all and everyone is forced to work no matter his virtues the same traditionalist points out that he who does not work shall not eat is a cruel modern axiom that was never believed brahmana the priestly caste in ancient india were forbidden to work except when times were exceptionally harsh  moderns are valued in the class system only according to the amount of money they produce in the class system honor is never considered instead those of low class are dejected and seen as inferior only the upper class holds any dignity in modernity however in the past under the caste system each caste had equal dignity by according to its divine destiny  the class system is very backwards in fact the more honorable you are the less money you will make because grifting and hustling is the profession of the rich to be competitive you must conform you must become a used car salesman or sell yourself in contrast various indoeuropean societies of the past would put liars to death lying was a mortal sin not a way of life   the caste system was based around vocational honor and each caste was held to be of equal dignity this is represented in ancient india as the body of brahma each of its four parts corresponding to one of the castes the legs were the laborers the thighs were the producers the arms were the warriors and the mouth was the priests brahma could not exist without any one part and so each one was held to the same dignity in the modern world however the working class is without special dignity it could be replaced tomorrow with machines and the upper classes would not mourn it the class structure is rife with avaricious jealousy whereas in the past each caste was happy to fulfil its vocation to retain its honor since it was ordained impersonally by god in india the caste system was not essentially hereditary but instead individualistic and based off of a persons strengths and virtues the goal was inner harmony rather than class conflict and inequality  if you advised an ancient man to sell himself hed have thought you asked him to be a prostitute modern wage labor is likewise not very different from selling your body for sex we give up our time our energy our health and our spirit for someone elses pleasure at the end of your career youre used up riddled with diseases and rife with trauma all for the benefit of someone else rather than enjoyable and relationally fulfilling as well as spiritually consecrated the sex of selling yourself is alienating and destructive such is labor rather than ludic play  in the past commercial establishments were always subordinated to principle and rulership guilds were chartered by kings and operated within narrow boundaries they were not competitive but rather anticompetitive they fixed prices and cut out competition keeping the pace of work slow and prices high allowing them to focus on quality perfection honor and the dignity of the craftsmen even marx spoke about the dignity of the craftsmans intrinsic relationship to his works and how modernity alienates the craftsman away with its demands for speed and output  accordingly even mundane goods in the past were designed thoughtfully and with intricate care craftsmen wanted to make beautiful goods to honor and reflect the divine rather than to please their managers there was a serious spiritual underpinning behind guilds as well in ancient rome corporations had lares which were like spirits of the place craftsmen would offer to these lares and their work revolved around honoring them rather than simply turning profit in the medieval germanic zunften there were patron spirits that filled a similar role  the ancient corporations and guilds also had a hierarchical personal nature kind of like a family the leader of a corporation cared for the well being of his craftsmen and they desired to work with the leader as a unit in turn it was organic and personal unlike dehumanized modern workplaces where the only object of the leadership is profit and exploitation  even war was not as destructive in the middle ages battles were sometimes won without even a single blow being struck other times the destruction that could be wreaked was limited without the aid of modern technology there was no militaryindustrial complex  war was a virtue of its own and wasnt motivated by profitseeking warriors held a sacred place in society and were held to be a prime example of honorable sacrifice sacrifice itself is a symbol against materialism and industrialism because to sacrifice one must give up attachment to greed and material things to be a warrior then was to essentially forego greed entirely this is reflected in the dialogue between arjuna and krishna in the bhagavad gita arjuna a warrior struggles to muster the courage to fight  but krishna reminds him that he will die if he fights or not so he might as well fight either he earns glory in death or victory in life profit never enters the equation  war was seen as a path to enlightenment through sacrifice not as a mere means to secure economic or geopolitical advantages as is the case today modern colonialism on the other hand as an unlikely traditionalist writes was driven entirely by expansionistic greed and a false sense of superiority on the part of europeans during the renaissance and enlightenment societies which knew sacrifice and the divine such as the aztecs were tragically genocided and enslaved by europeans for the sake of profit  ancient man worked only as much as he needed to being free from the artificial generation of needs under capitalism there is an anecdote from the modern era in which a british officer went to china and remarked how when he increased native chinese wages on a farm the chinese workers simply worked less proportional to the wage increase rather than to work harder as the british were accustomed to of course they were interpreted to be lazy rather than human  anarchists and traditionalists both point out how peasants and slaves had it better than modern wage laborers medieval peasants had more days off than office workers on top of having intact families and central meaning in their lives never before was capitalistic restlessness so prevalent  the same certain traditionalist ive been discussing also points out something interesting which is akin to what others have called commodification modern capitalismliberalism in reducing people to producers and consumers presents them a false sense of individuality people believe that they can find meaning in what they consume or buy they are presented false lifestyles and identifies by capitalism for example ford and chevrolet coke and pepsi have formed cultural shibboleths a smoker feels pressured to smoke due to propaganda campaigns and pressures his friends to smoke in turn each of whom identifies with a different brand of cigarettes hes a marlboro man shes a newport girl etc etc but ultimately none of this has anything at all to do with personality these are just artificial inflictions made by capitalism to justify the labor cycle and have nothing to do with higher values instead of principles instead of gens ethnos and familia people have brands  in antiquity people had personalities by virtue of their dharma or inner nature karma and heredity as well as astrological influences would determine a persons vocation traits susceptibilities and their spiritual disposition they possessed personalities and vocations and it was seen as harmonious that they followed them   this is the amor fati or the classical pronouncement that you should be who you are after having learned what that is this was based in something that couldnt be inflicted or changed by a capitalistic environment but rather which was intrinsic and immutable this puts the liberalsocialist desire to reduce people to products of their environments into perspective and moreover the general attempt to homogenize humanity and culture the environment is capitallabor nobody can be unsuitable for work if they are molded by capitallabor and yet the hippie generation shows a particular resurgence of immutable spirit against conformism in general and many people from around the world having moved to the capitalistic west endeavor to keep their cultures even if its sometimes a failing battle  religion has been reduced to a mere accessory and it is no longer seen as essential  mostly because it isnt productive modern society refuses to make accommodations for religious practices particularly those skeptical of labor a buddhist cannot get an exemption from work he must work  his religion means nothing to capital even if work might bring him away from enlightenment and suck him back into samsara  all told it should be evident that capitalism and its modern counterparts is a truly unique evil its mammon made incarnate  an oligarchy of greed and malevolence the traditionalists and anarchists are right to say that it shares similarities with calvinism we see constant dissolution and freedom combined with increasingly strict moralization and conformism work is being made a principle while at the same time were told that the telos of work is to be free from work work will bring us to heaven were told while our ancestors realized long ago the opposite  the traditionalists say that calvinism and puritanism are degraded forms of spirituality which have involuted from their superior antecedents rather than having in its sights the immaterial and divine calvinism concerns itself with petty morality and the immediacy of work it is more horizontal than it is vertical buddhism on the other hand with its seeking of the unconditioning of the self and freedom from agitation dukkha wishes to break people free from brutish necessity and survival  there was at one point in history acknowledgement of all the ills were suffering today in fact they were presaged the traditionalist here referenced would have stated according to his theory of the regression of the castes the the final age the kali yuga is characterized by the condition of the peasantry and of reduction to labor he was right were all serfs and we cannot escape but upward lets hope that something can bring this insane workbased misery to an end and signal a new beginning of an age of light,pxpzev

369,"My first work experience in life was with Amazon, and I've hated work so much ever since that I haven't been able to land another one.",so it all starts in 2017 i was 19 at the time soon to be 20 after failind and giving up on college i realised that i had to pay off my student loan somehow and needed to get a job for it an amazon warehouse in my city was doing some sort of presentation of their work specifically aimed at unemployed people and i was told to go there and check it remember i was young and impressionable back then at the end of the presentation they made us do a short test 17 questions about safety and stuff related to logistics and i learned later on that it helped them decide which shift to give us i made it with 16 out of 17 correct answers and joined amazon 2 weeks later       fastforward to a year later at the time i had been trained to do almost every possible tasks in the warehouse and was the only one in my shift able to do it even though we were more than 500 and whenever help was needed somewhere i was the one called which means i did around 67 different tasks every day when everyone else only did 1 i had to move pallets that weighed around 1 metric ton with a manual pallet jack because they kept saying they were too busy to train me for an electric one while i kept seeing people who didnt work with pallets at all getting trained to use an electric pallet jack which resulted in my shoulders being damaged to the point where i cant lift them high enough anymore and one day they put me as head of a small group that i had nicknamed cart pushers because thats all we ever did that job was a rotating one which mean the lead changed every day and they gave me the most useless team possible so i was basically the only one doing any work guess who they blamed when work didnt go fast enough yup me       i was mainly trained in receive and one of the tasks there had a productivity quota of 1 000 items an hour which was basically impossible to reach when we only received big items like coffee makers and i ended up getting chewed on every day because i couldnt reach the quota i often worked at the hazmat storage area with no way to protect myself from whatever escaped from corrosive and flammable stuff which ended up taking a toll on my lungs as well as give me migraines but what really pushed me over the edge was the fact that whenever i had to take a sick day because my body couldnt keep up anymore hr would call me when i got back to tell me about how productivity is important and if you dont come for a single day it will affect the entire warehouse so i got burned out and simply decided to stop showing up for work after 2 years of nearly flawless commute it took them 2 months to actually fire me and ever since then i havent been able to land a single job because i keep remembering how much of a slave i was in amazon       sorry if ive made any mistake in this english isnt my main language,pxpy87

424,"Preaching to the choir, but honestly we need to keep talking about it.",it has become impossible to afford living at the baseline income for americans and even attempting to keep up is futile        if you were to work for 15 an hour 40 hours a week all 52 weeks in a year you only make 31200 before taxes        if the 2019 median wage listed for an individual american citizen to make is 34248 and the government takes roughly 30 of that in income tax that brings us down to 23974 rounding upwards on the change we will call rent 1000 a month which is a conservative estimation for most people so now were reduced to 11974 utilities for the home internet and a phone are all also necessary to function in todays world with another conservative estimate we can package all those into 200 a month although its likely more which brings us to 9574 keep in mind that we still need to eat all year long even with careful budgeting each meal you eat will average 5 3 times a day over 7 days a week with 52 weeks in a year which now brings our expendible income to 4114 except that we didnt consider the price of gas or vehicle costs if gas is 3 a gallon and the average person drives roughly 14000 miles per year with an average of 24 mpg in most cars weve spent enough on gas to where we would only have 2365 left if we were finished in my state car insurance is the most expensive in america but we can just say the average person might spend 100 on insurance per month which lowers our total to 1165 before considering vehicle maintenance or car payments which will easily eat the remainder of everything we made for the year and likely push us into a steadily building debt for years to come        i didnt factor in sales tax clothing entertainment new technology having children and obviously forget being able to save or invest any of that for the future        the issue isnt the work its the system that houses the work its the manipulation to make us all believe that we are drowning simply for being born and that working hard is the only way to swim to the surface to stay afloat its not a matter of contributing to society as a whole its about servitude and exhausting all of us to a point where we no longer have the drive to stand up for ourselves and point out how this whole thing an abomination to the human experience        we all deserve better we all should be given the opportunity to simply live like house cats if we choose we deserve free shelter food healthcare and a nationwide wide transportation system that doesnt suck we should be given a baseline universal pay that meets the minimal needs of every individual while consistently growing to match inflation so at no point does the cost of living overwhelm the universal income meanwhile employment will continue to thrive because most people will still desire more than the bare minimum employers wont have to pay individuals as much per hour to enhance their lives because their living expenses are already covered so in turn the employers would pay more towards the income tax system which feeds the universal balance for all 10 an hour at work will feel more like 40 an hour because inflation will always be managed        maybe not exactly this system this is just a frustrated rant but you get the idea something needs to change because its only been getting worse and every decade drags us away from the surface and deeper into the abyss i absolutely care what happens to the generations that follow mine and its cruel that the people who came before me were happy to steal from me to feed themselves before i was even ready to enter into the working world        how would all this effect the economy the capitalists would ask and honestly just one idea of many but if thousands of individuals didnt make half of a million dollars or more per year and then dodge taxes on all of it we would easily be able to afford to keep the entire nation afloat        we all know that the only thing keeping us down is other people who were either born rich with limitless opportunities or was born with very little and took advantage of others to get ahead there are very few ethical paths to success and our society rewards the worst of us        this is my country and it fucking sucks,px7gt6

465,Rant about corporate..,yesterday was one of the most relieving days of my life i just quit an entrylevel job of a corporate facility they were the most micromanaging useless harassing piece of junk ive ever witness in my working career we were all working from home and if the call volume was too high they can restrict our bathroom breaks our metrics were measured god awful and the amount of cringe they were was insane i knew i fucked up when i finished my training and the manager who put me on her team told me that were family and that she loooves her job automatic red flags to begin with    it came to the point where the call volume wouldnt be high but they told us that we are service level black meaning calls and emails were coming in too much and they can refuse your bathroom usage if you tend to go to the bathroom or anything for whatever reason  you have to notify everyone what youre doing in the group chat they had us in to be honest that wasnt too bad for me however i cant imagine all the single moms that have children and had to do something with the child and having to explain that in the chat group that may be had 20 to 30 people    i can go on and on of how horrendous this company was but what made me mad is that on my last day i decided to cuss out my supervisor and manager and all the higherups i could find i even told the customers how horrible the company was and its funny because as i was telling these customers that the company was horrible and none of them wouldve ever figured that they treated us badly because our primary focus was always on the customers instead of the employees   but in doing that of course the supervisors pulled me aside and they clocked me out and told me that i had to take  an early departure which i knew what was gonna happen however they made me feel bad for doing what i did when in reality everything that they did made me bottle up so much feelings inside and on my last day of work i decided to let it all go     sorry if this went on a little bit too much tonight dissipated but i had to just get that off my chest i am starting a new job on october 4 and im very excited because it is some thing that im trying to do with my career and these are the first steps    tldr i was with the corporate bullshit for too long and on my last day i decided to cuss out management and also tell the customers how bad the company was and felt a little guilty for doing so even though they made me feel like shit the whole time i was there,px5px7

607,Can We Talk About This Type of BS?,how do you tell people theyre going to be laid off without telling them theyre going to be laid off this self help crap sells millions of dollars a year to fools who believe that if they give 110 theyll earn more money and god knows what else in an increasingly limited job pool sad  i once worked for a large student loan servicer it was one of the most eye opening and horrible experiences i had in my working life up to that point i was hired right after this huge govt entity just went public on the stock exchange i had heard how great it was to work for this company and thought i was lucky to be hired i quickly realized how wrong i was in one of the orientation meetings i had with the hr dept head she announced that the company allowed us to have a second job but not in certain fields oh boy i thought that doesnt bode well it just went downhill from there the culture was toxic they also required tons of over time month by month since going public they stripped away benefits and made cost cutting measures that included such things as downsizing our cubicles to accommodate more people which was kind of a false economy which will be evident soon i once was given a negative review because i didnt personalize my work space that is how crazy they were   a year and a half later there is a company wide meeting which wasnt that unusual but they were tedious and pointless my sister worked for the same company and was really good friends with one of the directors so i got the inside scoop on many things many people worked there because they were related to someone not great but i benefitted you take what you can get these directors lives were horrible i heard all the stuff they had to do each quarter because the company wanted them to always be reaching their potential they worked 60 to 70 hr weeks with no overtime as they were executives and not hourly employees she had to do so much work in the community as well   one of her targets was to give a motivational speech at one of the company wide meetings this woman decided to give everyone a heads up as to what was coming down the pipeline without telling them what was coming she decided to give a talk on the book  who moved my cheese she used the power point presentation that must also be available for purchase but added her own points which if you read between the lines let everyone know that layoffs were on the horizon i listened to her presentation and immediately after my friend i was sitting with and i looked at one another and she said i guess we should start looking for new jobs and we burst out laughing so few people understood that they were soon to be laid off it was sad all these people running around in tshirts the company had given them that had weve earned it written on them referring to the companys restructuring from a govt entity to a private corporation funded with tax payer money a month later the layoffs began they did it in such a way that everyone was just in fear that one day they would go into work and receive and email asking them to report to hr i survived the layoffs and was promoted to a different department my good luck didnt last long there was an accounting scandal and i was picked to be the fall guy i refused to fall on my sword for these asshles which made the scandal worse because i could actually prove i had been scapegoated i knew the writing was on the wall and resigned a month later but i will never forget the humanity that director showed in trying to tip other people off with that corporate self help drivel she remained with the company they eventually cut their work force in half and wound up renting out the other half of their building,pwrvrv

618,How the turntables...,its funny how businesses precovid were doing well and when business owners got rich they earned it  they deserved the profits the nice houses and cars the trappings of wealth because they worked hard and chose to take a risk  that said an inherent element of risk is that sometimes things dont go the way you want them to  now all these businesses have lost profits during the lockdown some customers are hesitant to come back because of covid even more are hesitant to come back as a result of slowerworse customer service which is a result of companies being understaffed because nobody wants to work  youre right  nobody who was making 8 an hour wants to see you drive around podunkville in your ferrari or your new escalade  nobody cares that businesses are struggling and why should they  you spent all those years smugly not caring if your workers were struggling  you felt entitled to your rewards because they were the result of your hard work yet failed to appreciate your employees who also worked hard and didnt get to share in the rewards of your success  and by the way if you took ppp or any other kind of government assistance to help sustain your business dont you dare shit on the average joe for collecting unemployment  thank you for coming to my ted talk,pwzqqp

622,Fake and urgent deadlines - an excuse to overwork people,these deadlines are all life and death apparently its beyond me how people are expected to put imaginary deadlines over their free time family and wellbeing like  people are expected to work through lunch after hours on the weekend and on their days off to meet these artificial deadlines and its not a one time thing   my roommate once worked from 9am 12 am16hrs for 3 weeks on a project including weekends she got 4 days comp off during which she was asked to complete the additional work this is because her company committed to completing the project in 3 weeks without consulting the people doing the work so she worked for 16 hours a day for nearly a month there were days where i had to give her food because she didnt have time to make anything  of course she got nothing for it except getting berated for low quality of work   i understand the people are doing this out of fear assume they will be fired or dont have the privilege of being able to quit bad jobs i dont blame these people i  blame the assholes taking advantage of them  i have wondered though if the reason for these asinine deadlines is to extract every minute of work from the employee i live in india where most people are salaried so people arent even getting paid extra for this so companies are getting more work for no extra pay like in the case of my roommate they got an extra months worth of work for free,px0wwu
623,*slaps table* another one (update),i posted a letter that my managers put up about ot a few days ago and a lot of people said that it was only about to get worsewell it did for me   we all got raises which helps address the reason why we were all taking overtime you may be asking yourself well how is that bad for you favoritism is how my raise means i make less money   basically you used to have a choice between getting the health insurance or getting an extra 100 every month as thats the money our bosses usually spent for their end of the insurance however they found a new insurance provider so theyre not spending anywhere near 100 every month idk if the coverage is any less i didnt take the insurance and only 4 of us didnt take the insurance so they decided to do away with the stipend instead those of us with the stipend got a raise to make up for it apparently they also gave out raises for the extra work weve been doing lately so while everyone else got 12 raises i only got 50 cents for my stipend i usually got 25week as a stipend that raise only adds an extra 20 for my pay   they have their reasons that imo are not valid to not like me on a personal reason they dont like that im friends with an ex coworker ive called them out on their unequal treatment before i recently had to call out due to an emergency while we were short it smells of favoritism because i got a shitty raise while people with less responsibility than me got 2 and now make the same or more than me this is bs after all the ot i did that they begged me to take  should i quit  tldr i got a raise but lost a benefit so now i make less money while everyone else got significant raises,pwsf2b

629,What are some valid criticisms you can think of this subreddit? Here are my own.,lets critique otherselves so we can better our agenda you cant better something without pointing out its flaws and trying to improve it so ill throw some on the table to get an idea going but feel free to throw your own as im noticing a lot of controversy occuring here  i think that this subreddit provides barely any solutions and mostly post memes and snippets of controversial workplace activity and opinions jokes are nice and all and i do enjoy a good vent but we need an abundance of solutions or discussions for some as well  another would be that the title of this subreddit itself as it causes mass confusion when first seeing it you mean you want to be lazy you mean you want to quit society and move to the wilderness honestly if there was a better shortterm word to describe what we stand for that wouldnt cause confusion that would be great this is a probably the lesser of the critiques but i do see it causing a big effect here  how far is too far it seems like a lot of us want to push toward widespread social change to better the work environment which is cool but we have to know our boundaries sometimes we have to suffer or cause suffering to exist you can see the same issues with hardcore veganism for example eat only plants and drink water everybody change and if you dont you are supporting the machine and are evil okay but it aint that simple to change and is an incredibly complex issue just like the current working situation ive also seen a recent post where they were discussing if not capitalism then what which is a valid point but like 85 seemed to want communism like come on there has to be a better alternative we know how badly communism functions unfortunately though i dont think you can have an absolutely perfectly government structure we just have to pick the best one or create a new one out of the lesser evils or the lightest shade of grey we can get it society is complex it cant be perfect  i see a lot of people also being unfortunately only for pushing towards changing the world pushing the agenda of antiworks beliefs and so on which is great however they seem to only be open to blaming the world instead of taking on actions that they can do as an individual changing yourself is easier than changing the world changing the world takes a lot more time so do what you can at the moment  pushing towards individuals changing their own circumstances when asking for solutions of what they can do gets criticised leave it up to supporting the cause and believe in this im sure those beliefs are great but i barely any control in convincing 1 person to do anything let alone billions when asking about topics like passive income whether it be through the form of investing setting up a digital store vending machines renting you can dismantle everything to somehow be wrong in someway each of these maybe be more valid than another but when does it end can i not own a vending machine because it means im exploiting a factory workers labour can i not invest my money into businesses i want to see thrive and that do good in the world is renting out a place airbnb owning a hotel or whatever really deserving of the criticism received here as it helps in our current workplace situation i think some of the answers to this have to be grey and maybe it should just be up to the individual to decide whether they are crossing a line or not  if you dont agree with any of these points fair enough but lets hear some valid criticism of this subreddit then,pwvhxw

712,Nearly 6 years at Domino's and I finally quit,this is going to be a long post probably i need the catharsis of getting this off my mind     my career at dominos started when i was 19 years old and needed to help my mom pay the rent it was fun at first even if i was nervous and shy when i first started i had opportunities to meet new sometimes strange people learned some new skills and learned about the area i lived in more thoroughly since i was driving around delivering all night all in all it was something i enjoyed at first despite some stressful times of the year when business would spike   at some point i decided it would be a good idea to transition into management i think traffic and being on the road was starting to stress me out too much just like driving working the inside and learning to make the food items was a fun learning experience at first   years go by people come and go we cycle through a couple of general managers throughout my time there some good some bad doesnt really matter because they dont affect my day to day shift too much over time ive grown tired of the place tired of the annoying or rude customers tired of the employees and their drama tired of trying to juggle work school a social life and trying to find an ounce of free time outside of all that   then i get an email from dominos it reads congratulations on your 5 year milestone  the amount of existential dread that hit me after reading that short sentence is indescribable what am i doing with my life how did i let it get to this point what am i still doing here im going to be here my whole life i think i nearly had a panic attack and yet i still got dressed and went to work that day   it has been about 9 months since i received that email from that point i began seriously contemplating what i was doing with my life and grappling with the idea that i might have to work a job i hate for the rest of my life not dominos just in general i came to realize that the degree i was working towards was just going to put me into another job i would hate technical writing writing instruction manuals writing for a business setting writing memos or doing editorial work i was working at a place that made me miserable making myself even more miserable by going to school at the same time and working towards making myself miserable for the rest of my life by getting a degree in english with a focus in professional writing   this past year was hell at my dominos the pandemic boosted our sales big time our store had the worst staffing it has ever had in a long time and more business than weve ever had i was the opening manager four to five days out of the week the past year i worked anywhere from 38 to 45 hours a week during the summer and for some reason i let the company walk all over me and exploit my labor while quietly seething about it   i woke up at 5am most mornings rushed off to work to get there at 6am rushed to do all the prep work  describing just how much work that is would take too long  before we opened because it was impossible to finish prep during business hours and there is this toxic idea at dominos where an opening manager can work 1000 dollars in sales by themselves and still be expected to stay late if prep is not finished so i do nearly all the prep before we open on top of setting up the store cleaning things that the closing crew did not counting money etc then i deal with 1000 to 2000 in sales with one driver  two if im lucky  and one other manager the days inevitably devolved into full order screens deliveries waiting on racks customers calling back annoyed the lobby filled with tourists no breaks and no time to eat it was a nightmare and on top of all that we were expected to have around 30 items each of prp ready before 5pm if any of you have ordered dominos before cheesy bread parm bites bread twists and pan pizzas are all prp prerush prep it is all expected to be done im supposing because the late night managers want all the side items finished before they even get there so their jobs are easier  that all leads me up to yesterday i woke up around 530 am to work on an art assignment for school i switched my major to creating writing with a minor in art as soon as i started the timer started before i had to leave for work two and a half hours no time to make any decent progress all i could think about was how much i did not want to go back to that store there is a festival in town this weekend yesterday i was scheduled with just one driver until 3pm just me and one driver i couldnt bring myself to get dressed i called my friend and she gave me the push i needed to quit my job with a text   i immediately felt a rush of relief and happiness nearly 6 years and it was finally over yeah i felt bad about quitting through a text message it was inconsiderate maybe irresponsible too but i havent been treated with even a little consideration from this company for a long time   i bundled up my work shirts and hats put them in a bag and threw them in my apartments trash compactor then i took a long walk and relished in my newfound freedom   now that i dont have some stupid meaningless fast food place taking up a lot of my time im free to pursue my dreams of writing and art   the funny thing is that i had requested some time off once summer ended i told my manager and district manager that i just needed about a month off for mental health and to recharge burn out was getting to me and i was thinking of quitting they didnt listen to me instead they wanted me to train an insider into becoming an opening manager then well see what happens from there if they had listened and gave me some time off i might still be there im glad they did not listen     tldr fed up with job over the years existential break down at 5 year milestone finally quit after what i can only describe as a summer of abuse and exploitation by both customers and corporate dominos,pw5dst
713,How do you guys do it?,for the record i really want to because ive become so disillusioned with jobhunting over the last few months and its destroying my already unstable mental health even more   i dont even know what im doing wrong i did everything i was told to do for my whole life never missed a deadline never skipped class got good grades picked a field to focus on went to uni graduated and now everywhere turns me down before the very first stage normally and then when i get an interview i spend the day preparing and travelling to it before never hearing back after   every job ive applied for has been minimum wage and in a field ive studied for five years straight which came at the hefty cost of mental stability yet i cant seem to get anything and i dont know what im doing wrong at this point i do have asd but id like to think thats not why im not being hired im more than socially competent i can handle an interview well and apart from a few stutters youd never suspect that i had it   so at this point i feel im going to have to eventually bite the bullet and go work a zero hours job at my local mcdonalds or whatever just to make a living and because of my mental health that idea fills me with dread without meaning disrespect i dont have rich parents nor any connections that can ensure me easy employment and just because of this alone i feel myself and most of the countrys population are immediately at a disadvantage   so how do you do it and how can i do it as in how do you afford a living without working in the conventional sense if you understand in an ideal world id drop all this fear and become a successful writer musician streamer or whatever and live off the money from that but lifes no fairytale so im realistic about my prospects   ideally id spend my life seeing the world and pursuing my creative interests but in this world it just seems that its bydesign that most people never end up doing what they really want to and at that point why should we even bother,pwkmy8

715,Engineering didn't work out as well as I thought it would,so when i was growing up engineering was all the rage to push middlehighschool students to shoot for during the 00s10s for their college education  it was marketed as a steady career path for technical minded young people alongside programming pharmacy and nursing  so i go through middlehighschool going to summer programs taking electives that would help me in college classes later  i join the robotics team i learn machining programming management gunning to become and engineer because im a kid and im just anxious about my future  i do well in highschool and get into a good engineering college lucky enough that my parents lived lean their whole lives to put me through college only child    i make it through college with a ton of technical skills in computing  however i learn that you cant actually get into an engineering job without a licensing process pe that involves paying thousands of dollars on additional testing and preparation  on top of this i would have to work under a professional engineer for 5 years before i can take another test and finally get my license  its just too expensive after 4 yrs of college too hard to find places with pes to work under and im just sick of school studying and throwing my parents money away also i got kicked off of my parents health insurance so i needed to get a real job  so i went into commercial construction designing buildings  anyway i dont really have a plan for the future after all this  im really good at my job but im already at the top of what i can make in this field and its barely enough to pay for my mortgage food and my familys medical bills  and this is all in a good job in a good field shit is just too expensive these days so any thought of upwards mobility is a fools errand  its the same with a lot of my friends who graduated too because a lot of them graduated with student debt and most people i knew in college are still living at home or in continued schooling because you just cant do enough to get paid to live these days,pwg8ui

728,I apologize for the long rant in advance; I am supplying detail information. Look for constructive advice as to how to handle being micromanaged (needing to take meds) and how to deal with incompetent managers?,i am starting to hate my job because of my boss we only have 2 managers my boss and his idiot counterpart lets call them beavis and butthead for this example since i have coworkers could possibly see this posting with beavis being my direct boss they over schedulemicromanaging the entire day if you are not showing in the phone system they call and want to know why you are not calling or waiting in the que i set appts for 2 divisions under a parent company both inbound and outbound calls i make 16hr working from home   they have 2 different programs for scheduling one for paychecks and one for daily tasks the daily tasks do change every day slightly and to complicate matters i live in one time zone but work in another somedays i have to work 3hrs before getting a 15 min break to just go to the bathroom another 2 hours before lunch for an hour after that on tuesday or wednesday 15 min team meeting to reiterate something weird policy change that was already posted in our slack main channel work another 45 minutes then beavis calls me while on a call i ignore it and call him back he wants me to verbally confirm i understand what was posted in chat and during the team meeting i confirm yes he then says something about my performance to keep working on reaching his daily goal of 30 booked yes sir  dont call me sir  work another 45 minutes take 15 minute break  try get something together for dinner jump back on the phone another hour before done for the day  this last month has been unbearable our industry is in high demand because of covid each week is something more challenging to make our job more frustrating is added to our plate  first off we have job codes for the divisions if job codes show ex w2 or g2 we are not allowed to book we have to mark as surplus and an other inhouse dept reaches out to them we have to notify the customer that we dont have availability and that once we do someone will reach out guarantee the customer will argue and want to speak to the managers noone is available to assist  then the next week they did a daily contest top 3 setters got 301st 202nd amp 103rd you could win several times through out the week employees were booking customers for both divisions so 1 customer counts for 2 appts without customers consent noone was notified of the winners numbers and there was no transparency at the rankings of all employees   following week our booking system glitched and any appts we set 2 days ahead only in a certain time zone fell a day behind good old usa said its getting fix before next friday   next week it was heres a service schedule check it before booking since we cant service certain states until nov 11th oh surprise we fixed the system glitch but customers are calling in pissed that they havent heard from local department offices since they were booked incorrectly because of the glitch they want to speak to our managers all of a sudden doug and bill are not available and they are talking through the slack window in private dm i can see this since both are show from my previous private dms to them both under my recent chats appt agents trying to get their attention and going unanswered in our main slack channel mrs priss i will post about her another time says just warm transfer them to local division office  last week we were informed now that we must say this call may be monitored for quality and training purposes that phrase exactly ourselves before engaging conversation like they didnt already hear it when they called in check service schedules looks  goodoops cant job codes show ex w2 or g2 we are not allowed to book we have to mark as surplus and an other inhouse dept reaches out to them we have to notify the customer that we dont have availability and that once we do someone will reach out guarantee the customer will argue and want to speak to the managers of course the both show unavailable at the same time again  i book an appt and double checked all the details got a weird error saying only 4 miles away from local division informed customer told her i would get her on the schedule and may have to call her back if theres an issue completed the call was just about to call local division office they called mepure luck i explained to sir that i did get a weird error saying only 4 miles away from local division for the customer and was just about to call them sir was cool said we just cant until december 15th no man power or availability i offered to call customer back and explain sir was like great whos your boss told him and documented the service ticket what local said and that i informed him that beavis is my boss left the ticket opened so i could document return customer call info sir said he would reach out directly to my boss by email and thanked me for being on my toes about the error message called the customer back notated that i informed them about the far off date and if they are still interested call local division directly gave the number and saved my notes   couple of days pass and beavis calls me through slack while i am booking an appt i just ignored the request and called him back when i was done he asks me to pull up the service request and says do i remember this call i said yes sir  he says dont call me sir he says he didnt bother to pull it up himself because of my great detailed notes telling me that theres problem with the local office and that he is concerned that i am pulling up offices the wrong way and he has already spoken to me about this before just berating me about how i am causing him a problem because his name is on the service request under the comments that 3 people above him are looking at service ticket and mad as can be finally i get a chance to speak i explained to him that local called got ahold of me that i documented our call answered sirs questions and followed through with the customer as promised he said dont ever document any of our managers names or say there names to a local office again he said he had just gotten to the sirs email and was being reprimanded by his boss top dog for not responding to local sirs since he didnt respond sirs reached out to corporate and they went to top dog to find out why his employee had yet to respond   so i get the bullshit since he isnt doing his job once again tells me that hes tired of talking to me and that he is tired of my rebuttals excuse me what they have me working 7days a week without any days off every other week he takes off every other weekend but is oncall just in case if a tech issue arises but never responds because our tech dept doesnt work but 1 person each weekend day our customer service dept doesnt work weekends at all so we have to fillin fir them too  when i was hired i was told one weekend a month and monfri the rest of the time theres always a manager to help book 20 appts a day as a natural firstborn over achieveraries personality i try to get more than the day before we would be given our schedules a month ahead and that we had paidoff all major holidays they changed that fast to you have to be there 90days to get the holiday off paid then next holiday rolls around now its 10 people volunteer then everyone else can have the day off paid but no time and a half holiday pay would be given unless you had been there over 90days what huh as of 2 wks ago told if you want a holiday off you need to request asap as they are making the schedules until the end if the year and no longer monthly you need to request in payroll program and send a detailed email to lucy will bring her up another time as to why you need it off what huh   apparently beavis will be out of the office for a few days and butthead is in charge my questions for you to review and suggest on should i reach out to top dog and let him know that i am being berated by beavis through slack because i was doing my job and constantly am interrupted while on calls explain to him my side of the local office sirs conversation explain to him that the daily tasks are causing me anxiety needing to take meds as i dont work well being micromanaged that prior to them showing me the daily tasks that i have a record of booking 40 appt a day   i feel under constant threat like beavis is going to fire me every time he calls me i am like damn what now and my defenses go up he always gives a backhanded compliment before berating me  at this point i dont give a shit about my productivity out of 40 people i am in the list of the top 10 producers my personal goal is to double book at least 5 people and get a few extras not exceeding 15 appts a day thats what is keeping me in the top 10   i expect some people to say that i am lucky to be working and i should appreciate my jobto stop whining or i am acting like spoiled brat   please understand im 42 yrs old raised in the south with manners beaten in me child of a hoarder mom verbally and physically abuse by my mom and 2 exhusbands  which caused my anxiety its getting very hard for me to leave the house becoming

so as the title playing states i quit my well paying job with benefits after years of feeling inadequate as a person due to my lack of income to give some background about myself i was raised by my mom after my dad died when i was 5 and she instilled the belief that the key to a good life would be to do well in school she taught me i could be anyone i wanted if i put the work in you know classic american dream shit you tell to your kids i loved my mom so i listened but she was never there having to work 2 jobs to support myself and my two older brothers so we occasionally got into trouble as any at risk youths with a single parent would by the time i did go to college in 2011 i was pretty much a full time hippie smoking weed religiously and experimenting with a plethora of psychedelic drugs and more i wanted to prove a point at the time that i could still get good grades and be smart while being a fucking druggie i went off to houston and was succeeding at first deans list both semesters in my freshman and sophomore years while exploring the depths of my mind with acid mushrooms 2cb and  peyote i was not worried about the future knowing that no matter what my brain would be able to figure a way out of any situation i found myself in i had already developed a plain disgust for the money is god religious fervor of western culture at this time having realized we are all one species floating through space and time on a shared home we call earth and that we are too busy fighting over pieces of the ground to realize the existential sadness you feel knowing that you are contributing to the destruction of your only home by participating in the systematic fuck we call capitalism was too much to take sometimes the social pressures of society the plain fact that if you want to eat you need to pay up the pleassure of mindless self indulgent behavior to escape the nagging thought you have in the back of your head that you cant help but feel is true in the pit of your soul that we are all dancing of a cliff and know one seems to care drugs right lolmy long time girlfriend informed me in 2013 that she was pregnant and she would be keeping the baby whoops lol i loved her and decided the right thing to do would be to finish up school get a good paying job and be the dad i never got to have so i got my degree in 2015 and started the job search how sad i was to realize that my undergrad degree was pretty much useless and i would either need to attend grad school which would mean loans and owing a shit ton of money or get a job that doesnt really use my degree the first career path i thought of to make money fast to support my family as my moral obligations required was sales i was extremely nieve and took a door to door sales job that i hated from day one then got a job as a car salesman for a month carpet cleaner for another month etc i fucking hated having to work with these sales type people the guys who drink too much would feel no qualms in their deceitful sales practices and who expect you to work 1012 hour days 67 days a week i moved back home and worked different call center jobs always feeling depressed feeling like an inadequate husband and father who cant even support his own family for the past couple of years now ive been working in life and health insurance sales and have been with a few different companies but always jumped ship in an attempt to find something that payed more all this time after college my wife has been trying her best to finish up her school but shes getting a degree in art and im not sure what job prospects there are in that field tbh weve definitely had our ups and downs in our relationship due to the economic struggle the feelings of relative poverty when comparing to peers and neighbors the embarrassment of having to talk about work with your family because they expect you to be making more and supporting your family i finally got the good job in april of 2021 great pay great commission on sales full health insurance they paid for pto and sick time but the stress of 45 hours a week of back to back calls the pressure to hit your numbers the constant breathing down your neck i did great though i gave it my all i was making 3000 checks after taxes every 2 weeks but i was depressed i was drinking every other day i drank coffee just to wake up but it gave me anxiety i wasnt paying attention to my now 7 year old son who is struggling in school and had to be held back this year due to falling behind during the lock down and above all i felt like the job itself selling medicare advantge plans was pointless when you believe healthcare should be a human right why was i spending what fleeting time i have left on this planet exacerbating the existential problems we face as a species so i can support my family i feel like thats how the system tricked me played off my love of family so i can be a willing employee willing to sacrifice whatever it took so that they knew i loved them i snapped last week and almost broke down i took the week off and spent time with my wife and son i told myself i would think it over and i decided i quit with no plan in place because life is too short to be wasted on dreams implanted by false programming or propaganda so yeah i needed to vent i feel like im making a huge mistake but at the same time i feel a sense of power im not letting my western cultural programming deem myself lazy inadequate and a failure any longer i figure ill find simple part time work just enough to get by and work on writing my stories now i just need to tell my wifelol  thanks for reading best of luck to everyone here sorry if i got off topic for a bit just figured some background would help,pwkrni

762,From Hardworking To... I Want Out!,so i see these random posts here from the hardworking people claiming its all lazy and the ones who never worked a day in life posting here well let me tell you about that  i graduated in civil engineering almost 20 yrs ago and its the stuff i really love i like technical challenges and it was so fulfilling starting my career on some massive infrastructure projects i was a green noob hungry for knowledge and full of passion about my work i was the one who stayed late at night not because someone asked me to and of course they did i wanted to know more to get better it was not about career progress at all it was literally about getting better in engineering and knowing more about advanced calculus i was interested in  that was 20 yrs ago today i am a design manager whos questioning his career choice and every day looking to get out of this filthy corporate man eating machine that is run by the most incompetent amongst us   after few years the noob wannaknowitall person was slowly being transformed in to a bitter overworked drone you see one would think engineering is about inventing new things and making stuff more advanced and better well its nothing like that engineering is about making things cheaper within the competitive budget available for the project which is then cut by first line of managers to look good in front of the ceo and the subsequently cut by every other manager down the line until youre left with crumbs to deliver something thats been built once in 100 years everyone is overworked to the point of collapse overtime is like standard in every engineering office nobody even questions how hr walks away from the office at 5pm like a clockwork while we stay late in to the night because its a project submission day and every week there is another submission and then on to the next one there is no time to discuss only time to patch up and submit the next deliverable   then you become a family and that engineer salary wont cut it anymore where do you go then must go up the manager level and if you dont want it you will be segregated and treated as a weirdo hey hes 20 yrs here but only an engineer what a looser this is where the true grind begins because to be a successful manager in this profession you need to be a psychopathic emotionless and ruthless asshole which is something im not and you guessed it im not very good at being manager i worry about people who work for me i genuinely feel bad when we do overtime and i must order it i spent sleepless nights worrying about letting people go if we dont get the next project bid its pressure beyond imaginable and im looking for way out i get shouted at by middle managers and directors every day im not meeting targets im being too nice im not delivering i havent seen my kids grow up as i spent most of my days in office i feel like the guy from cats in the cradle song thats my life  so fuck corporate and office environment fuck the useless non technical managers who took over our profession and made it so unlivable and constant grind fuck the governments for always being broke and looking for another cheaper unreliable low quality solution everything is cheaper from our solutions to our wages if anyone dares to tell you youre laze because you dont want your life to be destroyed by this monster tell them to fuck off,pw67pj

790,Feels good to be missed,first time posting but a funny story to tell     i was let go from my deadend pizza delivery job last week after being in the hospital for several days and my last few days worth of tips mysteriously missing earlier today my former boss manager a created a group text like she does every week and accidentally included me i watched as my former managers struggled to fill the schedule before finally manager b suggested that manager a call me and offer me my job back provided of course that i could make it in for a shift 30 minutes later     three laughing emojis and a large no may not have been the most professional response but it was very satisfying and funny to see them realize i was included in the text group i was then called and chastised for being lazy unprofessional and not a team player i reminded them that i had been fired not quit had worked there less than 6 months and was making 6 an hr outside of tips so no i was not concerned about trying to make it into a shift with 30 minutes notice just to get my shit job back while still recovering from my hospital stay     dont sell your soul lovelies save your skills for a time and place they will be appreciated not missed after its too late,pw30mn

834,I'm rooting for each and every one of you.,ive just now stumbled upon this sub in rall and i am so glad that this sub exists because i agree with so much of the stuff being shared here the norms of a 40 hour work week is absolutely terrible  coming from someone who has done both worked the 95 for a few years and has escaped i can say that doing your own work on your terms when done correctly is the greatest thing in the world some people out there will tell you working for yourself is so hard and stressful i wish i had a job but those people are just focusing on the negative and not realizing what they dont have to deal with anymore from the 95  this post is not meant to be a brag at all but more so of coming from a position of expressing that ive been where you are now somehow i managed to escape and i really hope you are able to as well  by the way this is my anonymous account in which i rarely post about what i do for a living to hide my identity so dont expect to see anything like this in my post history for this account  right out of college i got a job in the career i studied i didnt mind the work but i hated the lack of time freedom and energy more than anything not to mention i had a ton of student loan debt that was hard to keep paying off so i was living at home with my parents as well i have no idea how anyone making as much as i was could afford rent anywhere i was taking home about 2000 every month student loans were a few hundred a month gas car payment cell phone food and there is literally no way i could afford 500700 for rent   at the rate i was at it would have taken me like 20 years to pay off my student loans and not to mention how the hell i would be able to afford my own place furniture appliances and all of that needed to move  the job robbed me of my time i got off work at 5 took a 20 minute drive home went home to cook dinner and prepare tomorrows lunch at work its 6 oclock then i got to be asleep by about 9 or 10 because i wake up at 5am to go to the gym before work  the job robbed me of my energy all the time i had off work was just used to recover mentally and physically just so i could go back and do it all over again  one day i had enough of it i was building a side gig of my own and although it was very early in its infancy stage i had to take the risk  the final straw for me was that my boss said we werent allowed to listen to music in our headphones while we work anymore building up to that literally every week there was a new rule or restriction to our work that made things even more miserable than the last week  the last good news i did get was a couple of months before putting in my two weeks i was given a raise i think it was only like an extra 100month but i was already checked out by then and i actually felt nothing i honestly feel like they could have given me a 1000month raise and i would still have been as miserable and as stuck as i was  fast forward to now  i am living my dream life in terms of work wont go into specifics but ill just call it a side gig online freelance work i make my own schedule i get to sleep in every single day i can do whatever i want when i want there hasnt been a week where ive worked more than 25ish hours with this gig and i make much more money than i did at my job i make like 4 to 6x as much money in some months working half the hours when you calculate my hourly pay its about 610x in some months  if you are in a situation where you feel stuck in your job i promise you there is a way out you may never figure it out but i swear everyone can do it if they have the passion for whatever it is they want to do and they are creative enough to turn it into an actual source of income it wont fall into your lap you have to go out and get it try fail try fail succeed grow escape the 95  there are so many things that i could complain about the traditional 40 hour work week but i will highlight just a few from the perspective of being out of it and realizing how terrible it is to live that way  you cant use your phone  most jobs dont allow you to use your phone while youre on the clock or whatever getting in trouble for watching youtube or playing a game the phone that you are paying for every month you cant even use it all the time  you are at work more than home  pay for a house or rent an apartment just to only be there 3 waking hours a day its so terrible to be at work just so you can afford to live in a house that you are barely even at  all of your impulse decisions are based around your work schedule  if you have the impulse to stop everything youre doing and go buy a new tv you better hope you dont have this impulse at 2pm on a tuesday or at 10am on a friday because you cant just pause everything youre doing and go do it because that time is owed to your job you dont own your weekday afternoons you have to ask for permission and it has to be important enough deemed by your works standards to allow you to take that time off now if you have this impulse decision at 6pm on a monday you better hurry up and get to the store before you have to be in bed so youre rested enough for work the next day  being a few minutes late is the end of the world  this literally does not make any sense why this is such a big deal at a job if you pull into your work parking spot right on time you better not sit and mentally rest for 5 minutes or youll be late and in trouble but god forbid if your manager wants to take a 20 minute poop after lunch thats totally acceptable  if you have trouble falling asleep one night too bad  there are no jobs that i know of that will let you sleep in for a couple of hours if you were tossing and turning at night they dont give a damn be at work right at 8 oclock if you do call in and arrange it to where you come in later in the morning then youll have to use your vacation time and this will be considered a penalty to your sick days my old job would only allow us to call in sick twice a month or you get written up  end rant  time for the positive side of where i am at now  now i can go out of town whenever i want  there have been a handful of times where i have taken impulse trips out of town cleared my schedule arranged my work around my enjoyment and made it happen   i dont mind being stuck in traffic  my work only requires 2030 hours of work a week i have plenty of time to get where i need to be if im a few minutes later than expect to my destination it does not matter  i take action based on how i feel  when i had a job 95 of the stuff that i wanted to do i couldnt do it ever i had to be at work at the same time i had to eat at the same time i had to go home at the same time i had to go to sleep at the same time now if i feel like staying up until 2am to watch south park episodes i can do it if i feel like walking around at the mall on a tuesday afternoon i can do that very rarely do i ever say to myself i wish i could do this right now because i just do it  i can wear whatever i want  wearing a uniform or tucking in my shirt was such an annoying feeling now i work in the most comfortable clothes most of the time at home without shoes or socks on   theres so much more i can list off here as well  all of you who are feeling stuck in your 9 to 5 you feel like you dont have the time money or energy to be happy i promise you there is a way out the opportunity is there with the internet cell phones social media and technology only the people who take the right action and dont give up can escape  let me know if anyone needs

854,The sleezy life of working a New Car Dealership,i started a job in early 2020 at one of the highest volume ford dealerships in michigan i was in a tough spot after being let go from another crap job less than a week before christmas in 2019   i finally got this job as a porter at this ford dealership less than a month later we got hit with the stay at home order and got laid off for 2 months  when i came back i was pretty nose to the grindstone  kind of worker i avoided going into the dealership if i could  i saw most of the porters before me leave and watched everyone who got hired leave as well   there were two types of porters sales porters and service porters i was a sales porter and was part of the inventory department  my direct manager was the inventory manager but above him were the sales managers let me stress that the inventory manager was one of the best bosses i ever had however his powers over my employment were very limited raises pto and everything like that had to be approved by the sales managers all the other porters left due to the pay being an absolute joke considering our work had us exposed to the elements and the consistent pissy comments from management for things not getting done when they always pulled us from jobs to do something the sales team can easily do themselves  now that we are done with introductions lets get to why youre here after most of the porters quit there was a total of 4 of us left in our department 2 porters and manager and assistant manager around april of this year the world was hit with the chip shortage look it up if you are unaware of the significance of this with the shortage of chips came a huge inventory shortage as well  with very little inventory i spent most of my time in the dealership doing whatever was needed being inside the dealership i would over hear a lot and talked with the sales team more and it was eye opening ford closed up ordering units for stock due to the huge shortage and cars could only be ordered for customers specifically even with this being an issue the dealership was still making close to record profits the gm was not silent about this he would brag about it to anyone who would listen even after getting a dollar raise it still wasnt bringing in enough i would still be sitting at my starting pay if my direct manager didnt go to bat for me as he knew i was busting my ass day in and day out   the sales managers required all sales to have an extra 2k slapped on the back end of every deal which greatly helped their near record profits most salesman were also practicing something called packing the deal  which was essentially overstating the monthly payment and convince them to buy a car at an inflated price this was against company policy but management actually teaches them how to do it and get away with it as the dealership also gets some of that money too not everyone does it but its pretty common practice to rip off customers  if that wasnt bad enough management and our new corporate had a brilliant idea to recoup stock before anyone else they were still restricted by the retail orders only  that i mentioned above the dealership started using customer information to put in fake retail orders when the car comes in they will just say customer didnt want it and slap it in stock they pulled out old customer info and even forged customer signatures using the cursive font of the computer i saw sales managers doing this left and right they did this over 1000 times not an exaggeration   it always kept going deeper i saw them fire a woman  in financing because they found a hotter younger girl to do her job no explanation just fired her in the middle of meeting  the high volume sales people would also get assistants who are basically someone to work with customers so you can double up on customers they will pawn off most of their work in underpaid guys and get barley any of the commission assistants quitting was very common as some of the salesman were just absolutely horrible people some worked to rip off customers more than others  i could bore you with everything but that would take all day and id be surprised if you have read this far into it  im no longer with the company as all of these things made me not want to be part of this company  a week after i left i saw them hiring for my old position for 2 dollars more than what i made after close to two years with them   let me leave you with this my job had me visit many dealerships and the shady nature is universal  do not trust salesman its their job to make you feel comfortable and let your guard down they are definitely looking to squeeze every cent out of you buying brand new cars is a terrible investment buy used always you will not get your moneys worth out of any new car every good review you see on a sales person is from some poor soul who got talked into bed with no lube  dont tell your sales person youre gonna go shop for a better deal on a new car they know the minimum the car can go for and they know you arent fooling anyone they know youre bluffing and that deal will only go up the next time you come back because they know you exhausted your options,pvzh05

873,I refused a ‘promotion’,posting this from a throwaway account   for some context i work a unionized job at a fortune 500 company where im paid hourly i get paid double time and a half for stat holidays vacation and my pay is reflected by the number of hours i work including overtime if offered in this position we work 5 8 hour shifts per week with two guaranteed days off   in may i was approached by the general manager and asked to work a non union management position due to staffing shortages temporarily he told me for the sake of simplicity they would continue to pay me my hourly rate and i should just enter my time worked as i did in my old position after i checked with the union it was okay to do something like this i agreed for the sake of helping out and trying something new  i found out quickly that i was not a fan of the job and that there were some stark differences in the schedule   the schedule is rotating 4 on 3 off or rather its supposed to be that way but ive had to work a few 6 or 7 shift straight the shifts were originally 10 hour days instead of 8 again not so bad 2 hours of overtime every day is nice  on the 13th everyone in the team im working with has been mandated to work 12 hour shifts and for the existing salaried employees there was no pay raise   2 weeks ago i got a phone call from my manager telling me he had a job offer for the position i was working looking to make it a permanent arrangement almost immediately i said no simply based on the fact i knew it would be salary however he insisted i at least read the offer before i gave an answer looking at the contract it was a salaried position with a stipulation on the salary offer citing this salary consists of payment for all hours which you may be required to work in the performance of your role which loosely translates to unpaid overtime bearing in mind the salaried employees are entitled to a bonus based off both the company and their performance after running the numbers based on an average bonus it comes out to around 12000 less than i make without working any overtime after reading the offer i once again declined   not long after i was called into the general managers office and was given an hour long lecture about how im closing a lot of doors and leaving a lot of opportunities on the table for future management positions if i say no i just told them regardless of the potential for promotions i told him i saw very little value in taking home over 10000 less and working an average of 40 hours more per month their justification for the pay cut being that my job title is the highest paid unionized position in the company and we do get paid very well so its hard to offer a competitive wage for an entry level management position he kept telling me the money will come sometimes you need to make sacrifices and make yourself more marketable within the company   i was also not a very big fan of the carrot and stick approach of take the job offer and see where your career goes or return to your unionized position and a lot of doors will start closing for you here,pvq4e5

923,Heinrich Böll's Story about the Lowering of Productivity,this is a classic german short story anekdote zur senkung der arbeitsmoral anecdote concerning the lowering of productivity published in 1963 by heinrich bll and translated into english by hansjrg bittner university of east anglia it was written for a may day program on the ndr a german news channel and adapted as a classic story in many other nations including mexico and brazil i thought it is incredibly poignant today nearly sixty years after its original publication so i thought id share a translation of the original story source herehttpswwwunihildesheimdemediamigratedcontentuploadstranslatingheinrichboellpdf i just transcribed the pdf  ampx200b  to work or not to work  in a port on the western coast of europe a man wearing shabby clothes lies in his fishing boat and dozes a smartly dressed tourist is just putting a new colour film into his camera to take a picture of the idyllic scene blue sky green sea with peaceful snowwhite crests of waves black boat the fishermans red cap click and again click and as all good things come in threes and as its better to be on the safe side click for the third time the dry and almost hostile sound wakes the dozing fisherman who sleepily sits up sleepily reaches for his cigarettepacket but before he finds what he is looking for the eager tourist already holds out a packet right under his nose putting the cigarette not exactly into his mouth but placing it into his hand and a fourth click that of the lighter finishes off the zealous civility this hardly measurable and never verifiable excess of rash civility produces an irritably embarrassing situation which the tourist who speaks the language of the country tries to bridge by starting a conversation  you will make a good catch today  the fisherman shakes his head   but i was told the weather is favourable  the fisherman nods   so you wont put to sea   the fisherman shakes his head the tourist gets increasingly nervous to be sure he is deeply concerned about the welfare of the man in shabby clothes and sadly frets over the missed opportunity  oh you dont feel well  eventually the fisherman switches from sign language to the actually spoken word i feel splendid he says i never felt better he stands up has a good stretch as if he wanted to show off the athletic shape of his body i feel great  the facial expression of the tourist grows more and more unhappy no longer can he suppress the question which as it were threatens to burst his heart but why then do you not put to sea  the answer comes promptly and briefly because i already put to sea this morning  did you make a good catch  my catch was so good that i need not put to sea for a second time i had four lobsters in my baskets caught nearly two dozen mackerel  the fisherman finally awake is now thawing and slaps the tourist soothingly on the shoulder the worried countenance of the latter seems to him an expression of inappropriate yet touching anxiety  i have enough even for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow he says to relieve the strangers soul do you want a cigarette   yes please  cigarettes are being put into mouths a fifth click the stranger shaking his head sits down on the rim of the boat and puts down the camera for now he needs both hands to give his speech emphasis   i do not want to meddle in your personal affairs he says but just imagine you put to sea today for a second a third or perhaps even a fourth time and you catch three four five maybe even ten dozen mackerel just imagine that  the fisherman nods  you put to sea continues the tourist not only today but tomorrow and the day after tomorrow indeed on every favourable day two three or perhaps four times  do you know what would happen  the fisherman shakes his head  in one year at the latest you would be able to buy a motor in two years a second boat in three or four years you may perhaps have a small trawler with two boats or the trawler you would of course catch a lot more  one day you would have two trawlers you would for a few moments his enthusiasm leaves him speechless you would build a small cold store perhaps a smokehouse soon afterwards a marinating factory fly around with your own helicopter making out the shoals of fish and giving orders to your trawlers by radio you could buy the fishing rights for salmon open a fish restaurant export lobster directly to paris without a middleman  and then once again his enthusiasm leaves the stranger speechless shaking his head saddened in the depth of his heart and almost bereft of his holiday delights he looks on the waters rolling peacefully into the harbour where the uncaught fish jump merrily  and then says he but again his excitement leaves him speechless the fisherman slaps him on the back as one would slap a child choking over his food what then he asks in a low voice  then says the stranger with quiet enthusiasm then you may relax here in the harbour with your mind set at ease doze in the sunshine  and look out on the magnificent sea  but that is what i am doing just now says the fisherman i relax here in the harbour with my mind set at ease and doze only the clicking noise of your camera disturbed me   in fact the tourist thus put right became thoughtful and went away for he used to think he worked in order that one day he need not work any more and there remained in him not a trace of pity for the fisherman in shabby clothes only a little envy,pvpo47

939,Theirs a difference between working overtime for yourself and for a company,just a little thought experiment i wanted to share i have sworn off working more than 40 hours a week for just one company the company i work for now doesnt really require me to up my hours as i can get my work done in less than 8 hours i also have a side hustle than i do on the weekends and a few weeks days just to take care of some of my bills besides rent i would never work over 50 hours a week for a company because my roi is gonna be shit for that not much added benefit outside of the company making more money of course but i do plan on starting an online business where im gonna be working my normal job and working on the side business off hours and weekends im gonna be easily clocking in over 60 hours of total work time but only 40 of that goes to the company and the other 20 or more hours goes directly reinvested back into me eventually ill be able to have it up and running where i can quit my day job and focus full time on my business where again i would still hope to work under 50 hours a week i guess my point is im gonna have to sacrifice a lot of time to accomplish my goals and dreams but thats ok if im reinvesting all my time back into myself and not to make some other cocksucker rich i think its totally ok to work a lot of hours if you are seeing the full return on investment even then you should probably find a business plan that allows you to somewhat automate a lot of things and have more free time in the end online businesses cut out a lot of middle man bullshit and you can limit employees if not completely eliminate them i only plan on having a few people do contract work for me at some point it wouldnt be a full time salary position i would never start a physical business in todays day and age moral of the story your time is limited here always find ways to reinvest in yourself not someone else,pvu916

944,Quitting for my mental health.,hi everyone my first time posting here ive been at my job for 6 months now and recently had a mental breakdown i work in a medical setting and have seen old folks with dementia being mistreated by other staff im very empathetic and so its taken a toll ive reported things and management doesnt care they told me that occupancy is going to double before the end of the year but more people wont be hired   ive been sick for a week with a noncovid illness and i was out of work for a week management has texted me showing no remorse for me being okay only asking when ill be back i am 99 sure im leaving without notice to preserve my mental health it sucks because i make okay money but contributing to an organization that shakes my moral compass is not good for me   my two concerns are leaving the patients amp not being able to use this job as a reference  otherwise i know its the right choice any advice on how to handle this would be appreciated thanks,pviqqr

947,My anti work story,i just stumbled on this sub and its great i thought id take a moment to share my own anti work story with you all and how i sort of rose above all the toxic bullshit   in june of 2015 at the age of 29 i began working for the usps as a city carrier assistant its the absolute worst professional experience ive had in my life things began pretty rough like any new job but i stuck with it and became good at it too good within months i was given absolutely ridiculous workloads sometimes two full mail routes a day 7 days a week week after week and month after month fast forward to the next summer were short handed and ive worked 90 days straight i lost count i asked the postmaster for a day off because im exhausted she begins to chuckle youre the office bitch after that exchange i thought to myself ok im supposed to get a full time spot in two months ive stuck it out for a year i can do two more months no problem  two months go by and mere days before im to be awarded a full time spot with benefits im told they management screwed up seniority and the lazy asshole who called in sick every other week will be getting the spot instead im furious but no business near me pays as well as the post office so i continue to stick it out   several more months go by and were rolling into december its crunch time everyone is pissed and overworked by the nonstop flow of holiday parcel volume its early morning and im preparing my route for the day but something is wrong im experiencing so much pain in my groin i begin to feel nauseous and i begin to wonder how it will be possible for me to deliver my 16 mile walking route i express my concern to my supervisor to which he replies go to the bathroom and throw up youll feel better i went back to work for 20 minutes before i returned to his desk this is bullshit im going home use some of my vacation time to cover my hours im going home sick i went home and took some ibuprofen and a nap woke up several hours later still in pain from there i went to the er where after several hours i learned i had cancer it was everywhere and my body was lit up like a christmas tree in the ct scans i call work the next morning and explain i wont be back until i figure out what the next steps are as ive been prescribed heavy painkillers   5 months later im back at work ive been through enough chemo where my tumors have shrunk and i kicked the painkillers however ive still got 4 months of chemo followed by 6 months of recovery this doesnt sit well as i need a lot of time off for treatments and other doctor visits they were also expecting the same 70 hour a week wage slave so it shouldnt be surprising that i met resistance when i presented management a doctors restriction for 40 hours a week id be thrilled if i had an employee with stage 4 cancer that was still willing to put in full time hours even though they werent receiving full time benefits  2 years later im still considered part time cancer is gone and im still working far more hours than the full time regulars that receive full benefits i go back to the postmasters office to make my case only this time i have an ace up my sleeve i sit down and tell her ive been here nearly 5 years the amount of work i do justifies the creation of a new full time position at this office if youre unwilling to create that new position then i will have no choice but to bid on full time positions outside this office as im now eligible to do so she declined   that was her mistake she thought i was bluffing within two months she had multiple requests for my employee file from other offices  in the end i chose a full time position at the post office in the next city over it wasnt a carrier position in fact i dont touch the mail at all anymore i became a custodian which is generally a position saved for disabled vets  now im guaranteed 40 hours a week no mandatory overtime full benefits and pension union support and best of all there is legitimately only 3 hours of work for me to do and i get 8 hours to do it so while im still at the bottom i was able to rise above and get the hell out of that toxic office and unreasonable workload i have my life back i have enough time left over every day that im able to spend the afternoons and evening fishing kayaking hiking or just be a couch potato if i want  i know most of us wont become rich so i wish the best for all of you and genuinely hope that you can find yourself a golden parachute career like i have,pv7ds3

994,Teachers Expected To Be Parents To Students…Or Going To Work And Doing Someone Else’s Job..My Word To Teachers,of course this has been said about every generation but recently this has really been getting out of hand gtschools across the nation are being vandalized and destroyed by students and recently a school in my area shut down because the students got too out of hand i shit you not  students are misbehaving like fucking crazy and teachers got to suffer right now and i know because even when i was in school a few years ago i was seeing this shit too gtteachers are even being threatened and assaulted by parents because of school mask guidelines  parents realize they hate their own kids and expect teachers to babysit them gtwhen covid lockdowns first hit parents had to watch their children for what felt like forever to them for the first time since before they went to school during this time parents nationwide had seen how bad their kids really were  gtparents were all over social media complaining how bad their children were and that they couldnt wait to send them backso youre telling me that instead of dealing with your child as a parent should do youre just going to allow them to continue being bad and send them back to school instead of correct their behavior not only is that shit parenting but youre literally not punishing your children and teaching them to be better kidsso you guys expect teachers to deal with them  social media argues over who should teach kids morally gta recent facebook post about a school shutting down because kids refuse to behave even after being punished has started a debate this debate is about who should be teaching kids to learn to be good people the teachers or the parents  gtin these comment threads so many parents were calling teachers lazy millennials for not punishingteaching their kids to be better news flash parents its not the teachers job to parent your children their job is to educate your child on the provided educational topics  gtparents also dont realize that schools are now limited on forms of punishing kids many kids now take advantage of this and will intentionally get in trouble knowing the punishment wont be much they will then keep doing bad things as the punishment wont affect them as i said in a comment thread i told the story of how a teach i had quit because of the students the students constantly went to the office got detention had the principal on them and the students kept coming back and mistreating the teacher worse each time even parents were called and the parents refused to put their child in check  the ipad theory which has ruined modern day parenting gtthis is a theory ive formed for years now as ive seen it in real life on multiple babies and children the theory is that if you give a child an ipadtabletphone to distract them theyll grow too attached and will lose focus of reality once they gain focus of reality and see its not like it is on the videos they watched on the tablet this will cause an entitlement and spoiled attitude to develop  gtmany parents refuse to punish and deal with their child instead they just give the child the tablet or ipad and put kids youtube on to distract them that child will be glued to that tablet for hours and once it dies the kid sees how the real world isnot so fun and boring from their perspective  the child will then try to recreate that fictional world they saw on the tablet and develop a spoiled attitude where everything must be theirs the kids youtuber always has nice things and gets nice food so the child thinks thats how reality should be and starts demanding everythingthe tablet and kids youtube doesnt show the real side of the world how bad things can happenso when a child doesnt get what they want it leads to tantrums anger and destruction   gtputting kids on a tablet at a young age can be very destructive for how they grow up to turn out to be i suggest it should be limited on tablet use ive seen this happen in family members and other people my younger cousin is a prime example and whenever her tablet or phone died she threw tantrums and cried like she was being killed she would get in constant trouble and have things taken away but it wouldnt work because she wasnt being punished hard enough shes be ungrounded a day later and get all her electronics back shes even started trying to assault me and my other family members and face little punishment nowmy other little cousin was the same but one day when i was watching him and didnt give in to him he threw a straight tantrum for a whole hour i had a long talk with him and now hes changed since then,puxcwy

1055,Did I make the right call,i quit my job with a very good salary and walked out earlier this month only been out of work 2 weeks   it was quite a small company who discribed themsleves as a family already that was a red light they even said in the interview well somtimes we yell at each other like family too another red flag on my second day i was told by my manager so and so the higher up will call and rip into you but they wont start yet because your new if you want to keep your job youll sit and take it we all do i said to the line manager if they do that i will complain and leave i dont put up with that at work  so over the next few months this is what i see the higher up lets call them bob i wont specify the role but it was c level  so i started to see sales staff come in all puffy eyes like theyd been crying it turned out bob would call them whilst they were on the road to work and start screaming at them about their work before their working day even started   the work load was way to high you were expected to do the work of 3 people by yourself and failure to do so would result in the calls i just mentioned on top of the calls you would get emails from bob also complaining about your work they never said thanks for anything as well   bob knew some of the staff were on the road for 6hrs a day which adds up to about a 13hr day and bob still behaved this way  bob clearly didnt understand that people dont get motivated by being given to much work to do then being yelled at multiple times a week on top    in this time make the company millons in profit which got recognition from the ceo yay me but i hate being micromanaged and hearing constant moaning and i dont like authority thats the rebel in me so at this point im losing my mind and my mental health is in freefall  the week i quit i was pulled into a meeting with the other staff and written up via email a full 2hrs before my working day starts the meeting was via video call and basically bob took the time to tell me how shit i was and how my work was unacceptable and that if u didnt like what he said i can leave etc he did swear and did use personal insults all in front of over staff he mentioned how he was trying to help me and that he was being fair they had offered no objectives regarding the project and bob seemed to believe i should be able to read his mind dispite me asking for direction multiple times not enough help was offered  during the meeting bob was literally changing colour because he was so angry it turns out one of the staff was related to bob and he treated them even worse bob was discribed to me as someone who likes to see if they can break people   of course i spend the rest of the day not doing any work i then called bob later in the day and said i dont like the way people are being treated bob then told me their position entitled them to speak to me like that so i gave notice their and packed my bag and walked   now im unemployed and need money i had a 2 day panic attack where i could bearly breathe and have been sick along with it my recruiter says im over worked and too stressed   what are yalls thoughts on this i think i made the right call id rather work part time now if im honest,pv7h8i

1095,Dear r/antiwork: My job almost killed me; I'd like to tell you my story.,summary  ampx200b  my job almost killed me luckily i have a military pension so in late 2017 i left a note with some colorful language on my desk and i walked outforever  shortly thereafter i had a nervous breakdown and i almost died on the way to a mental institution on monday im going to start working as a doordash driver and i am going to study in the car in between deliveries i am going to invest every penny that i earn into dash  ampx200b  end of summary  ampx200b  in late 2013 i retired from the us military after 20 years of service  for all of its faults the us military was very well organized  we were well trained and the expectations were very clear and very reasonable  working for corporate america after my retirement was quite a shock  ampx200b  in early 2014 i started working for a large american corporation that i wont name  i was hired as an administrative assistant   i soon realized that they were paying me for one fulltime job but they actually gave me the workload of 3 fulltime jobs  ampx200b  fulltime job 1 scheduling the use of building training resources  i worked in a training department and i had to schedule resources classrooms conference rooms etc  i also had to take meeting minutes during several important meetings  i worked on a site with several hundred employees who had to compete for limited resources classrooms conference rooms etc so this job was challenging ideally i should have been at a desk for 8 hours a day doing this job alone  ampx200b  fulltime job 2 training completion data entry  we had a data entry system to record the results of all training sessions  again on a site with hundreds of employees we did a lot of training  my employer was too cheap to automate the data entry process so each day i had to manually enter the training records for the whole site by hand  many days i had to stay later after work unpaid overtime to successfully input the entries  ampx200b  fulltime job 3 maintaining training books in the training classrooms  our industry was old school virtually all of the training material was in the form of paper books  our main training room had over 100 books in it and each classroom had training books in it  by myself i was in charge of every page in every one of those books  in our main training room for convenience the trainees were allowed to write in the books in pencil during the training sessions  they typically held 4 to 5 training sessions per week and the company expected every page in every book to be pristine before the training session started  so each day i had to go through each book looking for random pencil marks and either erase them or print a replacement page  this was by far the most stressful of my 3 jobs  new revisions to pages were printed all of the time so each day i would get boxes and boxes of new pages to enter into the books  weekend after weekend i came in unpaid overtime to try to get all of the revisions entered  ampx200b  i take pride in my work ethic but they made it impossible for me to succeed  they would ask me why didnt you get all of the work done  they didnt want to hear you need to hire more people or you need to automate some of these processes or you need to shift to electronic tablets  they made me feel that there was something inherently wrong with me  ampx200b  in late 2017 i finally snapped  in mid2017 i started waking up and hearing electrical noises in my head  i knew that something was physically wrong with me and that this job might eventually kill me if i kept up the unsustainable pace  the final straw happened on a monday morning  i had spent the entire weekend unpaid overtime of course putting new revisions into the books in the main training room but i was not able to finish  my plan was to come in early on monday morning and finish  i came in at 6 am and a staff training session was scheduled to start  at 630 am  i entered the room at 6 am to enter revisions  i had done this hundreds of times before staff training was less formal so i could normally enter revisions while staff training was ongoing  one of the new trainers came to me and said to me very disrespectfully why are you in here  i replied entering new revisions i do this all of the time  he then said you have to leave ill ask everyone if its okay for you to come in ill come back out and let you know  i thought to myself that was weird and i left  about 5 minutes later he came out and said they dont want you in the room  he offered no explanation why  ampx200b  it made no sense logically  i just quietly sit in the back of the room entering revisions  it doesnt interfere with their training session at all  i spent about a minute playing back all of the humiliations of the past 4 years in my mind  enough i thought to myself  i went to my desk wrote a note with some very colorful language and i walked out  it was the best decision that ive ever made in my entire life  my military pension is the only thing that gave me the freedom to walk out  ampx200b  shortly thereafter i had a nervous breakdown  i started hearing voices and my wife tells me that i started acting very strangely  she called an ambulance and they started to take me to the hospital  as they were driving me a voice in my head told me they are going to kill you  they took my clothes and they put me in a hospital gown before the drive to the hospital started  soon after i heard the voice i took off my gown and i jumped out of the back of   the ambulance as we were moving down the freeway at about 65 miles per hour  by the grace of god i wasnt killed by a vehicle when i jumped  i ran as fast as  i could and they never came back for me  butt naked i exited the freeway and i ran to a nearby 711  i told the clerk to please call the police  he did and they picked me up and took me to the hospital  i ended up spending about a month in a mental institution  ampx200b  since this happened i have worked for other large corporations  a few months ago i found rantiwork and i realized that in not alone  a lot of people experience the same things that i experienced  i realized that this is a systemic problem  i dont think that i can ever again work in corporate america in its current form  ampx200b  on monday september 27 2021 i will become my own boss working as a doordasher  the pay is low but i will invest every penny that i earn into dash illl explain below  ampx200b  technology is not diverse at all there are very few minorities and very few women i am a minority male  i love technology and i want to find a way to independently make a living in technology  while doordashing i will listen to technologyfocused audiobooks and podcasts  ampx200b  i love the digital currency aspect of technology  in 2018 i learned of a poor young man from africa named nathaniel who submitted a business proposal for a technologyfocused business to the dash network  he was funded to the tune of several thousand dollars  that proposal is here  httpswwwdashcentralorgpbuildingadashyafricaphase1httpswwwdashcentralorgpbuildingadashyafricaphase1  ampx200b  as i read nathaniels proposal i was inspired and i started planning how i would eventually escape from the slavery that is working for corporate america  ampx200b  the people in the dash community voted overwhelmingly yes  to fund nathaniels proposal and my eyes were opened to a whole new philosophical concept  the more i studied dash the more intrigued i became  they were run extremely professionally for example  they hold a quarterly summary call   httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5ypjigy37kghttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5ypjigy37kg  ampx200b  my plans moving forward  the pay as a doordasher is very low so i will   study hard while i am driving   invest every penny that i earn into dash   if and when dash appreciates ill start my own business   in the future i may submit my own business proposal to the dash network  ampx200b  thank you for reading this post  rantiwork was one of the things that helped to rebuild my confidence in myself and i am forever grateful,puka39

1112,"bell hooks on modern-day work, masculinity, and patriarchy",many men use work as the place where they can flee from the self from emotional awareness where they can lose themselves and operate from a space of emotional numbness unemployment feels so emotionally threatening because it means that there would be time to fill and most men in patriarchal culture do not want time on their hands victor seidler expresses his fear of having downtime in rediscovering masculinity confessing i have learned how hard it is to give myself time even an hour for myself a day there are always things i am supposed to be doing a feeling of panic and anxiety emerges at the very thought of spending more time with myself he argues that most men have such a limited sense of self that they are uncertain that they possess selves we could want to relate to competition with other men in the workplace can make it all the more difficult for men to express feelings or to take time alone the male who seeks solitude in the workplace especially during downtimes is seen as suspect yet when men gather together at work they rarely have meaningful conversations they jeer they grandstand they joke but they do not share feelings they relate in a scripted limited way careful to remain within the emotional boundaries set by patriarchal thinking about masculinity the rules of patriarchal manhood remind them that it is their duty as men to refuse relatedness  the will to change 2004,pupp6s

1206,Having a baby helped me release the guilt I carried from internalizing capitalist propaganda,tldr extended my mat leave feel liberated fuck capitalism  i live in canada and had the choice to take 12 or 18 months maternity leave i work for a large financial services company and this is my first baby i am the classic overachiever type that was raised on the idea of meritocracy and blah blah blah work was important to me and i wanted to do well and thought i should find purpose in work i never did jobs always made me miserable and i have worked a wide range of jobs eventually i decided i just need to seek out decent pay and benefits and stop caring whether the job is fulfilling because i will likely never be fulfilled by work i am fulfilled by my personal life i work to pay the bills  i was so anxious making the decision originally how do you choose how long you will need off when you have never had a baby before how would it look if i chose the longer leave when i have only been at this job for a few months would i lose my mind being home with the baby and long for adult interactions and being productive and using my brain and just die of boredom a few people i know had mentioned maternity leave was torture for the above reasons they were bored they longed to return to work so i freaked out about it and told my workplace i was taking the shorter leave of 12 months  the moment i had my baby it all felt so fucking stupid what is another 6 months to this company they will continue making money the business wont stop without me i dont even like my job it is tolerable best job i have had to date but by no means enjoyable i emailed them and said i changed my mind and i am taking the full 18 months  i feel like the weight of the world has been lifted off my shoulders for the last few months the 12 months felt like it was flying by and i was so sad to have to leave my baby at 1 year looking back i feel so foolish for letting this guilt about needing to be productive and using my brain and showing my workplace that i prioritize my career influence my personal decision of how long i want to be home caring for my child who was i trying to impress what was i trying to prove i am an introvert and love being home i love babies and kids and really wanted this i dont really like my job why did the choice for an extended mat leave feel so damn complicated  alsofor the record you definitely do not stop using your brain when you become a parent my mind is running nonstop 24 hours a day i am having so much fun and putting all my time and energy and intellect into caring for my child feels 100x more fulfilling than zoom calls and reports and arguments with various departments about project timelines there are other ways to be intellectually stimulated than going to fucking work and that is not to say that it is easy or that i judge people who didnt enjoy their mat leaves this is about how years of capitalist propaganda clouded my judgement to the point that i couldnt originally make a really obvious decision that was the best for me and my life and my preferences  also id like to add a sincere and heartfelt fuck you to all governments that deprive new parents of taking appropriate leaves to care for their children looking at you usa fucking brutal i feel bad celebrating my 18 month victory when so many new parents get fucked with 6 weeks leave or no leave at all it is sickening,pulmod

1234,The US is a whole different breed,this story starts from 2019 but the ages ill write are as of current   my uncle64m owns a small business that employs 25 employees he has no family of his own and closest relative to him is my family but he lives overseas the way he was managing the business wasnt that good but also wasnt that bad hed just complain unmotivated employees high expenses etc here and there   so i23m visited him and his business and we talked everything about it for almost 3 months i proposed a plan to him to which he agreed but few months later he got sick and his health started deteriorating to the point he asked me if i could manage it i accepted but for the mean time until he gets a replacementor so i thought   here are things that i changed  1 increased every employees salary by 30 their salary was slightly higher1020 than the market wage  2 made the whole month of june pto its the least active month and doesnt generate much revenue so might as well make it pto  3 hired branding and advertising agency  4 hired a few more employees to ease workflow processes   5 fired my uncles friends his son there were complaints about him not doing much work and mild sexual harassment uncle knew about the former fact but not the latter nepotism is real in this country but not in this company   6 decorated the whole workplace and vehicles in a way that theyd lift up the mood    a year after this changes the results were  1 the employees were much active and motivated to get work done  2 revenue was 40 higher than the avg of previous 2 yearswhich is huge and vehicular expenses went down by 36 my guess is employees started taking care of the vehicles   3 had employees come up to me with clients theyve found themselves  4 no one quit and there has only been three callinsick cases the whole year   second year20202021 was all good but not much growth but we hadnt invested in anything that year so understandable    i left for college after that and uncle hired his friendwhose son was fired i told him that wasnt a good decision but he promised nothing will change and his son wont be hired as a thank you he put me on his will few months went by and i get a text from one of the employees saying that friend was corrupt and suspected he might be stealing told uncle about it and he investigated it few weeks later he only told me he fired him but wouldnt say the reason   he rather quickly hired an mba graduate who studied in the us and that mf changed up everything he gave a speech in which he said he set the salary back to the market wage which is 4050 lower and said if you want those increases then work for it removed june as pto and the one that pissed me off the most is that he said therell no longer be free coffee pods and that they should get their own ever since ive talked to my uncle and he said hed set up a meeting with him physically present and i through ms teams uncle said hed give me the courtesy to fire him remotely lol   as a conclusion i think this kind of thinking stems from the us its a known fact that the us believes solely in money so maybe that could explain their greediness and hunger for power to control everyone so they could get the money for themselves,pudici

1238,My Old Teacher Got Bullied By Students Into Quitting Her Job…Principal Couldn’t Do Nothing About It,the reason why i make this post is because recently a school in my area shut down and has made all students go back to at home learning because the students have misbehaved so bad due to the lick challenge that the school punishing students isnt helping this has led to parents arguing that the school should be the one to teach kids morals  for context  gti had this teacher during my senior year of high school all of the previous years all i heard was how much students loved her and how she was considered the best teacher in the school she was there for a long time and was extremely chill during the last 20 minutes of class she let us all have free time and do whatever we want we also got to watch tons of movies and do goofy acting activities  what led to her quitting  gtmy class was quite possibly the worst mix of kids to have in a class half the class was full of divasyes gurll queens the other half was full of dudes who would always act up then there was the very few people who werent either and were just there to be there  gthalfway through the year queen fever came upon us queen fever is when the most diva esque people unleash their inner diva to the extremes and annoy people with it thats when the class first started acting up and getting out of control  gtduring the second half of the school year many of the guys and girls would constantly argue and fight with each other in class it got so out of hand to where it became a constant and nearly everyday thing  how she ended up quitting  gteventually all of the drama got so out of hand in class that students would start back talking the teacher on a daily basis so bad that the students would start arguing with the god damn teacher and we werent even 2 months into the second half of the year either these arguments would take up so much time and then other students would join in on these arguments and make it worse  gteventually drama got so out of hand that people started being sent to the office and getting write ups and saturday school our form of detention at one point half of the class ended up intentionally misbehaving to get on the teachers nerves it got so bad that i shit you not half of the class got sent to the office the principal and vice principal would constantly be called in but as soon as they disappeared here comes the students ahit talking the teacher again  gtthe teacher had one last plan instead of the fun laid back class we would normally have she changed the whole class up no longer did we sit in groups but spread out we had to do book work and reading in silence which we never did and the teacher said we would do this from beginning to the end of every class until we got our acts together class was an hour and thirty minutes long so imagine just sitting in silence doing book work  gtnone of this worked and even more petty students started intentionally making as much noise as they possibly could and started fights to show their way of rebelling against the teacher  teacher quits and gives her grievances while class cheers  gtaround march the teacher comes in and sits down and has everyone listen the teacher explains how stressed she has been because of the class and how its been affecting her mentally she then says never in my years here have i ever had a class that misbehaved or acted so bad i cant believe it i gave you guys everything and yall still treat me like this she then announced that she would be quitting and never working at our school again and that she would not be there the next time we came to class  gti shit you not after she said this the entire class except me and a very very rare few fucking cheered and was praising hallelujah i was like wtf is wrong with this class dude if you guys are wondering this happened over near memphis so i guess you could see where the bad class even comes from  gtstudents who had her in other class periods were actually very sad that she was quitting and i was too its fucking horrible how many of the female students in my class straight up challenged her to a fight like wtf  what can we take away from this gtmy former teacher is literal proof that no amount of punishment from a school or a teacher will get a student to behave she gave many people chances and even tried to give us moral speakings but the class kept bullying her which drove her to quit her job not even the principal could do anything about it  gtparents you need to discipline your kids and teach them better a lot of parents dont know how their kids really act but a teacher does too many teachers have been bullied at parent teacher conferences because they gave timmy a f for refusing to do a assignment the parent then argues that timmy is a saint and would never refuse to do work,puc82i

1258,1/2 pay for disability,tldr im on disability until february at least due to my job making my anxiety and depression much much worse i am receiving 12 my usual pay but this pay cut is a lot less stressful than actually going to work also my manager sucks and the company sucks for making my manager suck and i fear the company might find an excuse to eliminate my employment due to this whole thing     about a month ago i went on disability for severe depression and anxiety now my job wasnt the cause of it i know this but it definitely was a huge contributor because my job is incredibly boring and full of people who clearly dont want to be there so having casual fun conversation isnt an option because everyones so bitter save for one maybe two of my coworkers and i dont want to deal with it    id been stuck doing the same thing all day 12 hour workdays for over a year begging for cross training so i can at least contribute and feel like a part of the team extremely loose use of the word instead of being stuck with this mindless task of literally just moving and scanning boxes of our manufactured product   the thing is the pay is pretty good and the health insurance is a necessity ive been sticking around only for those reasons because in theory i was going to save up for a year maybe two to move somewhere with better job opportunities and health care  but  my manager has hounded me about the stupid break policy that the company has 1 hour tooltotool meaning that i have to use one third of my break time taking off and putting on the full body clean room suit and getting to the lunch area i among others have protested this policy and literally no one gives a shit what the company says about it except for the managers  he caught me coming back from break 1015 minutes later than he wanted me to due to the companys policy and held me up for about five minutes complaining to me about not being at my tools which is where i was headed annoyed with him wasting the companys time i said whatever and continued on my way i got written up for that and he wouldnt accept that he was just wasting time that he apparently cared so much about   my manager also told me that i had to let someone know if im going to the toilet so the tools dont sit another instance where we are supposed to take off our clean room suits so it takes more time than to just go in do our business and head back nobody and i mean nobody covers the tools when ive gone and i am the one who gets the flack for it if my manager catches me coming back from the bathroom   also when people call out for any reason the manager demands a doctors note for us to come back to work   dealing with that and the sheer boredom of the mindless stupid job ive never been bored before turns out boredom makes me anxious and angry all i can really do all day is think and overthink and i hit a wall of depression and twelve hours of thinking in my already darkened mindset led me to seriously contemplate offing myself   i called my manager the last day i was there two hours into the workday and told him i needed to go home im clearly in emotional distress at this point telling him my heads awash with terrible thoughts and the first words to come out of his mouth were im going to need a doctors note  i responded with you already have a universal fucking doctors note for my depression and anxiety i am not going out and searching for another goddamn note for you probably could have handled that better but again i was in distress i did apologize for my response but expressed that he should never have said that to someone in the state i was in in the first place   a week and a half later my doctor was talking to me about my return to work date which was fast approaching and i nearly had an anxiety attack on the spot   i will be starting a therapy program next month which will take 1618 weeks i decided to go on disability for this time because frankly i need to get the hell away from that place if im going to make any improvement on my headspace   i know its not exactly legal but i fear the company will let me go not that it would so much be a problem for me other than losing my insurance because i intend to find other employment elsewhere when i feel like i can muster an interview or three but the company has done some real shady shit and have shot themselves in the foot many a time   and im well aware that if they have a layoff it hasnt happened in a while but its happened fairly often they target people who are on disability which i guess since they arent contributing to the company is somewhat understandable i guess  but not entirely indiscriminate   i need the insurance and i hate that i need the insurance because i would have left a long time ago if i could get the healthcare i need and apply for unemployment for a time after leaving   sorry for the rant theres a lot more with this but it would have turned into a novel instead of a shirt story at this point,pu0tmc
1259,My answer to 'what is antiwork?',   antiwork  is against exploitative work like extorting someone to work for you  under threat of homelessness starvation or loss of healthcare once  these things are guaranteed rights then work will truly be consensual  and workers will have the power to retain the value of their labour  thats  what antiwork is about working to enrich yourself rather than a  capitalist they think work should be optional and consensual and  should enrich the worker right now capitalists and landlords steal the  value of labour from people who actually do work theyre parasites  a big section of antiwork is simply pushing for a ubi and more workerowned coops to bring democracy to the workplace     thats my answer what is yours,pu59jy

1263,"My children, I must tell you a story.",it was right before the pandemic started and i was out of work for more than a year and of course desperate i went through a temp agency i got a dishwashing job at a big fancy government building that served galas and stuff   it started out okay but 8 hours in me not having worked for more than a year i was dying lol i had welding jobs before working 10 to 12 hours by hour 9 i was done mentally i mean i wanted to go home 8 dollars aint worth that   we were taking a break and i just straight up asked the second highest payed after the head chef how much he makes he had been working there for 10 years he made 10 dollars an hour this 50 something year old man 10 dollars an hour working one of the hardest jobs i had ever witnessed   we are talking about a place that feeds thousands of people i was just awestruck and i realized he was a much stronger person than i could ever be i would have killed myself i was amazed by him   i told him straight up you need to quit why would you do this to yourself i told all the other temp workers too about the place i know of that is always hiring their conditions are shitty compared to other jobs but that place was heaven compared to this fucking place   im a welder and 10 dollars an hour is like the minimum i had promised myself years ago that i wouldnt do service industry jobs again and that reminded me why that shit was soul crushing   the temp agency asked if i wanted to do that job forgetting my previous experiences i was like what the hell i will try it i will never make that mistake again   the temp agency was like yeah they dont want you to work for them again for leaving early i worked 10 hours after a fucking year of doing literally no physical  work i felt like i was going to throw up i hadnt eaten anything because i knew it was going to be rough so i was retching but there was nothing to throw up   i replied yeah what a coincidence i never want to be a dishwasher again and that was that   i went to that temp agency because they were advertising welding jobs the mother fuckers when i asked them about the welding jobs they said they dont have any right now so i gave their other jobs a chance,pu0v3e

1267,I only have 10% in my contract but I work 70-100% (for several years now),i live in norway where its normal to only have a part time job so my contract says 10 but i work from 70100 every week i have talked to my boss about it but she keeps saying things like well due to covid19 we get more customers but when covid19 is gone you cant have a 100 contract because there will be fewer customers where i live everyone goes to sweden because its cheaper there  even before covid19 started i worked at least 70 yet they wont give me a more secure contract   i hate working but i need 100 contract to buy myself a house because the banks wont give me a loan when my working contract is on 10 even when i have made alot of money and dont spend my money on bs   how is the boss expecting me to wanna work for them 100 when they dont give a shit about my life as long as theyre happy with their lives they dont care that their employees future is insecure  also there are only part time jobs available where i live because its so easy to manipulate the employees and then throw them away when they dont need them anymore,pu0ujg

1269,The cause?,i think there are many reasons we are where we are as a society and why the world has become such a difficult place to work in  it started of course with the advent of electricity leading to the assembly lines and forced urban living just to survive  this then led to the slippery slope of devalued and more importantly interchangeable human labor  modernly i think one simple rule could make a world of difference getting rid of franchisesif we didnt have 10s of thousands of mcdonalds and starbucks and subway and ralphs and so on we would have so many opportunities for people to fill the void open small local restaurants pharmacies grocery stores and everything elseif all of the burger joints closed people still need to eat and others will step up to open places and the middle class would be reborninstead of some guy opening 20 or 200 wendys locations then sitting at home and paying minimum wage to everyone  20 or 200 people would open new restaurants maybe run it with family and so on  there would also be the added benefit of innovationnew places would encourage new ideas and creations and the burger and hot dog wouldnt be the main or most well known american dish,pu3fps

1272,A little long story about something that broke me.,hi new guy here so to break the ice ill vent a story which happened      i just read a post by a guy on this subreddit who is replying to his manager because he needs a day off during the week and when he asked he was shut down and the manager said i cant promise      this hit really close to home     i was in my final year at university had finals coming up and was working at vodafone yes i will say the name of the company people should know as a customer care guy we were a pretty sizeable group and had a roster where we would know one month in advance      on the day of engagement almost a year and a half before this episode i have asked for one specific thing i need a month off unpaid during my finals so i can study i need off time due to my personal disability otherwise i wont be able to study on and off      a year has passed had my finals sorted it out no worries manager was nice about it and did it for me      the following january  i asked for the month off i had asked for beforehand the managers mood wasnt there she said well see about that dont worry      come june the month of my finals now it has been 8 years but i remember the dates i needed to be replaced 7th 12th 21st and 22nd  yes i have been traumatized by this and i cant fuckin get any sort of justice but oh well i went to my manager panicking telling her look ros i really need these days off for my exams at least she replied with yeah you need to find replacements      i was flabbergasted i literally just shut down i told her  i have asked for days off i really need these days at least for my exams ignoring all study days  so i didnt even get my month off      she just sent me asking people not very social and was a part timer during evening shifts and part timers rarely spoke to the full timers since they worked mornings who i barely knew and who literally wouldnt care if i was in trouble as they didnt know me if they could work my shifts i got  3 down and needed 1 more     so i went back on the manager and asked her if she could find someone for me she was like you know the roster i am busy go      the next day i spoke to hr who told me i had to work otherwise i would need to leave the job but still work my notice which pretty much meant id be working from the 7th till the 21st so id be back to square one     i dont know what i did exactly but  i asked if i didnt come to work what would happen so he said youd be considered deserting work if you do it legally thus you will be fired      so i woke up the next day sat down started focusing on my finals and never went back     its been 8 years since this happened it affected my life a lot and i never wrote anything about it to anyone but here it is      i am not anti work i am anti abuse,pu0vm0
1273,What is the purpose/reason of having OT exempt professions?,the term exempt employee refers to a category of employees set out in the fair labor standards act flsa when an employee is exempt it primarily means that they are exempt from receiving overtime pay  well technically you arent getting paid at all after 40 if you are salaried    so i understand if you are actually managing a bunch of other employees but why do normal professions end up being exept from overtimecomptime   then you end up falling into the usual  if you work 70 hours no one says a word but if you work 35 without taking pto days then you are in trouble,pu5om6

1278,Pay Day is Such a Strange Concept,i really like my job the people i work with are great i enjoy the work and i feel like im genuinely contributing and being useful rather than just making someone else money   however due to some oddities of how pay roll is kept im not getting paid for the entire month of september i should be paid twice in about a week once on the 30th and once on the 1st all of this despite working all month   its such a strange concept that a job can make you work with essentially just an iou like i have clearly provided the agreed upon value but because its more convenient for them they get to hold on to that value for almost a month in this case   its a relationship that absolutely does not go the other way i cannot have them pay me and tell them i owe them the work   i dont really know if this fits here i was just frustrated when i checked my account and had nothing in there again,pufsnk

1282,"I got a job offer with higher pay, more paid days off but a longer commute - i need your experience",so im working at this company for 8 years now it was my first job after school im living in germany btw because of this im lacking of experience on how to decide maybe some of you could help me   the job itself is awesome i love what im doing but everything around it sucks my boss is an ahole laughs about the concept of worklife balance doesnt want to pay our overtime but refuses to let us take them off too so he tries to disguise our christmas bonus as a bonus when in reality its just our overtime money he was furious when we demanded more paid days off so instead of the legal minimum of 20 days he gave us one day extra the law in germany says 20 days but its more than common to have 30 days i dont know anyone who got less than 30 even in times of lockdown he said homeoffice is a nono even though my job is the number one example from working from everywhere in the world im working 40h per week  the very big plus i only have a 1520 minute commute my colleagues are the bomb im very good at what im doing there and i love my tasks the pay is mediocre but since im very frugal i am able to live with it the job is very secure for at least the next 5 years  so now ive got a job offer from an old classmate  ive been working with him for a few projects as a side job the last couple of months and now he wants me fulltime he offers 3 days of homeoffice 30 paid days off only 375h per week and 4k yearly more than i am making now plus im suspecting a christmas bonus  i love to work with him he cares a lot about worklife balance and that the team is happy  the big bummer the two days i have to be in the office are a 1h commute each way and i dont know how secure this job is since this company is rather new   its driving me crazy right now im in my comfort zone where im ok with my job i learned to not give a shit about my boss do my work go home and live my life  should really leave this safety for something new,puesdc

1307,My thoughts from the beginning of the year,i posted the below on social media near the beginning of 2021 before i had heard of this sub now that im trapped fulltime in an office i felt like sharing    so yall have probably seen a berjillion comments on the interwebz about this or have heard it from me but im in the office and thinking about just that and decided to actually put some thoughts into words rambling as they may be as i dont do this very often  with vaccination numbers rising and covid cases dropping im waiting for the inevitable question of when do you want to come back to the office full time something that was being asked of me throughout the entirety of the pandemic  it may just be millenial ol me but my answer is never working from home is amazing prior to the pandemic throwing a wrench into things work was 8 hours of sitting in a cubicle with maaaaybe 2 hours of actual work and that was if it was done at a leisurely pace when there wasnt anything coming in i had nothing to do oh theres always something to do but im fairly certain we all know that more often than not entails some tedious task that isnt important enough to warrant being in our job descriptionsduty rosterswhatever   the pandemic has certainly held a mirror up to the way we live and having been mostly working from home for a year now i dont really want that to change being bored at home is different from being bored at work as you can imagine when ive finished my work at home i can take care of the chores and work on all that selfimprovement and maintenance were ideally supposed to have time for in our society but really dont though thats a rant for another day from better informed folk barring the days of existential dread melancholy and frothing rage towards the sheer idiocy of my government amp fellow americans i had time for those things i lifted weights practiced music on my apartments balcony and even dealt with the pile of laundry that occassionally graced my bedroom floor  when the pandemic is over whos heard that a million fucking times i dont want to go back to an office because its all my bosses seem to know they dont seem to understand that if i have my laptop and an internet connection i could work from anywhere and unbeknownst to them have parks my car etc theres always an attitude of what if we need ya well you know how to use a phone and email so if you can figure out a scanner youre basically caught up with modern office tech that scanner is im 100 certain the only reason i am still required to head into the office every day scanning documents cuz no one else can be bothered it seems when i was at home and lifting weights practicing music etc my work phone was never far once i was notified of something that needed doing it was done but i always had the feeling that my bosses thought i was being lazy to be fair i am and just coasting along playing video games which i tried a few times before accepting that having them interrupted by callsemails really sucked the fun out and i stopped i still feel a little bad about that one but in spite of what they thought the work got done they just werent seeing me in my cubicle while it happened   my earlier comment about millenial ol me comes from the frustration of my bosses desire to get me back into the office like its the only thing i have to look forward to after the pandemic coupled with their seeming inabilityunwillingness to learn some basic tech i dont say this to shit on older generations but to refer back to that mirror i mentioned many of us saw that we didnt have to do things the way they have been for decades and i feel that my bosses are stuck in that old corporate office school of thought that the 40hour work week is still the endallbeall and havent learned a damn thing or otherwise gotten with the times were supposed to learn and change for the better on an individual and societal level with new information thats the fucking point of it all a tangentially related note their idiotic decision to have me work partial days in an office late last year to be productivepart of the team meant i was surrounded by folk who halfassed basic covid safety measures resulted in many of us getting sick with the virus while i laid in bed struggling to get a satisfying breath of air i wondered if i was going to die and what my chances of getting admitted to a hospital were im still mad and have none of the respect for my bosses that i used to i hope their maskless meeting at the table was fucking worth it  overall i think the point im trying to make here that youve all heard in one form or another is that things could always have been better for us and it took a fucking disease to show it my situation is not a blanket statement that could be applied to every profession amp walk of life or maybe it could with some tweaks but the fact is that all our of lives couldve likely been less of a struggle in a myriad number of ways ubi universal healthcare housing costsrent an educational system that wasnt treated like filth a goverment comprised of individuals who actually understand grade school science etc and to see so many people who want to go back to the way things were before like that was fine isidiotic wishful thinking i dont lambast the sentiment the years been fucking rough but to come out the other side not knowing better is a recipe for fucking disaster when this happens again hopefully not in our lifetime but it will happen again and maybe next time the body count wont be literally worse than 100

1312,Anyone feel like taxes are way too high for the average working American?,i dont care about raising income taxes for higher brackets because they get most from capital gains and that needs to be addressed but theres such a jump for people making 500k or less a year i know some anesthesiologists can bring in 300500k and it makes sense because theyre also paying 36k in student loans malpractice etc i dont think these people should be punished for getting through medical school and being skilled but if youre making like 110k or less it for sure feels like highway robbery especially because we also have to pay into health insurance etc its like you grow up poor and somehow claw up to 6085k right im still at 47k but will reach 85k over four years on a contract but then 85k turns into 62k after taxes then you gotta pay premiums and retirement then you get reamed by property and sales tax and before you know it your net income is what your gross income was at 47k i know the median income for average americans is like 35k and theyre worse off but the point is that it feels impossible to get ahead and afford a house and not be stressed like if you make 9k a year you get taxed 10 what bullshit is that like that pays 13 months rent in some places and thats it its just insane you get laid off and get severance or unemployment taxes when you need it most i hate taxes in the us because we get nothing to show for it they immediately claw it away before you even get your check idk maybe this is an unpopular opinion but it frustrates me that people at the bottom get taxed so damn much in income and spending and we have so little after we are literally peasants first world privileged peasants but still peasants,pu0eyi

1338,What would be the best way to structure an employment agreement that sets boundaries for roles prone to abuse and exploitation in a company with a poor track record of supporting its lowest tier employees?,this subreddit has given me the motivation to fight for better treatment conditions and of course wages  but its hard to watch my unenlightened coworkers devalue themselves and trade their integrity for empty promises  i want to give you likeminded empathetic humans a scenario and see what the community thinks  i work for a massive corporate global real estate company despite a lot of archaic unfair crony bullshit they have better than average benefits and have resignedly embraced remote work since the pandemic began  they have basically 2 employee categories the hourly very low wage workers and the salaried midhigh wage workers everyones wages are low relative to industry average  most live under constant threat of layoffs or pips and the accepted company culture is for anyone with direct reports to behave towards them with open hostility  office employees are treated especially abusively by entitled and aggressive real estate agents and managers   so they predictably lost most office employees and struggle to replace them because the low paying high stress roles require so much knowledge and there is no real training you are expected to expend massive amounts of emotional labor caring for the needs of the most immature coddled unethical people youll ever meet some truly heinous agents received unearned and unneeded pandemic funds and still have the audacity to threaten the wage slaves handling their daily needs  so hopefully you can feel the vibe im describing here of what its like to work in an office with these people   the majority of the prepandemic office employees who remained were offered full time wfh roles in an effort not to lose them now the company is desperate to entice the wfh people back into hybrid roles training the new office staff their short sightedness is finally causing them enough pain to offer candidates but not internal employees more money  the handful who escaped that hell are slowly being individually persuaded to agree to these newly created roles they will never consider those of us in the loser category for higher paid roles so a new role is the best case scenario without quitting  the recovering traumatized staff have been conditioned to take whatever is offered so they just refuse the role rather than negotiate  how can people in a situation like this collectively bargain there are some very talented people making 17hour who have been with the company for many years who now have a massive amount of leverage but just cant face an abusive and demoralizing negotiation process their confidence is just shattered and they justifiably suspect the company is preparing to trick or exploit them anyway  theyve adjusted the reporting structure which was a huge concession so we dont have to worry about abusive managers anymore but there are a lot of concerns that offices will still treat any staff role as their slave  how do you ask for things like  no expectation to meet demands outside of predefined tasks or reporting onsite limited to business need as determined by employee or requests must be scheduled via calendar app  so basically  i need help with the structure of an agreement that sets boundaries to protect employees from exploitation and gives them channels for handling disputes,pu4eoc

1342,"I joined the antiwork movement in 2016, but have been depressed and regretting my decision for years… until I found this sub.",hi my story is similar to a lot of yours except i didnt have an encouraging support group to fall back on instead i was met with backlash from my family and certain friends and made to doubt my decision for years  i was working for apple corporate i started as a contracted employee and the big goal was to be hired on directly to apple this was a gauntlet of dog eat dog competition and networking asskissing i wont get into the details of the petty and asinine things i was reported to management for just so someone would hopefully have an advantage over me it was sick also apple has a strong drink the koolaid cult vibe to which i eventually bought into as someone who came from a pentecostal brand of church i recognized this every step of the way but i needed that job  finally 10 months in i was hired nice benefits better pay than ive ever gotten in my life it was the dream i even got a promotion 2 months after my direct hire i ended up in a tier 2 team taking on a very manageable work load with an incredibly supportive and amazing manager over the next 6 months she mentored me and began prepping me for management training sadly she got a promotion herself and was transferred to a different department this is when my personal hell began  many things happened very quickly over the next month we got a new manager who stepped in and began his warpath uprooting anything that had been established previously so he could pick his own favorites this included my opportunity to be trained for manager i would have to prove myself all over again he was then after a week transferred from my team we got a new manager and he as well was transferred after a few weeks this is when we got dexter dexter was a socially inept dweebynerdy yes man a type our vapid area manager was quite fond of dexter promptly changed our cubicle assignments to put all the attractive girls next to him my seating didnt change lol   i had a meeting with dexter early on to discuss my management training and to let him know what i had worked on and that i was willing to do whatever it took to continue that path he was none too interested he told me my email handle time was a little low and that i would need to work on that before even being considered for further training i should say that yes my email times were not exceptional but more around average i just had trouble focusing on it where i shined was on the phone i could get people taken care of and off the phone faster than anyone on my team period and with exceptional client satisfaction and feedback dexter didnt give a flying fuck back to the cubicle with me  shortly after one of the girls dexter moved to his area started getting the management training opportunities then shortly after was made a manager my spirit was from then on broken shortly after this the girl was stupid enough to text another of the girls who was moved nearby that she had been having sex with dexter scandal dexter was swiftly fired and the girl got to keep her position but was moved to a different department as she had lost all respect from the hundreds of people in our area  anyway i got 3 new managers over the next 3 months that is six different managers for my team in 6 months and was being relentlessly picked on with action plans for petty grievances even though i was one of the area managements favorites they had doubled our workload twice in the past year making it no longer an easily manageable thing but rather an awful never ending stream of people who were angry because we didnt have the time to assist them properly my last manager even had the fucking nerve to recommend i get prescribed to adderall so that i could cope with the new workload i finally broke it was sxsw week and i was stuck in a cubicle staring at the beautiful austin hill country outside i walked out and no call no showed the entire week while i enjoyed life came back the next week expecting my card not to work when i buzzed in the door but it did they gave me the degree of if you want to stay its going to be much harder for you you will have to not be tardy at all for 9 months or you will be let go i left i quit   i have been struggling ever since with gig work but i was able to pursue my music and passions i lost the stress of the corporate america but gained the stresses of the poverty line i will say i am easily happier working for for smaller businesses and gig work when i need but my family and others were always there to remind me how stupid my decision was i now no longer deal with these doubts after reading you alls stories here i am absolutely proud to be a part of this movement that i wasnt aware i was a part of till recently and it is time to make working in this country more sustainable and less time consuming lets fucking do this i also have a story for my job before apple

1385,How do we fix staffing in the restaurant industry?,hey yall i wanted to post this question to draw on all of your experiences to try to find a solution for my current situation  i am the general manager of a restaurant and i am on salary that means that i have to work as many hours as required to keep the restaurant running smoothly it is a small business with one location that is looking to expand and we are currently in the process of opening some new locations  for perspective the owner is a really nice guy who wants to use his position as a restaurant owner to create a workplace where people can be happy make a living wage and have a work life balance i am in the unique position of being able to help shape the culture and trajectory of this business to achieve the goal of making it a place where people are actually happy to come to work and make a wage that allows them to support themselves it is a great opportunity and also a great responsibility  the issue im running in to is how to allow people to have the time off that they want to live their life the way they see fit without fucking other people over in the restaurant the restaurant industry has long run on exploitation of laborers people are broke and hungry for hours so that they can pay their bills so when there is a lack of coverage in an average restaurant there are plenty of people willing to take on extra shifts to make ends meet  in our restaurant everyone gets a living wage and has the availability they want to go to school travel or do whatever they want to do in life because of this when we are short if someone goes on vacation staffing the restaurant falls on me our staff doesnt want to take on extra hours because they are already getting paid enough to live comfortably and they have a life outside of work totally understandable im working 70 hours next week because someone who i was relying on ended up leaving while 2 other staff members were set to go on vacation because he wants pursue his creative dreams and was invited to a bunch of events i am happy for him but this is putting me in a bad situation and is not sustainable when it comes to building a model for staffing a restaurant there is nobody else to staff the restaurant other than me our owner is the kind of guy who will come in and help out whenever but he is also out of town for a family commitment so it is bad timing  all that being said im not so much talking about this specific situation as i am about the industry as a whole how do we build an industry that can account for unexpected staffing shortages without keeping employees in a state of constantly being hungry for hours and without fucking over management with 70 hour weeks i am excited to hear this communitys thoughts on this situation,ptl9n5

1394,The chance to change work culture,ive been following this sub for a little while now and with it i found my new home i know a lot of people and i am one of the only self employed entrepreneurs that i know i am a 31 year old guy from the netherlands and i got fired at every job that i had and i had a lot   back when i started working at around 14 i got into hospitality with a mixture of all facets that it offers ive worked as a waiter a barman and a cook i had jobs for 1 day i had jobs for 2 years but every time there came a moment where i called in sick for the 34th time and knew i would get fired because of it i always weighed down the consequences and always came to the conclusion that it wasnt a problem sure sometimes i had no money but i could always find a new job with ease  during my student time i did 9 different studies but none felt right until i started working as a call center agent this was the moment that i realized that i didnt want to do a shitty fucked up job for the rest of my life i registered for my last studies which coincidentally was also my first and finished without any hickups being older then my classmates and knowing how shit life is when working a underpaid and undervalued job was made me excel in what i did   in my second year i started my own company for web and graphic design my first project was a massive bluff for a way to low price but it felt so good to finally be able to work for no one but myself never did i sit behind my desk and slacked away what was the point it was my own time so slacking meant i would just go and chill at the end of my second year of my last studies my right to loaning money from the government was ending shit i still had to do 2 more years i dont know how but the month that my loan ended i got a big project that gave me a very good amount of money it was 4k but back i was living off 1000 euros a month i had moments where my money was gone and i had to wait for payment from projects that i did i had moments where i didnt have projects and thought fuck how am i gonna survive mind you in those days i smoked 1 gram of weed daily how i got that money still baffles me   in september 2018 i graduated and thought to myself now is the moment that i can focus fulltime on my own company 2019 was a decent year i didnt make a lot but i had enough still i made a vow with one of my old classmates that if 2020 wouldnt give us a steady income we would find a job 2020 started really well i got a massive potential project for the dutch police the day my contact had his meeting with the chief of police and all the heads of each province corona hit full lockdown no one was spending any money i stressed out as hell i started looking for jobs that paid me weekly found a job as a cook at a small bistro i went for the interview and they asked me what i wanted to earn i gave them a unrealistic amount because i thought fuck it they can only go lower it was 18 an hour which is a shit ton for cooks in the netherlands they offered me 16 euros and i laughed my ass off because that amount is insane compared to the wages i made a couple years back   when the day came for my first shift i just didnt show i couldnt get myself to go and work as a cook anymore my mind just couldnt fathom the fact that i was back at this kind of shitty work i called the bistro a couple hours after i didnt show and just pretended that i didnt know i had to work that day they kinda believed my bluff and gave me another chance the week afterwards when that day came i was halfway there on my bike and said fuck it this is not who i am anymore and i turned around the week after that i found a job as a webdeveloper at a small company this was more acceptable because it was one for my level  i started that job at 900 in the morning as a decent guy i showed up at 845 but my boss only showed up at 915 okay no problem when the clock hit 1700 i started packing my shit my boss looked at me and said what are you doing me well its 1700 my 8 hours are done him but what about the 30 minute break you had me eh really youre gonna do that instantly i became annoyed and thought to myself that this shit wouldnt happen in a decent job   time went by and i made a deal with my employer that i could work from home on thursday this was during the peak covid times when everyone was told to work at home anyways it was really hard for me to get this deal as my employer wanted me to come in to work because he wanted to be able to spar with me about my work obviously this almost never happened during this period i would sometimes work on a late night because i had an epiphany and just wanted to create something this was all overtime that i wouldnt get paid for i did it because it felt right and i wanted to use my insights before i forgot about it eventually there was a moment where my boss went home early and i had to work for 30 more minutes i went home 5 minutes before the assigned end time and my boss found out because he forgot his keys and had to drive back he was fucking furious his punishment was me losing my day of working at home queue my hidden rage    all these tiny things pissed me off so much that i came to the same conclusion that i had at all my previous jobs this shit isnt worth it money isnt that important this eventually led to the fact that my contract wasnt renewed i had a contract for 1 year this was 1 month ago the day my contract ended i rented a workspace at a shared workspace place in the month that i rented that thing i got 4 leads and 2 projects today i got a big project confirmation for about 10k ive never been happier in the past 2 years as i am now working for myself is so much more gratifying then working for a boss  my whole point with this story is for the people that i see posting similar shit that happened to me my only tip i want to give you is if it seems like you get undervalued underpaid underperformed at your current job dont think about the money and problems that might occur when you dont have a job think about how much happiness you can achieve if you start working on yourself   i know this isnt possible for everyone but if you are in a position where you cant go on your own change your life by thinking about what makes you happy and start focusing on achieving that happiness yolo is a bad meme but its the truth if you get hit by a bus tomorrow youd be wanting to know that you enjoyed life to the fullest   tldr focus on what makes you happy and start applying every aspect of you life to achieving that happiness money isnt important with the right mindset you can achieve anything you want,ptiwae

1417,Promotion AND a pay cut - The Follow Up.,hello again everyone this is a little bit of a delayed follow up to my original post below but i do have an update for you and lets be frank  nobody will be surprised with the outcome   httpswwwredditcomrantiworkcommentspakxqipromotionandapaycutillseemyselfoututmsourceshareamputmmediumiosappamputmnameiossmf  where i left off was i had planned to give my current employment family the news i had been offered a new role and to also give them an opportunity to try and counter it i live in a  small country and its always sensible to leave on a good note as you never know who you might meet in the future   they were completely shocked that i would wanted to leave but also not surprised considering my reaction to my payless promotion so that to me signalled they knew they were taking the piss and had expected fall out from it   they glossed over that and decided that it was a career progression issue rather than a monetary or even recognition issue and decided to put me in front of other teams to try and lure me into another role to retain my skills and exp i was happy to entertain this as id been with the company for a while and had that guilt urge of leaving as we all do im convinced theres a level of manipulation at play with the whole family thing in a time where people are chronically lonely but thats a chat for another time  they essentially tried to sway me to stay with an offer of a temporary contract in another team which they sold as a lucrative step in a futurethinking role that was specifically created for me and would look great on my cv interestingly enough this wasnt as exclusive an offer as it was sold in light of my circumstances but as it turns out was a multiapplicant internal role that was going begging anyway that other colleagues at a similar level were picking up anyway as part of their job and id have been doing at some stage  you can imagine the annoyance that this would generate  a payless promotion followed by a complete humdrum secondment which wasnt even a proper role just additional tasks that i would have likely been picking up had none of this transpired it was literally one kick in the pants after the next the pay discussion was short and sweet they wanted to give me a raise that wouldnt even catch me up with inflation because over the past two years due to overall company performance ive not received increases or bonuses despite consistent overachieving at a personal level in terms of business metrics  the long shafting game as it were so working hard for the carrot only to be handed a stick  ultimately i said thanks but no and the day after my resignation a cc all email was sent to the entire regional business unit highlighting how i was leaving to work in a totally different sector which as some of you crafty folk will know is a clever deflection tactic of he left because he wanted something we couldnt offer and wasnt for changing his mind despite everything we offered as opposed to the truth of hes left because we are shit at managing people took advantage of a difficult time to extract more labour and our offer was a turgid dump on the shag pile carpet that only a fool would ask you to pass the ladle for   anyway i start the new job soon and ive already been reached out to by the new boss who is mad keen to get me on board and sent me a map of where i can get free parking  to quote the illustrious blink182 its the little things that let me know you care and thats all it really ever boiled down to youre a bum on a seat youre a number youre only as good as your last win or arse up and even people that you thought you were close with will instantly revert and close rank to company file when their own workload is about to be impacted   in the current climate dont be afraid to push back or ask for things that will make your mental health and your day to day better and more importantly knowing your worth even if that means taking the leap to somewhere else   thanks for reading,pty7li
1418,Help for my Aunt,hi all  i have an aunt who works for a small doctors office and she has told me about whats been going on at her job for the past few years  please excuse my format but i am going to just make a list of the crap she and the other 3 workers have been putting up with   1 they are told to hold their checks and only cash them after a certain time otherwise they will bounce there are times where they ask 1 or 2 employees to hold the check until the following week or it will bounce   2 the company has been deducting health insurance premium for the past 6 months but my aunt has confirmed with her insurance that it has not been payed and she is not covered this is blatant theft on the company part  3 the company is manually deducting tax withholding from my aunts check but is not paying them out somehow because now my aunt owes taxes to irs from her paychecks the company did not tell my aunt anything about here having to pay taxes herself   there is some other stuff but i think this alone should give an idea who does she contact to report her employer and no there is not an hr at this small company unfortunately,ptiyr7
1419,Employer Has Us Parking Offsite - Hired Security to Carpool Us to and from Lot,i work at a large grocer in dallas tx that was recently renovated and had its grand reopening last june in order to maximize parking for customers the company has hired private security and rented a van and a portion of a parking lot from a church about a mile and half away from the store for the employees to park their cars before the store renovation we were allowed to park in the farthest part of the onpremises lot now there are always at least two security folks on staff at anytime of day 24 hrs a day either watching the lot or carting our employees to and from the lot in the van which seats 7 incl driver    there are about 350 employees on shift throughout the week and no one is allowed to park on premises including overnight shifts when the store is closed writeups threatened    ever since this began i and a large majority of the employees have all been late by several minutes to their shift starttime on many occasions this is due to many variables i will list the common occurrences why employees have difficulty getting to work on time      1 the van is full and we have to wait for it to go and come back sometimes twice   2 the van is pulling away as we pull into the lot and miss it the drivers of the van will never stop and wait for you   3 traffic to and from the lot also two major intersections to go through before getting to the store    4 security employees drive like grandmas since they are being closely monitored by our company and their own they are overly cautious   5 security shift change happens at 6a when the majority of store shifts start they are sometimes late so there is no one in the lot when we arrive   6van driver wont return to lot immediately because they stopped into the store to use restroom or get a snack and drink   7 security employees stopping and chatting with one another as they passtaking calls while driving so they have to pull over and stop this has seemed to have stopped not completely due to complaints from our employees     we are not allowed to be clockedin until we arrive in the store and if we are late there could be disciplinary action at the discretion of your department manager my manager understands and is lenient and does not writeup any of my dept coworkers for being a couple minutes late however i know of many other employees from other depts being writtenup for being late by one or more minutes  a good portion of us have expressed our grievances to store leadership that company time is being wasted along with our own personal time none of us want to be late we want to start our shift on time and get all of the time on the clock as possible      the employees would like the company to recognize that our personal time ends and company time begins the moment we start waiting in that offsite parking lot    leadership of course was aghast at this idea and suggested that we waste more of our personal time by arriving much earlier to the parking lot personally one instance i have arrived in the lot at 545a for a 6a shift start and i still didnt clockin until 619a thats 15 minutes of my time that i added onto an already 30min commute and 19 minutes of company time that i was not on the clock prepping the store for a 7a open      i have notified corporate hr about this and they are now investigating investigating what i have no idea their response was vague which is typical of hr      we really feel taken advantage of time theft is bullshit because the moment any of us steal company time fired but our time no just waste more of it to make sure youre not wasting company time     the contempt is insulting and dehumanizing      tldr boss make us park far away all late many time all want pay for wait on van boss no care,ptxiy2

1434,Solidarity,fret deane as the     in the potential eve of the first nationwide strike in iatses 128 year history id like to share the story of the shades of blue wildcat strike and what it taught me about labor power and worker solidarity  sometime around 2016  was working on season 2 of the jennifer open corrupt cop show shades of blue under the key carpenter are criscolo of you ask me how the show was  dont know  didnt watch it it just paid the rent  now are is an old friend and we personally get along but he was a harness of a boss lacking or mistakes get operation his way or the highway his is just to establish are was not a lazy man nor did he allow his crew to be lazy he got it right and we got it on time  our relationship with the production team was a good one smooth communication and good conditions with problems addressed fairly quickly his is to establish there was no tension in the air before the strike but a contract is a contract  and part of our contract is that we get paid in or before pm of the following thursday his was back in the day of physical checks being the norm so someone is supposed to come down from production office and hand them out  and today its thursday at 4pm in a stretch of busy 12 hour days so we still have work til 6 here all working at our benches building scenery cutting building standing when the production assistant comes down from the office with a cheery disposition that doesnt match what hes about to say  key guns here sorry there has been an error in accounting and we cant print the checks this week hell have them for you on monday  are looked him in the eye and said thats fine well resume work on monday and then he took his hammer out of its bolster and laid it on his workbench ceremonial and gesture for all of us to do the same all dozen of us followed  now a of is just another grunt themselves and our cheery of was now suddenly aware that something had was happening and he was in fig trouble he ran and got a producer who came down and tried to soothe us  am sorry about the mixed but we do have lot of work here shooting tuesday  promise were fixing the problem  are didnt budge and when you fix the problem well resume work  and then they stared at each other for a little while and in ares eyes was he dont do this for fun  got bills to pay and production blinked  to for all of thursday evening we just sat at our benches and talked and friday morning and friday afternoon and wouldnt you know it they found a way for the printer to work again on friday night and then we picked up our hammer and worked overcome on saturday and we shot on tuesday as planned he got it right and we got it on time  and that strike a wildcat strike as work stoppage without union coordination are called taught me a crucial lesson about striking and labor power you dont only have to strike when conditions are unbearable you can threaten strike to prevent unbearable conditions and to remind your bosses that you do their work of they keep up their end of the deal and keep the deal good   watched the hardest working carpenter  knew lay down his hammer on a time because nbc broke the cardinal rule of the relationship he work you may and he did it because he knew his crew would be behind him and we were behind him because we knew the union would be behind us  and thats the power of a union the bosses will try to fuck you over its their favorite thing to do they do it on purpose they do it by accident of youre not in a union all you can do is say thank you sir may  have another of you are in solidarity with your fellow workers you have another response on the table you know what luck you too  in rejecting our negotiations to curb the normalized use of long 14 16 hour days and to bring the pay and benefits of working for streaming services in line with the rest of the industry they now dominate the producers and studies have voted to say luck you to all the film crew members that make their fancy little alas possible in october st when you get that strike authorization ballot  urge you to vote luck you too  solidarity to all strikes and all workers ,ptpyoh
1435,Currently witnessing the process of a power-tripping boss cutting off his nose to spite his face.,my son a college senior is dealing with a powertripping assistant manager at his parttime job right now when this manager first arrived at the store he basically told everyone in the department that despite the fact that the store is located in the heart of a major college campus and almost all of the parttime employees are students who require flexible schedules the shift schedules he drew up were set in stone and that he would not tolerate anyone calling out to attempting to switch shifts regardless of the reason and because it was hard to find fulltime employees with unlimited availability he would threaten to cut the hours of anyone who didnt keep their pt availability as open as possible he would then schedule all these students for long shifts on school nights and every weekend making studying and participating in anything collegerelated practically impossible needless to say since hes been there employee turnover has skyrocketed  anyway my kid requested a few saturdays off work when he was finally able to score a student ticket package for his schools home football games and he wanted to take advantage of it in his final year of eligibility the boss denied all of his requested dates off and informed him that hed be written up if he called out or switched shifts with anyone on any of those requested days it was was if he was punishing his employee for having the gall to ask for time off even though it was unpaid as a parttimer my son accrues no vacation time  so my son who is only 2 years younger than this manager but has actually worked for the company four years longer changed his work availability to being unavailable on saturdays forcing his boss to take him off the saturday schedule completely for the entire football season the manager was so furious that my son figured out a way around his time off denial that he retaliated by cutting his hours to only one shift a week  the company as a whole prides itself on working with students schedules and the location my son originally worked at was very good about making sure the students they hired maintained a good worklifeschool balance everything worked out well for him while he was in high school and community college and when he initially transferred to this location upon his entry into university he has more experience than anyone else in his department and has had nothing but glowing reviews until this new manager came along he was recently reprimanded for wearing inappropriate footwear which happen to be the same shoes hes worn the entire time hes been at the store and no ones ever complained about and the manager treats him with disdain in every encounter they have always looking for an opportunity to publicly criticize or humiliate him  what his boss doesnt seem to understand is that he cant afford to lose employees like my son who probably knows more about their department than he does and is relied upon heavily to help train all the new hires so what if the kid wants a few saturdays off to enjoy the only football games hell be able to attend in his senior year so what if he needs his thursday evenings to work on his research project hes been a loyal employee he has experience in the department that no one else has why shouldnt he be able to take time off that hes obviously entitled to  the reason this guy seems so hellbent on punishing my son is because my son used the only official power he had at that company which was to dictate the hours and days he was available to work he didnt request for every weekend off just 6 saturdays during football season but all of them were shot down so he did the only other thing he could have done and this guy didnt like it  needless to say my son is now looking for another job with the intention of quitting as soon as football season ends all because one mywayorthehighway 23 year old is too spiteful and powerhungry to realize he needs my kid more than my kid needs him,ptyve8

1470,The Hypocrisy of Work-Life Balance speeches,sometimes i wonder if these people up there especially the csuite or actual company owners are actually aware that their worklife balance speeches actually mean jack  there are people who do this for a living probably hr hiring some other professional to discuss this but its usually infeasible for anyone at the bottomline to maintain if only because the vast majority of groundwork is upon them and managers only really need to decide good ones actually actively monitor workload and reallocate it accordingly not just to the best ones but those who can be reliably tasked to learn from it bad ones just generally throw it to whoevers available  csuite is even less involved only really monitoring the rise and fluctuation of numbers and brainstorming possible solutions based on a survey of things people believe are causing issues not aware that it could be biased in its entirety as well if the work culture doesnt encourage free thought  the end result is a disconnect a bunch of leaders with a lot of free time in their hands because they know that other people will manage situations for them and the bottom line not even able to take it because they know when theyre gonna get back from a leave someone else will be swamped with doing their fair share of groundwork  this in turn leads us back to their useless speeches encouraging us to balance work sure we can do that but since in the modern day were so obsessed with squeezing 120 of the work effort at every turn they start to complain when were actually doing far below expected capacity  which leads to certain techniques of dubious quality to be used or to be continually harassed to improve the results better  instead of hosting these speeches why dont these guys use the budget to continually improve employee salary  im not exactly against work if its good and meaningful but nowadays finding a job you can really pledge yourself in is like searching for a mythical unicorn in a realworld forest  theyll just tell us to balance work and family but the moment we start focusing on family theyll complain about the low turnout on sales low numbers of tickets resolved low everything and then inevitably tell us to focus on one thing  work or yourself  fk you man im going to focus on myself i didnt live to end up working like a cog im working to live,pts2l3

1549,How would it work?,i am happy i found this sub as it has shown me not only that there are other people who share some of my views but also that there is a lot more depth to those views that i had developed myself and that there are so many crappy employers out there than i would have thought  reading every post here though i try to think about the general overview of the sentiment of antiwork  people and how the world would work if these views took hold  i know there are extremes of the type dont work just draw and eat fruit or maybe they are not extremes but i am not sure they are well thought through  while it would be nice if i didnt have to work ever again how would i eat how would i have shelter how would i have sanitation healthcare and so on i could go to the village doctor i guess but would she be working without compensation and if not what would i give her some of my fruit why doesnt she have her own fruit and needs mine and if she does have her own fruit why is she working seeing sick people  i think my main question is how does it all work if we dont work any more,pt3l5l

1556,I'm going to start my own podcast called the wageslave rant,this will be about all the time i waste at work and on the internet i will rant about different things but mostly about myself ill do all the ranting because no one else on here wants to listen  just some advice to my fellow wagies who need to serve mr coinblatt in order to even fucking survive     step one start making a list of all the places i waste time every day everyday i can i find something to fuck up    for example    1 when i get out of bed i go on facebook and play video games with my friends    2 when i go to the bathroom i go on facebook and check my friends statuses   3 when i go to school i go to facebook and check my friends statuses    4 when i am eating lunch i go on facebook to mess with my friend    5 when i get home from school i go on facebook and look at my friends status    6 when i get on the bus to work i check my friends facebook    7 when i am on the train i check my friends facebook    8 when i get to work i waste time playing video games and doing shit    9 when i get off work i go home and waste more time on my friends facebook    10 when i go home i waste more time playing video games  so you can see that there is a lot that i waste time doing now you can tell me that this list is very stupid      step 2 i have a meeting in an hour its going to be a long one get up and start filling my time with something thats gonna help me when im having the meeting maybe something like this      1 clean my desk    2 go to the kitchen to get something to drink    3 get a glass of water and brush my teeth    4 make sure all my shit is organized    5 check my email for any important emails    6 make sure i have the most current version of everything    7 check my facebook for status updates    8 check twitter and reddit to see if anybody is talking about something that relates to me    9 make sure my laptop is fully charged    10 go to the bathroom and check to make sure my laptop case has a good strap to wear on my back so i dont have to hold it in my hands while i walk       this list helps me focus on the important things and it helps me to prepare for the meeting you can make one of these lists for any kind of meeting you have to have and it will help you to be more productive and focused on whats most important       step 3 i always keep a notepad in my office when im working i try to write everything down on a notepad when i have a meeting i get my notepad out and i start writing down things so i dont have to be sitting at my computer looking at things on my computer i have a notepad right in front of me whenever i have to write something down i take my notepad out and start writing down what i need to write down that way i can write faster and im not having to look at my computer screen all the time if im meeting somebody i might have a different type of notepad thats different from my day to day notepad thats really small but i still have my writing pad maybe it has my list of phone numbers maybe it has some notes i have to make it could have everything from my daily notepad when im having a meeting this notepad is the notepad that i need to take notes on it helps me to stay organized it helps me to stay focused its a great little tool       step 4 make a to do list a to do list helps you to remember all of the things you need to do and it helps you to stay organized if you want to really organize your schedule write it down for example if youre going to be browsing reddit for an hour write it down if you want to call your mom write it down if youre having a meeting write it down all these things you can put on your to do list sometimes i use a yellow pad for my to do list and i write all the things that i need to do on there it helps me to stay organized whenever i have a to do list i always have it near me it helps me to be more organized it helps me to be more focused on my goals and my purpose       step 5 buy a planner a planner is something that helps you to stay organized it helps you to stay focused it helps you to be organized if you want to really organize your schedule buy yourself a planner sometimes you just buy yourself a small planner and add pages as you need a planner could have everything on it a planner could have a list of important things a planner could have a list of events that you need to have on a certain day if you want to really organize your schedule buy yourself a planner it helps you to stay organized it helps you to stay focused it helps you to be organized its a great little tool       step 6 find your purpose the sixth step to help you stay organized is to find your purpose why are you doing what youre doing what do you want to get out of it how do you want to feel when youre finished do you want to feel better do you want to feel more fulfilled do you want to feel more alive find out why youre doing what youre doing whats your purpose when you know your purpose youll be able to set goals to get you there find out why youre doing what youre doing find your purpose write down everything you want this will help you get what you want when you know what you want to get out of it youll be able to set goals       step 7 set goals the seventh step to help you stay organized is to set goals this will help you to stay organized it will help you to stay focused it will help you to be more organized what are your goals what are your personal goals what are your work goals what are your education goals this will help you stay focused this will help you stay organized this will help you to set and achieve your goals write them down keep them in front of you take a picture of them and put them on your refrigerator the sooner you set a goal the more likely you are to accomplish it write it down tackle it headon you can take it one step at a time you dont have to think about everything at once write down your goals think about your personal life your professional life      all because we need to take this slavery seriously to get crumbs from mr coinblatt   capitalism has failed,ptb2zt
1557,Work rant/society rant.,ya know while i sit here in the office of where i work counting down the minutes of my life going by that i will and you will never get back  my youth is ticking away so that i can justify my existence on this planet to be productive and contribute to this fucked society  well one day this sham will and must be put to an end and yes i am aware that i am infact lazy and im not afraid to admit it i do less than the minimum at this point because of poor salary and shitty conditions   at my job which i will leave vague if you want time off you need to find your own coverage from other stores nearby which always have an excuse or can never help out then when they need help the district manager gets involved and we will end up covering them i sit here stuck working the next 8 days consecutively open to close alone and not a single person can help out   fun right   i have a theory that one day ai will be the solution to this human suffering which we call work the machines will make everything so far ahead of us in productivity and cost that i argue the cost of living will plummet to almost 0 at this point ai will have mostly replaced all meaningless jobs that humans currently do and i for one cannot wait for that day where we can wake up and instead of the rat race we all are in we can decide to go anywhere we want and do anything we want without the constant worry and need for money or employment   end rant,pt9p3c

1566,Two mentalities,i think there are two mentalities in general when it comes to making money  1 when i help my boss they give me money i earn the money  2 when my boss exploits me they owe me money they pay for stealing my time     i think there is a strong shift at the moment from 1 to 2 and the reason for that seems rather simple  let me tell you my story  when i was younger i worked in a small store after school when there were no customers i felt bad and did something productive like cleaning etc i felt bad for being at work without doing anything    later i worked in a school as a caretaker and i did my best to help the school as much as i could when there wasnt really anything to do i grabbed a broom and sweeped the schoolyard   now i work in an office when i started here many years ago i wanted to see my mouse pad burn and my keyboard melt by the sheer speed of my hands i felt the urge to help my colleagues and my boss as much as possible  but that has changed over the years   i dont feel bad anymore for sitting in front of my work pc and working rather slow     i was thinking about what has changed and why   it is quite easy to tell honestly it has nothing to do with the amount of money i earn it is the way my boss values and appreciates me as a person and my work  during my time at the store i felt like an important part of it my boss and his wife often praised me for how accurate i did everything the wife sometimes even brought me something nice to eat during the later hours like a steak   the same is true for my work during the time at the school i felt appreciated it felt like my boss my colleagues and i were working together to give the children at school a good time it even wasnt rare that my boss said something like hey today you are driving to xyz right here take this money and on your way back make a stop at the storebakery to buy something nice to eat for you and the collegues  coming from such a background i felt the same in the office for a rather long time except there wasnt appreciation from my boss at all i always thought that he is stessed and has no time because of his work but turned out it simply isnt true he never appreciates anything no one of us workers instead we only get to hear what we have done wrong and how dumb we are so over the years the motivation to help him with his work became smaller and smaller oh and sure our boss is perfect he cant make mistakes when we did something exactly like he said and it is wrong the only reason for that is that we werent listening or understanding   so instead of feeling appreciated i feel exploited    during my first two jobs we worked together to make people happy our goal was the same  but now the goal has changed happiness isnt valued here at all money is  i dont feel like i need to earn my money anymore i feel like my boss owes me money for stealing my time and exploiting me   i am not happy my boss is not happy none of my colleagues are everybody has only one thing in mind money since happiness doesnt exist anymore    it was fun to see people smile it was good to feel appreciated we were a good team  now everything feels kind of bitter as if we work against each other    is it really that hard to understand make your workers feel appreciated and important not with money only but with gestures too and for gods sake greet them back when they greet you  otherwise your workers will exploit you just as much as you exploit them  even if your goal is money only it will pay to be nice to your workers its a winwin situation  please dear bosses it is in your hands to spread happiness and prevent bitterness to happen it will make people feel like they earn money for helping you and not like you owe them money for exploiting them,pt33nx

1582,Company low balled salary offer + asked for pay stubs,i wasnt sure where else to post this but just needed some validation lol ive been interviewing for a position for 5 weeks did two activities to demonstrate my job knowledgeskill set  salary range was discussed before first interview as 100120k  solid for my position and experience level last week after the final interview i confirmed the pay range again with hr and they said the same range and agreed my requested salary was acceptable cool this would have been a nice pay increase and i was stoked especially as it was a remote position i got the call for the offer yesterday and guess what the salary now is that they want to offer it to me 85k i honestly couldnt form words they then said the the discrepancy was because they didnt take into account where i lived when they offered that range side note i dont live in a lcol area i would say its similar to boise id in costs i was so mad and said the lowest i could go was 100k this request was followed up by an email from hr explaining the low ball again and said they could give me 95k if i would send them my two most recent pay stubs to ensure that my new salary bump was within 1012 of my current salary i only make 75k and my current salary was never discussed when the salary range came up nor my location i essentially told the hr lady that was so inappropriate and still not meeting the minimum previously discussed she double downed and said it was bc of my location that the range totally changed and could be resolved by me providing my paystubs i told her this was insulting and i was not interested in any future offers from her team   am i crazy or is this situation bonkers has anyone else run into this issue and how did you handle it i was so excited about this opportunity but this seemed like a last minute grab for cheaper labor  edit i did not accept any of this nonsense and declined twice to give my pay stubs and told them to find someone else fuck them,ptg1bm

1622,Why is it worth living if we're forced to work?,after joining the workforce straight  out college ive been the most depressed and hopeless in my entire life i got a good paying stable job in my field of study doing something im passionate about with alright coworkers and a decent work culture i did everything right i was earning a decent amount of money i made my friends and family proud and was a respectable member of society with their own income and prospects ahead  but why did i feel so empty and hollow at the end of the day after the first week the feeling of enthusiasm in a new experience and advancement in my life quickly faded and i was left with the reality that i was trapped stuck in this eternal limbo of constant repetition for weeks months years on end because thats what awaits me sure there was variation from day to day on the job and chances for advancement but i struggled with this overhanging feeling of dread and i quickly became depressed in the fact that this is my fully realized life i began to resent my career and view work as the oppressive anticlimactic mundane repetitive meaningless drain on my life it was turning into   in my head i was constantly focusing on the mental math on how to best partition my days so that i can enjoy myself outside of work thinking things like i have 24hrs each day i spend 8 at work and on a good day 8 asleep thats 16hrs that leaves 8 hrs for myself but i spend an hour on commute time and about 30min checking work emails and texts so in reality i only have 6 hours to myself on a given work day and even less considering i still have 1hr workouts 30 min showers and cookclean for on average 2hrs for my family back at home so minus the home and body maintenance i only have about 2hrs for myself consequently  i began to drop allot of my passions and hobbies because they just werent fun knowing that i had to time crunch them with the feeling of annoyance at having to mind the clock and monitor myself and i couldnt get more time by cutting other areas of my life because i dont want to let myself go by not going to the gym and not showering or by  just leaving chores pile up at home i couldnt see my partner and friends through the work week because not only were they working also and rarely our schedules aligned i was also too tired to want to go out and when i did i was thinking about how id have to drag myself out of bed the next morning it felt so bleak knowing that even though weekends were the only opportunities to hang out with ppl i could only at most hang out 2 times which was a stark shift from college and school sure i could be friends with coworkers but although they were nice i dont think they or i were looking for new friends and even if we were we were focusing on working those 8 hrs not  becoming friends   i quit at the first reasonable excuse i could find that wouldnt hurt my relationship with my employers which just happened to be getting assaulted and threatened with violence by a coworker ever since then ive been contemplating whether that lifestyle is worth the mental degradation i experience while living in i understand that i come from a very privileged position not having the strong motivator of paying expensive bills but i dont want to ever return to that i didnt feel fulfillment in the money i was making or the things experiences i bought with them and i dont think i ever will   i hate this work lifestyle i hate the system that normalized the deterioration friendships and passions ppl have outside their jobs and i hate those ppl who say to me its not that bad just because they enjoy themselves devoting their lives to the work gods   sorry for the rant,ptbxm8

only feasible because im in covid19 lockdown and working from home i have no idea how others are doing this im childfree and have no idea how people with kids run 2x3x time as many errands and still manage to work for a living i have no idea how people with chronic illnesses which require regular doctor visits and tests find time to work and get medical care   here are examples of stuff ive been doing in the past 2 months    stores are closed because of covid19 gotta buy something essential at a hardware store you have to use click and collect when can you collect thats right 9am5pm     did you select delivery instead of store pickup the parcel may arrive at the post office and you gotta pick it up and yes they close at 5pm when i finish working sometimes i hook my laptop to 4g and walk to the post office with the laptop open so that ill still be online on chat for work this is super inconvenient   dentist appointment  booking on the phone going there for the treatment   booking a dentist appointment for complex work requires a sedationist in my case so i gotta call the sedationist too   the sedationist wants a form from the dentist before theyd take me as a patient so i gotta call the dentists office again but the dentist is not in today to write the form so his receptionist tells me that shed give me a callback tomorrow and she doesnt so i need to chase it up and call both the sedationist and dentist and arrange for the appointment   the dentist writes a prescription to fill the pharmacy is open late  after work but theres an error in the prescription so they wont give me the med i gotta call the dentist office again during work hours and then i have to take the revised prescription to the pharmacy again   the real estate agency needs me to sign a form to get access to their portal and pay my rent i cant go to officeworks to use their printer and scanner they close at 5pm i go to the real estate agency i sign the form and they say id get an email from them with a login to the portal to pay my rent   the email never comes i call the real estate agency they put me on hold 15 mins later they say they cant find my form and i have to come in again   i had my name legally changed so i have to provide name change and proof of identity documents to half a dozen companies and a dozen government agencies despite uploading my docs as instructed paypal wont change my name within 35 business days as promised and their chatbots are useless  i have to call their customer service and navigate through many menu options to sort it out   my internet provider wont update my name either till i bring the documents to their store open 95 ofc btw utility bills here are considered a proof of identity docs and required  for many things ie a home loan thats why its important the internet bill needs to have the correct name   i moved house so theres packing removalists cleaners unpacking new furniture assembly everything is sold in ikea state preassembled removalists were 25 hours late and by the time they arrive there was rain so we had to reschedule   routine blood tests gotta go to the clinic early to get my blood drawn they open at 8am i assumed id lose 1h of sleep come in early and get this errand done before work and get back home by 9am so did everyone else in the long long queue outside we all look tired i dont make it inside by 945am and end up late for work   remember when i bought some stuff online the shower head arrived but it doesnt fit my tap so i have to go to the hardware store and return it within x days   theres some indiscrepancies in my power bill so i had to call my energy provider   buying groceries fresh fruits and veggies require a couple of visits to the grocery store a week   laundry  washing hanging outside in the sun saves power money reduces environmental impact of dryers takes more time though   cleaning the house changing sheets once a week vaccuming the carpet    cooking cheap lunches with reasonable nutritional value washing the dishes after taking out the rubbish   walking 10000 steps a day and exercising 150 mins a week the recommend minimum as per doctors to maintain a healthy lifestyle especially as a sedentary office worker    callingemailing overseas relatives regularly i feel bad for not not being diligent enough about tis one    keeping in touch with friends   doing my taxes  still procrastinating on that one its due next month    ive been doing at least half that shit while im supposed to be working im obviously tired disgruntled and hopeless i end up snapping at various service givers and call centres for being unable to do the paperwork i need them to at a timely fashion its not their fault i guess i am less friendly and fun to hang out with i get upset with friends and family for no good reason other than the general frustration of life  sometimes i manage to work with my laptop on the bus on my way to various stores clinics or offices but its quite an operation to arrange cant be attending any zoom calls during  i dont know how people develop hobbies you do all of the above plus a fulltime job and you have zero energy left to knit paint woodwork or

1728,A new perspective on the worst job ever,i was the most productive employee in the building for 25 years at the call center for the dmv know this because they had boards all around the call center showing who was the most productive all day  i didnt do any of this because i care about being up that high  the call center was based on piece rate so it was more lucrative for me to learn the system then excel in this system  i was written up for wearing a sweatshirt and also avoiding phone calls when i was the top employee  i basically talked to 0 people  i wouldnt even look at people in the hall or in the lunch room  my job was to get in work and leave asap  the turnover was so ridiculous getting to know people seemed like a waste because the chances you would be there after 3 months were about 3  they used to have us train people  these new employees would be in your cubicle for about 2 hours a day  they wanted you to take your time and teach them everything slow down show them the ropes etc  sounds like its not bad except slowing down meant youd be getting paid less  they should have compensated you for training but nope  you wound up getting paid less  i came up with the idea to tell them i didnt feel comfortable having training knowing with hr and everything they couldnt even ask what made be feel uncomfortable so that eventually got me out of that  the building didnt allow any  cell phones well unless you were a manger or in it because they had good excuses i guess  if you were late even 5  minutes for the month your pay was docked for the next pay check and it was a considerable hit like 20  if you had to call off for any reason your next 2 checks were screwed  the beginning for the end for me was during the beginning of the pandemic  we never worked for home nor was that ever  a possibility  my coworker that worked next to contracted covid only the superiors didnt notify me for 2 days friday evening until my shift was almost over    i was called into the office to talk to the big wig were i was forced to take mandatory quarantine  i was offered to use my vacation time but i explained my vacation time was already locked up ya know for vacation  i was then told i wouldnt be paid for it  i asked the building manager if i should be applying for unemployment but was indirectly told they would fight me for it  at that point i figured i didnt have too much to lose even though im married and have two kids  i told her it was basically a slap in the face on multiple levels and that i was literally wasting my life there for the past 3 years after being so productive  besides the pay hit i hate the job so it was a blessing  thankfully i never contracted covid so it was an additional vacation  when it was time for vacation they asked me if i was leaving the state  i told them i was  they told me i was no approved for this vacation that was actually approved 5 months previous  i asked them well what is going to happen when i dont come in next week    the same manager that purposely neglected to tell me for 2 days that the  person sitting next to me had covid was like   what are you going to do call off every day  i answered with  i dont know maybe   why would you do that  well that would be my prerogative    at that point i just returned to my desk and to my cubicle  i walked out after grabbing what little things i would keep there  i wound up going on vacation calling off the days i needed to  after 10 days of quarantine i got a call from the supervisor that i was fired  i hung up on her  i then proceeded to get a better job that pays more from home and sniped 3 of the good employees from that job,psnbcg

1759,The Big Lie: the reason why your life is reasonably comfortable is the current societal structure,arent you comfortable delivery pizza delivery weed nearly ubiquitous internet free video games etc that all exists because of the current system thats because our politicians are doing a great job if you want to change the system that means you want to give up all your creature comforts you have to martyr yourself gt  wrong technology is what makes us comfy not government policy and not the capitalist system there is no reason why the internet or houses or gmos would magically disappear if we changed the structure of society to be more conducive to living rather than working but changing society through policy from the topdown is far less effective than creating technology that renders the existing system vestigial  if you want to make the world a better place your time is better spent inventing new technology than political activism or shitposting getting started in hobbyist electronics is cheap and getting started in software design is even cheaper if you have a little more money on hand you can even get into crispr biohacking its feasible to splice together say dandelions with potatoes to have nutritious weeds autonomously growing everywhere but monsanto wont even try because itd be impossible to profit from even worse nutritious weeds would remove one of the main reasons people work in the first place avoiding starvation  consider the huge number of people bitcoin has already lifted out of povertyhttpswwwcoindeskcomtech20210121tradingbitcoininafricaisawayforsometoescapepoverty myself included there is no policy prescription that could be that effective bitcoin was likely created by a small team of amateurs though because we dont actually know the identity of satoshi it may very well have been a single person they didnt ask for permission to change the world for the better neither should we  dont worry i practice what i preach im ordering 1000 worth of crispr nucleases and gear and attempting to splice together a more nutritious weed sure it may be a waste of bitcoin but im willing to take that risk for the good of humanity but more importantly it sounds like fun,psg4nx

1762,All kinds of screwed up. Please read for your sake.,ill try to be concise here  turned out kind of long wrote afterward i promise though this is super food for your little justice monster living inside you  and itll hopefully be a cautionary tale about getting out of such a toxic environment when you see the signs  worked at my last company industrialmanufacturingwarehouse environment for three years the good i displayed excellence and diligence consistently and got promoted three times in three years with pay increases each time my most recent role was shipping and receiving supervisor got a lot of experience under my belt  it was challenging and rewarding work they do have great longevity in their business model with sustainability at the core of their vision and a versatile product reaching a wide range of clients and markets the ceo is a great guy my manager was nice and very often went to bat for me   so far so good until this last year got progressively worse i was with them through 2 acquisitionsname changes lots of layoffs lots of restructuring positions being dissolved others being created no outlined job performance  i saw a good amount of people that were paid poorly trained poorly and treated poorly several individuals were fired for nothing more than the fact that the company either needed a fall guy for a company wide oversight andor they wanted to appear that they were following their safety protocols to the letter   one gentleman was even given the responsibility of shop supervisor for almost a year while they strung him along month after month talk after talk about how the company couldnt do it yet at 17hr way less than his subordinates madesome making north of 20hr and no official promotion   no standardized training for any job since the multiple acquisitions everything is just passed on by word of mouth they are working on that now creating sops swim lanes for each role learning management software for training etc but while i was there it made meeting expectations very difficult when there were no clearly delineated guidelines or procedures for doing your job very mix and match trial and error in their processes  they frequently made individuals do about 23 peoples worth of work and punished them for mistakes being made and were unemphatic when those team members were burnt out physically and otherwise very high turnover rate revolving door of temps all that being said i know they are working on some of this stuff but some of it shows no signs of improving in the near future i enjoyed my time there for the most part even though i saw these things happening to others and was empathetic but its a little different when it happens to you i had very little training and very little support from my manager nice as they were   i made the very bottom tier of pay for all my responsibilities 19hrresearched a little and found out 21 was average for my role but didnt complain because my wife and 2 kids had everything we needed and i was not the most experienced candidate for my role when i was hired  they took a chance on me because of how id proven myself in the past   my team shrunk over that year from 3 to 2 to just me when one guy got fired for texting while drivinga forklift and the other guy got poached by another department without any warning or plans to replace him  cant blame him though he had been there for 10 years and he was getting paid 17hrsame as current entry level guys and the other dept was in desperate need and offered him several more per hour  i was singled out for my mistakes even when an issue showed holes in every department with my manager taking every opportunity on teams meetings to emphasize our departments my portion of the failure some sales reps were pissed too because all they could see was the fact they had to face an angry customer and had no empathy for the situation actually going down in the shopeven though i had let them know  also it is very everyone for themselves with lots of finger pointingnot conducive to a team atmosphere at all and ultimately i was let go because of a gross misrepresentation in regard to safety and the companys desire to appear to have a safety culture even though i was possibly the most safety conscious person in the shop i was told i take safety too seriously    i was doing a job for 3 people trying to stay afloat naturally i was in the warehouse more doing more physical work than normal runnin and gunnin as they say i didnt injure my back per se  it was just tight tense and hurting a little took an ibuprofen told my fellow supervisor and kept working pain went away next morning its still a little tighttense i knew everything going on in my departmentbecause i was the whole damn departmentand i knew i could afford to call in based on the current workload called in told my manager the issue they asked if the back stuff happened at work i said if i had to guess i think it did but i want sure could have been how i slept just getting exasirbated by the massive work load next thing i know i get a conference call with my manager hr and safety saying im terminated for not reporting the incident on the previous day per their zero tolerance safety policy that i had agreed to the policy states that this zero tolerance is for deliberately avoiding reporting an accident incident or injury there was nothing deliberate about this didnt even cross my mind as something to report and i did tell my fellow supervisoralbeit i wasnt his direct reportbecause my manager worked out of a different facility and was never at my site tried to fight it with my manager hr and even the ceo no wiggle room with the first 2 and the ceo was on vacationcant fault him for that like i said he is a great guy and he deserves time off with his family like we all do  the biggest slap in the face was a week later scrolling through indeed looking for a new job and all and seeing the job posting for my exact job description different titlereal sly guys posted as of 3 weeks ago as in they were looking to replace me a whole 2 weeks before the incident not a conspiracy theorist but something doesnt add up there lol  cherry on top you ask the salary offered was up to 70k a year  that translates to roughly 36hr to do a job i was doing for 19 aaaaaggghhhh   hoping for a better opportunity around the corner   been almost three weeks now though150 applications so far hit me up in the comments if youre in houston and know if anything in a supervisory role for industrialmanufacturing,psc0xn

1767,My internship has apparently never had someone set boundaries.,im currently working an unpaid internship because i have to have two internships before i can complete me degree i previously worked an internship with a small stipend and had a fantastic experience there there i did just about everything i was asked to do and genuinely cared about the organization  at my current position im massively resentful of the lack of compensation but i push through by telling myself im learning from the experience today however my supervisor asked me to do a very repetitive office work task if i had to estimate there are about 200 hours of work available on this task which is more than my total time required for the internship ive been doing this task for about 14 of my time here already but apparently that wasnt enough i basically said this isnt beneficial for my education please dont plan to have this problem entirely resolved by intern labor  my supervisor didnt acknowledge this until i was already gone for the day at which point she wrote a lengthy email describing it as one of the most inappropriate and disrespectful things shes encountered in her professional life  i guess an unpaid intern having boundaries could come off as disrespectful if youve never encountered it before regardless we have a meeting with a mediator from my university this week im absolutely not going back to that environment where im not respected and i think if i play my cards right i can convince my university not to send another inter to that organization in the future  tldr  unpaid internships are bullshit theyre mega bullshit when youre just given busy work that isnt even educational,ps8j2w

1797,I filed an OSHA report on my company and I was surprised by the reaction of those I told.,my work does not care about the wellbeing of its employees ive been there for almost 2 years and i have witnessed blatant safety violations that have become expected of us to commit in order to achieve peak production goals  i work occasionally in my companys warehouse in order to pull supplies needed to construct products our customers requested these products are on shelves that are up to 20 feet high the problem is that we have 1 person certified to operate our forklift the coo of my company and basically a step up from my manager  who more often than not cannot make time to retrieve things on top of the shelves so its come expected for us especially my manager to climb these shelves with nothing other than a stairs that go up maybe 23rds the way so we basically have to hopefully have enough balance and stamina to pull ourselves onto these shelves without any sort of safety equipment and if we fell it would be at least 20 feet straight to a concrete floor   on top of that the temperatures over the summer have been especially brutal this year felt about 100 for most of the season and our warehouse does not have air only a few fans that really just blow all the hot air down to the ground its gotten so hot that two of my coworkers have thrown up due to over heating and over exertion   two weeks ago was the last straw for me my manager was made to climb onto the shelves and he injured his leg and had a limp for a few days this isnt the first time hes injured himself doing this but hes extremely loyal to a fault and when asked to jump he usually responds with how high  and even if he injured himself more severely the higher ups at the company have proven they dont care after another employee fell off a truck dock and hurt himself pretty badly the first thing my company asked him was if he was going to sue or not    but if my manager wasnt going to put his foot down about the unsafe conditions i decided to take it onto my own   so i filed the complaint havent heard anything yet and ive been keeping it kinda quiet especially around work since they are openly republican and because its a smaller company so if i made it known i filed a complaint the bosses know me personally so theres a high chance they would begin targeting me and the few people ive told all had the same question  arent you worried that this would make you unhirable if you look elsewhere  is that really where we are in the us its now completely taboo to worry about your safety of you and your fellow workers  is our culture that obsessed with the idea of being a boss that we allow ourselves to be so exploited that our safety is no longer a concern  it really baffles me that people would rather dehumanize themselves rather than admitting something is wrong   oh well i at least hope this at least will light a fire under my boss ass for them to reevaluate their business ethic and it did feel good to be naming my boss specifically in the complaint especially since he unreal standards routinely expects us to get 40 hours of work done in two business days so if anything fuck you boss man,psn0tq

1828,Gather around children and let me tell you a story about working.,i am 57 years old and i started working in 1976 when i was 12 years old mowing lawns shoveling snow babysitting and delivering newspapers it was ingrained in me at a very early age that you needed to work to succeed in life my siblings and i all looked up to our father as a role model and truly great man he worked the same job for 30 years   when my father turned 55 his employer a large semiconductor manufacturer forced him out with threats of losing his pension and retirement if he didnt take the buyout  he was heartbroken because he had spent his entire working life devoted to his employer towing the company line and working his fingers to the bone to provide for his family after he left the company he took a series of low paying jobs and thankfully he eventually found one that made him happy we were all ecstatic and until his death a few years ago his later years were filled with time for his family and his hobbies  ironically i completely ignored the cautionary tale that i had seen unfold right before my eyes and so i too devoted 25 years of my life to a familyowned company where i worked tirelessly up to 70 hours a week all in the name of success and advancement until one day shortly after covid began i was brought into an office and told that my position was being eliminated which of course was a lie the new assistant that id been training for months was replacing me i was handed a check and an nda to sign  i was 55 years old  in my panic i set about to replicate the exact fucking thing that had been my father and my downfall i wanted to get back on a career path as soon as possible i tried a couple of retail managerial jobs which during covid were a nightmare and eventually settled on job managing some warehouse employees for a fraction of what i had made previously my wife and i made it work and downsized to a smaller house and got rid of our leased cars my thoughts however continued to return to a career and advancement  it wasnt until two weeks ago when i ran into a former coworker who told me that hed quit his highpaying high stress job to return to cooking the line that i realized that i was done chasing a nonexistent safety net i am currently preparing an exit strategy from my current job so that my wife and i can keep health insurance but i can downsize my work life i know how much cash i need to make to pay bills and set some aside for retirement but i am planning on spending the rest of my working life in a lowstress job with no career advancement potential  the moral of this story is that your employer is not your family nor your friend nor your ally they have one reason for existing to make the owners wealthy you are a replaceable cog in the machine for 25 years i ignored this reality and when i finally came around it was so freeing   free yourself,psj3oq

1839,"Quit my job without having another one lined up, relieved and terrified",im 22 and have been working continuously since i finished high school  mums always drummed into us the importance of having a good job  i never went to university but i used to plan to go but take a gap year between uni and high school and mum used to tell me when you take your gap year you cant work in retail you need to get a full time office job  i was a straighta student in high school because i was good at writing essays which is what most of our assignments were and because of this a lot of people expected that i woulr be really successful in my career  ive since learned that working full time is an entirely different ballpark to being able to write good essays  last year i was diagnosed with autism  id been suspecting that i was autistic for a few years due to a lot of the struggles i was having in my previous job as a receptionist  2 years ago i left that parttime receptionist job which constantly made me want to die for a fulltime admin and typing job which at first was a breath of fresh air not having to be on reception all the time    and yet i still wasnt happy i was still struggling being around people in the office all the time even though i didnt have to constantly talk to customers anymore i was struggling with being constantly interrupted by my coworkers throughout the day because i like to do one job from start to finish and focus on that but when you work in admin youre constantly getting interrupted with more work  ive had to mask my autism for 40 hours a week for the past 2 years  ive become steadily more and more burnt out over the past 4 years and it has reached a breaking point where i can barely get out of bed im not exercising or making healthy foods for myself because i get home from work and im exhausted and the thought of trying to fit in cooking exercising walking my dog chores trying to learn skills that could get me a job i might actually enjoy and trying to put aside time to relax and recharge and do something that is fun for me all in the few hours before i had to go to bed is so overwhelming that i just do none of it instead  i called a suicide hotline 2 weeks ago because every time i go to work i wish i didnt exist  i thought i had no choice but to keep feeling this way but i found out recently that i actually am lucky enough to have the support of my family including my mum and i resigned last week  in 2 weeks i will be unemployed for the first time since leaving school and i plan to stay unemployed for 36 months to try and recover from my burnout  i am so relieved and terrified  ive grown up in a society where your worth is tied to how productive you are and if you are disabled or neurodivergent and struggle to spend 40 hours a week working or even cant work at all capitalism does not give a damn about you  and even though i am in a very privileged position because my mum is okay with me continuing to live at home without paying rent it is still terrifying to think of not having a job under capitalism and i cant tell you how badly i wish it didnt have to be this way and i wish that i didnt have to spend 4 years wanting to die before it was okay for me to not work,psa2qf

The world is cooking to death and we're likely to see horrors never before faced by humanity.",sorry if this doesnt belong here mods but i feel like this needs to be said i know other users have touched on it before   i must preface this post with a few facts i live in the uk i rent i live month to month with very little left over at the end of the month i support 3 people on my wage alone i have a career though its extremely underpaid  for identity purposes i wont say what my career is however my career is unfortunately one of those menial nothing jobs where nobody would really notice if it didnt exist im 32 and have been in my career path since graduating university nearly 10 years ago the first 5 years of it for the most part i loved it or at least tolerated it as being normal at around the 5year mark i woke up to things such as rcollapse rantiwork rlostgeneration it opened my mind as to how much the wool has been meticulously pulled over all our eyes collectively and now i cannot unsee what is really going on in the world  i do believe we are witnessing the end times and will highly likely see some horrific outcomes in our lifetimes   so for the last 5 years i have been in a trancelike state at work not really caring or believing in it anymore because i find it utterly pointless at the same time the system demands that i continue this path because i have no other options but to pay my bills and keep a roof over my familys head despite several failed attempts at small businesses in order to escape the rat race i find myself in   i guess the main point i want to get across is that i feel there are much bigger fish to fry in the world right now so much so that i even feel guilty for getting up and taking a shower using resources such as water gas and petroleum  in order to look presentable only to get to my place of work just to come back home rinse and repeat the whole damn week   now say that it was possible just to just exist without requiring a job for example if universal basic income became a given thing you could pay all of your basic bills by doing absolutely nothing if you so chose i honestly believe most people would then go and find altruistic purposes in their lives   in the current sorry state of the world i know that i would change my work role immediately to something more communityfocused my dad is retired but he builds residential automated hydroponic stations that use a water catcher solar panel and battery to regulate the watering of around ten large growing planters for any kind of vegetable or herb youd like to grow i feel that helping to build those for people around our community would make so much more ecosense going forwards i could see this as how wed play our part in the community of course this isnt possible right now because it is not profitable or at least not profitable enough to pay my monthly bills so i stick with my pointless job because i am very much stuck here but this is it my case in point  wasted time and potential in my own life   also for those that would prefer to just exist and observe the world going by via universal basic income that is completely fine too im not here to have a cheapshot at anybody we are all given the gift of life to do as we wish hopefully in a respectful and good manner but at the moment we are being utterly exploited and there are so many intelligent people out there that are wasting away their potential in shit fucking roles just because the upper crust want to increase their stock market high scores at the expense of our only damn planet   im so vexed by this concept that i struggle to see past it most mornings especially in those waking moments   dont get me wrong im not saying we shouldnt work there are a plethora of important infrastructure jobs that must be done to keep our basic needs met but these jobs should be paid handsomely not the pittance that the workers are on currently also anybody working these core jobs should only be on 1520 hours per week and this should be classed as a full time role especially in the modern world where most of our mundane jobs are automated this would further free up more allocations for jobs during a work week so that more people have the option to do a job if they want the extra money to improve their lives however they deem fit   life should be for living or improving on not for wasting away at a job that wouldnt even matter if said job didnt exist   i certainly feel that going forwards the whole world needs to balkanize to some degree in order to stop the oligarch companies and instead undertake a transformation of work to do most things small scale and local again  on a planet that just cannot take anymore of our collective bullshit it blows my mind what are your thoughts,psi719

1931,On Investments: A Discussion,i see a lot of people talking about getting by through living off investments and i gotta say thats confusing as fuck to me  wall street positively punishes companies for doing right by their employees and stocks explode upward when tons of employees are fired  costco is a great example of this because their stock tanked during the pandemic in 2020  they were having gangbusters sales knocking it out of the park in profits just killing it in 2020  they paid their employees more between making more money and those employees being at risk due to covid  their stock went down because the market decided that costco was wasting money by paying their employees more while the rest of retail decided to just throw their employees into the meat grinder of covid with no increase in pay  if youre living off of investments  youre living off of someone elses labor and when you profit it is at their expense  living off investments is part of why people are paid so little to begin with  you want to get paid better at your job  stop investing in a system that punishes companies for paying people better jackass,przeg5

live and what values we want to pursue most of us eat food from grocery stores or restaurants grown in distant places we will never see under unknown and uncontrollable conditions we rent or take out a mortgage to find a home we did not build with neighbors we did not choose and must labor immediately and continually to pay for it after going from place to place to beg for the opportunity to sell

Share it,this is how i turned antiworki used to be a gogetter always trying to be the best little wage slave that i could be in 2008 i took a parttime job in addition to my full time job the job was supposed to be parttime but had me working 40 hours a week by my third week that didnt bother me though because i was a good wage slave that thrived on the challenge eventually i quit my first job warehouse and stuck with my retail  secondary job as they offered a promotion and more consistent hours   i climbed the ladder and became a top store manager in 2015 the best store manager in the company lets call him jim finally got his promotion to district manager he did it by running one of our most difficult stores for 45 years and improving sales by 400 over those 45 years i worked with him for the first year and then went on to manage my own store when jim got promoted he said that he really thought i was the only one in the company that could run that store right   i interviewed with the vp of stores and the district manager for that store they both agreed that i had what it took to run the store and they were impressed with how prepared i was for the interview i brought up pay at the end of the interview i stated this store was very difficult to run and required more hours from a store manager than any other store if it was to be run correctly it would require more weekends and nights so i expected a pay bump in addition to the pay bump that i would be getting for going to a higher grade top quartile in volume store i also said this as i knew i was getting paid like 45 less than jim the vp of stores told me yeah not a problem we know you are a bit low on the payment spectrum and this store requires special handling it will be a 20 raise minimum  a few weeks go by and i never get an offer letter or anything they tell me i have the job and my start date comes and i still dont have an offer letter so i stay at my store two days after my supposed start date at the new store they come with an offer letter that has no mention of a raise the only carrot is a single 5 sign on bonus i refuse to take it  they decide to give it to a woman whose store was so slow that they shut it down for being unprofitable she was getting a couple dozen customers a day rather than give me a raise they put the manager from the slowest store in the company to the flagship store the lunch rush of this store alone was three hundred people she had a meltdown store sales tanked by 65 over the busy season store was ridiculously busy from midspring to early fall and dead in winter one of the challenges of that store all the trained staff the previous manager had set up either quit or transferred then they offered me an 8 raise to go clean up the store i turned it down again and was told that i apparently didnt want to advance  treat people like shit and they wont want to advance my first thought is now always how are they trying to fuck me and having been management in multiple places i can tell you it should be yours as well  ampx200b  they have since repeatedly screwed the store and now the store does around 1520 of what it was doing under jim i no longer work for the company neither does jim but four of the people i trained are  still store managers there so i still hear good tidbits,ps6r64

2023,I walked out of my job today. Sort of.,ive been with this company for about 25 years now and the first 2 were pretty good i had consistent trips and made a decent hourly wage there was enough free time in the day to take a nap unpaid which i need to stay safe driving at night i made friends with the people i delivered to and generally enjoyed my job   about a year ago things started to get disorganized trailers werent loaded on time drivers were quitting faster than they could be replaced and to top it off they changed how our pay works in order to give us less i also noticed a couple of my checks were short and theyre taking away my paid time off without compensating me its just vanishing  because of the shortage of workers they started selling off some of our runs to subcontractors naturally these were the best runs available so now the employees are left with crap   for the last 6 months ive been working longer hours for the same pay i made before while having to deal with angry customers who arent getting their deliveries on time i explain what the problem is but i still feel like an asshole because im the guy who showed up late they dont care whos at fault   today i got a run thats 3 hours longer than the norm but comes with no extra pay i asked for something else and they said no so i said i felt sick and left the on duty manager comes running out the door and manages to convince me to stay for today after i tell him everything thats going on he wrote down my complaints and said he will take it up with management but i doubt it i decided to work so that i didnt screw over the office people the problems arent their fault and it would be wrong to make them suffer for it   its pathetic that it takes me walking out for them to care about the problems   tldr company has been expecting more work for the same pay and has been screwing with the money i earned they ignored my concerns until i got fed up and walked out,prxyrd

2027,"Just turned 40, and still can't find the motivation to work / progress in my career. Terrified for the future. Guess I'm just looking for solidarity / support.",i just turned 40 and im unhappy the only way to have even a modicum of monetary comfort in a capitalist society is to just trade your already limited free time to a company that demands you to give them even more than that and thats only if you have been privileged enough to get that job in the first place i was lucky to get this position i am in now but im still working paycheck to paycheck my company doesnt give raises not even for cost of living they told me theyll promote me with a slight raise but they want 50 hours a week from me if so thats not a raise ive looked for other jobs and although there are some out there that match my actual skill level they want even more of my free time i had an interviewer once tell me well pay you 100k a year but we expect 80 hours a week wtf even though im currently not even making half that i still rejected the position giving that kind of time away to these people would make me lose whatever tiny bit of happiness ive been holding to after all these years  reading a lot of anarchist antiwork philosophy these last twenty years or so and being active in movements hasnt really helped me enjoy the working life either   its that whole officespace quote ever since i started working every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it so that means that every single day that you see me thats on the worst day of my life  i feel trapped but thats pretty much life in late stage capitalism i guess  i have interests outside of work of course i write a lot and am hoping to selfpublish im creating a board game as well losing these passions just to make an extra 20k  30k a year isnt worth it to me but that also means ill be working my whole life because i cant retire off what im making now  im just tired of it all tired that even if my peers arent happy about this type of life they have come to accept it and are able to just shrug whatever sadness they have about it away why cant i just shrug it away i get gut punched each time i try tired of my family pushing me into a better paying more hours worked career despite them knowing how bad my mental health would get tired that capitalism will soon push me into that kind of career anyways just to keep afloat  anyways i was poor most of my adult life below then just above poverty level and am white im not there anymore luckily but am still living paycheck to paycheck i cant even begin to imagine the pressures capitalism and those who enforce it place on those who have less privilege than i do   fuck,prh0wt

2049,U.S. Medical system makes working pointless,what is the point of working and saving when our crappy health rationing system will bankrupt you when you get sick and take everything you have worked for even people with health insurance are going bankrupt because insurance companies always find a loophole so they dont have to pay just when you are at your sickest and most vulnerable they hit you with a deluge of paperwork and hoops you have to jump through to get them to pay there is no transparency in the system so even if you have premium insurance the doctor who treats you is somehow out of network and you insurance doesnt cover it   working in america is a bad deal for working class people you have no security when everything you work for can be taken from you because you fall ill tying healthcare to employment is oppressive and leads to even more insecurity the business closes due to no fault of your own and again your life savings are on the line if you get ill because you cant pay your cobra premiums,prgdjp

 hate on this sub is like 9010 the rich vs government it should be flipped this is going to be an unpopular opinion on this sub i spent some time reading the comments on the thread about retirement sad for me to see people who live in fear and are lost i was broke and thought this way a few years back i want to help shed light on what i learned last few years becoming libertarian i am a first generation immigrant parents less money than myself 30 work for crony private sector my bosses are retired government employees that receive full state pensions 10k a month working full time state pays pension as long as they are not working for state government ive seen enough which is why my politics changed  are most people pretty screwed not in comparison with other countries but with what usa could be yes i absolutely agree you arent just trapped financially also mentally your wages dont stretch very far loans healthcare retirement cant afford to start family etc the natural thing to do is to find another group to vilify hence the rich hate i mean if someone else has a bigger slice of a pie that means my slice is smaller right but if you know the fiscal changes the last hundred years youd be able to link issues with policies  1 federal reserve eroding your earnings via inflation tax and  look up the cantillion effect labor is last group to catch up to higher price before nixon took the us off the gold standard the dollars could be exchanged for gold now not backed by anything the money you earn will eventually be worth the paper they are printed on the federal reserve now acts like an investment insurance to the stock market bails them out directly bailout and indirectly stimulus it should not have that type of power or that kind of responsibility the fed is directly transferring purchasing power from wage earners to stock holders each time they come to save the day and some of you cheer them on because you were emotional that this crisis is different and is world ending instead the business that mismanaged should be allowed to go out of business instead of getting put on lifeline with cheap loans from the fed  2 government cronies that serve you to justify their existence but are basically money laundering i work in infrastructure sector not high on the totem pole but enough to be in email chains and my job is like treading in a mine field when you dont want to say anything about waste or obscurity you dont know if that expensive thing someone wants to pay for is tied to someone important and your ass is gone i was in a government department intern class 1314 people are not civil engineering majors when its a ce field they were all someones kid myself the only one and dont get me started on government unions contractor unions oh not to mention look up davis bacon if you are looking for work guys gets paid 60 an hour holding a stop sign knows people last year we had to dispose a dump truck worth of soil that had a little fuel spilled in it instead of burning it locally we were told to fly it to another town with an epa certified site and they burn it there 20 bucks says that sites owner is related to someone and it only cost the tax payers 100k trust me i was way liberal before working now libertarian  3 licensure boards they are often state backed or sponsored and are designed to keep barrier to entry unnecessarily high to manipulate up wages for the exclusive club not to mention royalty i mean fees it is serfdom 2000 hours and hundreds of bucks to legally cut hair and this jacks up price of services your earnings worth less when you buy these services  4 hoa zoning commission business licensecommerce regulators all these blood suckers prevent you from opening many types of home business they force you to rent from overpriced commercial property if you ever saved enough to start a small business where i came from people were able to open convenient stores from their own tiny one bedroom street side homes and made better money than wages and street vendors stands if you didnt have a home to do that american regulators took out the bottom rungs on an actual capitalist system just look at covid somehow walmart is open but mom and pops are forced to close thats a government hitman job  5 taxes the original taxes were introduced to tax the rich now its really the middle class paying most of the taxes property taxes just gets passed on to renters social security tax turns into a slush fund for point no2 and gives you little in comparison to if you put the same money in an etf retirement account you complain about rich people not paying enough but ask yourself how little of that tax even comes back to you you get the crumbs while the rags to riches politicians get them by the loaf  6 healthcare another thing fucked by the government its insurance tax codes written off as expenses its when they limit income cap and employers used expensive insurance policies to attract people its when you gave so much power to bureaucrats that they and not us gets to decide what meds can be sold so now pharmas have political contributions as a business expense that gets added to our cost and not to mention the law barring pharmacy from selling me meds that i know i can take but requires me to check back with the doctor pay them a few hundred bucks so he can write me a permission note again all this shit adds up  7 education like point 2 its another money machine whenever government is involved overpriced overpaid when they know government is giving easy loans we saw the greatest price jacking in history a greedy private lender knows some degrees are not marketable and they would not have allowed you to owe 200k on something that earns you 20k a year  8 all this adds up stop thinking about standard of living just in how much you earn but how to get more with what you earn basically most things government touches makes you get less with what you earn they are not your friends i thought i was a left leaning person in my early 20s but the more i got older the more i realized that the less entities mentioned above the easier it would be to climb out as long as youre willing to work  how to climb out 3 years ago i was 27 jobless no health coverage no house savings ran dry just had a civil engineering degree and that was it worked in research in a state uni for the year prior and made 10 an hour doing difficult data analytics and material strength testing that is worth 40 hourly private sector dream of research wasnt as fun as i thought when i started doing it and it didnt pay for the lifestyle i wanted and i quit what i wanted for a long time because i came to realize i made a mistake i got a remote travel required job instead that paid a premium since others dont want to be remote my net worth went up 300k this past year alone from earnings real estate and investment appreciation i think sometimes you gotta not be afraid to move around between employers and cities for opportunities and not be afraid to ask for raises they can sense if you think you cant live without this job dont live in a place where you are not appreciated move be flexible see what services are needed and do that ive met people doing non college degree jobs making 5x your typical college grad jobs find ways to save and invest it think about your future dont think as you go and always learn new skills be aware but dont worry sick about the world and anything out of your reach i got friends from hs who complains about big things all day no action same place 12 years later life is never fair fuck those that painted the picture that it is i got no family members not a single one in this country competing in a super nepotistic industry kid who sit next to me for promotions has company name as his last name no coincidence but what could complaining do for me unless you start a revolution to change things i will do what i am doing now the

2063,"Labor is such a mess right now, and I'm loving it",just dropping in to share an anecdote  i live in a very high col area and was dining out at what ill call an upper middle class restaurant last night  the type that you cant call average but isnt nice enough to be called fine dining if you will its the type of place that would previously have been considered one of the good places to work as far as restaurants go and always pulled highquality candidates as far as staff went  due to covid i havent been out to eat in the current labor market but was at the tail end of a long drive from a relatives with no food at home and i finally got a taste firsthand of what ive been reading about what a mess i was seated outside and could observe the five other outdoor tables and our waitress got every single tables order wrong in some way shape or form often on multiple occasions forgot to put in more than half of her orders brought the wrong thing for several orders didnt bring platesnapkinssilverware etc etc  the beautiful thing wasnobody blamed her i could overhear the conversations at the three tables nearest me on the subject and nobody at the other three tables made a scene about it either among people who largely are welloff enough to never have worked a retailrestaurant job postcollege who are generally accustomed to a high level of service there seemed to be universal understanding that the waitress had more tables than was ideal even for an experienced staff member and had very very clearly never been trained properly for her job she was probably extremely new and had been thrown onto a saturday night dinner shift with almost no preparation i also imagine that she never would have been hired by this restaurant under other circumstances and the fact that they did hire her to do something she was potentially unqualified for wasnt her fault  we were all in a sense learning what the value of welltrained and good labor is in those positions by having it taken away and while people werent happy with the situation more so than ever before the opinion didnt seem to be this was a problem with the specific server or that millennialsgen z dont have a good work ethic or that it was fair to demand that she perform as well at her job as her predecessors and magically just be better because she was letting us down and we were the customers and she wasnt allowed to do that like they understood that the labor market had let her and countless other people down and that was the problem perhaps she was never meant to work in a restaurant  she certainly wasnt a natural but this is what you should get if you are paying people poverty wages  people who for personal or training reasons arent equipped to do the job  on another happy note in a casual conversation with a former boss of mine a fullyembracedmylife as a bland 60 year old suburban white pretrump mildly conservative upper middle manager type without him knowing my opinions on the matter he openly began advocating the revolt of the masses to me and was adamant that eventually the oppressed will rise upand then went on to clarify that he wasnt associating himself as part of that class but got into the tradeoffs that he had to personally make and wished he didnt because there wasnt much alternative besides haha live in suffering and die destitute then i guess  i hope this means real change is possible im hedging my bets personally but among people who have historically been hesitant to change what seemed like it was working for them and who have a lot to lose im starting to see opinions shift in a nontrivial way its not just oh well it would be nice if it was possible but theres a real recognition that it should be possible,prbrxt

2094,Losing my career and gaining self-realization,this is a rant but please feel free to ask me questions or discuss if you read it all thanks for sticking with me ive played hockey since i was barley able to crawl and have been coaching since i was 16 im 24 now and recently had a falling out with the organization i was working with up until this thursday  backstory i returned to the us from canada after aging out of a jr a hockey league in ontario 4 years ago and went through an existential crisis and self introductory period in a lot of ways  after a few years of assistant coaching with a hockey club in my hometown i rejoined with them after my jr hockey career ended i was given a lot of freedom to run summer workouts and build programs for our teams players and freely become a student of hockey in my own way which is what works best for me ive explored other ways but i find doing my own exploring and evolving is the healthiest thing for me  anyways i was told the way i did things was problematic likely because politics in the work place dont really exist to me when its something i really love doing they left me without a paycheck on my last week and im still owed that but its almost not worth the energy because i dont want to work for money ill take it since thats what apparently has worth today but i digress   same guys ran it since i was 8 years old and thought all the players i coached loved my workouts and style of coaching i guess they didnt like my ideas   so after all the drama dissolved i felt tonight on a run that feeling of originality and inspiration i hadnt felt that since i was probably 19 years old and it had nothing to do with words of reassurance or money or stability or anything that keeps me afloat i just long for freedom now more than anything else and id rather die with lint in my pocket and freedom in my heart than all the money in the world and no soul to witness the sublime life we all deserve im just hoping to discover what it means to me to be alive and career building aint it,prly8y

2098,The hospitality industry sucks. I'm done.,havent posted here before but buckle up cause this is going to be a rant  ive worked in hotel maintenance for 3 years now and im sick of it 2 separate hotels both big names my current one is awful out front they pay to keep it looking nice flower lady furniture touchups valet etc but behind the scenes its falling apart multiple major pieces of equipment are at the end of their life expectancy and need replacing most of this equipment was poorly designed in the first place not intended for this climate too much usage etc just nothing is right here everything is broken or stupid or poorly thought out upper management pretends to listen and then spend their money on more pool furniture or stupid events  my department is a shitshow theres me my boss who i really like and followed here from the other hotel a venezuelan temp guy who works really hard but goes back home in december and our senior mechanic whos a 60something year old who drinks silver and is trying to build a perpetual motion machine thats it for a property this size we should have 10 but we have 3  heres a story my hotel almost got in trouble for a safety violation a jackass in another department tried to blame it on us despite the fact that this had been a problem before we got here and management was already aware of it they just hadnt done anything to fix it my boss countered and took the jackass to hr their response they promoted the jackass and made him my boss boss what  these guys are management theyre supposed to plan for things figure things out resolve conflicts have back up plans these people couldnt plan a trip to the store its always last minute emergencies because they didnt bother to check anything or think about anything   heres one they wanted to swap out some coffee makers the old coffee makers were rented so i cant touch them sounds easy enough call the tech for the old ones and have him remove them call the tech for the new ones and have him install them if youre feeling really smart you can call both of them and schedule them to come out simple right apparently not they didnt call anybody to remove them and instead wanted us to do it also can you do it right now thanks bye we had other stuff planned but fine we take the coffee makers down a few days later a tech comes to install the new coffee makers only hes alone and isnt allowed to lift them by himself he also isnt allowed to lift them with one of us it can only be 2 of us or 2 techs no mix and match for liability reasons we didnt know we were doing this until they called us out of the blue so now theyve pulled two guys off of what they were supposed to be doing for some coffee makers that we shouldnt even be touching in the first place but fine whatever well lift these things up onto the counter and then we can go the tech will take care of the rest only they dont fucking fit theyre too tall and hit the shelf above the counter they eventually had us cut a notch in the shelf for the coffee makers the manager who should have been directing this was actually the same jackass from above he was busy schmoozing some guy out on the golf course and didnt answer his phone just a clusterfuck from start to finish best part is those old coffee makers are still sitting in the hallway cause they cant figure out what to do with them  how can they make the wrong decision all the time even flipping a coin should give them a 50 success rate   and for the grand finale the straw that broke the camels back since our department is so short staffed we are quite low on specialized labor kitchen tech refrigeration tech electrician you get the idea so we have to call outside companies in no big deal pretty common but lately those companies havent been answering our calls couldnt figure out why until my boss mentioned that accounting hasnt been paying them weve confronted them and gotten nothing this has been going on for months how can they not pay people a tech comes in they give my boss an invoice my boss signs the invoice to say yes this tech did this work i agree to pay him x dollars and then accounting pays them thats it this isnt complicated so now the techs wont answer our calls and wont come out because they dont think theyll get paid meaning the work doesnt get done and people are left complaining at me  im done i worked straight through covid because hotels were essential somehow i worked for a month straight with no days off because we were so understaffed usually 60 hours a week with no recognition and they still expect us to jump and instantly solve their problems i did not spend 5 years in college get a bachelors of science just to plunge toilets and get yelled at by colleagues all so some fatass upper management who doesnt know the meaning of a full days work can make some bonus thats more than i make in a year fuck it fix your own shit im out,prb0b9

2103,Anyone else feel unemployable?,i did various courses in things i was good at but never good enough so i didnt get the all valuable experience that employers are fetishize the emptiness of that word  experience i graduated with a phd but it looks like despite really fucking trying all academics have closed ranks and its pretty obvious they dont want me in their field either so im kinda getting old apparently though i fail to see the logic of that with potentially 20 years of working left which is a long time  2001 seems like aeons ago i want to escape ireland which i really dont fit into and go on a european adventure work is a necessary evil for that i just dont want to get esl jobs retail etc because they pay peanuts and theres no job security plus ive worked in esl for 5 years and my brain is turning to mush with the boredom   its kind of fucked beyond recognition tbh the bullshit of academia cant be overstated they constantly shift the goalposts nepotism is redefined as moulding when its just supervisors with influence picking their favourite students and plonking them in tenure track careers originally you could take a few years to get into academia now theres a 5 year window courtesy of neoliberal infiltration and hr assholes after that too late youre out this excludes people with experience outside academia who can enrich academic environments again what youre left with is a closeted stagnant environment which preselects for people who conform most to the characteristics of selfimportance ego and snootiness associated with the quintessential academic seriously im no comedian but so many academics ive met have been stiff and up their own asses   im aware though that the bs extends to everything for example im horrified and baffled by the ageism bigotry i read about in it apparently being over 30 is old too old to make a career change or teaching where its just psychological abuse until burnouts and breakdowns its like there is 13 of the population who make work hell for everyone else but theyre too vacant to realise it themselves the employment landscape since 2008 has been bad but now its going into full overdrive absurdity and im thinking something has to give its like a pressure cooker heated to max the corporations squeal and whine about not finding employees but have requirements so bloody high only the top 001 get an interview i could be teaching at a university ive done it before but because im not a superstar academic theyve shut down that future i could video edit just as well as anyone else but because my experience isnt in a professional environment it doesnt count i could take a job like graphic design and learn on the job but no you must have a portfolio specifically for graphic design other art doesnt count and we will not offer training there are companies like linkedin who hire data entry people but dont pay them thats the recruitment agencys job so not only are companies refusing training they now expect someone else to pay for their hires   its like fuck these people they perpetuate this violence of unemployment because thats what it is it condemns others to poverty psychological and economic misery its like a game of musical chairs where theres one chair and 10000 players,prhz0t

2115,The funny thing about this sub is... (Serious),the funny thing about this sub is from what ive been reading most people here just dont want their life controlled i thought i was antiwork in a sense that i just hated being under someone elses agenda and time  1 they tell me when to show up 2 they tell me what to wear and how to wear it 3 they determine by their own discretion whether my health is severe enough to miss a day or two 4 they operate under their convenience not the convenience of the people who make them the money  im pretty sure i could make a longer list but these are just main things i thought i was just a lazy pos but it turns out thats not the case at all and for many people here  when the people here say its either slave away or starvation its true because its stating that most businesses are of the same cloth there are hardly any businesses around that take into account the employees convenience in which they can get the best performance out of them  i recently found out that i enjoy investing alot there is risk but it is far more suitable for me than a backbreaking grind in the name of workethic  i dont care if the people who hate this sub just see everyone as lazy they believe everyone should just put up with a situation that makes them miserable and thats working a majority of your life doing something you dont want because you wont have money otherwise  to that i say there is more to life than unconditional ambition if someone wants to chill in the grass and eat fruit all day i say let them obligating work only sparks resentment and resistance  we need a way to get chores accomplished in a manner that isnt at the expense of ones freedom of choice  many people here arent lazy i thought i was lazy but im not would a lazy person take time to read books to learn about the stock market i definitely think not i did what i did on my own time because i was interested in it this showed me that not wanting to spend 812 hours doing work everyday does not make someone lazy  i made 100 dollars in 1 hour the other day and i couldnt have been happier i had complete control over how i obtained my money i couldve stopped anytime i wanted once i was satisfied with my gain and i think thats what alot of people want  we need to redefine lazy being lazy doesnt mean doing nothing it means doing the bare minimum and if thats the case doing the bare minimum is something even a person who doesnt want to do shit could do someone isnt gonna complain for working 10 hours a week and make sufficent money to live off of  from investing 100 dollars everyday is 500 2 weeks would be 1000 thats a basic paycheck for alot of people and id have potentially made that in 1 hours time 1 hour each day  instead of forcing long hourly wages we should provide the absolute bare minimum or amount of hours at the employees discretion as a foundation  and then provide incentives and rewards for the longer the employee chooses to stay  ie if the employee decides to work an 8 hour traditional shift they get free healthcare on behalf of the company on top of better pay meaning more frivolous spending money as opposed to making just enough money to sustain yourself incentives like this  if an employee decides to work 5 hour shifts they get much better pay than if they worked a measily 12 hours  corporations need to value time again and people need to realize how valuable their time really is,prfbcc

2127,I miss being unemployed.,back in march of 2020 i got laid off from a miserable ass job and was able to get all the unemployment benefits for about 6 months i think that was the happiest i have ever been i didnt have to worry about money bc i was getting 2x what i was making working over 40 hours a week and had time to do things i enjoyed granted that was just watching all the star wars movies and sleeping in all day but it was so nice to have no worries about work and still have money for bills i also found out since covid started that im autistic which is why i have hated every fast paced loud noised job ive had its a sensory overload and i just really hope i find something with a good manager thats slow paced and pays decently so i can have a cute house one day i do miss not working and having all my needs plus some met though so much,prm8gg

2129,Make way more than other workers. Not sure what to do!,last week i found out i and one other staff make almost 5 more an hour than everyone else to make things worse we both are the newest people here   im extremely grateful that im paid well but there are many conflicts with this  i feel like anyone finding out i make so much more would just set a target on my back  yes i can tell them about it and try to get them a raise this just put me in a weird position if they didnt get a raise they will still probably be bitter toward me and the manager will have knife out for me even if they get a raise the manager definitely will start to look to get rid of me or worse loader my pay so yes a lost  lost situation here  if i dont rock the boat and keep it to myself i can imagine they would shaft me hard whenever it come to raise im doing very decent on money now but i need about 4 more a hour to be absolutely comfortable and have money to put toward savingretirement   so i cant afford to just not get a raise or get a shitty 15 cent raise im full on determined to get at least 2 raise next year  this put me in weird position when it come to negotiations for a raise i know they will try very hard to find a way to not give me raise  so im thinking maybe when the time come if they wont give me the raise i want i can just tell them look i know i make way more than everyone else give me the raise i want or i let the words out that im making a lot more than them then you will have a real mess on your hands give me the raise i want or they learn how much more im making  but that doesnt seem like a good idea  so any suggestions on what i should do,prcou3

2131,I feel like the butt end of a joke,i work under the table which i always felt was a blessing screw you taxes i am a certified nurses aide privately  for a 96 year old lady with dementia a rich 96 year old  at that  i also work 20 hour shifts which isnt super easy because i have to stay awake during the entire time  but leaves me more time to be at home with my child being a nurses aide is a lot harder than people think lots and lots of physical and verbal abuse from the very peopleperson youre working to keep alive and well but physically its hard too and the pay is terrible when i was working at a nursing home often taking care of 2040people a night i made less than an average fast food worker and i went to school for this job working under the table felt like a blessing because the difference in my paycheck without taxes taken out made it feel much more glamorous    on to the point of my story    the children whom are in their 50s60s active and well are in charge of the finances so they pay us biweekly one of them was visiting last week and while i always find it weird that were still required to come take care of their mother when they are here to visit  when they are more than capable of doing so you cant walk your mom to the bathroom while youre here and have me do tasks that feel a little degrading theres just something about being ordered around when they just sit there for example they were eating  a meal i prepared and the daughter will ask her mom if she wants salt for her food and when the mom says yes the daughter turns to me and says can you get her salt like uh sure but also when she was visiting i had to clear her plates and cups  had to wash them  etc okay fine but can you at least rinse the dirty food off your dish so i dont have to wipe off the bits and pieces that fell from your mouth on the last day she had a plane to catch at 6am so she came knocking on her moms door  at 445amdaughter stayed in a hotel paid for by mom turned all the lights on cooked herself breakfast and packed herself lunch for the trip and left the kitchen a mess of half eaten food crumbs 3 cups a plate bowl  pan wet used tea bags dirty used disposable mask dirty napkins all on the counter for me to clean   guess who forgot to pay us 4 days ago ah yes the person i just waited on hand and food when as a trained medical professional  i am not even hired to take care of in that way i am not a maid  and i am not hired to take care of family members etc    i always dread when her awful pretentious  disgusting offspring come to visit because it means im taking care of 2 people for the price of one but it just feels like a huge slap in the face when you can do that  and not even be concerned enough to mail a check to pay for the people who are with your dying not nice mother 24 hours a day so pretentious that you assume we are here to wait on you and your family  but even worse when our livelihood depends on you remembering to compensate us for our work    i am currently on a 20 hr shift with a migraine going on 11 hours but still being a kind person to the lady i am responsible for but i was very excited to get my little paycheck so that when it actually deposits in 2 more days i could pay my bills but as of right now me and the other 3 cnas have no idea when we will see our earnings    i wish i could quit and do something from home so it didnt feel like someone else held my life in their hands this life is a joke    sorry for the long rant,prido9

2140,Speculations about the future: how Capitalism could keep humanity enslaved,hi ive been suggested this subreddit by chance and i promptly joined before talking about the subject id like to tell you something about myself   im 42 i come from a family of workers my grandparents were farmers ive got a 13 years old son and im divorced  ive been working in it for a big insurance company for several years now im a project manager of sort i like my job nonetheless i cant help but feel a slave of a system i dont like  smartworking made me think a lot about our modern life and the absurdity of commuting every day just to sit in front of a monitor  im italian so english is not my native language forgive me if something sounds funny  having said that id like to go back to the topic at hand  we all have heard about the rising of automation and im sure most of you have thought about what the world could be once robots will be able to substitute humans in their job  i personally think the real humanism can only be reached by total automation when nobody is forced to have a job to sustain himherself  a society forged on people who are free to do what they want will inevitably make social differences disappear and this is where the troubles could start emerging  capitalism is built upon social classes it splits society in blocks based on their income a very minuscule group of people the ones in the upper echelon controls everything they can influence the market they can decide prices they can make masses of people poor at their whim  these people wont surrender their power so easily they dont want humanity to stand on the same level they need control and they dont consider themselves equal to the rest of society  to start the real automation process you need money you need economic and political power you need the means to develop and build the robots  factory owners will consider these robots their property even when the robots will be able to build themselves even when they wont have to move a finger to make the factory work  even now i read articles about how we should start thinking about a universal basic income to keep the system going  this is the worst thing that could happen to humanity it would stop the process of liberating humanity from the yoke of currency  capitalism is organizing itself right now its creating the foundations to keep us under its control even when the automation will do all the work  i strongly believe people should reject the idea of being dependant from currency we need to lose the concept of exchanging money for goods robots will give us all we need and these robots must be owned by humanity not by capitalists  i know all these topics are far away in the future but im afraid the few people who control the world are already moving to keep us in the corner  id like to hear what you think about it am i too pessimistic  thanks for your time,pr4jut

2155,I'm enjoying the memes here but I'm yet to see any meaningful post/conversation about how to really reduce the amount of tedious work in your life.,hi im new here and im quite surprised that most content here is memes about corpos exploiting employees and not much about actually solving some issues were all facing  so whats your plan for financial freedom to pursue hobbies or leisure how can you slowly reduce the amount of work in your life how you can plan ahead so your future life is happier and funnier while not making your present life awful or maybe you want to share some issues you face in your life and maybe community would actually figure out some solution  so i guess i can start my overall approach is specialization as learning to do things that noone can easily replicate because theyre just hard andor require very specific formalized form of certification and i strongly believe that it can work in any domain be it art medicine or literally painting walls at some point you can be picky at what job you choose and if you prefer working 250hmonth and drowning in money or 50hmonth and just managing to have food clothes and small place to live  so prove me wrong i guess ill gladly hear your experience and ideas,pqr5rz

2171,The CEO Kitchenette Nightmare - With Pics!,some background  my department moved into a new building earlier this year that is across the street from the main production facility this new building has its own small kitchenette and dining area our ceo micromanages every area of the company including this kitchenette its quite sad and hilarious   for example   we have a refrigerator with an ice maker he picked it out we have a waterline for the ice maker he approved that in the design of the building we are not to hookup the waterline he specifically had ran for the fridge to the fridge itself therefore we are not allowed to use the ice maker  we have submitted several purchase reqs for a coffee maker he has denied every single one of them a basic keurig hell no the cheapest bunn on the market nope if you want coffee you have to walk across the street to the only coffee maker in the facility to get it a small gripe in the grand scheme of things for sure but his repsonse when asked why im not sure i want you all to have a coffee maker over there seriously  i regularly pick up extra items on sale when i go grocery shopping and bring them in to stock our small pantry stuff like crackers chips cookies pudding cups hot pockets etc other people on the team do the same so we have snacky stuff like peanuts pretzels and beef jerky on occasion too he has no problem coming over to help himself to our teams food now i bring in snacks for everyone so they can feel fed happy and maybe even appreciated a little bit i wouldnt mind him eating our food if he wasnt such a richard  i know all of these sound like first world problems of course theres more to the story including many instances big and small of his behavior his outbursts and his bizarre decisionmaking process those are stories for another day for now our focus is the kitchenette and this email we received yesterday labeled exhibit a because im putting together a portfolio for my exit interview  ampx200b  clean

email   the trash was neither overflowing nor offensively putrid and stinking up the place friday is trash day and it was going to be thrown into the dumpster at the end of the day anyways well take it out during the week if it gets full or starts to stink  we also clean out the fridge and pantry every friday to dispose of any open or old food it all goes into the trash can which gets emptied into the dumpster at the end of the day we never leave food waste in the building over the weekend  nobody keeps food in their desk drawers we have a kitchen for that remember well we used to i do have a pack of gum some chapstick and pepto bismol tablets in mine if you want get technical  we spot clean during the week as needed with the pathetic lobby broom and dustpan we have and deep clean the place every friday afternoon this includes dusting sweeping vacuuming and again emptying all of the trash in the building oftentimes this means we throw it all in a personal vehicle and drive it around to the other side of the main building to toss it all in the dumpster  coming to a close i want to say that the point in all of this is not to gripe about us having to clean the point is that we work for an impossible to please manchild tyrant who loves to browbeat his employees maybe more context is needed or maybe its just one of those you had to be there situations ill elaborate further

2177,Quit 2 jobs under a week in the last month but now I feel I'm just gonna have to put up with it,this is a rant of me getting tired of the bullshit with minimum wage jobs and what comes with them  ive just gone back to education so i can go to university  next year uk ive decided after working since i left school at 16 its a load of shit and i should at least try and do something that i enjoy for the most part which is music  while im going back to school i need a job to pay my bills and pay of debt i got myself into by being young and naive really  the first job i got was advertised as 1150 an hour it was a waiting position i was pretty happy about getting this job as it was a fair bit over the minimum wage here so i had a 5 hour trial shift which i was told is only paid if you get the job this isnt illegal in  the uk but its certainly a whole load of bullshit i got the job but it turned out to only be 750 an hour even though it was advertised at 1150 i stupidly accepted it because i really needed the money and couldnt wait for another the job was fucking mind numbing and there was posters on the wall showing how you cant have visible tattoos piercings no messy hair etc i put up with the bullshit for a few days but i was rotad in for like a 11 hour shift with a 30 min break they got round that by using their closing time as your finish however it was policy to allow customers to stay as long as they want which meant hours were much longer i left after like 4 days or so  i then about a week later managed to get another job as a waiter the money was better about 9 an hour i started on the monday and was put on the rota for 9 days straight originally i told them i had school so i needed those days off so they changed my days off to when i was at school i was still working 7 days straight some shifts i was in a or a closeopen close being around 12am and open at 7am i have 67 hour days at school its not physically exerting but it leaves me with literally no time for myself i tried to stick to the job but i literally burnt myself out within the week and was really sick of it  starting to wonder if its me being too picky about jobs or if they all just take the piss and expect you to be ok ok with  sorry for the rant,pr88r2

2195,The Stupid Job: A Memoir,jobs are confusing to say the least my previous job was a material handler at fedex and i absolutely hated it the pay was around 1525 an hour and i worked part time which meant roughly around 5 hours a day  5 days a week now i know that sounds like heaven considering the fact that i dont have many debts to pay for but if im going to be honest it was one of the worst jobs ive ever had at first it seemed like a pretty cool job mostly a male environment and some crude humour  which in no way am i dissing on and i got along with many if not most of my coworkers yet there was one thing we could agree on and that was how terrible this place was ran there were many minor incidents that had happened but the lack of responses from the managers were beyond there was one instance where a small chemical spill happened in the belly of the truck i ran to the bathroom to wash my hands as it was burning the hell out of my skin that didnt seem to work so i proceeded one of my managers on duty for help he looked at my hands for a solid minute  as my hands are still burning and told me to wash my hands i then went to the bathroom as i was told and washed my hands a second time i ran back as it was still burning my hands and he proceeded to tell me to wash them a third i finally got some burn cream from a coworker and that seemed to resolve it much better i was a little upset by them but not too fazed nothing happened for a couple of months until one day i was working in a truck and a 40 pound pole had fallen onto the back of my head if im going to be completely honest its like i couldnt feel it because all i felt was numb i looked into the light and it was pretty blurry so i stood up and walked around for a second i asked for an icepack and didnt receive one for 30 minutes and i was dumbfounded i knew by then the company was sht  another instance was bathroom usage i went to the bathroom once and i was asked later that day if i had menstruation issues by my male manager because he felt as if i took a long time in the bathroom i also always saw my managers on snap or tinder and i mean i would be too if i could but they specified no phones inside the building due to privacy issues it was one of the worst jobs and honestly i called out so much i thought i was lazy and unmotivated because  i didnt want to go to a job that was only five hours a day moving on i have now found a different job in which i work a ten hour night shift and i love it i guess it goes to show that some jobs are just not for you also look the job up on indeed before you apply people will give you feedback on your future hellhole,pr4pe0

2205,"The planet’s dying, people are starving, and I have to cook pounds of food just to throw it away so I can pay rent",im a closer at a grocery store deli aside from the fresh salads aka premade prepackaged garbage we just dump in a tray to put under display and the handsliced cold cuts and cheese you can also come to the deli for our hot food case and a selfserve hot soup case and my god the amount of waste this one department makes in a single day is harrowing especially if youre on closing shift since thats when we have to throw away the most amount of food  first theres the selfserve soup case already a terrible idea during a pandemic they closed the selfserve case for a couple months before reopening it because corporate is stupid and every night thats no less than seven pounds of cooked soup to throw away  then theres our main hot case the one where we have a huge assortment of all types of cooked foods chicken tenders chicken wings baked chicken fried chicken potato fries mac and cheese etc   technically were supposed to throw out anything that gets put in the hot case and replace it every four hours we usually dont though because fuck hustle and grind culture and i at least try to cook as little as possible because i know most of it is going to be wasted still we need to make sure theres at least enough cooked food out and that none of it is too old or dried out because otherwise customers are going to complain or one of the higherups at the store will complain  i shit you not one time the store director had us cook way too much fried chicken because the store was doing a big sale event the store director wanted to get a picture of a huge pile of fried chicken so he could send it to the big corporate overlords well guess what even though it was a big sale day 8piece fried chicken for only 5 we were still left with like forty pieces of fried chicken to throw away by days end but hey at least the ceo got to jerk off to a pic of a fried chicken tower  and i hate how entitled customers are these people either dont know or dont care about the ramifications of this fucked up keep fresh hot food on display all day system people complaining when we dont have enough readytoeat hot food because they need their god damn chimkin tendies right now dammit one time our hot case broke down we literally could not have any hot food on display for almost a week and while most customers were understanding we had one fucking karen come in and throw a fucking tantrum because we couldnt have any fried chicken out and i only came here for the fried chicken bitch was acting like we broke our hot case on purpose just to spite her specifically i despise that gimme gimme right now bullshit youre in a fucking grocery store in a shopping center either find something else to eat or if you need fried chicken that fucking badly theres a fucking kfc and a popeyes just around the god damn corner  all of this just forces me into a negative feedback loop if i dont cook a disgusting amount of food for the hot case someone might complain about it but if i do cook a lot of food its guaranteed that all of a sudden well have a drop in customers and then all the extra shit i cooked wont sell and has to be thrown away  and of course being a big chain grocery store we cant give food to anyone for free so all the food that needs to be tossed goes in the dumpster with a padlock and a compactor inside it i would love to find a way to sneak out with all the cooked food thats still safe to eat and give it to anyone who needs it but of course i cant because if i get caught and i will coz grocery stores have security cameras everywhere ill get fired and then i wont be able to pay rent   oh and naturally our prices keep going up since the planet is dying and all and i hate that i have to bite my tongue every time a customer asks me why our chicken tenders cost more now or worse complains about it like im just a clerk im not in charge of shit the only response i can give is were in the middle of a global pandemic as well as total ecological and economic collapse of course everythings getting more expensive and will only keep getting more expensive but obviously im not going to say that to customers so i just have to smile and say im sorry i dont know why prices are going upits up to our vendors  im writing this because im almost finished with my shift and i had to throw out maybe thirty pounds of cooked chicken alone and thats par for the course here and thats just the cooked chicken theres plenty of other perfectly edible food that gets wasted on a daily basis at this department which is still only a fraction of the total daily waste produced by the entire store its fucking unreal who the fuck came up with this model for grocery store delis there are a lot of things i hate about my job but the sheer amount of waste produced by our hot case alone is just so depressing   this system is fucked and i hate participating in it but i need to in order to afford the privilege of being alive ugh,pr0zgt

2226,Let's build a better society,hello everyone  in the last months im thinking a lot about our society how much nonsense and paradoxes it creates eg unemployment systemic poverty i believe there is a better way forward we dont have to stay confined in these problems that we ourselves created  how to do it though we need people and resources a lot of them history teaches us that many times we have tried to overthrow the establishment but to no avail ive come to the conclusion that a widespread radical change is impossible in the short term for each person that will join our effort there will be 10 more that will actively refuse the change and work against it most people really dont like changes even less the radical ones even more if they have been brainwashed about it since childhood it doesnt matter if their life could be better by doing so they prefer the uncomfort of what they know  i suppose this is just part of our human nature fighting it will do no good however i strongly believe humans can change in the right environment even better there are already a lot of people that want this change to happen  but then do we really need to change a whole nation the whole world i dont think so it would be enough to unite all people that are already happy to work towards a better future towards a vision if we play our cards well more and more people will come together there will still be people against it but as long as we dont force the change on them they will have nothing to complain about  thats what i want to make a reality an evolution rather than a revolution ive already worked on a manifesthttpsbabelsocietyorgmanifest and a planhttpsbabelsocietyorgplan none of them is set in stone and im open to contributionhttpsgithubcombabelsocietywebsite but i believe its very important to state crystal clear what are our goals and what society we want to build  thats what babel societyhttpsbabelsocietyorg is about  i hope this piqued your interest and to have a discussion around this project ask me anything ,pr39p7

2228,Getting rid of my raise on the sly,ive worked at my current company for 3 years now my first year i didnt work a full year to qualify for a evaluationmerit raise second year the entire company didnt do merit raises because of covid and bankruptcy   after recovering from that i finally got my first evaluation and merit raise lil ole 48 cents for over 120 rate in production okay fine nbd   our company just got a market increase my job position got an increase in base pay as well but even with the new increase and my merit raise i wouldnt have made as much as hiring someone right off the street in my job position so they matched it   they matched my pay to the same pay a random dude off the street would get if they got hired three years of work and my tiny little merit raise has been wiped away   im thankful for the market increase in pay dont get me wrong but to word it like theyre doing me a favor by matching what should be the base pay is just plain dirty and im not the only person theyve did it to   im working on trying to go back to school at this point because ive felt trapped in my current position ive taken pay cuts before to get out of a shitty work environment and ill do it again but not without a plan ready to go because none of us lowermiddle class workers can survive without even 2 weeks of a paycheck,pr7o8v

2234,Are we just hostages?,ive been considering why it seems so difficult for governments to extract the wealth out of these huge billion dollar corporations the most obvious answers is that these companies leverage their huge wealth to essentially bribe and lobby their way out of paying their full dues i do believe this is definitely one aspect however i believe there is a more sinister angle the true power at play for these companies is not their massive wealth but comes from the jobs they provide even a well meaning politician or government is going to be reticent at taking action against these corporations when it risks jobs of the people they represent and these jobs are necessary for providing the basic needs of these people  to that end these jobs are utilised for political capital to keep governments from acting against them it is then obvious to see why these companies would have an interest in inflating how many jobs they provide giving rise to so many unnecessary jobs and wasted labour this goes against what would be expected of a company which would be to minimise costs but when this labour can be used to gain real power it makes sense if instead these corporations paid their dues and the government were to provide for the people in terms of benefits or ubi or whatever then that power would be given to the government these corporations want to be the ones to provide sustenance in the form of unnecessary salaried employment because then they hold the keys they are the hand that feeds and hence that is where the power lies   ultimately it just feels as if these corporations are essentially using their employees as hostages to amass not only wealth but real political power governments cant act against these companies without risking jobs these companies can so easily claim that any government action which goes against their interest will cost people jobs since they are fully aware of the inefficiencies within them and can easily drop these unnecessary employees without actually compromising the operations of the business and at the same time make the governments which acted against them extremely unpopular by increasing unemployment and claiming that it was a consequence of action taken by an unfriendly government  the only real way to prevent this kind of thing from getting worse is if jobs and employment are not strictly necessary for basic human sustenance thus diminishing the political power gained through inflating the number of jobs provided by these companies,pqrypk

2261,My Job and Coworkers Made My Suicidal Ideation Worse - So I Left. Have I made a mistake?,im a 26 yearold woman in nc and i was diagnosed with adhd and persistent depressive disorder around may of last year at the same time i was working at a bake shop and taking classes at my university it got so bad that i had to take a medical withdrawal from college so i could focus on just one thing attempting to earn a living i worked for a little over a year before quitting abruptly my decision was preceded by a toxic social hierarchy in a team based setting where my manager would protect her team leads that contributed to a decaying work environment a few examples include having a coffee bar with only one person on station getting backed up with orders visibly frustrated customers and no one coming to help  instead they would go to the back to chat and play on their phones another being that i would be treated like the social outcast never included in any conversation despite my efforts and practically ignored by my coworkers unless i put them on the spot by asking for help which only made tensions worse these are people that revel in the misery they cause and thrive in maintaining superiority over others i quickly became their target and was kept outside of their social group from the very beginning  these are just two examples among a generally immature petty and horribly toxic environment that made getting up in the morning near impossible often i would get ready while sobbing and screaming into the universe for some escape it got so bad that i would have alcohol in my car that i would drink during my break to take the edge off which bled into my days off i was drinking so much i became unrecognizable then the suicidal thoughts appeared stronger and stronger to the point that i was actively planning out giving away all of my possessions rehoming my cat and researching suicide methods  so in late august i quit over text and just about burned every bridge i know thats not the healthiest exit but i cant begin to describe the elation i felt knowing i no longer had to wake up to another nightmare for minimum wage while being mistreated by rude and entitled customers  im still applying around for another job and while i get interviews occasionally nothing has come to fruition i really just want to focus on finishing my degree but i know i cant survive on the little aid i receive and i doubt i can qualify for unemployment based on the circumstance above im wondering if theres anything at all that i can do at the rate im going i will be staring down the barrel of homelessness or worse yet again,pqsrvg

2264,Can we talk about how much benefits suck for a second??,ive been working for almost 30 years now every year the benefits have gotten worse while premiums have gone up i get that healthcare has gotten more expensive overall but employers dont have to sign up for the shittiest plans like a responsible person i sign up for the vision the dental and the medical nobody takes my dental plan except these back alley rundown back alley sketch shops same with vision and then when i go to these grimy places i still have to pay for half the shit out of pocket then every year they switch to a different cheaper plan and i get to find an even shittier doctor to go to who ends up telling me they dont take my insurance anymore when i get there even though they were listed on the website and if you need mental health care good luck finding anyone who takes insurance i hardly ever end up using my insurance because i spend the whole year hopping around trying to find somewhere they will even take it and end up getting almost no care despite paying premiums every month and then the plan switches every employer ive worked for has pulled this same shit and they get away with it because they all just say great benefits in their job posting and we dont find out the truth until its too late,pq770q

Tried to spread class consciousness, but capitalist propaganda interferes once again.",i needed a haircut today and went to do online checkin which wasnt working the sign out front said cash only and when she wrote me down on paper i asked if their systems were down and she said yes she seemed visibly frustrated and from what she was saying to her current client it sounded like she was going to quit her job  when it was my turn she was talking about how the wifi was down and how the owner of the store had pulled her away from a client just to yell at her for not doing her job she said she makes 9hour as a hair stylist and thats not part of her job and i agreed she said that she told the owner over the phone she was quitting and there was one other lady working who said she was quitting apparently someone had called in that morning and the woman cutting my hair had to leave at 3 pm to get her kids and it seemed like nobody else was coming in so they would have to close at 3   i thought this was a great opportunity to subtly spread some class consciousness but sadly i dont think it worked she told me shes 38 making 9hour with at least 2 kids and she has been living with her parents since the start of the pandemic shes fed up with being treated like shit at work by customers and the owners which i told her i completely understood i did the whole ya know isnt it crazy that we deemed all these jobs essential and just dont pay them more you all should really be paid more to which she started talking about how people are lazy and just dont want to work and then i just internally sighed  she talked about dominos workers for some reason and raising wages there and what she said wasnt very clear but it sounded like she was upset that they were paying 1314hour and hiring teenagers and how that affects adult workers or something like that again this woman is 38 has 2 kids lives with her parents and makes 9hour and shes complaining about other people that are most definitely in a similar situation as her making more and how its bad because teenagers who might not be in that situation could also make a higher wage i tried to talk about how it sounds like the owner contributes no labor to the shop and just yells at them for not doing things they werent hired to do which she seemed to agree with but that went nowhere i really thought i had a shot here to spread some class consciousness but it didnt seem to work capitalist propaganda is so effective that adults living with their parents making 9hour will belittle and demean other people in the same situation just because theyre conditioned to think other people are lazy and dont want to work  i paid for my haircut in cash and gave her a 40 cash tip despite her ignorance on that one part but i really thought i had a shot at spreading some worker solidarity i told them i supported them in quitting their jobs and they should never feel guilty for quitting a job they are sick of tolerating bullshit at  how do you all think the most effective way to combat these ideas are the idea that other people are just lazy and dont want to work how do you show people that they are people in the same situation and hyperindividualism is an attitude we should abandon,pq78ko

2268,Dealing with former boss and his psychopathic behaviour,so i quit a role a promotion for a set period of time  same employer but different office from my old role a month ago this was a really difficult decision for me as it was an opportunity i worked really hard to get and it was a big jump financially but my boss was impossible to deal with so i had no real choice   he was the most supercritical manager ive ever dealt with was constantly hounding me talked over me or cut me off regularly was just generally really rude and unpleasant and so much more it was a toxic environment that impacted my mental and psychical health immensely anyway i quit and the arrangement is that i now need to go through an internal process where i can apply for another position in my previous office i have not asked this boss to give me a reference have not spoken to him since my last day in that role and hope i dont need to again  i have good reason to believe that despite me not asking him to be a reference that he has gone behind my back and given unsolicited negative feedback about me to the managers of the new roles im applying for the feedback isnt even correct as much of the criticism is a result of the environment he created and doesnt match with feedback ive received by any of my previous managers here  how do i deal with this i like the organisation i work for and there are some opportunities that i have here that i wont be able to get in many other places i also have a few nice colleagues id like to stay working with theres no chance of me being jobless as ill get placed in a role soon if the applications for my selected roles arent successful   the role i left was quite high pressure and will mean that he now has to do more work until my role can be filled i think he is also trying to do some kind of revenge as he no longer has power over me   are there any ways i can better navigate the situation i dont want to make a formal complaint as it means ill need to interact with him again and i know hell get protected by some management higher up anyway  any general tips or advice would be helpful thanks,pqjd88

2316,From my local paper - Hawkers Asian Street Food’s staffing woes were a mess. Raising wages fixed it.,httpswwworlandosentinelcombusinessosbzhawkers15minimumwageresults202109146zkvqb526neodd6uerzsp6vnbqstoryhtmlhttpswwworlandosentinelcombusinessosbzhawkers15minimumwageresults202109146zkvqb526neodd6uerzsp6vnbqstoryhtml  support local journalism if you can if you cant here is the paywalled text   a raise in june gave chyanne cole another reason to stay working at hawkers asian street food as well as more money to eventually attend technical college  its helped me not look for another job because now its very hard to find another job that is willing to pay you this much the 19yearold said i do feel like im getting paid for the work that i put into this place and they treat me very well for an employee ive never had a job treat me with this much respect  orlandobased hawkers upped its nontipped minimum wage to 15 an hour and 8 an hour for tipped employees in june hawkers also gave raises to workers already making more than those amounts to account for tenure and experience leading to 72 of its staff receiving a pay increase  just months later the chain is no longer facing the employment crisis bedeviling much of the restaurant industry since the move turnover has dropped by more than 40 said ceo kaleb harrell though salary costs are higher that lower turnover and less time spent on training are helping to offset the expense  were completely out of crisis mode harrell said our restaurants are comfortably staffed  there are still 42 open positions but thats down from 86 in may  hawkers has 10 open locations one restaurant temporarily closed in atlanta and another on the way in dallas the chain has 873 employees a figure that would be about 965 if not for the atlanta restaurants renovation  cole who is now making the new minimums in both tipped and nontipped roles at the mills avenue hawkers in orlando wants to eventually become a nail technician and barber  i went from only being able to put like 50 a week away to being able to put over 100 a week cole said it helps me pay my bills and buy my nail supplies to help put me into nail school   top challenge for restaurants  wages have been on the rise for restaurant employees across the country  average hourly earnings were 1532 for restaurants and other eating places in june up from 1360 in august 2020 according to the us bureau of labor statistics  beyond just restaurants the washington post reported nearly 80 of workers in the united states are now making 15 an hourhttpswwwwashingtonpostcombusiness20210808fifteendollarwage or more that percentage increased from 60 in 2014  floridas minimum wage is also set to gradually increase from 865 to 15 an hour by 2026 httpswwworlandosentinelcomnewsosne2020generalelectionfloridaamendments20201104cewjo6jr5vebzmvmb423sgkviahtmlstoryhtmlit will become 10 per hour on sept 30  the pay increases come as 75 of restaurant operators said recruiting employees was their top challenge as of june according to the national restaurant association  restaurants remain nearly 1 million workers below prepandemic employment levels despite job growth in the first half of the year the business association said in a news release in august  restaurant operators along with their partners throughout the supply and distribution chain remain focused on providing diners with a safe and enjoyable experience amid rising food and labor costs and challenges related to the pandemic national restaurant association ceo tom bene said in the release given these factors our outlook through the end of the year is one of cautious optimism   a breath of fresh air  in addition to the raises hawkers also has improved benefits such as a 401k retirement program for employees who average 20 hours per week and have been with the company for six months  hawkers also is working to focus on restaurant employee development and holding feedback sessions to consider other changes to improve the workplace spokeswoman esther mcilvain said  it was definitely a breath of fresh air coming here said 26yearold server zack tomkin who started at hawkers last year after working in restaurants since age 18  harrell believes the improvement in his companys staffing happened largely through the increased wages and competitive benefits  outside of covid this is the most important conversation weve had as a company in the last 10 years harrell said  he said while the costs from higher compensation havent been completely balanced out yet by the savings from not having to replace workers it is moving in that direction  lower turnover means the business can drop training expenses and productivity skyrockets harrell said he also pointed out the time a manager is taken away from serving guests by having to interview and onboard new employees  the restaurant chain has had minor price increases but those were based on inflation for foodstuffs and other costs harrell said  for tomkin whose wage before tips has increased to 8 an hour from about 6 the extra money helps him afford his own place after his roommate moved out the raise is especially helpful on slower days  to me it shows that they care about their employees which obviously as an employee i love tomkin said its helpful to us in just everyday life and plus things are getting more expensive just in general so of course it helps  tomkin then joked keep it coming,pqmwo8

2322,I quit my job a couple of days ago and I don't know how to feel,tdlr i quit my job to get away from my abusive and manipulating boss and i dont know how to feel about it  i keep crying over and over about it im not in financial ruin because of this thankfully but it was income that i badly needed since i am a student and trying to get away from an already bad household  i worked for a company as a marketing assistant and i was there for about a year remote in hindsight i shouldve seen the signs before i even applied my boss was extremely controlling and only had employees that were either foreign or stoners not shaming either one theyre all very talented and do not deserve to be there under her many previous employees quit and people more experienced than my boss turned down the job i have 4 years of experience in pretty much all things associated with marketing and graphic design  long story short i went through a grueling year of a lot of work one week and then only 30 mins of billable work for 2 weeks and then so on she controlled what was billable and what wasnt her business model was making you do the job the way you think it should be done she tells you youre wrong then off the clock you have to fix it i was berated if i asked a question and was guilt tripped by her saying that it comes out of her pay check if she has to answer me because she wouldnt do it on the clock i was guilt tripped over and over by her saying that x employee has something going on and they are doing better work than i am she would say that if i have to fix something or ask a question or if i have to do something for the company and i wanted to be paid for it it would come out of someone elses pay check  every week she would call and say how bad i am at my job she said it was a progress and performance check every time it was just saying how bad i am even though i did work that clients loved including a 38 slide presentation where she berated me for not adding something that no one mentioned she got on me for my emails and the order they were in and if they were in a thread or not she berated me if somethung was wrong such as with printing or shipping and i didnt know who was associated with the project or how to contact them she yelled at me for informing her that something was wrong and while she doesnt have the contact info for the person associated that i have to contact them and find the contact info without asking her i made guidelines and checklists in my off time for every single piece of work i could do and email templates for each one when she wanted me to send them to her she yelled at me for doing it on paper even though they were only for me she would tell me something and make me guess the answer ie where do you think this money comes from how do you think i will pay you why do you think i called you etc all the time and she would make me do tasks on days off and not pay me for it because it would come out of someone elses paycheck  the nail in the coffin was the call when i quit she kept talking over me and she talked for about 45 mins until i could speak i told her i was overwhelmed not by the work but because i cant ask questions and have to guess what shes thinking she said i was overwhelmed because i had too much work she said that the problem is not her its me she accused me of having a drug problem when she knows nothing about my life other than work she said i was just rebelling by telling her my reasoning for doing things the way i do in emails and im just angry at her and being a child even though its because i felt like i had to defend myself when i talked to her she said i was doing things wrong deliberately ro spite her she told me about the situations of other employees and how theyre doing better than me i told her a small part of the situations im going through right now i talked about how i asked what platform she wanted me to do invoices on and how she pays people in an email which is how we communicate and how because she refused to answer i revealed sensitive bank information that she didnt even need she said i wasnt allowed to ask questions and she doesnt have time to answer them and that in my agreement it says im not allowed to ask i looked and nowhere did it say that she said that i am easily replaceable  i told her i dont appreciate when you guilt trip me using other peoples situations i also have things going on to a similar caliber i also dont like that you put words in my mouth she yelled at me for it she said that she knows how people like me act and im just lying she said it was disrespectful of me to accuse her of guilt tripping and if i continue to rebel and have a drug problem then i shouldnt be in her team i told her then i quit   as soon as i got off the call she deleted my work email and thus all the accounts associated with it she emailed me an excel sheet to my personal email and requested my final invoice i cant even check if shes being truthful with her numbers she emailed me again basically trying to have the final word saying that its my fault and i should have done better saying that i shouldve anticipated her way of doing business  i cried hard when i got off the phone i dont have a job anymore while im trying to get away i dont sleep im eating less i hurt all over i dont have anything to do im applying for jobs like crazy  im happy that im not there but im sad that i dont have work i wish she didnt use me as a punching bag because its really taking a toll theres a lot more that she did but im really trying to forget it i hope karma gets her ass,pq6vbl

2373,Employer wants me to work for 80%,hi im fairly new to reddit this subreddit was recommended to me for advice on an issue i am currently facing at my workplace  i 27f have been working for a company for a couple of months as a parttime casual worker  i received an email from my employer stating how the company is under financial hardship as a result of another lockdown the company is now open for business again with employees hours reduced in the email they asked that i agree to receive only 80 of the hours that i work  i wasnt sure that i understood correctly and after talking to my partner and another family member about it who both agreed that it doesnt sound right i phoned one of the companys office staff  i explained that i was calling to gain a better understanding of what they were asking of me and they assured me that they were indeed asking me to agree to only receive 80 of my pay for hours that i actually work i told them that i wasnt comfortable with that to which they responded that they were disappointed in me as 90 of the other employees had agreed to this and the remaining hadnt responded yet i was caught off guard  i asked if my position will be jeopardised if i didnt agree to which they said no however it is part of working as a team they went on to explain how difficult things are at this time and suggested i find another business owner to talk to about it to maybe gain a better understanding of how hard things are right now for businesses i explained that my other employer who i also work parttime for is paying me 100 and hadnt asked this of me they ended the conversation by suggesting i call back when another office member is available to discuss it further  i have reached for out for legal advice and all have responded saying that it is immoral because if i am working i should be paid 100 for hours i have worked however my employer is within their legal right as i was given the option to agree or disagree  i feel like if i had the right to not agree to this they should have been more professional and simply respected my response accepted it and move on rather than guilt trip me  i feel like how i was treated was manipulative ill now feel uncomfortable working alongside my colleagues knowing they are working for only 80 while id be earning 100 if i agreed to this i would be earning well below minimum wage i feel it is especially an unfair request as our hours are already decreased i understand their business is struggling but everyone is struggling right now  they are receiving financial aid from our government which is supposed to assist them with their employees wages they are essentially asking us to work for free and at the same time they are receiving financial aid that they will not have to pay back  it feels unfair my manager has told i am a great worker and that they value me i know i have a lot to offer and have 9 years experience in my field  i feel insulted stressed disrespected and angry but at the same time i cant help but feel guilty  i appreciate any advice on how to go about this moving forward thank you so much for taking the time to read this,pqjmun

2377,When did companies stop accepting paychecks as a valid motivation for work?,the title may sound a bit confusing so let me explain  4 years ago i was in my high school business class  which we didnt learn personal financial management in just fyi  our teacher was giving us a lesson on how to write a resume as part of an assignment in which we had to write a resume which he would review in a fake job interview during this assignment he made it very clear to us that when an employer asks us why do you want to work for this company saying i need a paycheck to support myself and my family is taboo and simply doesnt fly and i think most working people will agree that this is true  my question is why  based on personal research it seems that back in the say1920s every company understood that money was the only valid motivation for people to work and explaining ones financial situation in a job interview was common   at some point in time however every employer decided that a good employee shouldnt be interested in the money but rather the experience of working and what services they can offer to the company instead of the other way around in the warped world view of modern ceos and store managers an employee shouldnt be motivated by their paycheck but rather the honor of working for them  this worldview is illogical sadistic fundamentally destructive and downright biohazardous and what really bugs me is how so many people simply dont question this bullshit and accept it as fact when i a young person complain about this illogical expectation from employers to my parents and grandparents im treated like a dumb kid who simply doesnt know how the world works   its like everyone agrees that working solely for a paycheck is taboo behavior but no one is able to explain why just that it is and arguing against it is wrong  so my question is when did employers start adopting this twisted worldview and why do so many people think its ok,pqce64

2421,Tricky situation with my co-worker,hello everybody before i start in i must say that this sub has been an excellent find and despite us all existing in a system we cannot stand it is of some solace that others feel the same way as myself   so a bit of backstory i work in a small team with one other person and we are both very much antiwork so generally speaking we work hard when we have to and ease up when we dont after all the reward for hard work is just more work and that is no incentive  the problem is that recently they have completely given up on work which i completely get because i feel the same way however the issue is that the vast majority if not all the work within the department is now left to me alone   i cant really be mad at them because they are doing what in an ideal world we would both be doing and dont want to come off as being a whiney arsehole but this situation is causing myself to do the work of two people for less money than they are earning   am i being an arsehole for thinking this is unfair or am i just being overly sensitive envious and resentful that they can get paid for doing very little when im picking up the slack    they often will work from home despite it being a job that the majority of which requires being physically onsite and when they are working from home all this entails is them logging on and not even checking our emails when this happens they often ask me to cover them in case management ask where they are our manager is located in another office in a different city   do you have any advice on what i should do here should i broach the subject or carry on in the hopes that they will realise that it is having a knockon effect i cant see how they arent selfaware enough to recognise that i am carrying the workload for both of us   thanks,ppwjap

2431,Not a morning person,my wife and i live on the west coast and she was just recently made an offer by a small company based on the east coast for a 100 remote position  it was a very short interview process in which they didnt ask her for her resume or any other normal type of interview questions  they kind of knew her from prior meetings from industry conferences but they have not talked to each other in over 5 years  i need to add that she has 20 years experience in her industry  she was scheduled to start this week but there were some other things that came up that delayed the start date that were completely normal    heres the wild part  during a brief phone call with one of the partners she made a comment that she is not a morning person  we have an elementary age child in which has needs every morning it seems and she mentions that there will probably be some interruptions during the 7a  9a time block as we are getting him off to school  this came about because she was inquiring how they approach their days  this benign comment has now resulted in a suspension of the offer after a meeting was setup to clarify expectations in which my wife was trying to find out what their issues were  they made the offer with the assumption that she would be expected to start at 5a pst every day as this was their primary collaboration time   they did not convey any of this in the initial interview or offer   they explained that this collaboration time is phone calls with clients and other chats  texting in which she is not expected to be an active participant  she had offered to be as flexible as possible in the early hours but currently cannot commit to zero interruptions and 100 participation in those really early morning hours and has stated that she would be most likely working til 5p pst every day   the result of the meeting was that this wasnt something they had not considered before hand and needed to speak with their partners who my wife has not interviewed with in any professional capacity  she hasnt heard back from them in two days  this whole process is so odd and i keep telling her that she is probably dodging a bullet by this falling through  how is it companies offering remote positions to people in other time zones are not accounting for the natural skew in the day when families and school age children are involved,ppq1lg

2444,"""STOP"", a letter of immediate resignation.",good afternoon all     as requested by managernamehere i was asked to explain why chose to reveal to the customers that ive interracted with in the past four days why im quitting the company and the sad state of affairs with the migration project in general    keep in mind this explanation comes hot on the heels of a very confrontational discussion with servicedeskoperationssupportmanagernamehere in which he succeeded in making me breach my contractual agreement with scc in order to leave the company as quickly as possible and ultimately absolve them of any responsibility    i feel a deep seated need to help people    whether thats due to the trauma ive suffered during my childhood with the lack of help from my neighbours when my parents were physically abusing me or because its my rationalization for the reason why i chose to stay alive on this planet    i know that life is nothing but a constant string of suffering and i would have been better off not existing    but since im here and able i chose to help people   as such when i came to scc i was overwhelmed with the access i was suddenly provided    so many people coming to me to help them    so many personalities so many individualities so many souls all of them in need of help and i just happened to be there to help them    so many opportunities to do good in this world    it was great for a while    then i discovered the ugly side of working for scc or any tech support company in general    managers that do not care about the humanitarian aspect of the interactions we have with our clients    the comfort we bring our clients the assurance that we can provide them with the assistance they so desperately crave so that they can do their work with the tools we provide support for and the joy the have in their voice when they leave satisfied at the end of the call these are all footprints to what our managers are trying to turn us into    the managers are trying to turn us into tools cold unfeeling tools in their complicated and sometimes nonexistant processes all in service of their artificial indicators of performance that have no actual meaning to us or the people that we work with    the managers want quantity without hiring more people    the managers want quality without training those people properly    the managers expect us to train ourselves while they reap the benefits of good reviews that their subordinates receive    the managers start projects that last for months maybe years and when it finally starts the project falls flat on its face causing suffering to hundreds if not thousands of our clients    the managers either know the grief that our clients communicate to us and dont care or they dont know because they dont care    and then theres the suppliers we work with they just flat out dont care    as a human being when i talk to someone on the phone i try to level with them    be straight be honest be human    ive developed this style of comunication for almost eight years and it has never been an issue up until i decided to quit scc i talk to them like a friend and i dont have any restraint i let them know that i too am a human being and that i too suffer in my continual existence but that i want to channel it into helping them suffer less    i want to make them understand the human aspect of the issue they are facing and why they are facing it as far as i understand it from my own human perspective wether or not im autorized to divulge such details has never been my priority however upon requests from management i did have to make adjustments from time to time that however relies on management being aware of my behavior in the first place which razvan grecu has confirmed that they were but as long as it produced value to the company by building trust between the service desk and the clients that we interact with they chose to let me continue    now that i want to leave that value suddently dissappeared because the precedent wont be there to maintain the level of trust    i told scc that i wanted to quit due to medical reasons as the stress ive accumulated has reached the limit of what i am capable of enduring    an enlarged liver caused in the msot part by the stress ive experienced working for scc although part of it could also be caused by my declining relationship with my parents culminating in my fathers death from heart and lung cancer this very same enlarged liver that is pressing into my rib cage reducing my lung capacity and making it difficult for me to concentrate in spite of my preexisting adhd condition    i did not at the time mention that what recently spiked this stress was my due to managernamehere repeatedly asking me to split my weekend in twain despite it being in breach of romanian law    for the sake of my sanity and for there to not be any legal repercussions i expressed my need for two days of uninterrupted rest and was repeatedly denied that opportunity during negociations finally after several discussions we reached an agreement and they dropped the subject of my working during saturday all together    i was even generous enough to suggest my departure on october 1st because i was vaguelly aware of two weeks being a courtesy again managernamehere decided to correct me by stating that i had to give them 21 work days of notice before my departure even though again its in breach of romanian law    so now out of the blue my down to earth sincere communication style with the clients about how the migrationprojectnamehere is a sad joke and how were severly understaffed and how im actually planning to leave because i cant take this anymore was brought into the spotlight why because scc wants me gone without them suffering any consequences    scc never cared about my health when i had a work accident in december of 2018 where i twisted my neck and had to wear a neck brace they shut me up they upgraded my privatehealthcareprovidernamehere plan so that i could afford to do an mri that was required for the medical investigations apparently after working for scc for almost five years at that point it hadnt earned that healthcare plan until after my injury so they could then use it as hush money    when i went to the doctor to investigate my shortness of breath in autumn of 2020 i was financially reprimanded by my manager at the time for being late even though my absence was communicated in advance and the delays present in the romanian healthcare system in particular those that exist even when having appointments were well known i wasnt even granted a full week of leave to continue my medical investigations instead being forced to accept only 3 days between november 16th and 18th resulting in me having to return to work thursday november 19th  the day after my liver problem diagnosys which coincided my own birthday all because the team that i worked for then was also severly understaffed to be able to handle my absence    ive been trying to make changes in my diet and my life style and all i needed was just some stability on behalf of my workplace instead servicedeskoperationssupportmanagernamehere  either from his own will or directed by his superiors has moved me from project to project since february of 2021 after working for project2 for three years i was moved to project3 then when the project was over back to project2 for just a couple of days before being transfered again to project4 then project5 then project6 then a bit of project7 then more project6 then a bit of project8 then a bit more project3 then more project8    i got tired of being moved around willynilly and i seized the opportunity to apply to an open position for project6 within minutes i was contacted by my project7 managernamehere about why i havent consulted him before applying a couple of days i was contacted by supervisornamehere who tried to provide a peace offer by providing a job at project9 being human and failible i accepted and in about two weeks the whole project9 went under due to lack of funding and so i returned to project7 where i continued to sit in silence without being contacted to be trained thoroughtly left to my own devices for days and days only taking stray calls from people that happened to call the service desk by accident    and then the migration project began and as you already know its a disaster    these are but a sampling of my experiences that influenced my decision to share details with the customers about the situation theyre in and how hard im trying to help them    but as a human being even i have limits and despite how much i hate that i have to do this much like a plane thats currently losing oxygen and crashing i have to put my own oxygen mask on before i help others even if the plane is going to crash anway    after my argument with servicedeskoperationssupportmanagernamehere however i decided to jump out of the plane entirely    as such please consider this my last scc comunication i will be shutting down my equipment for the last time and head towards hq to deposit my equipment    i would have liked to say that these past 7 years and eight months have been fun but scc took advantage of my addiction towards helping people and have been edging me closer and closer to this day when i finally say stop    kind regards wally hulea  project7 1st line analyst   your feedback is very important to us please share the experience you had with the service desk by filling out the survey you will receive on the closure email,pq40pr

2460,I wonder if they really believe what they say,just discovering this sub at the right time thanks for setting it up   yesterday i stumbled on yet another of those motivational quotes by some multimillionaire about the socalled price of greatness working longer hours than the average person  do these people actually believe what they say or are they parroting what they think people want to hear   first of all who defines what true greatness is is the publicly lavish billionaire lifestyle really the only approved standard of greatness what if i dont want to have a private jet guess that means i dont want to be great right   and who is an average person by the way i tend to find the very arrogance of this term both irritating and insulting   then the working longer hours mantra how does that necessarily equate to a successful life this is assuming we even have a uniform standard for what qualifies to be a successful life  arent there also some other things ill need to do with my time apart from work ah i guess that calls for some more sacrifice and hustle and grind  wasnt it just tiring to read that   they are just so many assumptions and clichs tossed around as advice that dont seem to be well thought through and these life tips end up working so many people to the bone   thanks again for setting up this sub now i got that off my chest,ppq5xr

2472,Let's Solve the Problem,often i catch myself thinking that people should get paid the same amount per hour for whatever job they do  but then what about jobs that require learning certain skills beforehand should those jobs not be higher paid and what about jobs that put your health at risk  here is a partial solution in the hopes we can rally together with more ideas  1 pay everyone the exact same hourly rate no matter what their job this probably would vary country to country but should be the same for all jobs within the country this should be a livable wage that is key  2 reimburse employees for training they have done beforehand that is integral to the job until they have received full reimbursement so if they switch employers in the same field they dont get reimbursed for anything the original employer has already paid something like if its your first job after a specific bit of training for 5 years you get an annual bonus equal to 20 of what it cost you to train spreading it out should mean its less of a hassle for employers and gives employees an incentive to stay for 5yrs  3 any training required after an employee gets the job should be paid for completely by the company  4 add an extra hourly supplement for any jobs that are dangerous to employees health eg waste disposal or that are deemed to take an unusual toll on employees either physically eg manual labour or emotionally eg medical professions  5 bonuses to reward employees for going above and beyond are still fine as is overtime pay etc all companies should offer the same hourly rate for overtime pay with any other additions ive mentioned  what have i not yet mentioned should there still be variations in the amount of tax people pay  obvs cant be income based maybe get a tax break for a certain amount of time if you have children to look after,pq2yr9

to interact with them nor are they made to they just hire disabled people exploit them and get super rich off of selling donated goods they didnt even pay to get all while telling the populace that its for a good cause a cause they dont even truly care about we all made minimum wage and werent even called employees they called us clients despite our biweekly pay while boss man got to go camping at the florida keys every year you better believe theyre fighting to keep their right to pay subminimum wage at their other facilities signs and chanting and everything     over the course of a bakers dozen years i did a lot of things for these people i suppose i was stupid at first and bought into the hype of having a job authored their facebook provided excellent customer service kinda became lowkey famous around the small town this all took place in because everyone liked how i did things and kept wanting to ask the secret to my success and such even very smart people were mistaking me as one of the managers i was a superstar     boss man was not that never sat well with him he didnt like being upstaged by an autistic guy then again hes a pretty insecure dude anyhow constant pathological lying never honest about his emotions or much of anything really anger issues well those anger issues started spiraling out of control hed start yelling and screaming at the handicapped employees in public it would wind up in situations where id just be standing there with a customer at the jewelry case and sure enough hes on a ladder looking down at another employee screaming like no dont tell me what the rules are i make the rules here hey were not done get back here ill tell you when were done and me and this other customer are just awkwardly watching this whole thing he also seemed to love chasing people out of the store especially during mask mandate season when he would just march up to people asking them if they had masks with them and practically glower at them and lean forward while stepping closer to them until they left one time a dude just casually mentioned that i must be the one operating the facebook boss man took that personally and widened his eyes and raised his voice going hes a cashier and leaned forward and stepped slowly towards the dude dudes like i was just saying and he got cut off by boss man again yelling hes a cashier as he stepped towards him some more eyes still widened dude has issues     as it would go on over the next several months boss man would just get worse hed come into work clearly upset about something dragging his anger around becoming more and more dismissive in his responses to jokes or much of anything really ruined the atmosphere kept yelling and screaming at other employees eventually i cracked and i wanted something done about it i reported to his manager the executive director aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they fired me for wanting him to be held accountable for his actions they said well you dont respect the hierarchy around here and you dont seem to be happy unfortunately we have to terminate your employment boss man then screamed at me more right in front of the executive director called me silly for trying to speak and explain my story and then chased me out the back door and shut the door behind me he clearly enjoyed this     ive tried to find work elsewhere its been about a month and a half towns been crying about the labor shortage pizza hut and such cant stay open because they cant get staff to work and such a brand new simonsons gas station opened its doors i put my applications in and pretty much nothing one grocery store offered me the job but they also offered way too many hours and wanted me to work nights and such and well thats a no especially with my social security i cant make too much money other grocery store did an interview and said no walgreens didnt even interview they just said no other places didnt even call back over a dozen years of relevent experience and thats not good enough for them but youd better believe theyre still on about how nobody wants to work as they continue to cry about the labor shortage     so for right now anyway i am part of the great resignation ive stopped looking for work ive got my social security checks so im not incomeless i just have a hard time getting out there and doing something and meeting people but im not incomeless and if theyre gonna be that exclusionary about stuff in their hiring practice then honestly i have no sympathy for them and their labor shortage plus with covid still

2554,So I think I might be quitting soon...,tldr either im working from home or im working for someone else        not sure if this is the right place for this not sure if anywhere is  so at my workplace weve been working from home since march 2020 uninterrupted the whole initiative was done at the drop of a hat we literally manhandled our ratty old tower pcs and monitors into our cars those that had them anyways and drove home this was at 3pm that day we were expected to be online and logged in by 4pm to finish the day as normal by 5pm  i mention this not to garner sympathy but to give you a hint as to the kind of company this is  they sat on their asses and did nothing for the six weeks running up to the first lockdown in the uk and suddenly it was our responsibility to make sure we didnt miss a single picosecond of work that arose from their mandates  my manager saw me struggling with a monitor under each arm and said to me dont you want to take your loose paperwork folder said folder was a collection of needlessly printedoff versions of documents that were saved on our internal servers and backed up in germany their ultimate fate was to be filed in a cupboard somewhere never to be seen again how do i know that in the 18odd months since nobody has asked about them  he helped me tuck the folder in with one of the monitors under my left arm and sent me on my way  theyve been in a bag under the stairs since that day  in the first two months i filled up my cars petrol tank exactly once i did the same work to the same standard to the same timeframe i just woke up an hour later shared a cup of coffee and some conversation with my partner and logged in from the box roomoffice  some have no doubt had some very negative experiences in lockdown but i dont count myself among them with the money we saved over that time weve cobbled together enough for a house deposit on a wonderful home that we now own with the time weve saved on commutes weve cooked better more intricate meals with the mental energy ive saved ive connected with my friends and family  when i was in the office i took two diazepam a day and periodically excused myself to find a quiet toilet to vomit into the anxiety i felt there was a palpable oppressive force that was beginning to physically rot me from the inside out  some might consider me weak and unsuited to living in the real world because of my failure to control that fear and selfloathing sometimes i think that myself  either way i mention it only to say that my time working from home is peaceful i can be nervous or melancholic or happy or socially catatonic i can care for myself and for my partner i can protect us from an outside world that seems to actively take pleasure in harming us  so naturally my workplace said a few weeks back that they want all of us back at our desks by the end of september  why they havent told us why scuttlebutt from the more sympathetic among management hints that the upper crust of the company want us there because they just want us there  no financial reason we know weve been bringing in more money for the company than we were at the office  we were told by our direct manager that no flexible working arrangements would be considered for anyone in our team incidentally we are the lowest paid team in the building if that surprises anyone  a colleague pipes up shes looking after her very sickly mother who can no longer care for herself can she have any degree of flexible working  no  another speaks shes very ill with longcovid her mother died of it and shes immunocompromised can she have any degree of flexible working  no  the call was ended and that was that  i promise it isnt all doom and gloom though  see in the uk if youve worked at a company for more than two years you gain a greater degree of workplace protection you can make an official flexible working request and the company is legally compelled to give you a hearing  they have to sit in front of you and physically tell you why you cant work from home why it isnt at all possible  without so much as a single shared word between us every single member of our team made a flexible working request that very day we heard that there were dozens of other requests made across other teams and locations at the same time  as of today the return to the office has been officially postponed for at least a month while they assess the situation  the email from the director says theyre waiting for government guidelines managers say theyve received such an influx of fwrs that the hr team will need the extra month just to work through them all  frankly as heartening as it was to see the entire company convulse in panic at the actions of the plebes at its base i dont realistically think it will change anyones mind  i think theyll spend the next few weeks desperately contriving a reason to say no that wont pose some legal threat to them  i think theyll devote every neuron to the task of getting us back into that hateful asbestosfilled cube  if they tell me that they cant offer the option of working from home im quitting  right then and there  i thought id be more frightened but honestly i feel relief  i play the conversation out in my head whenever i need to cheer myself up  ill work my notice from home if not come collect your shit ive left it in the car park,ppkcsr

2572,My American Work Story (TLDR version),i am not a capitalist but for a long time i have been in a variety of roles that defend the interest of capital    for those of you in the true working class youve likely interacted with me or somebody like me during your time in the workforce and probably muttered fuck you under your breath as i walked away  this story is for you  if youre like me a member of the professional managerial class then perhaps parts of my story might sound familiar  im the dipshit from the office upstairs who slaps bandaids on barely functioning machinery just to get a shipment out of the door  that work order youve been sweating on for half the day to throw away a bunch of shit that looks perfectly fine  i am the dude who does the math on when it becomes profitable to landfill literal miles of good materials  ive been there with a stopwatch timing you and your partner on your tasks so that management can decide if one of you is unnecessary  capitalism produces innovation they say  i was wellpaid to develop a product that closely mimicked a competitors patent claims but legally fell outside their description of its construction  we then turned around and made the market even less competitive by rolling out our own patent  it wasnt some big event like the loss of a job that woke me up to what i was doing  i had always considered myself liberal but becoming a leftist came from my observations in the workforce  a coworker who was chronically late because he was caring for a sick relative got let go when hr audited attendance and found out local management was covering for him  workers with 10 20 30 years of experience and loyalty were shown the door under pandemic costcutting measures  a foreman was abusing his power and influence to sleep with his direct reports on the shop floor  truck drivers were forced to pencil whip their logs to get to the next job those who refused were put through progressive discipline and fired  the list goes on and on and despite all of this casual cruelty the same people were always stepping out of the same luxury vehicles into the same plush lifeless offices clothed in the same designer workwear and clutching the same posh leather messenger bags with the same question what have you done for me lately  in my view things are the way that they are because the working class has been successfully divided  people like me have been deluded into thinking that because they are elevated above their peers in terms of pay benefits worklife balance workplace status etc the system is working for them  nothing could be further from the truth in my view  stratifying the workplace like this is by design not accident and the resentment it causes keeps labor from unifying to demand its fair share of the pie  things are not going well in the world right now and i see a lot of posts asking what can i do  i think that every persons situation is different but in general you need to figure out what small actions you can take to be in solidarity with your fellow workers  support unions and strike efforts  dont be a scab  identify and shut down procapitalist propaganda its subtle and theres a lot of it on reddit  for my part its been nearly a year since a combination of boredom apathy and disgust caused me to step away from what i was doing and critically examine my life  i am privileged to be able to do this  i am not sure what is next  i dont have infinite resources and at some point i will need to work again  as somebody without a house kids debt or many real obligations i think the best way i can help to change things is to take a servicesector or manufacturing job and start trying to agitate for worker rights  what do you think reddit  i want to hear your stories,ppja6z

2598,My resignation,i was working as a customer support agent for way over a year most of it was wfh due to the pandemic situation the contract that i had signed was 20100 and at the interview i noticed this and asked about it oh yeah the contract is like that but its gonna be very much to do hehe and i just signed it the job drained my mental health severely i hated every second of every day sitting in front of that computer in the corner of my apartment answering call after call after call  about half a year into my employment they started slashing all of our hours probably less calls due to the pandemic the slashes did however lead to even more workload for the ones who were working making me and others take out sick leave several times because of the severe workload and stress  one day we got an internal email from the ceo he was thanking us for our hard work and goes on to ramble about his intentions with the company that we are going to become the national leader in the business and similar stuff that literally nobody cares about and at the end of the email was a photo of him literally standing on his yacht in the sun this is where i got angsty  they eventually bumped our hours back up again but the workload for every person was still as high as during the cut period more calls i suppose this was very provoking they clearly couldve spared our mental health a little bit by allowing more to answer calls instead of trying to squeeze as much as possible out of a few out of greed i was getting even more angsty stopped caring about my call time requirements and just started taking my time with the calls i figured theyre not going to fire me anyways this business sucks and nobody wants to work there super high turnover  i got a few calls from a team leader who asked me to step up my speed a little no i said i feel awful when i stress so im going to keep it like this they can fire me if they aren not okay with me not stressing my ass off just to be on peak performance performance nothing happened just like i predicted so i kept taking my time and never stressed with anything  the team leaders eventually started asking my teammates on a short notice if we want to take extra hours or days because the line really needs you guys right now oh so now its okay to give us work i just said no im good i wanted to quit when supposed to just chill and hit the gym spend time with my partner i kept doing my thing in my own pace but a few weeks in i decided to find my way out i cant work for a company i dont respect  one week was hellish a lot of calls and the line was suffering i went to my boss and asked her if i can go home because i dont like the stress levels today i was declined so i leaved my resignation notice 2 weeks its in the contract too and then i went back and worked and eventually left  now im thankful to live in a european country that wont let their citizens starve or be homeless ive been living on benefits now and its actually quite okay i got only 30 more when i worked than what i get now when i spent 40 hours a week feeling like a complete fucking disaster its an okay life for now if youre mad now reading about this i want you to understand that its part of my point turn that frustration into something good go out and protest demand your rights give minimum effort for minimum wage dont buy their luxury products we dont need em keep posting memes stories and twitter screenshots on here this sub has had a major impact on my thoughts along with rlatestagecapitalism rminimalism and rlostgeneration  its time for me to head to bed but i wish nothing but the best to every single one who discovers this post,ppl4xl

2623,Having a job vs. Traditional Slavery - A few thoughts on the matter:,slavery you have to work to be allowed to live or avoid being beaten up as punishments and your slave master will give you food and shelter in exchange for your labor you also likely live pretty much where you work no commute to worry about at least  having a job you have to work to be allowed to live but you also have to figure out buying food and finding affordable shelter yourself with the money afforded to you by your employer in exchange for your many hours of labor and you have to get to and from there and spend time and money and effort to deal with all that  in some ways being a slave is advantageous at least you dont have to waste time hunting for an apartment or going food shopping and paying a bunch of bills etc those basics would all be taken care of by your slave master   to just pay workers a minimum wage and then have the workers figure everything out themselves in terms of basic sustenance and housing  is almost easier than to actually have to take care of all that for the slaves that are working for you   maybe in certain basic areas we are in fact less free than slaves because we have to deal with a bunch of annoying stressful side hassle that a slave would simply be given outright in exchange for their forced labor  the labor for income paradigm is just a convoluted and messy way organizing this basic premise work or starve  slavery is at least more direct and honest about that  ampx200b  whats the difference between a full time prison guard and someone in prison   the prisoner doesnt have to pay a mortgage or rent and have to deal with the hassle of daily commuting,ppk227

2625,Walked out and now they’re holding back my paycheck, the title says it how it is i quit my retail job last week after my management pulled the last straw i started this job a few months ago and didnt mind it much as i was able to mostly keep to myself and managed a lot of productivity the downside of working independently was i got little to no training or guidance from managers i thought i could handle it for a few months until i relocate but then i started realizing how disorganized and unprofessional management at the store is most of the managers were buddy buddy with each other which is great and all but when employees approached them for guidance their demeanor immediately changed they expected 110 from their employees yet had practically no idea what they were doing when it came down to actually performing their tasks i would be scolded for not throwing out a small area of trash i was not ordered to do before leaving 30 minutes after i was supposed to clock out only to watch the same manager who scolded me turn around and leave a table full of trash for me when he clocked out anyways incidences like these continued to turn me off of the job until one day the store manager walks into the area where i was working alone and snaps at me over having an ear bud in and told me i wasnt working hard enough this was never something i was told not to do and in fact was encouraged by numerous other managers to have it on me in case they contacted me through the walkietalkie system i decided then that i was not interested in being in such a disorganized working environment while being held to such an insanely high standard for a minimum wage paycheck i did not announce my departure to any managers as i did not see any for the rest of my shift and did not return for my next shift and was not contacted by anyone from the store since fast forward a bit and the day my last paycheck is due to arrive comes and i check my bank account to see that my paycheck has been reversed  upon researching online i found out that i am apparently supposed to go back to the store to collect my last paycheck so they can perform an exit interview im very upset because i was never informed about this policy during my time working there and i am dreading going back to that store if anyone has any advice id really appreciate it,ppis6r

2627,I quit the job I thought I always wanted after 6 weeks.,i was offered wfh initially i thought it might be good to go into the office for a week to learn some things however after that wfh was off the table if ever i wanted to wfh it was considered a day off even with covid symptoms i was asked to go in i was quizzed and pressed for 2 hours on where to get an urgent test telling me to go in then telling me to go home when im on my way in then telling me to go back into the office when im home when i dared wfh another time i took a shit and didnt take my work laptop with me some guy that was supposed to be my colleague but was the ex manager and bitter about it this guy started accusing me of being untrustworthy asking where the hell i was shouting at me to go straight back to my laptop and trying to investigate every little thing id done that day whether id actually had permission to wfh i did he also knew i did when he realised i didnt do anything wrong he reported me to my actual manager saying i was away for 30 minutes it was half that time i quit the same day that bullshit daily the rushed training where they basically told me the answers to the exam to rush me into it so they could give me the biggest workload for my training god forbid i get anything wrong though taking work home a flexible hours system where you can only build up time for 2 weeks until it stops but you have to give a weeks notice to actually use it and having to have multiple perfect suits shirts ties and shoes was absolutely not worth the dogshit 1050 an hour they had the audacity to offer thats not even getting into the actual job requirements   i never loved the idea of the job but i thought id be good at it and i could just get on it ended up being the opposite of what i wanted i dont have the patience for this bullshit anymore   ive gone through thinking im just being unreasonable that i was lazy that normal work is like this and i should get used to it but i cant if normal work is like this id rather be lazy than live and present myself like im a fucking attorney on less than 2 above minimum wage per hour,ppcetm

2629,Annual leave/sick leave,am i the only one questioning annual leave and sick leave in australia for example why is it that sick leave is only conditioned for 10 days  some people may get sick for 2 weeks or even up to a month and that may even eat up your annual leave such that you will have no holidaysbreak however i was told that a business still needs to run  ok and an employees health doesnt matter  i get the sentiment that these rules are there so that workers dont come and go whenever they want but that doesnt take into account of how healthy an individual is  we are just assuming that they are very fit for work that they can only be sick for 10 days throughout the year   this brings back to how we feel that we need to commit to the company 247 since our lives revolve around work at this point we have no time for anything outside of it,ppkr14

2635,Has any job you've worked for not had a toxic work environment?,i got a job as a receptionist in a medical office right out of university the first day i wasnt greeted kindly and without any training put right into intake where i was expected to greet the arriving patients and check them into the office so the doctor could see them and know what they were there for i was responsible for this first contact with the patients but i had no idea how to use their computer systems and fumbled a lot its a lot of pressure when youre trying to learn a confusing system with a person staring at you waiting to be told they can go and sit down since i didnt have proper training or any i made mistakes my coworkers would get very angry and mouthy with me about the mistakes i was making we are so busy and understaffed we cant deal with mistakes they would say  so i tried to learn as quickly as possible the office was very busy since 8 different doctors worked there and we were severely understaffed each doctor also required some differences in how the patients were check in which was really confusing once i got the hang of how to check patients in i had to learn all the little quirks and desires of each individual doctor i know you usually do this but dr blank wants us to do this instead its not that hard ok   i had been hired along with another woman who was performing the same tasks as i she was clearly overwhelmed and made a pretty severe mistake that was socially and professionally unacceptable but understandable considering no one told us about the proper thing to do within that specific and important situation despite our shortstaffed situation she was fired that evening in a very loud and dramatic way by the manager they had a shouting match and the manager said to her you are completely replaceable we dont need you   after this mistreatment of my coworker i was given a 1 raise as i was getting my extra 1 an hour the manager was acting like it was this huge deal and that i should be grateful for it i am very impressed with you she said keep up the good work now i was the only one who was doing intake and it was very overwhelming since all my other coworkers were too busy to answer my questions and treated me like i was bothering them if i tried to get their input no one was training me  additionally the working environment was very toxic my coworkers were overworked and always angry and moody they would constantly remind me that i was replaceable and mock mistakes i made they would lecture me about things and when i asked if i was getting lectured because i was doing it wrong or because they were just reminding me they would say things like well im just reminding everyone you havent done it wrong yet it was like they didnt trust me to be a functioning professional person i locked myself in the bathroom on many occasions and cried because i was so overwhelmed but i didnt know what i could do since i really needed the money  the nail in the coffin for me was how they expected us to do overtime in the interview i was told that they would sometimes require overtime but after i was hired i was told i shouldnt make any plans after my shift ended because sometimes the doctors appointments ran late and if patients were still there i couldnt leave this made my social and homelife super challenging since overtime happened nearly every day and i was already working a solid 40 hours a week i typically worked an extra 6 hours a week if not more i was told to not log my overtime hours while at work apparently that looked bad and i that i should only log them after i got home so more time i was expected to devote to this company  for instance they would schedule me till 7pm but i would usually not leave the office till about 8309 and then i would be scheduled to open the office the next morning at 7am sharp you have to pay your dos they told me i had to cancel plans with friends and family because i was always working long hours and i never had time to shop for groceries clean my house or anything else we need to do in order to you know live  the doctors at the office were also completely awful to me they were entitled and really rude in addition to intake of patients i was also expected to get the doctors exam rooms ready for their visits with the patients if i was lucky id get to this task before the patient was in the room but sometimes i would be cleaning and preparing the room while someone watched me it made me uncomfortable  one time i made a mistake but it wasnt really a mistake because the information hadnt been communicated to me i was supposed to type the doctors user names into the computer in the exam rooms so all the doctor had to do when they got into the exam room was type in their password i typed one doctors username incorrectly and he chewed me out for it in front of a patient he called me names and told me it wasnt that hard to get it right ok it was super condescending and i could tell he enjoyed mocking and belittling me in front of someone the patient came to me after and apologized on the doctors behalf that was really rude and im sorry he spoke to you like that she said  i was so burnt out after working there for only a few months but thats when they started to add more tasks to my day because people were quitting surprise right  they treated their staff like shit had no respect for our personal lives and because the pay was decent thought they could just hire new people if we left i quit before my 3 month period was up i was completely fed up with being treated so poorly by everyone at the office there was no kindness the patients suffered long wait times and rude receptionists because we had so much work to do and working in around medicine is a highpressure job there are so many other awful things that happened but in order to address them all id need to write an entire fing novel  this was one of the worst offices i worked for but every other office i worked for had similarities to this one and i was miserable at each job everyone was understaffed overworked and expected to do overtime to make up for the short staffing situation for context we needed 8 receptionists to keep the office running smoothly but only had 4 or 5  ampx200b  tldr i worked in a very toxic office where i wasnt trained was belittled and mocked for making mistakes and forced to work long hours with so much overtime i couldnt plan my life around my work,ppjjdz

2637,IMO modern corporations are just mlm schemes with extra steps,with corporate money continually suppressing unions and other forms of worker rights it seems to me that the corporation is just a form of exploitation like the mlm where there is an inverse relationship between labor and profit people with boots on the ground do the dirty work only to have the fruits of their labor be swiped up by some fatcat whose only labor consists of maybe a few meetings and schmoozing at a golf match or something without worker rights whats the difference between that and an mlm where you just continually offset the labor downwards ad infinitum,pourx7

They can fuck off.,20 an hour 5 weeks paid vacation  tension plan to tension plan doesnt have to struggle to get by buying food or clothes     luchageaileag  his isnt because larger king is nicer in denmark its the law and the of is actually the only socalled developed country that doesnt mandate jobs provide a minimum amount of paid vacation sick leave or both  of stowentoners  kind bunks that claim that they cant afford to pay their workers those sort of wages and still make a profit  of meiaiinck  its corporate greed plain and simple  of wrrropecuntrencion  otis the same in sweden otis so funny every time an american company opens up offices here and then tries to do it the american way and all the unions go i dont think so  like when boys r is opened in sweden 1995  they refused to sign on to the union deals that govern such things as paypension and vacation in sweden most of our rights are not mandate by law we dont have a minimum wage for example but are made in voluntary agreements between the unions and the companies  but they refused saying that they had never negotiated with any unions anywhere else in the world and werent planning to do it in sweden either  of course a lot of people thought it was useless fighting against an international giant but candles the store workers union said that they could not budge because that might mean that the whole swedish model might rumble to they went on strike in the three stores that the company had opened so far  due a shitstorm from the press and from right wing politicians but the members were all for it and other unions started doing sympathy actions the teamster refused to deliver goods to their stores the financial unions blockaded all economical transactions regarding boys r is and the strike got strong international support as well especially in the of  in the end boys r is caved in signed the union deal and thus their employees got the same treatment as swedish store workers everywhere  the right to be treated as bloody human beings and not disposal cogs in a machine  5 peter and that story right there is exactly why republicans in the of work so  hard to bust unions its because unionizing works and theyre terrified of workers actually having some power ,por33o

2664,I feel lost,this time three months ago i finally felt like i had a purpose in this world before that id vaguely settled on something in psychology but i was struggling with balancing college and an overbearing work environment but then i moved got a job i actually believed in for the first time and thought life had finally started to make a bit of sense and no the job didnt screw me over my manager was incredibly helpful my coworkers were great and the environment was fine if a bit stressful at times just due to the nature of it all but i left the company after a month for context i worked in the residence at a facility caring for kids with special needs many of whom had trouble caring for themselves in even the most basic of capacities the problem as i discovered was that kids who are nonverbal or semiverbal develop different and sometimes complex cues for someone who already struggles with social cues that quickly became an issue i cant point to a singular thing that went wrong and obviously due to confidentiality rules i have to be somewhat vague but i can say that despite trying my best i would sometimes misread situations and spent minutes on end responding to the wrong problems or id be too slow on the uptake prior to one of them getting upset and lashing out and so it was kind of agreed upon mutually that it was best if i tried to find a different line of work but that if a position opened up at the facility in a less handson division the door would be left open to me   the long and the short of it is that i suspect although i cant be sure because its incredibly difficult and expensive to get a diagnosis for it as an adult that i may have some less severe form of autism that has put a stop to my life because its forced me to reconsider how i approach the world why i chose the path i chose and where i go from there and the answer ive come to at the end of it all is simply that i dont know i dont know what i want to do with my life i dont even know what i can do droning repetetive tasks understimulate and bore me manual labor quickly aggrivates my back which thanks to a fun birth defect is missing a vertibrae meaning its a touch misshapen and very prone to pain im too honest for sales work blood and guts and bodies gross me out so i cant be a doctor and as im learning with my foray into clerical work i find office life incredibly painful and tedious   i feel lost i have no direction my most stable employment in the last two months has been a tenday receptionist gig that leaves me with little to do but wallow in silence and selfhatred all day until the phone rings and interrupts the tedium for one or two minutes at a time i dont care about enjoying work anymore i just want something that doesnt leave me walking away every day with nothing more than an aching spine and a deep desire to simply not wake up the next day i came so tantalizingly close to having that once and now that its gone i just feel lost and empty again maybe even more so because i know now what its like to have that sense of purpose and direction,pp1ls5

2715,The pitfalls of an Employee Stock Ownership Plan,i read another posters tale of working at an esop so i thought i would share mine ops story seemed to turn out well mine is the other kind  for a bit of background an esop is billed as a form of employee ownership i imagine it to be what happens when a pension and a 401k have a baby the company takes revenue and puts it into a pool which is split up into shares if an employee meets certain criteria hours worked etc they are issued shares of stock from this pool every year a 3rd party auditor looks over the books and issues a stock price the stock is payed out when an employee leaves or retires for taxfinancial purposes it has rules similar to money placed in a 401kira  the company i worked for exists in a highly regulated industry with massive barriers to entry the license to operate is a license to print money the original owners wanted to offload the business after a making a killing for about 2 decades they had a rather inflated asking price and couldnt find anyone interested  what to do enter the general manager the employees can purchase the company from us at our inflated price the og owners floated debt to the company to facilitate the sale wait thats robbing peter to pay paul   au contraire the general managers first step sell off all of the companys physical assets to pay off a large portion of the debt after all the license to operate is the only thing of real value the assets were sold for just under 50 of the sale value this is important since esop regulations stipulate that employees get to vote on certain decisions one of them being a sale of the majority of the business or its assets whew just skirted that line   the gms next step move the companys headquaters to a strip mall 15 minutes down the road after all i own a vacant strip mall the employees can pay my mortgage plus its in another state oh the layers of obfuscation  what else can i do hey i have a friend in finance we can transfer all of our 401k business to them the finance friends spouse also just so happened to be working in the accounting department of our company  whats that you say gm a quasi competitor in the local area is looking to buy our company they are backed by a billionaire the sale is contingent on certain legislation passing i dont know what contingent means but shit that sounds great company stock to the moon  hey where are you going gm you got appointed to a respectable position in the judiciary fuckin a cashed out that company stock good on ya i heard the legislation passed bring on the gravy train with biscuit wheels  and then it all fell apart the sale fell apart the company stock crashed people with five figure account balances were down to a grand classic pump and dump classic  the business still exists the former gm is still wearing a robe hopefully the litigation will show him to have no clothes none of it will make up for the hundreds of employees who had the wool pulled over their eyes and the carpet yanked out from under them  thanks to my antiwork tendencies i left the company before things fell apart and recieved the precrash stock price chock one up for the bums baby,pp8zpt

2785,So I quit my job after two days.... boss had high expectations and expected me to master many things within a day and got so sick within the second day and feel id rather die than go back. She wanted to give me a second chance because she was i saw nervous. Still couldnt bear to go back,i honestly feel id rather die than go back another day i tried to try out a dental receptionist job but i unknowingly also had to work as a dental assistant nowhere in her job posting did it say this was also a dental assistant job or in the interview if i knew i also had to do dental assistant i would have not accepted this job the job posting just said receptionistadministrative assistant  i really wanted to make my own money so i let my determination over ride my anxiety that all changed within the second day this was my first job too so i know nothing of the work place stuff or how it generally goes i i naively thought i would get more training but the first day i come in i only had 17 minutes of her teaching me the basics of how to log in and overview of the software and the patient informationscheduling then she just did some on the job training that day was not so bad but i did see a look of like uncertainty on her face few times she did not have the proper time to train me because she is too busy doing her job and no one else works there   but my second day was hell i will not be returning i go in i see her i remember to take out the laptop to clock in and she refreshes me on some things i still have trouble remembering all the stuff she told me i didnt have note paper on me and my memory is not so good and it was a lot of stuff to take in and to remember i forget how to schedule a patient for an appointment and how to postadd accounts i just learned that yesterday and where to click for each week to assign someone how to move them and much more and had to ask her how to do it again  a patient asked if he could email me about something and i felt embarrassed and had to be honest and tell him that i was sorry and how i am new and how i dont know the systems work yet but told him he could notify the dentist about it ugh im stupid and felt bad i was not more helpful to him but he was nice and still thanked me anyway  then after he left she told me oh you do not have enough experience for this job how old are you maybe you can try to find retail work to gain more experience  i never had experience as a receptionist or working in a dental office she knew that and said she would train me i i nodded and agreed and understood that i may not be right for this position and thanked her for letting me try out i was not sure if i could leave so i had stayed due to frozen shock i was fighting back tears while trying to figure out how to use the software i told her earlier if i could download the program at home and i could practice it and she like was no  she saw i was nervous and told me dont be nervous i will try to keep you stop apologizing we are in a very small space and we bump into each other frequently she is my only co worker then she wanted me to follow her around everywhere and help throw out the garbage sterilize her tools disinfect each chair each patient leaves  bring gloves and her tools to her when each patient comes then i had to run back when i saw a patient come in and had to learn how to add their accountsprocessing their insurance all at once i was stressed the eff out   even though this position was only 2 or 3 days week the thought of just going one more time makes me want to vomit  and whenever i finished trying to schedule patients and couldnt have time to try to learn and practice as i go i had to do each task as quick as i could i would got confused so much that i got a horrible headache   i got confused by her instructions because first she would tell me dont throw anything out without telling her but then when she called me to just to watch her doing stuff then told me you could have thrown something out but i didnt because i was not sure what to throw out and didnt want to stress her more she told me to bring her instruments and i didnt recognize the name because she didnt tell me the name of the instrument so i had to go back to ask her then go back to the reception area than go back again i was so stressed out i forget to go back some timehttpsoldredditcomhelpcontentpolicyutmsourceredditamputmmediumusertextamputmnameantiworkamputmcontentt52y77ds after i finished scheduling patients  then the payment machine she used was complicated and the portable charge to insert the card was on low battery so we had to enter it manually the patients were getting impatient and gave each other a look which was so triggering and them tapping ugh i was freaking out and they were staring at me i also was supposed to turn on the tablet at the beginning and she told me she had to do everything manually because i did not turn it on and looked annoyed after saying it   she told me i dont have to come tomorrow or wednesday i just work two or three days a week depending because less people not much work but i feel it would be even better to go on days which is not so busy to get much practice and learningtraining as possible rather than just going on the busiest days  id rather just not come at all besides very uncomfortable environment extremely small space constantly bumping into each other resentment is only going to build between us i think  what a nightmare  she looked so stressed out and disappointed i told her again before leaving i am sorry for stressing you i may not be a good fit for this position as i lack experience and she yeah but dont be sorry she tells me come friday and she will see what she will do with me  i see she tried her best to best nice and patient but im clearly not the right candiate for her i almost find it crazy she still was willing to try me out  maybe desperate for staff or im a placeholder until someone else comes along  i will not be going back doing two jobs reception and dental assistant is also too overwhelming for me  this job really is not for me at all im just going to try to do a side gig t i feel so sick just thinking about the place her other receptionist at her other location textedcalled asking if i could come on friday but i had to tell her that unfortunately i quit due to my lack of experience and feel a better suited candidate would be better for this role the receptionist sounded sad    maybe im just stupid lazy had high expectations myself  but i think i need to work on my mental health first before trying work again,poo4c3
2786,"""How much would you like to earn?""",i always feel tricked when asked this question at both my previous jobs i got  1150 net for working part time i have a masters and i have a couple of years of experience why do i feel like this is far too little today i applied for a new part time job and they asked me what i wanted to earn i said i wasnt certain what the average salary is for that position instead of helping me they said well you must have some kind of life standard its nice they said that but honestly if it was for my life standard id like to earn 1600 even for a part time cause i hate work and i wanna live like a normal human being and make twice as much as i do compared to sitting at home unemployed but why do i feel like even asking for 1300 or 1400 is too much would it be i have no idea and i feel like i played myself by saying 1200 thats below the poverty line for anyone who works full time,pom7xv

2789,I just have no words with this one,i started a new job three weeks ago not bad pay but there is alot of red flags and i mean like a mountain there was the general lack of communication between everyone we were suppose to train on the floor then we werent then we were told three different times for break trainers not showing up to do training  not caring if employees wear masks are vaccinated wear their ppe even though we make prescription drugs so someone could come in cough on their hands touch the pills and give your poor grandma covid while she is just trying to take her daily meds   but today honestly just shocked the hell out of me i had a meet and greet lunch with the leaders i will be working alongside it was nice and fun at first then came the comments first was the anti vax and mask comments which granted i thought would be coming so not so bad especially loved the defending trump and saying he wasnt an anti vaxxer himself  then was the ageist comments oh the reason we cant keep any employees is because millennials and gen xers dont want to work they just want to live off the government  and the final giant flag the giant racist comments oh we all know that muslims just care about being able to marry their child brides and wipe with their hands instead of actual making something of themselves the sikh are basically just the same i even asked the security guard what he was the other day but even he doesnt know what he is so guess it doesnt matter on that one  i mean even if you are racist stupid etc you think they would at least have the professionalism to not say that moronic crap at your job and in front of new team leads but i guess not if they say this type of stuff in front of everyone im not surprised they cant keep people,pogl1d

2809,"As simple as you can break it down, it still makes no sense.",i dont have money i need money to survive how do i get money work for someone who has money but how did they get money   if we assume this is the case for most people where does the money which we work for come from   if i live on my own like i have been for years paying my own rent and bills with no help whatsoever poor family i cant possibly save enough to start a business or invest in lucrative capital im lucky not to have kids or simply surviving would be more challenging   sure some folks live at home with parents to save money but what if we have no parents what if our parents have no home themselves   the missing variable here seems to be familial wealth it doesnt have to be a trumplike empire but even simply coming from an owned home andor somewhat functional family make a huge difference in ones personal struggle   do you think the sons of slave owners were working the fields but how did the slave owner come into their fields were they likely owned by the slave owners fathers father before him well how did the slave owners ancestor come into owning that land if most of us americans came from european lineage was this man part of or at least on good terms with royalty sent to help colonize the new land if so how is this different from feudalism   actuallyit makes more sense now,pom2d5

2829,How my former company turned a workaholic into somebody who couldn’t give a fuck,  i have the typical bullshit that i know most people here would enjoy so if you like to secondhand rage at someone elses shitty work experience look no further  i should start with the fact that ive been working since before high school every summer and spring break i would always spend a good chunk of it working for my dad when i was 18 i started a part time job at a big blue box retail store and i do have to say that the experience was generally positive for me as i got to hone my people skills as a salesperson after being a socially awkward penguin for a few years and i have to say i actually really enjoyed that aspect of it if youve ever worked retails or sales youve probably had customer satisfaction surveys shoved down your throat which was no different for us and in my 3 and a half years in that store i never got less than a 100 from a customer i loved my customersi worked in complicated sales so i would generally be with a customer for anywhere from 5 mins to 2 hours   one of the first worst experiences i had was when a supervisor named dick reamed me out one time for having literally gone to the bathroom in the middle of my shift while the store was busy i have ibs flare ups so occasionally when i have to go i have to really go well wouldnt you know that as im with an elderly woman trying to help her with something that shes really taking her time with i start to feel it in me loins i try my best to not make it seem like im rushing her but as soon as she swiped her card i practically started sprinting to the bathroom which was on the other side of the store no less also we wear headsets im kind of a germophobe so i took my headset off while i released the kraken because i think the alternative would be absolutely vile   well when i put my headset on and come back out i hear dick basically screaming like where were you shit like that i was like dude i really had to go to the bathroom my bad hes clearly unsatisfied but had to let it go for obvious reasons but hes dick so after this hed make comments like dont lean and shit like that even if the store was absolutely dead one of those  eventually he transfers stores and that was that but he was one of the first people that really made me realize how bad an awful boss or supervisor was i learned and grew much more alongside people who were my equals not dicks like him  anyway that was literally within my first month but after he left i didnt really have too many issues i ended up going full time and being a sort of lead in the section that i worked in and like i said my customers loved me i knew i was in sales but i also had the mindset that genuinely being a good person and providing legitimately useful advice and recommendations to customers will always always lead to better experiences for everyone as opposed to strictly trying to sell by quotas we were tracked by a revenue per hour metricamong others and eventually when i became the lead we had our section become first in the country at a certain point in metrics   to say i wasnt invested in my job more than your average retailsales employee would be so laughably untrue as i literally had coworkers who would moan and groan when youd ask them to do the absolute bare minimum of their job and the kicker they were with the company longer than me so i knew for a fact they were getting paid more than me still i really put my best into my job since i truly valued the skills and experiences i was gaining to an extent i remember early on in my time with that company i had a coworker tell me youre always so happy and i mean yeah its work but i tried not to bring my other shit into it yknow   eventually after a couple years i sought other positions in the company and actually applied for a spot for in home services which involved going to peoples homes and doing anything simple tv set ups on stands to 71 surround sound home theater systems being installed with wire runs the whole 9 when i started i started at the lowest rung on the totem pole above me were 2 other positions the way the hierarchy worked was that i was the helper position the middle position was for mostly simple installations and the highest tier involved very complicated installations as the helper i had one expectation to help them get the job done   this would usually involve me going from job to job and from coworker to coworker at different parts of my state so i usually had to move around much more than the people above me despite this i still took the time to learn pretty much the entire skill set of the role above me and most of the highest role as well it got to the point where my boss and eventually bosses would straight up tell me that i was one of the people they relied on most because if one of my coworkers called out they knew i couldand would get their jobs done despite being in a different role again i genuinely valued the skills and experiences so i usually didnt mind too much   but the of course as everybody in this sub would have warned my dumb yo g self you get take advantage of the first year i was told that during the holiday season it was likely that they would open up more of the positions above me and allow me to temporarily use that as a promotion and even get a temporary pay raise for it in fact that was told to me during the interview guess what never fuckin happened   as i mentioned earlier i specifically dealt with home theater equipment but again due to my flexibility my bosses would sometimes have me take calls for pc jobs as they knew i was capable and it would be better for the customer to not have to be rescheduled and eventually they started adding exercise equipment to our job expectation so i went from an interview for a job of a helper role on home theater equipment which states expectations it team lifts up to 150 pounds the exercise equipment we were getting would sometimes require 3 fucking people to even be moved    remember im the lowest on the totem pole   the real kicker were the instances where i was stuck cleaning up after my coworkers who didnt quite give a shit for example one tuesday i had a job with doug and doug told me about how pissed he was about his day the next day jamesour immediate supervisorhas me doing a fucking elliptical in next state over im not sure what my response was but it was probably something like damn that sucks   well on my way to work i checked my schedule for the day at a stoplight real quick and saw that all of dougs jobs were now my jobs i immediately texted my supervisor telling him this is ridiculous and that doug literally complained to me about this yesterday and now im the one stuck cleaning up for him he was complacent at best and i mean i did the jobs that day my helper was some 50 year old guy whod been with the company since 04 probably making double the hourly as me andwait hes my fucking helper i almost died when he let go of the fucking elliptical box while we were going down the clients steps im not kidding you were using those straps on your chest to lift and as were bringing it down the steps he goes hold on and lets go of the fucking box if i didnt have my feet firmly planted on the steps that moment i probably wouldve had a few broken ribs at the very least    ive already typed way too fuckin much but i swear this is when it all starts to really sink in and marinate in my mind that theyre never going to actually compensate me for the work ive put into their company but as i said im a workaholic so while im working 40 hours a week at this job i ended up picking up a second job in an office this was right before covid hit and when it did hit i left the office job and was furloughed from my full time job   when i was initially brought back from furlough i was told myself and another coworkeralso lowest on the totem pole would be operating a pilot program for the company which involved us doing deliveries directly for the company on the sunday we were supposed to start we entered the store which of course had dozens of precautions at that point and nobody knew what the fuck we were talking about none of our bosses are answering their phones either so i call our internal help desk to see wtf we should be doing and the girl on the other line tells me this is the first shes heard of this also so im like wtf turns out the program was delayed and for some reason neither of our immediate bosses could be bothered enough to send a text or fuckin call us prior or on the day that we came into that store so we literally risked our lives for what my blood was boiling so i told them im staying furloughed   eventually the options were come back to be layed off basically or at least thats how my supervisor made it sound i really have no idea if there was any legal standing for that so i come back and they have me doing deliveries out of a store a state away and an hour away from my home store if im being honest that was one of the most isolating experiences of my life i very rarely saw the coworkers i was used to working with and instead was left with people i had never met before and trying to figure it out literally by myself cause the first day i went into that store i asked one of the warehouse guys about their deliveries and he just kept walking and pointed to another direction like i was a customer or something it seemed like nobody really gave a fuck   i did that for weeks occasionally being sent to a store in a major us city that was 25 mins across the bridge from my home location but the problem was i drove a full sized transit van and most of the streets i was being sent to werent even large enough for sedans to squeeze by i almost got fuckin t boned by some asshat going 45 down a one way street he didnt see me turning out because both sides were lined with cars i felt like my mental health and physical health were quite literally in jeopardy any time they sent me to that city however that was a sporadic thing so going to that city mightve been a once every two week thing i just took the ones for my one state and left it at that there was one day i actually had packages for 4 different states on me to be delivered that day   oh yeah did i mention that none of our packages were like actually packaged at all it was basically like we just took shit off the shelves and left it in peoples porches the warehouse teams apparently didnt give a fuck so why should i i went full malicious compliance and i ended up leaving peoples expensive shit on their steps because 1 they were sending us out with literal macbooks gpus surfaces etc with no discrete packaging and 2 we never required a signature i genuinely hoped that if enough people had their shit stolen like that or simply complainer that they would change it  because when id bring it up to their warehouse it was a complete nonissue to them we have other stuff to be doing basically   eventually they stopped doing deliveries out of that store and told me id be returning to my home location and in a couple weeks i may even be back doing in home services well the first day i went in to my home store i looked and saw that every single fucking package was for that city that i almost got t boned in i was livid i knew exactly what shit they just pulled and i didnt fucking like it so i texted my boss sorry man i dont see myself having a future with this company anymore keys and phone are in the lockbox and that was that one of my bosses told me that i should speak to him before things were done that cant be undone really yeah i got nothing to say to you anymore i told him he wasnt a bad guy really and that i hoped the company didnt take advantage of him too hard and that was it   and of course at some point dick returned back to that store and im not even making this up on my way out that last day i saw him talking to a customer in the store and he was fucking leaning on a shelf it took all of my willpower not to say hey dick no leaning as a last fuck you but i honestly decided id rather never talk to that human scum stain again   so yeah thats my store and im sure its way too long for most people to casually read but that doesnt even tell half the story coworkers fucking with alzheimers patients having an actual racist scum lord working with me who owned dozens of guns and internal investigations what a fuckin fun ride that was if anyone is wondering why theres a worker shortage its because we have a fuckin human decency shortage in the workforce,poi7oh

2873,"I need a tried and true process to document my Operations Manager's incompetence, that won't waste too much time in the process",so i am the least malicious person i know i just do not have that shit in me at work i just want to get my work done and have a laugh if there is time but recently visions of outing one of my bosses  yep thats correct i report to two superiors and yep its definitely as efficient and as delightful as you would imagine  as the absolute fraud he is have been surging through my mind much like i imagine a serial killer feels the urge to hunt and kill it is potent and is totally unlike me   look hes a really nice guy but when somebody actively makes my job harder when it was explained to me that he would be doing the exact opposite im sorry but i get so exasperated that it feels like my head might pop off like a rocket and hit orbital escape velocity i can take new procedures being put in place this is fine this is  not the case   i feel like if you are being paid to be the manager of operations then you should maybe make an effort to gasp make yourself familiar with said operations and those of all your team leaders you may even have to wrap your head around learning file locations in the shared work drive that contain you know important information in them the kind of information that would really benefit if not actually be integral to your role as manager of these operations in question   this isnt a dude wont teach someone at his work cos he is all jaded and pithy and shit kind of deal i would welcome him wanting to learn and in fact he is my boss so like he can literally order me to do so nooooooopee efficiency is simply asking the person instead repeatedly rather than overseeing operations diligently and you know being the actual manager of them twice in 2 minutes today he asked about incoming items tomorrow is your head broken im visibly busy and you ask me twice when you should not only just know this shit but the information is literally right there a few clicks away   i have decided i am gonna have to leave within a few months which sucks because i finally have a role i really enjoy and am good at with decentish pay but this can not go unpunished in my mind i am going to keep it classy and resign with grace but i would like to keep a record of this gross incompetence so when they ask the reason i can simply present them with real proof of the way he manages his operations   what is the standard here i actually dont want to waste time doing this because im actually busy and dont want my employers to say in what im sure will be the convincing tone of an indignant 5 year old  ok but you wasted your time on this fruitless endeavour that contributed nothing to your role emails requesting stuff to be done or offering locations to him that he promptly ignores are a safe bet for sure what else do i keep a record of what he spends his time on some daysalthough ascertaining this information could rightly be labelled as a gross waste of company time because it would actually be quite difficult after all the operations he reportedly manages are vague and mysterious almost like getting a big foot on film   i am open to your help and suggestions im really not as bitter a person as i sound its just i work hard and i like to think i am also decent and even at times passionate about the work i do when you hit that trifecta of being crap not working hard to make up for that crap and also pointing out someones errors in a flash well i begin to melt down a little in my soul  did i mention i forgot to follow one instruction of ccing additional people into emails it was completely my bad now i know he literally immediately calls me out on it if i were to do the same i would be fired by monday lunch because every 5 minutes i would be tritely saying  remember when i said that like bro do you remember when you asked me that question and i said no and then you asked me the exact same question 2 minutes later no of course you dont why   simple he was far too busy with all these elusive operations that he is  managing thus  necessitating the request for information that is critical to actually manage the operations he was far too busy doing do you see now its like a time loop that we are both stuck in but only i know and i cant inform him instead i answer that same complicated question with an equally nuanced response of no before boom time loops over again,pom26v

2877,I had a job interview (in retail) this morning. I rejected the position when he refused to offer more than minimum wage despite all my previous years of retail experience.,it was so satisfying to watch him try and explain how he couldnt possibly offer me more money than the employees that have been with him for over 20 years excuse me what the fuck why arent they being paid more   then he also proceeded to say that i probably shouldnt be doing this if its just for the money excuse me what the fuck every human on earth works in order to sustain their personal lives having a fun place to work at is just an added bonus and to top it off after our talk about how i would handle difficult customers he still believes that customer is king if customers are indeed king then as the producer i am emperor its a mentality that needs to die already if customers are mean to me i want to wield the sceptre that says i can toss them out of the shop and not bow and bend to their demands   im glad im in a position where im not desperate for a job if you cannot pay employees more than minimum wage you simply cannot afford employees   thank you for reading my rant,pomup2

2909,"I stood up to a shitty company, got fired, and ended up homeless. But I’m happy and it’s still their loss.",not sure if i should post this here but i just happened to stumble onto this subreddit and i feel like this story belongs here  during the pandemic i was forced to get a shitty remote job from a terrible company the kind of company that boasts about how much they care but when push comes to shove they act like they own you  they gave me terrible training basically no training by any reasonable standards and i couldnt do the job without having to constantly ask questions or they would give me tasks without enough information to complete the tasks  i called them out on it and they accused me of being emotional and irrational so i straight up told them to stop gaslighting  they started telling me some bullshit rhetoric where they tried to use the type of company they are as an excuse they also tried to tell me they cared about their employees like family  i told them that family actually cares whereas they use the family rhetoric to entrap emotionally vulnerable people into working under bad conditions for less than theyre worth by exploiting the emotional attachment this forms  i also told them that they boasted open communication and transparency in the job description i pointed out that any time i had tried those things the underlying message i got back was to keep my head down and shut up  the best part is that one of the women in the hr department was on that video call and she actually couldnt hide the joy she got out of hearing me say this to my manager  needless to say i was let go because i was already in a precarious living situation i ended up homeless since i was going to be homeless anyway i booked a cheap flight flights are so cheap right now thanks to covid and moved to another town  the cost of living here is lower and the people are so friendly even the drug addicts in the shelter with me treat me with more respect than that job did  once i get a job here even if it pays significantly less i will end up with a much better quality of life and my new city is big enough to be amazing and still has a relaxed small town feel  but what i also learned is that the type of people who work for a company like that for too long were already broken to begin with and are just damaging themselves further both physically and mentally by continuing to work there  by conventional standards this should be a terrible situation for me the poor unemployed victim homeless man but i actually feel empowered because i learned that its better and healthier for me to tell off a bad employer and end up homeless than it is to stay in a job that ruins my mental health  theres no point to having money when you are too burned out and stressed to enjoy the life that money affords you  the sad realization though was that the employees who have worked for that company for years including my manager are all just perpetual victims of an abusive relationship which they choose to stay in despite being underpaid and mentally abused  that job would have shortened my life if i stayed as much as i hate the company i feel bad for its employees i hope they go under so their employees can experience the same relief i felt when that job ended and hopefully realize they are worth more than that  also fuck money choose happiness,pnu074

2972,Just stumbled on this sub and have a few questions,hi i recently discovered this sub and i have a few questions that i couldnt answer from reading the faq i am genuinely curious and really just want to have a discussion or get an idea of what the users of this sub believe in   for myself i think i somewhat agree with some of the main concepts of this sub i agree that the exploitation of workers and too much leeway given to corporations is obviously terrible and needs to be reformed i dont think i am against capitalism as a concept however and that is i guess sort of around what my questions to you guys are obviously there is not going to be a consensus within this sub so im interested to hear the various opinions there are on here  1 do you believe that if a person produces more either by quantity or quality they deserve more resources for example say someone is a master chef they can create the most delicious meals that make you orgasm in your mouth people line up around the block just to be able to be served by this chef would this chef deserve to have more resources money or whatever if not how would that be regulated would the chef only be allowed to serve so many people per day or would they end up just partially working for free  2 kind of a subquestion to question 1 but do you believe that there are just people that are inherently more talented than others maybe this seems like a silly question but ive heard different answers before by talent i mean it could be something related to the arts cooking painting acting etc intelligence leadershipsoft skills etc  3 long question lets say i want to start a business ive already done market research wrote up my business plan prototyping my product etc ive obviously done this on my own time i need money to get started buy equipment secure a location to do business so i can either use my own savings or take out a loan in either case im risking my personal assets to start this business       so now im ready to open my business and i need to hire an employee i dont need this employee to provide input to the vision of my company or make any big strategic decisions i have certain tasks that i need to be done and i need someone to do it of course if they want to do it creatively or efficiently they certainly have the freedom to and if it saves me time and money i would gladly compensate them for that but 80 of the time i just need them to do simple i put quotes meaning that it is simple to the relevant education and skillset for this employee could be a cashier job or it could be a software engineer job tasks to keep my business running      my question in your view what would be the appropriate way to not be exploiting this worker i think obviously paying them a livable wage would be a start so then in this example lets say i pay the employee 50100 more than the average for this position      but now my company hits it big business is really good and im doing way better than i could have ever dreamed of hypothetically lets say that we are able to do all this great business with just me and this one other worker unrealistic i know would you consider it exploitation if i were to become a multimillionaire off of my business while my employee makes whatever amount they were making is it exploitation that i am now making say 100x more than my employee how would this particular exploitation be avoided   apologies if my questions are not very clear and if it seems like im rambling on im more than happy to expand on any piece and really look forward to whatever conversation it spurs,pntgqt

I won’t either.,so heres my story  i got a dream job about 25 years ago contracts here are 1 year i was a head teacher it was a newly opened school so it was on me to create curriculums materials lesson plans all that jazz i lived for that shit and im good at it   the first year was magnificent everybody cooperated everyones opinion was heard i felt like a part of a team and i was doing a great job the materials were highly praised the students loved them and me it was fcking perfection  a year passed and the management changed  the manager lets call her jennifer because that was her name and i dont care if she finds this post was the bitchiest most stupidly stubborn never admitting fault straight up rude person ever  im not going to get into all the details but for example i was giving other staff members training about our library classes she added something i corrected her due to me honestly just wanting to provide the best quality of classes she doubled down and started explaining how she was actually right she wasnt  at some point it started feeling like i was working against her and me trying to be good at my job started feeling like a fight not cooperation  also because of her rudeness i actually went to the boss of the company because i wont be bullied at a workplace the effect she stopped talking to me   i decided that if she doesnt give a sht why should i  so when i would come to work i was coming earlier than others who were working later i would watch youtube videos when others came if try to talk with them as much as possible then lunch which i would always extend a bit then i would read my lesson plans very carefully for much longer than i needed  the only thing i did properly was to give classes i saw no reason why the kids should suffer because of her  i slacked like that for a good few months before my contract ended my proudest days were the ones when i had absolutely no work done,po5uh9

2981,Seems to be a lot of stories about standing up to superiors/supervisors.. here is my mic (ID) drop story.,hello everyone i read some of the front page stuff so i thought i would share my story that i find pretty funny and all my co workers do as well   i work multiple jobs out of need big family and i am also in school but i dont generally take abuse or allow my co workers to be abused i also really dont like hypocrites      so i was at my security job i consider this my fun job as its the job i did before my full time job paramedic so when i go to it its almost like i am there to visit old friends i of course do my work tho there is this one supervisor we all really dont like he is a ass through and through well when overtime shift comes up a supervisor can take it when they take it they do a floor shift so they are not in supervisor role but the peasant role this is key to the story    our shifts have numbers which correlate to the location you work in ill just make them up to come my reddit account secret he is doing the a2 shift which means he is right smack at the front door of the hospital while my friend and i are doing a1 and a3 which is at a desk near by    so the dick of the supervisor is working his a2 shift about 10 meters away from my friend and i and we are on reddit literally looking at pictures of cats and laughing at 4 in the morning no one is around us but the ass who is also on his phone whatever right    so the ass gets up from his chair clearly angered by the good times my friend and i are having loudly closes his flip phone lol and walks over to us chest puffed out and tells me to put my phone away so this is when the i hate hypocrites come in      i look at him and say you were literally just on your phone and your not supervising right now so i think you should go back to your station    he leans over my desk pulls off his id and puts it in my face and says what does this say it says supervisor on it so i take it with full on attitude and reply a2 the floorpeasant shift he is covering and than i drop the id on the ground in the mic drop style      he looked at me and picked it up and walked away he was later fired for harassment years later so i kinda got off clean,pnyi8y

3015,CPTSD depression and going back to work,hi everyone longtime lurker but basically ive had lifelong cptsd for reasons i wont go into here but which being overworked and underpaid definitely contributed to    im 30 and i have an advanced degree and i live by myself despite my best efforts i treaded water for 5 years i watched my entire life crumble even though i had done everything right like go to school and compete for good jobs in my field etc  i left my old career because i could barely survive and then at the start of the pandemic took an odd job and as luck would have it the job shut down and i went on unemployment benefits this is the first and only time in my life that for two years ive had a steady income that has allowed me to survive feed myself basically do everything all while getting time off to prioritise my wellbeing  anyway as we all know unemployment benefits are gone as of this month im looking for work and i have family telling me that in 30 years ill be able to work my way up the ladder of a new job and retire and blah blah and i just need to start over etc and they dont seem to understand how much i want to scream and cry every day of my life because i already gave all of my teens and all of my 20s fighting my way up the same ladder they described just for it to go nowhere   i hate that i have to start all over again at 30 i hate that im in almost 100k of student loan debt and every job i look at in my area fills me with a sense of terror and dread of being trapped and possibly never making it out again i get hit with random panic attacks when im out in public i go to sleep crying and just want the stable happy life i finally got a taste of to continue it feels like 1 and a half years wasnt enough and i was just beginning to heal from all of my pain  i dont know how to go forward with my life my life feels broken there are no jobs that appeal to me anymore no titles i dont even want to tell people what i do i just want to live my life the way i want to and i know that thats not possible anymore thanks for reading,pnwfum

3029,Need advice - I don't want more work with the same pay,hey all i could use some advice on how best to handle this situation and i figured this was the best subreddit for the job if this isnt the right subreddit please redirect me to which one is thanks  i am a college student working a minimum wage job on weekends for some extra cash for context this is very much so a high schooler kind of job low wages short shifts flexible most of my coworkers are high schoolers etc new people are brought on and others quit somewhat frequently but mostly because they go off to college   my issue is that there are talks that i will be made a manager soon at this job there are no pay increases for any reason including being made a manager you are payed for the time that you are supposed to be there and no more even though closing shifts often go 515 minutes past this time because of various closing duties managers are expected to do some extra tasks most of which id be fine with for no extra pay but one of them is driving to the bosss house around 5 minutes away after closing to deliver the days money and other things again there is no extra pay for this even though it is using our own gas and is after we are expected to be at the store  its unpaid labor  im okay with my current job and duties but i would not want to be promoted to manager without extra pay extra work with the same pay is obviously not ideal if my boss asks me about this how do i tell him this in a respectful manner i would like to tell him essentially that i would either like to keep my current duties or like to be paid extra for manager duties   some other info   before anyone tells me to quit  i know the job isnt ideal i love my coworkers and the flexibility of everything and i dont need the money that much so im not going to quit unless i find a better job or absolutely need to i plan on quitting eventually of course but a little money on the side without much stress is nice   im not worried about my boss firing me or anything if i say this the wrong way that isnt what this is about its more that i respect him to some degree and if i go about this the wrong way i dont want him to be upset or mess up our work relationship i also want to say this in a way that hopefully will make him realize how unfair it is to expect people to do all of this unpaid labor and change this system but thats probably wishful thinking  thank you in advance for your advice and feel free to ask any questions that can help with that,pnqkmc

3037,"The future of work, in sci-fi",one of my favourite shows of all time is a scifi space opera called the expanse if you arent familiar with it the world of the expanse is set around the year 2350   in it after environmental catastrophes led to widespread displacement individual countries were dissolved and the un became the unified world government   mars was also colonized but later gained independence from the un and is now called the martian congressional republic its a heavily militarized society whose goal is to terraform the planet martians are very rugged and collectivist and look down on earthers because they think theyre coddled whereas mars has mandatory conscription and is downright hostile to life   now i brought up this show because in it the population of earth is 30 billion and because of automation and machine efficiency 50 of earths population is unemployed so the government provides them with something called basic assistance which consists of food housing medical care and clothing but you dont get any money   if you do indeed want to work then first you must do an apprenticeship for a year or two i cant precisely remember which it is after that time period is up you can attend university completely free of charge after you graduate your name goes on a job waitlist its stated in the show that there are 1200 prospective applicants for every 1 job position with some people waiting for decades to get a job   please note that theres no waitlist for enlisting in the military   basic assistance is a somewhat controversial program within the fandom because some people think its soulsucking and crushing to not be able to work   i on the other hand think its a wonderful thing from the moment you are born to the moment you draw your final breath you will never know hunger or disease or homelessness one example is the arts in current times the arts are dominated by the wealthy because they can afford to chase dreams that might not end up working out but in the world of the expanse there are no hungry painters or homeless writers or destitute dancers because the government will look after you no matter what path you choose to follow assuming you want to work at all  also in the show earthers are sometimes referred to by martians as takers in reference to how 50 of earths populations subsists on taking government handouts whereas mars with its 7 billion people is a communist society the writers themselves said so where everyone has a role to play and laziness isnt tolerated and where there are taxes on air and water   i dont know what the purpose of this thread was but id really like to hear your thoughts,pnrgld

And boss ignores everything else,advice please i have worked with this company for 16 years i am extremely good at my job so im not worried about getting another one if i choose to leave or get fired there is one other person who is also at my skill and experience level the other people in the department some of whom have been with the company longer than i have still dont know how to do the basics of their job we have one that when it gets stressful and theres a lot going on says he cant work because hes sick to his stomach  i have been keeping track of all of the stuff that goes on since 2017 i can show on paper and with evidence people lying about doing work doing a shitty job and my many emails to my bosses asking about why this continues to be allowed at this point because there are just really two of us that know what theyre doing we get 95 of the work with the rest of the department either being excused because they didnt know how to do something or doing it so poorly that the boss then says oh well it would take too long for them to do it so you do it instead  as i said my good coworker and i have emailed our boss multiple times about multiple issues some of which truly affect how we do our work day to day  at this point in time iwe get no response from her whatsoever  the thought is shes probably sick of it and is not going to do anything about anyone or their behavior or lack of job knowledge she has two people already running the entire department so why should she change anything  we did not get a raise last year due to covid it is now time for our annual reviews and we have to do a selfevaluation my coworker is going to basically give spreadsheets with information concerning this is how many projects she did every day compared to the other workers she keeps track of everything and so shes going to basically just present an evidence file  my thought is i just dont want to fill out the selfevaluation we didnt get a raise last year so as far as im concerned we didnt need to make any improvements or changes why should we when we got no incentive raises are normally in the 1 to 2 range anyway so it isnt like youre missing a whole lot  in addition i am thinking i am going to retract all of my days off that i have scheduled for the end of the year which i am thinking may make my boss think im leaving and may dynamite her into some action  im not saying that im the greatest person in the world or that my coworker is but we are the greatest people in this department and this department cannot run without us  thoughts suggestions advice,pnrj4j

Barely do anything or go hard af,im usually smart enough to never work harder than is absolutely necessary but theres occasionally times where i go into overdrive and accomplish a lot it helps make me seem more productive overall and keeps me employed i also have residual boomer work mindset that my parents drilled in and its hard to remove  this goes a bit deeper  it really only worries me when my competitiveness kicks in thats when i get in the mindset of a true capitalist pig i do however think i have a few shreds of humanity left and am generally a personable enough person to reach most of my coworkers on a deep enough level to get a sense of either this person is sane and understands how fucked everything is they just want to get a paycheck to live and not be fucked over or this person is a sociopath with no fucks to give and will fuck anyone over  theres much more than those two groups but i feel its a decent generalization its kind of like ok im working with mostly folks who understand this is all a fucking scam lets just get by and get out then i end up working with the overly ambitious predatory fucks and now i know who to protect as much as i possibly can and who to engage with and meet their eagerness at every step and try and beat them at it  obviously theres no real tangible impact its pretty counterproductive to try and out capitalist the capitalist and at some point ill just end up as one of them if i keep it up i imagine the state of collapse will be too severe by then to matter but who knows,pnppgh

3056,Crap retail management job I left 2 weeks ago resorts to posting on Indeed.. with a pay cut 70 cents above minimum wage,i wrote this on mobile so i hope the format is okay please enjoy my rantstory of a terrible workplace   so i suppose the past 2 weeks they were probably trying to hire internally but theyre so delusional and understaffed that it didnt work and im honestly not surprised   i however found a fantastic new job that is right up my alley and pays more ive been loving it small company caring team engaging work the works   i left my last job because first of all the pay was quite low especially for a management position on the sketchiest street in town im from canada btw if that helps give perspective on how much  we need to live they paid me 1625hr minimum wage is currently 1435hr and the position they posted online is 1505hr for full time management   another reason i left was because of how corporate treated us our main store manager was off sick for 2 months on top of that we were understaffed i was the only full timer during this time along with 4 part timers the store was even open for longer hours than every other neighboring store with customer traffic going dead as soon as the others closed for the day   a month and a half passes without the store manager and i am sat down with corporate to talk about my performance because apparently i am making our workplace a negative environment and i am not leading our team and whatnot that because in your contract it says in the absence of the store manager it is your job to step up and act as store manager sure but for 2 months with no extra help    they give me this 4 week improvement plan that i had to sign which stated that if i did not improve on all of these things i could be fired spoiler i didnt stay for the full duration it went into detail about how i wasnt efficient with my time and many other bs things now heres the thing i wanted to do a good job i didnt want to cause a negative work environment so i was very eager to find out what parts of my performance were wrong they could give me no examples of this nada zip just indirect political answers saying theyre correct i managed to make the plan about actually finding these supposed faults because i cant fix something i dont know is broken i spent most days anxious as fuck that im doing something wrong at every turn but i dont know what it is   lo and behold we could never find anything i reported as such in our weekly improvement plan meetings and said that i have been doing the things required of me i kid you not they say that they cannot confirm that because theres nobody to witness whether i am or not i immideately said then how can you confirm in any way that there is a problem if nobody is witnessing it i get no answer just repetitions that i must improve   our store manager returns she is then able to witness for me and surprise surprise im now improving but the problem now is that im bringing down the teams morale however this is directly because my own morale is unsalvageable   our store manager instantly puts in her notice as she found a better job that is better for her medical condition good for her now all the other employees are very attached to her so when she goes they go too they hired 5 new part timers as soon as she was back all high school students on their first job poor kids    and my saving grace appears i got a new job gave 1 day notice i only regret not being able to see that theres nothing wrong with me or my performance all of this is simply a snippet of the ridiculousness that was my last job      tldr i left a super shitty workplace that was paying me very little and was gaslighting me into thinking i was a bad employee and now theyre trying to hire someone for 70 cents over minimum wage for a full time management position good riddance,pnkngk

3095,Aren't you guys afraid that they'll somehow shut down this sub?,ive been looking at how fast weve been growing and its absolutely beautiful everyday i see almost 2k new members who are reflecting on what capitalism does to us and how the ruling class is willing to do anything in order to keep us close enough to poverty that we have no other choice but to be their wage slaves  i sometimes wonder if this group is an analog to what unions provide to society an organisation of workers who share their realities and try to increase their leverage against the companies who have put them through terrible conditions  this group could obviously be seen by companies as a threat to their power and once we reach a crucial number of members we may become victims of an attack that would not only violate our freedom of speech but would also set us back in the huge progress weve had up until now  i know im just ranting but im a member of this subreddit because i believe that we can achieve anything we want once we have enough people on our side and it would destroy me if all the hopes ive put on this sub went down the drain like any other effort to improve working conditions that has been censored by these huge monsters  id love to know what you think thank you for reading   lets keep fighting for the ultimate goal which in my opinion is a universal basic income,pnm5p6

3107,Partially anti-work,im in the us so most of this perspective is us related   ive been noticing an exodus of employees from the food service industry around me about the past 5 lunches i went out in a row the places i went were severely understaffed and often the quality was way sub par compared to say a couple of years ago   im glad i honestly couldnt think of anything more degrading that working at a chain restaurantnot all of the places i went for lunch were chains but more than half were i did it for a very short period of time when i was younger i guess if you are a teenager any paycheck seems like a fortune but it is just about the most depressing thing on earth to see someone 30 years old working in a dead end shithole i dont think its just foodservice i think chain stores do things that seem extra demoralizing to me dumb ass color schemed polo shirts who the fuck wears polo shirts except frat duechewads and 98 year old golfers   also ive noticed major differences in employer mentality in different parts of the country conservative areas and conservative employers should be hardcore boycotted out of existence they take pride in paying employees as little as possible if you go to a more progressiveliberal area it is not at all uncommon to find the opposite employers taking pride in how well they treat and pay their employees   i guess the original point was it seems like the us economy is made up of nearly pointless jobs and jobs that shouldnt be pointless for example food service are often gobbled up by conglomerates and made completely demoralizing   as other posts have mentioned yeah there are shitty small business owners and almost every single large corporation treats their employees worse than livestock   are there any possible solutions   it seems like they would require organization which i am kind of against because it seems like in the end we would be right back were we are now   i think the internet brought a lot of transparency to these things it made clear what wages were fair which places were actually nice to live etc unfortunately large corporations have been using the internet to increase their dominance as well i live in a nice place and every time a house has gone up for sale in my neighborhood in the past 2 years a rental company has bought it then they rent a nearly half a million dollar house to section 8 people because its guaranteed income    how do you think conservative politicians get trash people to support the idea that it will be good for them if they dont have health insurance etc do they promise them free methoxyconton or something   i dont fucking get why we cant vote our way to a better existence,pnnsl9

3343,Another reason I quit my job,the first reason was that i was just getting unhappy i was a cashier at a grocery store nbd 13 an hour thought that was ok its not normal 8 hour work day literally someone quit the week i started and signed up for all their shifts i worked from 11am to 1030pm for a few days straight then my normal 8 hour shifts until i worked 12 days in a row i got a 15 gift card   so since the 12 day stretch ive been scheduled 6 days a week im like yeah i can do it i can power through i love being here then it didnt stop 6 days a week 50 hour weeks mandatory weekends at least one day for six weeks straight  i was having a bad mental health day and went home early felt guilty about that so that made me feel worse and saw other things have started happening because of my schedule  i took the afternoon off and literally just stared on my phone till literally like 4am and then i realized thats literally all i fucking do switching between the same 3 apps for 12 hours straight no music no smoking weed no background noise just me sitting on my bed like a soggy fucking waffle  i set my alarm at 10am sleep through it until 1230pm fuck around on social media for an hour then go to work come home go to my room sit on my bed and doom scroll until 6am its been like this for weeks  this job took my ability to take care of myself away because i had almost no time off i couldnt bring myself to do laundry eat shower fucking brush my  teeth my shift was 2pm to 1030pm i didnt wake up in time to do anything because i was up till 6 since im wired from that shit shift   whats worse is that when i actually do have time on my day off or whatever i still cant bring myself to do anything cuz its my day off i do stuff i dont wanna do everyday and its so draining  so last week i had a breakdown in the office and basically told the boss the last two paragraphs and theyre like do you wanna 30 minute break im like nah i need to go home and i need more than 1 day off a week they pretty much said aight we can do that   finally heres the second reason i quit when this weeks schedule was posted i got 3 days off one for my gpops funeral so thats gonna be emotionally tolling but the next fuckin week hit with 6 days again   im done im done being bullied i spilled my heart out to these people and they did not care  dont do anything more than what youre supposed to at work or else theyll use the fuck out of you,pm39wl

3347,Walgreens wouldn't let my sister wear a sweater or keep a bottle of water during her scheduled shift,decided to post here to kind of vent my frustrations after listening to my sisters bad experiences working in retail ive personally never applied to a retail job because im not too fond of the customer service part of it so when i was hearing about these two rules at this particular store i was pretty damn baffled   my sister has since quit this job but when she applied it was during the winter she was cashier for her scheduled closing shifts there so she stood at the register which is adjacent to the entranceexit doors whenever the automatic doors would open she would feel the cold gust of wind every time a customer walked in or out when she put on a sweater that first night her manager told her to take it off as its not a walgreens sweater my sister was a broke teenager then and didnt have the money to purchase one at that moment and was sure to let her manager know that still she was not allowed to keep it on until she spent her own money to buy a walgreens sweater to wear during her shift so basically the manager wanted her to put up with the cold closing shifts for at least 2 weeks until she got her first paycheck to buy a sweater there the logic there is nonexistent  another thing that bothered me a lot was that she couldnt keep water with her up by the register she was only allowed to take a drink of water during her break even if it was slow enough to take a sip for the time period that there were no customers around what the fuck is this all about is it normal for retail jobs to be this way this is bullshit and im glad my sister quit very shortly after she got that job she was 16 at the time so i think jobs like that really try to take advantage of the young ones since they usually wouldnt know better treatment as an employee,pmof6h

3379,I cannot begin to express how much I hate job interviews,had an interview yesterday for an internship shit pay that wouldnt even cover the cheapest rent in the city of course everything started off really well i went to a really good university and pretty much ticked all of their boxes when it comes to qualifications they seemed really friendly and happy to talk to me until we got to the dreaded behavioral type of questions like i am in some fucking therapists office except i apparently have to lie my ass off i cant and dont want to play that game i refuse to i dont want to project a false image of myself just to later on show my true colors and feel embarassed as fuck they asked me what role i take in group projects i said i always prefer not being the group leader but i am more than happy to do the bulk of the research writing and analysis they seemed visibly displeased with my answer asked why i dont like leadership positions i simply said i do not feel confident enough to take that role and do not have the personality characteristics to perform well in that position all three of the interviewers started furiously telling me that i cant say that and cant know that and that employers dont like to hear that one of them literally said i appreciate how honest you are really but dont do this again you dont know what youre saying really i dont know what i am saying my severe anxiety and clinical depression diagnosis since i was 12 would like to say otherwise i was pissed and felt invalidated i know damn well that i know more about my abilities and limitations than you  complete fucking strangers and i know i feel like fainting if i have to lead a group of people and inspire them with bullshit talk but of course i couldnt say that i cant let these people who are offering me the privilege to be interviewed by them for their godly company know that my mental health is not in pristine condition god forbid i shit you not for the rest of the interview they were all sulky and rude towards me nothing but dagger eyes nevertheless they said my qualifications were good and they will let me progress to the last step of the hiring process a 3 hour test they said how i should prepare for todays test and to do my research on the topic i did halfway through the test i receive a message from them hello madseason238 we have unfortunately decided not to go further with your application you can submit the unfinished test thank you for your time  and thank you for wasting mine  the entire hiring process is a fucking joke and is nothing but a disgusting charade of who can kiss the employers ass better sorry for being truthful and not selling myself better honestly as a person with mental health issues i wonder if this will ever get better maybe in the end it was for the better i asked about their work culture and they said we dont work 6am10pm but we are also not 9 to 5 kinda guys,pm8y8s

3399,what about we create a movement to end work?,now hear me out suppose everyone makes a youtube channel about antiwork speech  then we commit to watch each others videos and use the add revenue to create a company  then everyone commits to prioritize the companys products instead of regular prowork products  and we use the profit of the company to create more antiwork companies to replace more products  antiwork companies who commit to make work as easy as possible by maximum automation and having people as supervisors if possible even from home through a cam  normal it wouldnt work because the exploiters would have the unfair advantage of exploiting but if everyone agrees to use only antiwork merchandise then they would either have to agree to anti work policies or give the antiwork companies a effective monopoly  kinda of like a global union of consumers  ideally it would be better if work didnt exist but at least it would be a beginning at changing the way the market works  we could slowly impose new requirements like mandatory charity to the poor or i wont buy your products  if we were to for instance buy generators like solar panels and mini wind turbines for people they could save the energy on batteries and even share it one another and it would slowly but eventually bankrupt energy companies unless they become antiwork  if we allowed people to share internet eventually internet providers would go bankrupt unless they become antiwork  and so on until this stubborn world finally accepts that work is something that should be reduced and not increased  choosing products would be like voting the only issue would be that we would have to limit people form having like 12 children so they dont overload the planet resources but aside from that it sounds like a good idea  what do you think antiwork party,pli0ts

Where did I go wrong?,hi everyone  its taking me a lot of energy to even admit  write this post full disclosure its my first post on this sub but ive been following for a while and am grateful to feel less alone in the struggle  i have been in business for myself for five years and am holding on by a thread financially once pua ended this week i returned to a system of dread and concern as that was my lifeline in helping me pay bills i teach virtually art and meditation in healthcarewellness spaces as im selfemployed and also sell my work i am in the arts i have still not financially recovered from 2020 and have been networking and navigating the new job space nonstop to see if i fit in anywhere needless to say it is mostly soulcrushing  what happens when you know you are smart passionate and courageous in your field but feel that you have been out of the game for so long i have been applying to jobs since may 2020 and have not received a single interview since i have been in the workforce for 13 years have a ton of experience in some corporate spaces but the system was so vapid and agonizing i quit after seven years in that space i have been a business owner since  i even went back to school last year out all of all years to get certified in working in healthcare spaces for the arts but am now 20k in debt from that experience  even though i loved every second of learning   i am single in my 30s and feel like an absolute failure some days i make about 30000 a year and last year was my most prosperous year at 35000 simply from ui  pua help while i know the work i am doing is valuable especially given the covid madness everywhere and mental health being super important i am not seeing financial results or stability several years in and thus my mind is plagued that i am not valuable in a society where   value even though i dont see  and have never seen  people that way   shall i pack in my business and devote my time to applying to endless jobs for hours on end  its why i ask where did i go wrong what happened is it luck just a lack of demand for my work i love working with people and love my autonomy as well i know what its like to work for micromanagers absolute bureaucracy and people who were put into their roles due to nepotism and sheer connections even though they treated others horribly  and thats why i exited that world   do i hold my ground or give up i just want to help people i was told by an ex that beggars cant be choosers he made upwards of 1000 a day as an independent contractor in journalism while i worked pt and freelanced and barely pulled in 600 a week i wish money didnt matter so much to me but i just dont want to feel scared anymore i simply want to feel acknowledged and valued   thank you if you read this far   in solidarity,plstzx

3402,not fired.... but told by employer to start looking for other jobs???,this is my first time onposting on this subreddit and not sure if this topic fits but the end result probably will in any case please let me know if this post belongs somewhere else  long story kind of but not really short feel free to skip to the tldr i was hired for a program manager position 3 months ago at the time i was a project manager and it seemed to be the perfect next step for me at the perfect org but quickly realized that wasnt the case   as a project manager previously i was behind the scenes collecting data collaborating with it depts and holding project team meetings keeping everyone motivated this was my sweet spot as i have a few flavors of social anxiety and adhd that made these neatly scoped and scheduled projects with close colleagues my supersweet spot   this new job is different 90 of my day to day is drafting carefully crafted emails with a specific tone consistent with the orgs brand and im basically selling the program im managing to a seemingly infinite number of prospective field experts not to mention member engagement and retention is a top priority so i still have to watch every single word i write to our current experts lest i scare away with my word vomit the other 10 of my job is like creating social media posts and compiling articles for our monthly newsletter thats sent to our program members  as you can imagine as someone with adhd and social anxiety i did not take well to these tasks i tried reallly hard for the first 2 months working 80 hrsweek to make sure all the goddamn words i was writing didnt sound like complete jibberish i was on the brink of burnout and then i took a week long vacation with my family where we literally built a house in the mountains together seeing the exact outcomes of our efforts that week on the build site meant that i did not come back to my job as the same person  productivity plummeted every word i wrote felt meaningless completely out of my comfort zone and at times felt like outright lies all of which was not how i wanted to be spending my life so i pretty much just like stopped doing any work that wasnt a direct order and even those direct orders fell through the cracks  needless to say i was confronted about my performance multiple times they really have tried to work with me and i with them but it comes down to the fact that the skills i want to provide to this org are not the skills they need apparently so  tldr  2 days ago after multiple discussions about my unsatisfactory performance i was not explicitly fired but the words from my boss were the role that you truly want and could excel at does not exist at this org you need to start looking for jobs but i will do everything i can to help you find a job and you can continue to work here until you land one  my question to yall is how the fuck do i continue to work here in this position where my skills literally arent wanted do i take advantage of their pity and get paid to do nothing as long as possible or do i just tell them to fuck off and go back to the mountains to help my dad finish building the house  i have an idea of the response i will get on this subreddit which may be why i landed on it in the first place lol but objective opinions are much appreciated ,plor8n

3415,the end of work is nigh,there is no way to decarbonize while people are spending money all resources are required to be devoted to the preservation of whatever life is left and food production the rest of us need to get to work never working again except to preserve life and make food  life is the only thing that matters everything else is replaceableunnecessary   the alternative is extinction over the next 20 years and potentially already locked in but thats worth changing whatever your plans are no matter how old you are emergency call to service nonexistence is different from death and its a shitty ride there the big corporations and billionaires are emitting because you consume for fun their wealth requires our sweat our last chance for preventing total ecological collapse is focusing everything on preventing it work to keep everyone fed and fuck everything else because its driving extinction   i honestly cant tell if everyone gets it and decided has not to care but just in case when you set anything on fire you produce more than the weight of the fuel of co2 the fuel doesnt disappear it turns into a gas imagine the weight of an entire forest in the air and that gets turned back into a forest over 1000 years or so even if it only takes a forest 4050 years to get established when you burn carbon inside the system its part of the amount of carbon thats been recently alive we add 1 million acres worth of forest to our air every day by burning fossil fuels  carbon is in balance both for heat and for the greater balance between the living and dead co2 because carbon is the currency of life when we need to drill to get to oil were drilling through time 10k years per cm i think look that up if you dont know it often hundreds of millions of years which is evolutionary time 500 million years ago were the first multicellular life there isnt a species alive that knows this carbon setting fire to an ancient high carbon ecosystem is effectively doubling the warming of the co2 if it were halved at the preindustrial era wed freeze there has never been any budget for introducing new carbon into the system of any quantity let alone doubling it this energy is trapped over millions of years of accumulation but because its a liquid we can just suck it up we can release the exhaust of millions of years of surplus carbon from a different ecosystem into ours life cant support the rate of change of carbon added or the change but especially that it never levels off we are heading for an extinction and need to trade burning fuel with restoring life or we go extinct slowly while trying to maintain the thing thats making us go extinct  if theres an opportunity to avoid this we owe our own existence to try to preserve the greater force of life on earth our parents didnt give us life were part of an unbroken chain of existence that traces all the way back to the first cell all life on earth at any given time can say the same because were all from the same original source life makes life and feeds on life the entire system is required for proper function and all change is permanent disrupting the carbon balance any further is a threat to all life on earth and if we dont drop the co2 below where it is now we still go extinct it just takes longer so the choices are to live for life and nothing more or go extinct while working and commuting despite your quality of life decreasing exponentially from this moment forward its been happening for awhile just not fast enough for your to notice but its exponential so if you havent seen it you will   why arent we meeting in the streets trying to organize this and prepare our communities for living with less right or are we choosing extinction if this seems like hyperbole have a look at the description of rcp85 its happening even fasterworse than that,plecuc

3427,r/antiwork helped me quit my job and rediscover how much I enjoy work,i subbed about a half year ago when i was working retail at a big box hardware store i was a customer service representative working a grind i have a personality that those who know me casually would describe as sunny im a naturally smiley person and i genuinely enjoy talking to people but management took naturally smiley to mean im a naturally happy person no one is naturally happy that aint a thing just because i like dealing with people someone has to like being a people person doesnt mean i like long grueling hours with no support  they kept putting longer and longer shifts on me and accidentally forgot to schedule a supervisor for morning shifts i would work because they knew i would supervise at an associates pay there were opportunities to get promoted up to that position but it really only comes with a dollar pay bump with a ton of extra responsibilities only people who dream of management someday would take that bait but even if i didnt want that responsibility they filled my schedule up with 45 hour weeks while denying me those nice monthly bonuses that fulltime workers got i liked the customers i liked my coworkers i even had a sense of accomplishment when i did the work but they had no concept of worklife balance everyone was very pleased with my work and with me as an employee in general but they had no understanding that they were working me to a breakdown or more likely they didnt care  one day i saw a meme and it made me subscribe to this subreddit that meme bounced around in my head for weeks youve seen it its the one that goes paraphrased you want a two week notice you shouldve noticed i was about to quit two weeks ago and damn thats just glib wordplay but it got me i was working to the bone and my superiors just didnt have enough power of empathy to see i was about to break if they didnt care what i was dealing with i didnt have to care what they were dealing with i thought about that tweet for a few weeks more than two before one day i decided i was done i waited until the last hour of my shift and then wrote a polite but firmly written email to my superior wishing her the best of luck on her future endeavors i said that i was terminating my employment effective immediately i sent the email from my work computer and i told one associate who i knew loved to gossip as one last gift to her and then i walked out at the end of my shift with my superior not having checked her emails yet and never came back  i didnt have a backup plan my only plan was to casually look for a job while enjoying my time at home my spouse still had their job but it was not enough income by itself i had gotten myself free but for how long would the next job and there had to be one because my spouses job makes them miserable too be just as bad but with new faces and then randomly i saw a buddy who works in shared chat community for homebrewers ask if anyone was interested in a taproom position i fucking jumped on it  i work at a brewery now and its changed my life i dont just like going to work i like it more than staying home before i worked that shitty retail job when i had time for hobbies my main hobbies were homebrewing beer and mead and going to festivals with a booth so i could pass it out to people homebrewers cant sell their beer legally and without a venue they cant easily share it i was working booths at festivals for free and it brought me more joy than anything in the world it was my passion and joy but it was actually costing me money after 2019 covid ended all the fests which meant i didnt have a reason to brew anymore without homebrewing i didnt have anything but retail to pour my passion into i had abandoned all of my hobbies and let depression make my decisions for me  now i have my life back im homebrewing again because im constantly talking about beer and it has reignited my passion once the brewery gets their pilot system up ill even be able to put my own beer on tap im being paid better than any of the other jobs in my working life up to this point mid thirties because i earn tips but i also earn a decent wage before tips i took about a 50 cent wage dip from my retail job but after tips im making about what i was before on a fraction of the hours whats more i enjoy my work and thats where we get to the point where rantiwork makes me feel like a phony  i see a lot of discussion about ambition in this subreddit in particular i see trolls posting about how people here think ambition is bad but thats not right is it i think most people get it ambition isnt bad by itself work is not inherently bad but ambition to make capitalists a bunch of money is a sad sad ambition thats not where your energy and passion belong  but like mankind only gets so much time on this earth wanting to do something specific and productive with that time thats not sad thats like giving meaning to your life its not sad to want to work if youve found work that makes you proud that fills you with passion thats working for yourself if you find something that sparks that kind of passion you should do it as much as possible and that usually wont be possible not everyone has a kind of work that makes them feel that way and those people should try to figure out how to live and be happy on as little work as possible  this is not an endorsement of working what you love yeah no shit life can be good if you get paid to do work you love i know thats not an option most people have im not telling you guys to do what i did because i think its abundantly clear that what i did was get lucky im just saying that its okay to be subscribed to this subreddit and not fully hate work because i do love to work i love leisure very very much but i love the serotonin high i get from accomplishing things even more i just love to do my work and i dont want to have to worry about whether or not theres money in it  i hope theres other people like me out there people who hated work enough to walk away without a plan and rediscover the work that makes life feel meaningful and if you have a hobby that you had to cut from your life because work didnt give you enough time i implore you find a way to take your hobby back its more important than it seems and its worth fighting for to find the work you would do as recreation,plnqnm

3429,Major shift in worldview,hello  a brief background on me prior to the avalanche of brain nonsense that is to come i am a 22 year old male in the digital media industry about to finish community college and probably enter the workforce  i remember up until about 3 weeks ago i was totally fine and content with spending the foreseeable future working and grinding to get ahead and get the things that i wanted in life note that these things were mostly all material such as a house car etc in fact i had spent most of my summer trying to get ahead and worked on my portfolio so that i might have a competitive advantage over my classmates and be more employable  then seemingly out of the blue 3 weeks ago my wonderful partner asked me if i would ever consider moving out of the country living abroad for some time immediately i was in it sounded like such a good idea for some context i live in one of the most expensive 1st world countries in the world in one of the most populated cities in that country i have long dreaded the moment where i would have to leave my parents house and have to pay some crazy high rent prices that would essentially drain my entire money earned for that month seems like a pointless exercise grinding away all day to be able to sleep somewhere at night im sure you all agree  i did a lot of research checked other places around the world where i might be able to live for cheaper and thus have to work a lot less than before spain and portugal seemed to be 2 great places that would offer what i was looking for significant discounted cost of living wonderful weather and beautiful scenery  so here i am now i have this new mindset forged in less that 3 weeks that work culture is the dumbest thing ever grind and hustle mindset are super cringe and most importantly what the actual fuck is the point of working 40 years non stop to be able to retire and enjoy life when im old and out of my prime  i want to experience life to the fullest i am willing to give up some luxuries that i have become accustomed to in order to do this i am totally fine with never owning a car going on lavish vacations or even owning that house with the picket fence i am fine with living in the country side in spain in a house that costs exactly what it should riding my bike into town and doing whatever the fuck i want each and every day  i feel that i am young enough still and without many responsibilities that a lot of people have such as mortgages or children that i can strive for work free life or life as my own boss that so many people desire  i mean what the fuck we only have this one life why would i do anything at all that i dont want to do,plr6va

3431,If I ever get to be a political person this is my idea to fix min wage,imo min wage should always be be xh what it takes to live not paycheck to paycheck like average cost of rent food water etc in the area minus entertainment plus 10 extra so the person isnt living paycheck to paycheck like if yearly it takes 30k to live this adds an extra 3k as a buffer  2000  the problem with saying places must pay 15 or 10 or whatever is even if you hit the number today it simply isnt going to be right tomorrow so here is my idea  min wage should be calculated based on where the person works and the employer must pay at least the min wage calculated for their area cities themselves will be required to have these calculations and they must update it every 6 months like an exact day and the figure the city puts out must be easily accessed by everyone so workers and companies know exactly what is required   and every 5 years the city must be audited by outside firms and if the city has been found to broke the rules in how to calculate min wage living they will have a heavy fee to pay  for companies that complain about keeping up with payment changes every 6 months the advice will always be pay above to add buffer for companies that complain about this cost too much the words will come down it sadly this is simply the cost of business and to make sure everyone has the right to not be homeless   ampx200b  this doesnt solve medical and a few other things but it should make it where if someone did work at a job for the normal 40 hours a week or a mix of jobs that add up to 40 hours a week and they still cant make it  ampx200b  thoughts,pllf3w

3501,It finally happened where I work - Almost everybody walked off.,i live in the rural south and i work dead end jobs because i cant drive and have the wrong kind of military record awol dishonorable discharge most people here pretend to love working even act like working a million hours is something respectable and not sad  you know that poisonous work culture im always trying persuade people away from it where i can but i feel like i have only succeeded in pretty limited ways  day before yesterday most of the staff quit at my weekend job because the company fucked up our pay again i wasnt even there but from the facility and contract managers begging me to come in it seems they had gotten together and demanded a pay raise too like me most of these folks also have other jobs but this is fucking huge im flabbergasted because i wasnt even involved in it  anyway after four of my five bosses call me asking me to come in i get a call from the big boss who has only ever spoken to me to reprimand me for my facial hair and who fired my brother to cover his own mistake hes the typical executive douche and i hate him  i answer and it becomes immediately apparent that he has no idea who i am only that i have perfect work attendance i doubt he knows that the only other weekender is my roommate a fellow communist he goes on a rant about how people must not want to pay their rent and suggests that if i dont come in i wont be able to pay mine without missing a beat i say people also have to have their dignity dont they  i see his faces shock in my minds eye as he stutters for a few seconds struggling to construct an answer i sense the beast is wounded and after having been called so many times when i need to sleep i dont have any restraint left i let loose and he just listens because he knows hes fucked unless he does  after that he asked if i was even coming in on the weekend i said yes because i need the money but i wasnt coming in right away that and were getting the raise  i floated away from that conversation overflowing with a kind of ecstasy which i hadnt experienced since the last time i dropped a tab just eartoear grinning sporadically giggling to myself for hours  i know this isnt unionizing which is impossible to do in my workplace due to the level of surveillance and manipulation and of course righttowork laws however it is definitely the closest thing to a labor action ive ever been involved in and it filled up my soul meter    tldr half the staff quit sermonized at my boss getting a raise,pllyab

3506,The strange co-opting of Gen-X anti-boomer messaging by young people,im sure im not the only genxer that finds this unusual this strange way that younger people have coopted genx antiboomer messaging and how they are now trying to apply it retroactively to the 1970s and 1980s as if that was some kind of glorious economic period in america  when genx was out doing our thing in the late 1970s and 1980s there was a kind of prevalent messaging that took hold during the punk rock days through the mtv era and into the grunge rock days that was a reaction to the sort of never ending boomer economic optimism of the 1950s and 1960s like a rebellion  during the 1970s that is after the vietnam war  you had all these soldiers back home it was just after all of the social unrest of the late 1960s and early 1970s and the economy was in shambles this is like the post hippie summer of love era like black sabbath days  thats when i personally remember tons of people being out of work  not just a few people like the guy your sisters cousin knows but like your uncle your dad everyones dad  stagflation carters 1976 a crisis of confidence speech it was a total shit time economically drugs were everywhere and the only good things most people remember was that like now during the pandemic a lot of people got to hang out with their families  this was a time when every street in suburban america had yard sales all up and down the street people were dressing their kids in second hand clothes and flea markets were the big thing because average people were broke as fuck  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkcodqwzbghttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkcodqwzbg jimmy carter crisis of confidence 1979  this is when there were gas lines where you literally couldnt buy gasoline in a lot of places and people waited in line for gas and there was rationing  by the summer of 1980 inflation hit 145 and unemployment was at 75  young people might think they know what that means  but it was brutal  it wasnt just inflation unemployment the numbers  it was everything  litter people just threw trash on the ground out car windows in 1975 new york city declared bankruptcy  those wine and cheese shops that now exist on every corner in the city those were porno movie theaters or boarded up  i remember i used to go into the buildings in the city with friends wed play in them stepping over bums  those same places now are high end residential properties and shops  moving into the 1980s a serious recession through 1982 and by the mid1980s were into the crack epidemic this is when hiv was a big thing when shit was real  you could get shot in the city and not like messing around in the wrong place but anywhere crime was much worse then  you see shows like bait car on television now all of that had its roots in the 1980s when people would literally just pull you out of your car at gun point and drive off with it car jacking was everywhere in the city it was like a teenage pass time on friday and saturday night  this is when nwa was singing the early days of rap and hip hop when the police really would shoot your ass and get away with it and nobody cared  this was the fucking cold war too when the events glamorized by movies like the hunt for red october were actually happening when many of us were partying like it was the end of the world because we literally thought it was there were a ton of young people who didnt even think the world would survive  instead of climate we were talking about how people might survive nuclear winter when the great nuclear war we felt was imminent would black out the sun with nuclear fallout  young people you see all the smiling happy mtv videos from the 1980s have you ever really looked under the hood to see what the lyrics are to some of those songs princes 1999 released 1982 gonna party like its 1999  this is when many of the great dystopian classics were made akira ghost in the shell the road warrior mad max 2 because people literally thought the fucking world was going to end  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbc5nk1dxyeyhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbc5nk1dxyey black sabbath war pigs 1970  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrblt2etffc4httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrblt2etffc4 prince 1999 1982  thats where all that nihilism comes from in the late 1980s and into the 1990s when grunge as everywhere when the western world was in an existential nightmare   it wasnt until the mid to late 1990s until all this shit started to get better in real economic terms for the average person not until the stock market started taking off with the first tech boom before the 2000 crash  thats when you started having cable channels like cnbc thats when people really started investing in markets when all those derelict buildings in the cities started to be refurbished  thats when you started to see housing prices taking off  and that boom has been going on basically nonstop for about 25 years  if youre a young person youve grown up in the longest running economic expansion in american history  and that then really comes around to why i wanted to write this post  this younger generation has coopted a lot of the messaging that was rampant in genx culture during all of this time the dystopian nightmare talking about boomers before genx having it so easy in the 1950s and 1960s of postww2 america  that was a golden economic age when europe had been destroyed in the fires of ww2 and america was one of the few powers left standing in the world and the entire country was at work rebuilding europe and the pacific everyone who wanted a job then had one  thats when any dumbass who had dropped out of high school could get a good job with a pension  the 1970s and 1980s were the hangover from the economic party of the 1950s and 1960s the room full of stinky boomers who were laying around in sweat and puke divorcing each other and fucking the world up  its fine that young people coopt that genx language and messaging if you want to dislike boomers welcome to the fucking party but the problem is you guys seem to use all of these ideas and language without any idea what historical period youre actually fucking talking about  dude if you think the 1970s and 1980s were some kind of economic nirvana when old economy steve could sell vcrs and have two cars and a house you must be smoking some of that 1980s crack because you have no fucking idea what you are talking about  if old economy steve ever existed you missed by like two fucking decades because 1980s steve was smoking dope doing tricks on his bmx bike tagging buildings playing smear the queer in an abandoned parking lot and sitting around banging to rap and metal while listening to his boomer parents in the background arguing about who gets to keep the house,plfpje

3607,The hate towards those who don't work,i live in a country which values work very much so much that it is seen as a virtue in itself the common phrase is that all work is good the most important talking point of politicians is how to decrease unemployment rates since you are child everybody teaches you to value work over everything else studying and learning new skills is only considered worthwhile if they lead to better position in the job market it is generally accepted that people have burn outs because of work in some places having a burn out is seen as achievement people who work extra time with no pay are admired mental troubles are viewed as an accepted collateral damage of work   and if you somehow arent part of that people hate you if you are open about your antiwork views in social media you can get death threats and harassment especially older people get very angry if you openly despise work culture you are almost a subhuman or a freeloader who lives with someones tax money well some people should learn more about where corporations get their money from politicians who promote cuts in the social security and unemployment benefits are popular people see unemployment as a fault of an individual and if you dont have a job people expect you to do any job you can get there are people with university degrees who work in fastfood restaurants or as toilet cleaners  some unemployed people are so ashamed of their situation which is often caused by capitalism that they pretend to work they wake up early and take a bus to somewhere so that people think that they are heading to work then they come back home and drink for the rest of day   if you are trying to explain why people should be antiwork you get either hate or just a confused look and an answer like well people got to work how else they can make a living if you explain how workers are exploited most people just start to talk about how there is no alternative and how communism never worked   and no this is not about japan or usa,pkufcw

3640,"I beat the British Military, an 8month FIFA player, left with a better paying job, big payout and beat the market for nearly seven figures!",i beat the british military an 8month fifa player left with a better paying job big payout and beat the market for nearly seven figures  ampx200b  so a bit of background i reached my midtwenties having flunked around at university and done various minimum wage jobs and decided enough was enough and i was tired of crummy pay  i met a girl whose dad was an officer in the raf and after going around to his lovely suburban home with a nice car i decided this was the life for me   i would later leave that girl a couple of weeks into basic training cheating whore story for another time  ampx200b  roll on four years and i have started to make a good go of things i had two highly recommended reports for promotion three reports with a minimum of recommended are required to be put forward for promotion given annually  these four years were great i had some really good friends who i still keep in contact with until this day  the work was easy enough and i was crushing it in my line managers eyes there were pros and cons up until this point that many in this subreddit would hate we had to stay behind after work for a couple of hours without any workers rights  weekends for marching parades calling 18year old officers sir  this was balanced out with having almost half days on a friday and 38 days holiday to use  i was single at the time and lived on base paying 30 a month for accommodation and bills  this gave my 21k a year salary a bit more of a punch  ampx200b  going into my final year to get a good report i was drafted out to qatar to work at the coac  i worked an admin role out there sitting and watching hours of live drone footage with the occasional bomb being dropped  i was never really a military guy and didnt take much satisfaction watching people die even if they were the so called bad guys  it was on this tour where everything went downhill for my career    ampx200b  the shifts we did were terrible for my body clock  we did two days of 12hour shifts 6 am6 pm then had 24hours to change our body clock and do two days of 6 pm6 am  then once we finished our rotation we would get either 36hours or 60hours of recovery time before our next fourday cycle  on the face of it was not too bad but you were expected to stay in this rotation for the full four months of your tour  i could have probably pushed through this tour with the right amount of morale  unfortunately i was dealt a shitty hand and paired with an asshole of an officer for my shifts  this whole tour is a story in its self and one i may share  cliffs i was shattered out of my mind towards the end and made minor mistakes that made that officer lean on me too much  i finally cracked and walked down to the medical centre having a borderline breakdown  within a day i was on a plane home and finished my tour three weeks early  it felt good knowing that asshole would be snowed under in my absence  ampx200b  so i get back to the uk where i need to report to the medical officer  they sign me off for a couple of weeks to mentally recover  my girlfriend was supportive when i got back and i began my road to recovery    ampx200b  upon returning to my home base management had changed a lot since i left for qatar  there was a new squadron leader and well call him old timer and a new warrant officer well call him bootlicker  ampx200b  day one of my return old timer pulls me into his office and gives me a solid welcome back  he asks a little about what happened in qatar but tells me everything is a clean slate and to work at the level i was before my tour  great i thought  i work a further six months  life was easy the job was cushy  but i started to despise all things military i hated calling people sir just because they had a certain rank on their shirt i hated anything that infringed on my time outside of working hours such as marching parades  but still non of these things were dealbreakers yet  because i had started to hate being in the military i decided to move off camp with my gf and found an apartment 10  minutes drive away  things were great i started to have more of a worklife balance i got that great feeling when i drove off camp every day  work was becoming a minor part of my life and it just became 40hours i needed to be somewhere each week  i started to realise my 21k didnt go as far when i needed to pay 800 a month on rent plus bills  for some perspective my girlfriend was working in mcdonalds and earning nearly 16k a year with overtime  albeit she didnt have private medical and free dental  but in the uk we have nhs anyway and i have strong teeth and never needed a filling in my life    ampx200b  but i was in line for a promotion right that would have bumped me up to around 31k  old timer said i had a clean slate and my work for the last 6months had been good and i never took any sick days  report writing comes old timer is too high a rank to write my report and bootlicker didnt write reports for people in our department yet  so they drafted a senior nco from a different department to write my annual report well call him penfold looked exactly like the cartoon character  penfold writes an average bang report and gives me a developing for my overall score  the way the promotion board looks at your last three years any developing basically puts you bottom of the pile  so just like that a guy who barely knew me writes me up and wipes out three years of work  i told colleagues and they said i should fight it  but deep down i was done  ampx200b  for the following two months i went soul searching i was creeping 30 with a shitty salary and a job i now hated with each passing day  i had a friend who lived in gibraltar and worked for an online poker company  i knew a lot about online poker and figured i could work my way into that industry with my admin skills and experience with the product  i spent most of my early 20s playing poker for a living and it supplemented my salary whilst i was in the military  i visited him and he showed me how he was living the dream in this sunny paradise earning 60k a year and working in poker something i have always loved  ampx200b  that was it i was going to do everything i could to get into this industry  upon returning from that holiday i instantly put in my resignation  now here is the kicker i see many stories here where people hand in their two weeks notice gladfully or dont even do that and quit on the spot and walk out    ampx200b  that is not happening in the military and you can be court marshalled and jailed  ampx200b  instead once you hand in your resignation you have to work a further 12months until you can leave  this means you cant job hunt until the last 34 months so unlike civies where you can apply whilst you still have a job and monkey branch across without the risk of unemployment this system leaves you working months with the impending anxiety of not getting a job in a field you want  ampx200b  it is a great trap mechanism  but it did come with a getout clause if you received a job offer during your resignation period you could leave if your commanding officer was willing to sign off on it  now my co old timer had released a friend of my 6months prior and within a threeweek time scale  with this knowledge i began halfarsed throwing my cv to companies that i would move heaven and earth to work for but i had low expectations as i was only one month into my resignation timeline  i had a few interviews and finally heard back from one who offered me a job in malta    ampx200b  bingo they sent me an official job offer with a start date in four weeks the very next day i walked into work with the printed job offer and directly handed it to both old timer and bootlicker  they seemed shocked that id managed to get a job so fast and the job offer showed the starting salary  given that the military pays pretty poorly these days i am sure when old timer saw the starting pay for my new job was in reaching distance of his and may have been slightly jealous hed dedicated 35years of his life to this job be on 60kish towards the end  he took the paperwork and said he would get back to me soon i did push and said can it be soonish given the start date and the fact its in another country i would need to get my affairs in order pronto   ampx200b  i accepted the job offer and began organising myself to leave there was no reason to keep me i had like seven months of actual work time left when you factor my holidays and we just became wellstaffed for the first time in two years  i figured it was a slam dunk  ampx200b  two weeks pass and i still havent heard anything i keep plaguing each manager wtf is going off  i jump between old timer bootlicker and penfold who had become a secondary manager to me as well bullshit but whatever i was leaving  after avoiding me for two weeks penfold rings me to deliver the news  all three of them had held a meeting and decided i was to see out my 12 months because manning was an issue at the moment  fucking little wankers i thought  i reminded penfold on the phone of the mental anxiety i had from qatar and gave him a wink that it would likely resurface now he called my bluff and said we have excellent medical facilities and they would be willing to help  ampx200b  i put the phone down shaking my dreams felt shattered and i felt physically sick at the thought of returning to that office and working with those guys as my bosses for another seven months  i sat up late into the night thinking of a plan i wrote on my phone notepad all my thoughts and feelings tinged with lies of a drinking problem and added a suicidal tone in there as well i am sorry to anyone reading this that may be suicidal and the fact i sunk so low to use that is not something i am proud of  my home life was great with my girlfriend and i wanted to cut off that cancer which was my job  and i was prepared to fight fire with fire  i knew the only way the military would take me seriously was if i was suicidal and drinking was involved  ampx200b  very next morning i ring the station medical centre and ask for an emergency appointment specifically with a nonmilitary doctor  this was important because my mental breakdown was due to the confines of military rule and i couldnt be dealing with some uppy little shit officer trying to push me back into work  ampx200b  to be honest i didnt need to fake anything i was pent up with nerves anxiety and rage i was stuttering and muttering and literally handed the doctor my phone with all the notes i had made the previous night i hadnt slept and i purposely looked like shit as well  she was friendly and told me to go for a walk to shake off some of my anxiety  she signed me off for three weeks and booked me a meeting with a mental health specialist  ampx200b  one week to go for my start date and i am still holding out that there is like a 10 chance i can still make it i hope the three musketeers decide the juice isnt worth the squeeze with me    ampx200b  they dont and double down to entrap me  i keep in contact with the job in malta and they say theyre willing to wait a few more weeks for me this gives me some breathing room and i decide to push forward on a full medical discharge for my mental state  i knew going into the mental health assessment they needed a named condition before they could discharge me  so i began researching all the various mental health illnesses my initial thought was i was going to stick with crippling anxiety until i came across bipolar  as i read through this condition i started to realise it was a tick sheet for myself  but weirdly enough it was something i knew about myself but had managed to self medicate for years unknowingly  i would have mad spouts of depression which i could quickly turn around by destroying myself in the gym for 3months and eating clean  i would go from skinny fat to sixpack ready for the beach in literally two months and i would get high off people complimenting my quick turnaround  this is something i had performed without fail throughout my 20s and i had become relatively efficient at it  my mum was also diagnosed with it and i know it runs in the family   ampx200b  so theoretically i wasnt even lying in my assessment but instead bringing to light something i had managed to control anyway  this whole situation most likely brought out the worst part of this disorder  looking back at the time i believed i was lying and just using these doctors to get out asap    ampx200b  this didnt work but instead they just signed me off long term sick where i would have to visit the doctors biweekly  this meant the job was in the bin  a full medical discharge would take months to push through  upside i was getting full pay and only had to see a doctor every two weeks  i enjoyed this time at home with my gf she worked still but i was always around and we had a lot of fun i played fifa 19 every day and built a pretty decent ultimate team  i was living the dream to be honest  my future was always on the horizon and that did give me a lot of anxiety   ampx200b  because i was in the military bootlicker would have to check in on me every couple of weeks we would have the occasional phone call where we both pretended like i would do a days work at the office before i left doctors had promised me that theyd keep signing me off until i finished i was going through the motions before my official medical discharge  ampx200b  three months before i left one of the nurses suggested filling out this military compensation form and highlighting the onset of my anxiety and bipolar from my time in qatar  i did this and sent it off with no second thought  ampx200b  medical discharge successfully goes through and they give me a date which is in six weeks  boom all engines go i had to get my ass in gear and find a job  i started firing my cv off again and had a few interviews but pay sucked and it wasnt quite malta  i thought that ship had sunk but my gf just told me to ring the manager and see if that job was still available  it seems obvious looking back but i didnt even think of that as an option  i did it with little expectations and he offered me the job outright after some deliberation with his higherups i had to be there in a month so we sold all our furniture car the lot   ampx200b  the last week of living in my old apartment i got a letter from the military compensations bureau stating i would be receiving 18k in compensation  i couldnt believe it this was the most amount of money i had in my life  i had also spent those eight months reading selfhelp guides and financial books like rich dad poor dad  i knew i needed to invest this money  ampx200b  i moved to malta in march 2020 just as covid19 crash

3672,Even with a cushy job as a software engineer... man... working for money is depressing,just wanted to get this out there so maybe some can learn from my experience  so when i was starting my career some people did this thing where they would get out of college and basically try to speed run a career so theyd study for a googlefacebooknetflix interview get the job live the most frugal life possible and put every dollar towards retirement so they could retire by 3040 theyd go so far as to live in vans in the parking lot and eat nothing but chickenricebroccoli that theyd buy in bulk  now i get why they did that once you get to 30 you realize this is completely unmaintainable and soul crushing  ive noticed owners of business are not the same as the rest of us i got my first job at 14 picking apples the owner of the orchard took great pleasure in firing literal children then when their parents came to pick them up he would berate their parents about how shitty their kid was for not being a good worker my next job at 15 was at a pizza place mostly staffed by refugees the boss would come in every day then empty the tip jar for himself and explain i have two kids in private college so i need this money more than the workers bruh most of these guys here are literally just trying to afford rent in their ghetto 1bedroom that they share with another family jfc  and in software its no different i worked in a small company where wed have direct contact with the ceo and his behavior was just callous we had a product we had to release to bring to a major conference we all worked our asses off one of my coworkers literally rented a hotel directly next to work to cut out the commute and worked 14 hours a day i was there nights and weekends but i felt i was being clever by asking for comp time  you know what happens right after the release he fires us for not working hard enough meanwhile he worked a 3 day workweek my manager is pissed because they didnt even tell him so gets another job and they offer him a measly 5 raise to stay he declines two weeks later they text him and say we thought it would be hard without you but we dont need you excuse me but what the fuck and as for my comp time they just shrug and say what comp time lol got that in writing anywhere try and find it in your email oh yeah you cant and what happens next they outsource all the maintenance and new development to moldovan and ukrainian developers that they pay 30kyear  then the boss goes to the conference and presents it smugly like he personally sat down and wrote all this code himself you know what he was doing that whole time come to find out he wasnt even logging onto his computer he was at his third house in a vacation destination just hanging out thats right he had 3 houses his one 5 bedroom home in the most bougie part of town a guest house right next to it that had 5 bedrooms and a vacation home in the mountains and he told us time and time again listen the business just cant afford to pay developers more  sorry  and i cant confirm this but i am almost certain that the boss of this company found a way to drag our names through the mud because finding a job after even as a software engineer was next to impossible in my city if i applied anywhere i would never get a response or a near instant no even after applying to hundreds or thousands of positions it felt like i was blacklisted i had to move across the country where i was able to find an abundance with just a few applications  so whenever i hear workers arent working hard enough i feel a knot in my stomach remembering these times,pka9p3

thinking of taking this path  when i tell people i worked as a wildlife biologist for the federal government that specialized in endangered species people usually ask my why i left or how cool of a job it must have been i used to put on a face and tell them it was good while it lasted but now im just honest about how it was 95 bullshit the 5 are the just as frustrated friends i made along the way and the handson learning   when i graduated college with my bachelors degree i did a 6 month stint on a wildlife reservation for usfws partnering with americorps similar to peace corps i had to do this in order to have an upperhand against the other people who would also be fresh out of college and applying for fed jobs i was paid less than minimum wage because you are technically considered a volunteer   it came out to 600 a month  375hr   i was lucky enough that my station provided housing most did not you are also given food stamps i always found it highly ironic that i would qualify for food stamps while serving the government   while working alongside highschoolers who got paid 15hr but who had been hired through an outreach program in the community to help give kids experience to get into college this is bullshit most colleges will let you in if you have a gpa over 3 and money in your hands   after this it was impossible to find work in the winter in my field so i went home and applied for the next season this volunteer work had given me an upperhand though and i qualified for a position with the bureau of land management the next summer   this job paid me minimum wage 13hr with no benefits and was only guaranteed for 6 months  i was expected to hike up and down ridiculously steep grades 68 hours a day i was openly told we were the most hated branch of the government and that was why our cars were unmarked but we also are not allowed to carry guns tazers or mace into the back country with us they gave usa cheap air compression blow horn and radio your closest partner is 45 minutes away  this was when i was beginning to realize this was not the work i was meant for   i wanted to help these animals that were going extinct due to human abuse of the earth  however i quickly realized i was only there to record the numbers of their extinction i often came home crying and depressed about the helplessness i felt i went back the next year for one more 6 month term and when i witnessed a head biologist come under fire for advocating climate change i knew i needed to leave   the federal government at least the biology side of it will only hire you for 6 month terms until you have worked 4 6month terms then you can qualify to apply for a 1 year term after two 1 year terms you can qualify to apply for a four year term and thats as long as you get guaranteed you will have to reapply for your job every four years hr is obligated to contact interview and offer the job to any interested veterans before theyll look at civilians but if you were the person doing the 4 year job they will more than likely just reinstate you   i was 22 working alongside people in their late thirties who had long since qualified for those year long terms but werent veterans or didnt have phds or for whatever reason were continuously skipped over while also working under people in their late twentiesearly thirties who had stayed in college and gotten a phd if you have worked for the feds for 16 years on foxes without a phd and someone applies to the same job as you with minimal field experience and brand spanking new phd chances are you arent going to get the job knowing someone in the office wont help you either applications are usually gone through by hr sometimes a third party hr to try to alleviate bias   if you dont plan on continuing your education you will hit a ceiling regarding wages once you have hit the top wage for someone with a bachelors degree they will not bump your pay based on experience you will need to get a masters degree once you hit that ceiling you will need to get a phd   i left to make parttime at a dispensary that was going to pay me more plus tips i spent my new offtime making art reading gardening and volunteering with community environmentalists the woman who owned the dispensary liked my work and took me under her wing she showed me how to start my own business and now i work as a compliance contractor helping legal recreational marijuana farms file their forms with the countystate and offer advice on how to better follow the laws and standards set by the state i make my own hours i make twice as much money as i did working for the feds and i am treated with respect by my coworkers boss and the farmers i help i also have a consulting company for people who want to start homesteading which is something i used to dream about doing when i retired lol im not even 30 yet   i used to stay up at night dreading what might happen should i choose to leave this career path i had worked so hard to set myself on what would my parents think if i left the feds for weed would the pay really be better would i have stability  two years later and its the best decision i could have made i watched friends go unpaid when the government shut down i watched friends whose jobs were supposed to be 6 months get turned away after the first because of covid i have friends who live in vans and cars just trying to fight their way to something more than a 6 month position   i am thankful to have taken the leap of faith and landed safely on the other side i am starting the process of buying my own house and my partner and i have never had this kind of financial security all it took was dropping the veil of what having a respectable job looks like and losing the obligation to serve a countryworkplace that doesnt serve you,pkdf07

3710,Quit the same job multiple times.,this is more of a ventrant still a newbie here on reddit so if this post doesnt meet requirements my apologies never knew about reddit when i was working the job and if i did i would have posted like crazy   i worked in officemanufacturing and technically my first real job i worked a couple weekend gigs and at my high school food court so my experience wasnt much i started out in my 20s so i didnt know much after the first month i was put in charge while the owner left for vacation wouldnt have been an issue but we had an order a chain store the job had me doing data entry customer service taking calls from both customers and vendors production and shipping just after one month miraculously it seemed all went well until a few weeks after they came back and got a call from the chain store i screwed up with the invoice i used the same invoice  for all the different stores it took a couple of hours to fix really no big deal and the owner realized it was a huge order to have left me in charge with  years down the road with raises additional bouses and more tasks piled on having to work both office and production while having to deal with customersaccountsvendors plus employees who were forgetful even though they did the same thing almost every single day production would halt and orders placed on hold when we ran out of suppliesstock of items to finish the product needed to ship orders to customers that people forgot to mention we were low on since i was technically managers for both the office and warehouse the issue fell to me even though every department was in charge of their stocksinventory it happened constantly to a point i had to hide items so at least we had back up stock and i would have to place order when i gave them my stockpile so i was basically in charge of everything and everyone in the building  not only that my hours went from the normal 40 a week to 5060 hours6 days i was drained from work but also had my own responsibilities at home that had me leaving the house a couple of hours after getting off work to pick up my mom who didnt drive i was the only girl so the responsibility fell to me i tried talking to her but it was like talking to a recorder i got the same respond back that i was the girl so it was my job thankfully my brothers realized how tired i was and picked her up 23x a week  back to the demanding work things came to a head at times and when it was too much i would quit or at least tell the owner who would suddenly give me raises or days off i loved the job i was good at it but the environment and mostly the owner made it toxicdraining when my father passed i was only given one day off had to come in the next day but broke down from time to time when talking to customersclients the owner had told them what happened and they were shocked i was actually working i only mamanged a couple of hours but the owner was pissed that i was leaving early while they were in a meeting years later when the owners father passed they used as an excuse to why they were acting the way that they were i wasnt a bitch or petty and just told them take their time to mourn  got sidetracked again sometimes no one wanted to take responsibility or accountability for the screw ups which fell on me and sometimes they owned up to it because they knew i would try and quit again no one in that building wanted my job honestly no one was able to do my job   i did finally leave for a while but came back i trained someone before i left and they quit before i left i told them i wasnt extending it to train someone else months later i got a call i was short on cash so i took my job back but with less hours found out that the person who was suppose to work my job quit within weeks they couldnt find another replacement before it got too busy while i was gone 34 people had to take turns doing what i use to do to try and keep pace so the owner was nice for a while  months go by and basically the same crap happens there was a reason i actually quit not much had changed the owner was nice for a few months because i was needed it became a cycle of me having to talk to the owner every few months and say im at the end of my rope for the owner to be nice and then back to the crap that made me want to quit i put up with it for years as the pay was good with the bonuses i loved the job as it was a mix of both office and production so it wasnt too boring though it was chaotic unfortunately the owner was too toxic the turn around for people was quick i didnt care as some help was much better than no help  a few years ago i quit and never looked back they called and asked but i said no and stuck to it with all the hours i worked i had a lot saved up traveled and traveled some more  sorry for the long post i was currently browsing job listings related to office production and shipping as that is where my experiences are and not much has changed companies still want workers to do everything for as minimal pay they can get away with,pka14s

3746,My employer thinks I am great employee :),hello all  i recently have had my yearly performance review with my manager   he told me that my performance is splendid and there is nothing to complain or criticise about me   the job is in house it role at giant corporation i am software engineer mainly i do coding and some technical stuff on the top of those i am business analyst project manager product owner etc this part is important because they refused to give me payrise  due to not taking more responsibilities this is lame excuse because i have been doing non technical things which i dont suppose to do plus there is really nothing where i can take more responsibility ideally there should be at least one more person to cover everything i do except  payrise point i am quite surprised that they find my performance great why  since i started this job like 6  years ago i have not been working more than 3 hours per day 3 hours is maximum if there are some meetings to attend i usually work 1  15 hours per day i can work remotely all the time without any problem it has been the same pre pandemic as well this is boring and repetitive office work however i am getting paid quite okay   if they are okay with my current performance i will keep showing the same performance   the point is my job is still quite demanding in terms of delivering outputs i am willing to switch to a non technical it job where i can be middle man with minimal responsibilities i also hate working technical as there is always something to do or there is constant pressure to improve  update your skills   i am happy that i am quite close to achieve my antiwork dream where i have no to minimal responsibilities and getting paid really good amount of money,pkfchc

3801,"A year ago, I quit my job",hey all  so this is kinda the soft anniversary of when i really became disillusioned with my job i discovered this sub recently and i figure itd help me to put some of my thoughts to words whether or not anything actionable comes out of it  i was working at my universitys campus bookstore id gotten a couple of token raises but the pay was only a sliver above minwage id been working there for 3 years namely because they were willing to adjust my hours around my class schedule and the managers were all but one always actively working alongside the employees  since a lot of the other employees were seasonal i noticed gradual changes that others didnt often preceded by some ghoul or another from corporate visiting and tuttutting at the local managers usually these werent big changes but they were always a nuisance on the mildest end one of these regional managers wandered into the backroom to tell me i was hanging shirts the wrong way a more egregious change they phased out the mobile bookshelf units from the back room in favor of heavy shelves that could be rolled out to the sales floor for displayswhich made any backroom work much slower especially at the start of the semester when there were tens of thousands of orders to be sorted  one of my favorite parts of the job was the overnight shifts right before the semester began in which a few employees and a manager would blitz through gathering and boxing probably a good 400 online orders not many people enjoyed them but i was a big fan because your coworkers were grateful to get ahead of orders for the day you didnt have to deal with customers interrupting you with asinine questions and there was a great deal of satisfaction to be had from making visible progress on a quiet task the first red flag for me shouldve been when none of the managers wanted to do the overnight shifts in january of 2020 id communicated to the store director that i was interested in upward movement where it was available and she told me that i could fill the supervisor role because of my experience at the store if this went well theyd be happy to promote me to a shift management position in aprili think you see where this is going the overnight shifts went well and despite being myself and only one other person instead of the usual 45 we were able to keep a decent pacemaybe 60 as much done as if the usual complement had been there as well the store director was impressed and outright said that she wanted to keep me on board and there would be a promotion in store for me in april  when the pandemic intensified in late march that year everything on campus closed downbookstore included i spent that time on unemployment making about double what id make at the bookstore in half the time i wanted to work though and when in june i got a phone call about coming back to help with mailedin rental books i was more than happy to from there things kinda shifted to a business as usual attitude for the remainder of the summer things were slow but manageable and stop me if youve heard this one before i assumed that the management would recognize all the hard work i was putting in and think it was still worth it to promote me especially when the most junior manager was putting in his two weeks notice i brought up the possibility of getting that promotion again with the store director and she still seemed on board for it after things settled for startofsemester in september after this rush week i contacted my manager again about the promotion pointing out that i already do more work than other employees and just wanted my pay to reflect it once again the director agreed with me and said shed get back to me within the week she did but in the same breath asked me what additional responsibilities id take on to justify the pay raise to corporate  im already writing a lot more than i expected to so ill just shorten this bit and say pandemic customers have made a sport of finding new and exciting ways to be awful to our friends in retail and i was no exception with higherrisk members in my household with no hazard pay the university kicking and screaming to get another football season going and corporate trying to block someone from getting a managers pay for a managers work this was the breaking point and the store director and i both knew it i put in my two weeks and said my goodbyes  im lucky enough that as a student on quite a few scholarships id been able to save a good amount of money and coast on that im one of the lucky ones that i could take a year off and ive been spending this time doubling down on writing and selfpublishing after all if im not going to make enough money to get by why not fail to make enough while doing something i love instead  all of this said im finally approaching a turning point where i might need to get a real job again if only to maintain my health insurance im about to graduate with surprisingly little student debt small blessings and with the pandemic showing no signs of letting up i feel like going back to work is either a waste of time or a genuine source of danger to my household i dont think theres really a thesis to all of this other than just expressing my frustration but hey what else are we gonna do other than vent thanks for listening hopefully this might serve as a cautionary tale for others not to push themselves past their limits  even when your bosses seem to be pulling for you their hands might be tied  tldr  i fell for the work real hard and youll earn that promotion scam

3838,Am I paranoid or is my job setting me up to get fired?,long post sorry in advance  i am a part time 3rd shift shelf stocker at a grocery store firstly i am fully aware that this may be due in part to my number of call ins i have a nasty habit of calling in to work when i probably shouldnt besides this though i go into work on time do my job as instructed and leave on time   next the potential signs im wondering about  1 im getting less hours ive gone from working 5 days a week 6 hours a shift to working 2 days or if im lucky 3 my boss has claimed that this is because of my call ins and they want to give me the time and space i need what weirds me out is the fact that i know im not the only one in my department dealing with this problem  ive heard others bringing it up with management as well and management claimed itll fix itself on the other hand rather than giving me the hours straight up after i asked for them the managers are pushing for us to volunteer in other departments and have actually hired a bunch of new people for my department allegedly due to being short staffed however even though theyve hired more help they continue to tell us that theyre desperate for more hours to be filled and despite me asking twice i havent received said hours  2 being left out of meetings my managers have recently enacted a rule of having a department meeting every night to discuss issues concerns etc  despite this being an every night occurance supposedly theres only been about three on nights i have worked i learned about things said at these meetings through my coworkers rather than the actual gathering itself this could just be because my managers arent bothering to have one every night but its hard to say  3 being given more work than i can handle ill admit  im not the fastest worker but i certainly try and genuinely take pride in my work when i can actually finish stocking up an aisle fully by the end of my shift problem is management likes to schedule me to work on 2 aisles rather than one and after working here for about 7 months  they know im not equipped in either my hours nor my skill to get both completely finished in a reasonable time its immensely frustrating because i know i can finish one aisle when given the time but having to work on 2 and sheepishy having to tell the manager that i couldnt get them both done seems a bit like theyre setting me up for failure theyre also looking to add on more tasks to monitor our work despite me and the rest of the department already having an issue completing what we have  4 i ordered new shirts a long while back and havent received any pretty self explanatory im in need of new uniform shirts and havent gotten any despite usually being handed new shirts from the back the minute when i ask i had to fill out an order form about a month ago and havent gotten any small gripe but i may be overthinking all this   5 they might have somehow learned that i reported one of their best men  an actively patronizing toxic and slightly sexist manager who had given quite a lot of time to the company i imagine he may have figured it out himself an tattled on me given the constant tension between us but i cant exactly confirm nor deny this one  sorry about this long winded list im incredibly anxious about this massive cut in hours because im going to be missing rent payments and likely not eating if this keeps up i have already applied for partial unemployment and am waiting for that to kick in thanks all,pjz675

3900,Do dream jobs actually exist?,ive been working for a couple of years to what you might consider a dream job i got into it because when i found out that some people i admire has done the same i thought i could do it too and it could be an interesting thing to pursue before i do what i really wanted to do in life   after studying in college and getting into my dream field i wasnt working on projects that i really wanted to do i thought that i needed to pay my dues before i get a chance to get hired on these huge projects my field is essentially jumping from contract to contract with some unemployment breaks in between so there isnt very much stability unless your get a staff job at a large company   while i was working at these dream jobs at arent that great i was taking private classes to level up my skills i remember there was this one day at work that was going horribly a lot of people on my team kept assuming that i knew how everything about how things worked around here even though i never got properly trained so i always had to learn on the fly after a meeting i went back to my desk looked around the office and i got this epiphany i realized this is not what i saw myself doing at this point in my life  that night i talked about it to my then teacher who is someone that has worked on these projects that i dreamed of working on i told him about what happened at work and how i felt he told me that even he has felt the same thing while working at these dream jobs it made me think whats the point to stay in this field  so the years went by and i stayed in this field because its all i know i could do for work and i kept seeing these same patterns everywhere i got hired companies keep understaffing when theres clearly a need for more help on a project they undertrained their employees because they dont want to and dont have the time they always pay as cheaply as possible because they can easily manipulate you by saying you are doing this for the passion they constantly expect from you to do unpaid overtime that slowly kills production schedules keep getting tighter on top of that they expect high quality work done a low budget there is more but the combination of it all creates a hostile environment  when covid hit and i started working from home it was a little better but i can see this downward spiral where companies realizes they get even cheaper labor  so now i am thinking of simply quitting but im not sure what else i could do instead i could go into an adjacent field but i see a lot of similar problems what can i do btw that thing that i really wanted to do is somewhat in an adjacent field but i would rather do that as a hobby for free  i have a friend who has quit and suggested that i try what he does but i am afraid of getting into something with rose coloured glasses and then realizing its not as great as it sounds to be  anybody else had a similar experience with their dream job do dream jobs really exist,pj3ny4

4009,Happiness is bad for consumerism.,the marketing and advertising industry depend on people being unhappy because they can then basically sell you the idea of happiness through their products if more women for example accepted how they looked naturally and realised that they dont need make up the make up industry would basically be over and a lot of people would lose a lot of money  the whole industry depends on making the consumer feel like theyre not good enough if they dont have the latest iphone or whatever it is and of course everything they sell us is designed to make us momentarily satisfied so that we keep buying but if someone doesnt give a fuck and is at peace with themselves they dont feel the need to buy unnecessary things to fill a void  i would even go as far as saying our whole society depends on us being unhappy because when people are unhappy theyre more willing to sell their souls at mindless job theyre doing only for the money  basically what im saying is happinesshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjiaefm8lu is bad for consumerism,piwyx2

4016,Need to vent,im leaving my current job on friday and gave less than two weeks notice because my boss was dicking me around   one a contractor employee through a third party company for one of the most famous universities in the us my position is administrative and i started a full 6 months before my boss during that time i was doing basically her job in addition to general admin duties and working my ass off and by the time we interviewed her and hired her i was on the hiring committee and felt that she would be awesome to work with though she had never managed anyone before   now the part of the university i work at is fairly new and has been sort of notoriously toxic to work for in circles around here i was hired as a contractor and was told i would be converted when my contract was up that didnt happen because of a hiring freeze but my contract was extended for another year thats where i should have seen the first red flag but i am dumb and liked what i was doing at the time so i stuck with it they outright hired three people including my boss during that time   things were okay at first and i was basically training her how to be a manager because i had managed people before and she hadnt i just didnt want to manage people which is why i switched jobs in the first place   then come january something happened and she basically became a micromanager and kept giving me stranger and more vague tasks and was upset when i couldnt meet her deadlines or when i asked for clarification then she had me filling out a daily task list of everything i did and how long each task took me because she didnt know what i did all day she didnt know because shes a researcher and has never done administrative work before and didnt want to learn what i did   they extended my contract again once that one was up and told me they were getting ready to actually start the hiring process a few weeks ago the job was posted and she conveniently forgot to tell me it was until it was almost too late i got all my work in order and applied thinking i would stay for a few more months to a year and then look elsewhere within my university i went through the entire interview process i filled out their questionnaire with answers and then they just picked my interview date and time because she knows my schedule they were 10 minutes late to my interview and it lasted less than 30 minutes when it was scheduled for an hour no one asked me any real questions of substance and the questions i asked in return were met with thats a good question ill have to get back to you   then she went on vacation but not really because she had meetings she couldnt miss when she came back from vacation the hiring team met to discuss who they would hire that monday i asked on tuesday if she had any information for me and she said she didnt and i told her that i had an offer and i wanted to consider my options without leaving anyone stranded she was excited for me to have an offer but she wasnt transparent with me about the process at all she seemed surprised i had another offer as if i wasnt looking because nothing is for certain when it comes to interviews well i waited and came to the conclusion that because they didnt tell me right away i wasnt the chosen candidate and my work buddy on the hiring committee told me as much without telling me everything because she wasnt allowed to she encouraged me to quit before i was out of two jobs   i asked her the next day if she had an answer for me and when she got really defensive and aggressive i put in my resignation if she was going to act like that she didnt deserve two weeks notice she tried to tell me that three weeks is required by this university no nothing is required in an atwill state maam you dont know the labor laws youre not a good manager   since then shes been basically micromanaging harder and being on a complete power trip tuesday is a holiday for me and i opted to continue working but asked to be remote so i could be with my family she declined and said that she had decided onsite work was necessary so i needed to be there she said i could request the day off but just because i can request it doesnt mean she will approve it my last day is this friday and im stoked she spent all of this past friday giving me impossible tasks with impossible timelines knowing i had tasks that required me to drive around all day and beoffline too   i was very close to quitting right then and there and i think thats what shes trying to get me to do   i was also told that this was her first time ever going through the hiring process and shes never hired anyone before ive done that too and its not that hard i was told that the whole process was a mess by three different people i work with   im glad im getting out of there im just annoyed that this is how its going down i wish that i could have stayed to leave on my own terms with benefits   anyone think im going crazy or that im reading this wrong she chose her words very carefully to say i was denied my request to work from home and then told me i could request the day off not that i could take the day off shes a phd i know that she thought about this a lot to cya,pitdht

4018,I turned down a better position with more pay and guaranteed hours! Here's why.....,i turned down a transfer offer within my job because i decided that my current ob was actually the best choice for me the transfer job had more guaranteed hours and a small increase in pay not to mention benefits the job im currently at i can pick my own hours days i want to work i originally wanted the guarantee hours and more pay   but this better position required mandatory ot over 50 hours week and the long 10 hours a day made me rescind the offer it would be back to back 4 sometimes 5 days a week   the regular work world never worked out for me because i hated working on their time i didnt like the fact that my pre picked schedule interfered with family and life things and being forced to work on holidays really was not my favorite thing i can work holidays if i want to at my current position   my current position i choose my own schedule and time when i want to work and if i want to be off on holidays thats my decision sometimes i do choose to work long 9 at the most hours only if i really need the cash i usually pick half days and sometimes full days but get at least 30 hours a week i can be off 34 days a week   overall i rather work for myself but it fits my worklife schedule the summary i never liked slave labor and being on someone elses schedule   i know i turned down guaranteed hours and an increase in pay but i choose sanity and somewhat freedom over it,piwicr

4178,How/When did the American people become convinced that Living Wage is a ''privilege''?,this isnt a rhetorical question im genuinely curious as this seems like a good place to get an answer  when the minimum wage was introduced by fdrs administration in 1938 it was supposed to enable every working person to acquire the basic necessities of independent living however 60 years later a huge majority of older americans are convinced that a living wage is a privilege and people like fast food restaurant cooks and farmhands dont deserve a living wage because their jobs are unskilled labor furthermore if such workers complain about this they are called entitled  officially but not legitimately capitalism is a social contract between the elite and the working class in which the working class will work for money which they will use to better themselves if your employer does not pay you a living wage there is absolutely no point in working for said employer   so im genuinely curious how boomers and gen xers were brainwashed into perceiving living wage as a privilege and not a right,pi2scs

4189,In praise of idleness,dear all antiworkers and others interested in this sub i just stumbled upon this sub and thought i would see if you were aware of bertrand russell and he writing in the 1935 he wrote in praise of idleness which is a short but precise essay on where the working most of the week mentality comes from and why it was already obsolete almost a hundred years ago  httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiinpraiseofidlenessandotheressays  in short machines and automation should people more free time it is the whole idea of inventing technology  to make life easier and thereby give us more time and energy for other things   i myself have managed to buy a decent piece of land with a group such our individual expenses are quite low ive then found a local job at a school they wanted me full time but i refused and now work 24 hours a week  which still feels like full time btw cause its new and teaching kids is hard but hopefully not with time   the ideal of living in a collective or small villagetribe is that the stronger such a community can become the more independent it is opposed to society government and big corps etc and the better we can negotiate cause how can we put demands on those big international forces when we ares still dependent on getting our food from the supermarket and our water and electricity from the government plants etc,pi8ump
4190,TO ALL NAY SAYERS AND TO THOSE WHO CANT RELATE TO THIS GROUP.,so this post is for everyone in this group but more directly to those who either dont understand our perception or are here for amusement as ive only just logged back on after a while of not being on reddit and seen a few people trying to slag this group off on this page  so i would like to share a brief story of why i am personally a member of this group and what led me here please feel free to object or argue any points as i am always willing to grow my perspective on things  i am 27 in the uk  i did an apprenticeship from the age of 1721 and i enjoyed it so i do understand how it feels to not understand people who dont like work  all i would say is if your here because your curious about what we think and how we see things then ask us politely this is a discussion thread i am sure there is more than a dozen people online all the time that would be happy to share their perspective with you   if your struggling to relate just a little bit then imagine you were in a job that was not satisfactory and it brought nothing for you but stress and a bit of pocket money after your bills now stress can affect your energy levels your physical and mental health and motivation etc so never underestimate what stress can do too you now changing jobs is easy enough if you can find one but what if this next job is worse what if the manager or the work colleagues are not nice what if they make you work longer hours for nothing well you got no choice because now you have bills to pay and the only way you can feel better is instant gratification like sugar and alcohol and even drugs if its extremely badbecause remember due to stress your in no state to get to the gym and cook for yourself and have a good time with your mates if your being overworked and underpaid and your stressed give it a couple of years of this and you start to feel a huge sense of despair and anxiety because you feel like your in this horrible situation and you cant dont anything about it you start reminiscing about the good times when you were at schoolcollege and you wonder what has changedyouve started working you seen you identitysense of excitement for life just completely stripped away but you cant complain because people have it worse offnow ive been diagnosed with depressionanxiety because of work and they give you a little leaflet of natural ways to improve your mental health which is spend time in nature eat organic exercise be kind and social look at the positive things so i look around and see everybody spends daylight hours inside a building away from the sun and nature most jobs are in front of a screen so theres no exercise most jobs people dont enjoy and find stressful and so theres only a stressful enviromentcommunity then you think wait a minute humans natural habitat is to be in nature and exercising and eat naturally from the earth so why have we taken ourselves away from it all why is suicide rate so high and so many people directly and indirectly deal with mental health problems in first world countries why do we have billionaires in the world but people literally starving in other parts of the world because the capitalistic system and the people at the top who are running it dont care about what is good for everyone they only care for themselves we have enough food to feed the whole world the knowledge and technology for everyone to have access to electrical energy and a healthy habitat lifestyle but people at the top and the people who are running this system dont care about that or us i speak for myself and perhaps others in this group when i say im not willing to spend my life miserably contributing to this system that has brought so many of us to our knees id rather spend my life doing everything i can to get rod of it because the sooner we do and replace it with a much more human friendly system the sooner we will move forward in a positive direction as a species  now this year i have been living off universal credit and personal independence payments because i have suffered a huge mental breakdown this year which i think was covid related and my industry falling to pieces after spending 10 years in my industry building a career to get out of the rat race as soon as possible i ended up going into hospital for over 3 weeks because of it so despite my views on this system i am also thankful for it supporting me whilst ive been in a bad place but i would also argue its the system that has put me in a bad place  im getting better and have started retraining in the health and fitness industry which overall is much better for both physical and mental health so i hope to one day get to a point where i actually enjoy doing what im doing day to day instead of just looking forward to that end goal which i dont believe anybody should be doing should all be about living in the present but hey what do i know apparently im mental lol i hope this helps people out there ,pihjoh
4191,The Magic Hammer,long long ago in a land far far away there was a poor carpenter who worked tirelessly to provide for his family  every day he would hammer and cut and sand to create chairs and tables and toys for the people of his village  he was beloved by them  but they too were poor and could not pay him very well for his craft  ampx200b  one day he was cutting into a tree trunk when from it emerged a tiny winged woman  she chastised him for destroying her home  he looked into her eyes and took pity on her  by way of apology he promised to make her a new home better than before  ampx200b  he got to work and set out as if to make this his masterpiece  after a full days work of planing and cutting sawing and drilling he presented her with a miniature house complete with a miniature bed alongside miniature table and chairs  ampx200b  she was happy with his gift and gladly accepted it  but was dismayed to see how long it took him to create  in return spoke some magic words to his hammer and was never seen again  ampx200b  from that day forth the carpenter could with a single tap of the hammer instantly turn a tree trunk into the most beautiful table or a sturdy door frame or a wooden carriage or anything he could imagine  ampx200b  the village prospered and the carpenter and his family lived happily ever after  ampx200b    ampx200b  one hundred years later in that very same town jacob awoke as the church tower clock struck eight  just as the sun had already set behind the mountains he was breaking his fast with a bowl of rolled oats  he prepared his makeshift bed which consisted of an uncomfortable mattress atop a haggard old dining table  he then tidied the house for his brother would have to sleep and live there while he was away at work  later as he entered the carpenters workshop he saw the usual ugly little lumps of wood  thousands upon thousands of them all as if soldiers in neat rank and file as far as his eyes could see  his brother wilhelm deflated after a grueling twelve hour shift handed jacob the magical hammer  the brothers made eye contact as they passed each other  but remained silent for there was nothing to say  and with that jacob set to work  ampx200b  taptaptap  getting into the rhythm trying to maintain his target of one crafting every second  followed by his two supervisors ensuring he didnt fall behind his quota  ampx200b  he admired all of the beautiful creations appearing before his eyes  a door a table a wagon wheel a bed frame  he wished he could afford a bed frame so ornate and sturdy  but saving for such a luxury would take months nay years  ampx200b  after his twelve hours of labour with a trembling hand he passed the hammer back to his brother  on his way out of the workshop he passed the same hundred rows and hundred columns of wood except now they were not just lumps of wood but masterpieces  ampx200b  all of them to be transported to the man who possessed the sheet of paper claiming ownership over all goods made with the hammer  except of course for every single freshly crafted bed frame  these instead lay just outside the building in an untidy heap ready for collection  but the local merchant who had purchased them lit the bedframes ablaze so as to maintain the value of the bed frames he already owned  ampx200b  jacob wished he could become such a merchant but alas he did not have the education or training needed to know when to buy when to sell and when to burn your stock in an open fire  ampx200b  the foreman handed him the days wages ninety copper pieces ten shy of the hundred that had been agreed  you miss hit one of your hammer strikes the bed frame turned out malformed we cannot sell that  youre lucky we didnt deduct the full value of a bedframe  it would take you some time to pay back ten thousand copper pieces  a fair assessment he thought for the sheet of paper with his promised wage did include such a clause  ampx200b  no sooner had the money hit the palm of his hand than he had to give twenty pieces back to the woman standing beside the foreman  the representative of the king demanding subject each pay their tax to the crown  he resented the king taking his hard earned pittance  ampx200b  at this point he was feeling quite thirsty so he made his way to the river  the river merchant seated in a hut on the bank offered to sell him a pitcher of water for fifty copper pieces  jacob begrudgingly accepted  curses he thought now i only have twenty copper pieces left  if i had not been mugged by the king this morning i would be twice as rich  ampx200b  as he sipped his carefully rationed drink he witnessed a vagabond stealing water from the river  fool he said to himself she shall regret stealing from the man who possesses the sheet of paper claiming ownership over all of the water that flows through this river  ampx200b  two men emerged from the river merchants hut carrying with them each a great club  they beat the unkempt woman with their clubs until she could no longer stand  we are doing this for your own good they said  you deprive me of water for my own good she responded still under attack  what if the man who possesses the sheet of paper claiming ownership over all of the water that flows through this river decides to poison it  ampx200b  jacob watched these events unfold feeling as though even if he had the inclination to stop justice being served he would be powerless to do so  he treated himself to another small mouthful of water content in the knowledge that even if the river was poisoned his costly ration would be untainted  ampx200b  a representative from the crown appeared and politely asked that they stop the beating  this man derided the vagabond for being a drain on the community and called her a parasite  he purchased an extra small pitcher of water from the merchant and offered it to the woman  but before she could accept he told her in order to receive his generous gift she must first offer to make herself useful  she approached the merchant in the hut and asked if he would take on the employment of an extra goon  the merchant looked at her slight frame and laughed at her and said he had no need of her services  with that the kings representative gave her the water  ampx200b  that is my money he is spending jacob thought to himself  he is spending my money on that ungrateful parasite and tomorrow as thanks she will be approaching my employer offering to undercut my wage  ampx200b  it was approaching noon time for jacob to return home to bed and psychologically prepare himself for his next days work  on his way he encountered a small girl who asked him what he did for a living  after he explained it the child said to him  you must be very happy to be able to make so many things  i wish i was able to make so many things  if i could i would make everything everyone needs and give it to them for free  ampx200b  jacob admitted that providing things for the people of the town would make him happy  but then he thought of the man who possessed the sheet of paper claiming ownership over all goods made with the hammer  it may take some convincing for him to allow jacob to simply give the fruits of his labour away free of charge  perhaps he could purchase the sheet of paper he wondered how long it would take him to save such money  ampx200b  he felt a chill of unease creep up his spine  he tried to repress thoughts he ought not think  a memory flashed before his eyes of when he was a child perhaps the age of the girl in front of him  there were rumours of the farmer who wielded a magic sickle similar to his magic hammer  this farmer would give out food to all king and beggar alike with complete disregard for the wishes of the one possessing the sheet of paper claiming ownership over the food  ampx200b  he tried not to think on it but he knew how the story ended  how the paper owners rose up and settled their differences with the king and together they put the farmer to death along with his wife and their small child  they put to death every farmer in his village every farmers wife every innocent child  every house burnt to the ground  the village still in ruin and abandoned to this day  ampx200b  he swallowed a lump in his throat and said to her  take an advice  giving things away for free sounds good in your heart but it never works out in real life,pihu4t

4233,Quit my terrible job,i had a fairly unique field service job driving around all over 3 counties in my state installing and servicing a product for homeowners the work itself was actually enjoyable to me however we were basically expected to be available to work from 8am to 6pm at the very least not counting drive times to get to the first stop and home from the last which sometimes could be up to 2 hours away this meant many days id leave at 6am and get home at 8pm i worked anywhere from 5065 hours a week depending on how my service calls for that week lined up  we also were on this shitty rotation where we worked monday thru friday had sat sun and the following monday off and then worked tuesday thru saturday with sunday off and back at it the next monday every other week was a 3 day weekend with a 1 day in between sounds okay on paper i guess but when working 60 hours a week guess what happens to the one day weekend youre at home doing housework and not getting a rest   on top of that more often than not we were under additional mandatory overtime where we had to pick one day from our 3 day weekend and work a full shift making it a 2 day in reality  the starting wage for this job isnt even enough for a single person to pay rent for a 1 bed apartment in this extremely expensive region  the company was and still is also very short handed making the already long hours even worse trying to pack in as much work as possible to pick up the slack of missing four technicians even when we were fully staffed it was still usually 60hours a week   roughly six months ago my idiot general manager asked how i was doing and i was honest i told her that the hours were too much unsustainable and abusive   she attempted to placate me by telling me my 56 pm appointment slot was blocked out and had always been blocked out which was a lie or didnt stop scheduling from putting things there and that she wouldnt make me give up one of my days on the 3 day which she did but i somehow still ended up working just as many hours over less days she also offered a sales position when soandso salesperson was promoted to national sales which is something i wanted but there was no time frame  about 2 months ago i was contacted by a company that does something completely different but another field service sort of thing   by this time i am completely disgruntled just holding on because i dont want to leave a job with nothing lined up ive already mentally checked out of this job and just doing the bare minimum i start finding out about the new company and job i was just contacted about  i am at a particularly complex install that was scheduled from 8am to 5pm and miraculously have nothing on my schedule after it i saw this the night before and made rare social dinner plans  i was finishing up about an hour early not that anyone knew this because we work solo when i was trying to switch inventory from my truck to the customers account and the phone app we use for this is malfunctioning so i restart it and thats when i see a service call had been put on my schedule per the gm  im totally pissed now as it means i have to cancel dinner i sent her a text asking if we were expected just to not have any life outside of work on days we are scheduled  she calls me and by this point im just done and i tell her that i dont know why i bother to continue coming to work i dont need to be there and i could easily move on she tells me i am a great technician and she would hate to see me leave she asks what she can do  i tell her i need a mental day to which she demands a doctors note easy enough two different therapists have been telling me to quit this job for months   about a month goes by and i have an offer with a significant pay increase on the table   i waffled back and forth on quitting on the spot or giving two weeks because thats what ive been brainwashed to do and in the end i decided to give one week seemed like an okay compromise between my mental well being and giving my coworkers a little time to prepare for the shit they will be eating in my absence  i gave notice saying that my last day was the next friday which was only 4 work days because i gave notice on the friday before my 3 days off  the general manager is furious she is getting tears in her eyes and shaking with anger itd be nice if you gave me two weeks to which i reply that i have to do whats best for me and one week is the best i will do i could be done right now with no notice   she then got even more mad and said well i dont think we could work with you in the future anyway while making fists and shaking even more   lolwat not a month ago you said i was a great technician and you would hate to see me leave   i ended up working 60 hours in those last 4 days so my coworkers do not have to pick up appointments those days because i blew them off,pidvet

4258,My big fish story back from when I believed hard work is rewarded.,this was back in 2015 my life seemed to be getting on track and i was working what i thought was a great job at the time the best job i ever had even  i thought my contributions were appreciated and would be reciprocated in due time my coworkers liked me nobody complained when i showed up late or took a day off and i made relatively decent money but to the upper echelon of management i just a lowly software developer who sharpened pencils and made sure that nothing caught on fire  as in actual fires at one point i realized they were running over 20 mac pros on a dozen 10 surge protectors bought off amazon all of which were plugged into each other because they didnt have enough outlets i got permission to replace them went to home depot and bought five properly rated domestically manufactured surge protectors it took months to get reimbursed  at some point i discovered absolutely nobody was maintaining proper backups of our databases and what basic differential backups did exist were stored on the server running the goddamned database if one of our developers went rogue or we got hacked at any point we would probably go out of business   so i set up my workstation to do regularly scheduled backups and store them locally but i had nowhere near enough space to store all of the user files and even the database required juggling files around i let management know and explained that i needed a few terabytes worth of storage to back up all of our data properly   the disks i had requested totaled about 800 including the raid controllers so that i could do onsite backups and then another few hundred a year annually to set up an offsite backup on a different amazon account that only the executive team would have access to  instead of just doing what i had asked they decided to hire a dedicated head of devops to ensure that everything was done properly he worked in one of amazons data centers so he was a real professional unlike me  his first heroic deed was purchasing an incredibly expensive enormous gt1000 wheeled server enclosure intended for use in a data center rather than an open office he then put two whole switches router and a modem inside of it and used the rest to store some ethernet cables he then had to take the router out of it after realizing that putting wifi and metal cages do not mix  i had just rewired the network month earlier after receiving complaints from some of the service team that our internet was really slow for some reason that still puzzles me to this very day he replaced those switches which were brand new 10gbs cisco with a dozen smaller 10100mbs switches he saw for sale on slickdeals   he then daisy chained those together throughout the office and got rid of the cisco equipment which was the exact same setup we had before suddenly the network got a whole lot slower and nobody could figure out why   after this having nothing to do he spent most of his time adding features to a slack bot so my coworkers could play disco music on a very loud bluetooth speaker while i programmed dancing queen feel the beat from the tambourine oh yeah instead of uh doing the only job he was hired for maintaining our fucking backups which i was still doing because nobody else was  i found out that our customers were being phished after we hired more than a few offshore developers that i was tasked with getting up to speed dont worry were definitely keeping you theyre here to help your workload we were a 30 or 40 person company in a niche industry so i brought it to the attention of the ceo because i had no idea who was behind it  later that evening i was pinged in our public slack general channel by our hero who informed me i was disrespecting him and that he was the head of devops so all security related issues must go through him directly i responded that im the director of officedog relations and that the office dog had given me permission to do so this did not go over well and my messages were deleted apparently he had been given admin access to slack for his spotify bot and i was told by management to stop pissing people off  shortly after that one of our new very experienced offshore developers accidently deleted our payment gateway on a friday evening apparently our head of devops gave them the root aws account logins nobody could figure out how to deploy a fresh copy to it so i got to spend my a decent chunk of my friday evening doing just that  then the following monday morning on april fools 2016 i came in and realized that my slack privileges were revoked my username was renamed to disabled and my github access was gone   i sat around for about an hour until i got pulled into our conference room i was thanked for my service and told the company was growing and changing they took my keys and escorted me out of the building as if i was going to go on some rampage the office manager who owned the office dog later got a taxi and brought it to my apartment   of course i received zero severance and zero notice i later learned that the new developers released the update i had finished a week before being fired which gained them much praise for how happy customers were with how much faster the application ran the office manager was fired after trying to take pregnancy leave and i was invited to come visit the former office dog  later on from a different colleague i heard about how they got hit by ransomware of course had no backups and all of this was somehow my fault they had to lay off about half the company after that incident naturally the directorofdoingbackups remained employed despite being responsible for it  at some point during this shithurricane i overheard someone from accounting gossip about the rockstar from amazon  who was making 150k a year i made 60k never been the same since,phl07o

4269,How can we live comfortably without working,in this shitty capitalist hellscape does anyone have any idea on how one would live without working and without being born rich   i live in london united kingdom the rent is extortionately high if you want to live in any degree of comfort so obviously id need to move out of the city as a start   but paying rent would still require some form of income i could work a few days a month and maybe get by  housing prices are something like 28 times the yearly wage unlike 20 years ago when it was like 3 times the yearly wage so buying is not really an option  the social system here has been decimated by the tory party it is possible to barely survive but not live and not in anything more than a house share or a bin  im only 19 but the concept of working for the rest of my life is driving me further to suicide than i have ever been before  a combination of my distain for capitalism and my severe depression and anxiety makes it very difficult for me to see any light at the end of the tunnel or point in continuing to exist  i dont want to have to work for someone else who wont even pay me enough to rent a decent place for the rest of my life im currently only on 18k to afford rent here you need 35k at minimum  i would like to dive more into my political activism to try and change this for us all but i was already apathetic before starting work and now im so drained each day i dont have the energy to fight i suppose thats the whole point  i realize that everyone here is probably in the same position but if anyone has some survival tips ill be happy to hear them,phpwnf

4337,The world' worst appraisal meeting,this is a long read tl dr boss praises me in the beginning of the meeting then tells me that i dont deserve a raise or a promotion tell me to practically over work and then ill be considered for promotions  so ive been stewing in my feelings for a day or so now and now i am ready to fucking vent my management had the balls to first if all schedule my annual appraisal and give us all a four hour notice i said okay yolo i am going to crush this thing ive done a great job so far i met all my targets and i knew that it would count for something i join the meeting and see a totally unnecessary analyst who joined my team two weeks ago was already there it was weird but i let it go my boss began by telling me that hes seeing some real good numbers in my work and hes also really proud of how i one a few of those fun ice breaker games because now everyone knows that the fun girl is in his team i was pleasantly surprised and i thought wow i dont even have to pitch that hard hes already on my team he then says okay lets look at your self appraisal i had rated myself highly and put myself down for the next available promotion he then asks me if thinks i truly deserve these points which i have so generously awarded myself i am absolutely stunned at this point i didnt know how to react at all wasnt he just praising me i said yes i firmly believe i deserve it for xyz reasons he then began talking about another employee from a whole another team who does a completely different job than me he praised her for seven minutes solid and the whole time i am just sitting and listening like a dumb fuck because i want to see what point hes trying to make he ends by saying people like her truly deserve a promotion  he then asks that analyst who is literally a total stranger in terms of work relationship what she thinks of me a whole new shit show starts when she absolutely starts saying that i take a lot of time to correct my mistakes and how there are many flaws in my process basically vague shit that she cant prove and shit i cant argue about without looking petty he then asks me again if he thinks i deserve the scores i have awarded myself i still said yes because these comments dont change the work i have put in but i will accept whatever decision comes out of this meeting he then lowers his voice in an ooh i am telling you a secret way and says  look you meet a 100 of your targets but i cant do anything with that you have to atleast do 120150 of your targets to look like you really want to get ahead in this company so for this appraisal season you will not be getting a raise or a promotion you need to start showing youre interested from today work above your targets i said thank you and left the meeting i was stupefied at this point is this man serious he can go and suck a ding dong for all i care these absurd demands and absolute disregard for all the work ive done i am no way in hell ever giving him anything extra i get paid peanuts i still live with my parents because thats the best financial choice i could make with the kind of money i made  does he really think i am going stick around for another whole fucking year and then go through this same bullshit nope not in a million years the minute i find something i am leaving i dont have to stay here and deal with this kind of crap theres literally just one other person in my team and her performance is absolutely dismal so both of us arent getting jack shit the whole meeting was wrong on so many levels i spent the whole day talking to my family and ranting about this but all this gave me a chest pain that freaked me out even though i am in my 20s so i went and i laid down i have taken monday and tuesday off to get vaccinated and take a beat from work i want to center myself over this long weekend off,phogns

4340,Underpaid,i recently quit my job in the medical field im a tech not a nurse of doc and i came to the realization the people in the medical field are criminally underpaid at least in the us where private ownership of hospitals and clinics is the norm   for all the lipservice of healthcare workers being heroes and essential it doesnt feel like we are compensated for that i compare my pay with those of friends and people i know who work in something like computer science or engineering i am not saying it is bad these people can easily make 6 figures and work from home but shouldnt a good society prioritize the heroes   but that is not what happens you go to school and get in debt then get a job that is slightly better pay than what you can get without a degreecertification but it is not enough for the amount of skill and work required   i am not trying to ride a high horse because even the people who work in service or manual labor are also underpaid but i have to ask what is the point of me doing my best to help people if i am just barely getting by financially when people who do nothing to help society except increasing a companys stock price get to live like kings i just have no motivation anymore i love the medical field and all the interesting stuff i have learned but it is not worth it  another thing that highlights the comedy of my situation is that i bought an nft with crypto currency for relatively cheap and ended up selling it for almost 2 months of wages there is something very wrong with this society and everyone who isnt a company owner or executive is basically a slave,phu44j

4375,Why Work From Home Is Hated,like most people i work to have an income the kind of work i do isnt production or servicebased so i technically dont have to be at a specific place to do it its more of administrationtype work this was a benefit during lockdowns when i could shift to work from home quite easily without the fear of being fired during a recession  now the company i work for never really liked the work from home concept prior to the lockdowns you were given one day a week if your oneway commute was longer than 45 minutes youd get a second day so no matter what you had at least three days of onesite per week since my oneway commute is an hour i got to use that option  lockdown times showed that 85 of our duties can be done from home i experienced a sense of freedom and relief that was unknown beforehand no commute means more time and less cost for gas which is substantial where i am from but now with vaccine rates grinding to a halt at some 60 percent my company decided to do two things  1 they forced everyone back into the office 2 they cut work from home time the bonus day is gone  i have yet to hear a proper reason for this other than management decided this is more effective middle management is as always enforcing these useless rules like they get anything out of it well i can tell you that my level of engagement has never been lower i barely do anything other coworkers in the same position are openly talking about quitting over this   suits me i now sit in my office and enjoy the view go for walks and have a proper breakfast on company time theres such a major worker shortage that they cant really do much about it anyways,phxxc1
4376,"People living in the US areas that are being flooded and burned to non existence, I was just curious if you are still being expected to go to work in all this?",i read through stories during some of the fires in california that employees were still being forced to go to work even though the areas around them were burning down and people were evacuating specifically people who work in the food industries in tourist towns and i was wondering if you guys are expected to show up for work in say new york even though the roadspublic transits are flooded by feet of water and entire neighborhoods are being washed away tried to post this on raskreddit and it said im not allowed to post this question on there i figured this would be a page that would likely get an honest response,phn832

4380,Attempt at Collective Bargaining,i work at a country club that closes at a certain time of the year due to the fact that many members are out of area however the members still pay a membership for the year meaning salaried workers still get a check during this time but hourly workers do not personally i believe that if the club is going to keep employees on their payroll and expect them to return at a certain date ready to work there should be some compensation i would imagine 75 of the average that worker has made would at least help many who typically look for a second job around this time what are some strategies i could use to help my fellow workers and ensure they get paid for the expectation they will return to work thanks in advance,pgsbp6

4425,"Most jobs seem to suck, yet you're the bad guy, if you've read countless stories of burnouts and chosen to live off the system instead.",every time i open a discussion of this its always me being entitled and not the employers being legalized enslavers all people here seem to agree with the misery of most jobs out there yet choosing the alternative is somehow evil i mean dont you know that banks can essentially create money out of nothing as the economy relies on numbers in the banking systems why not go after the real predators instead of us who both have conditions that justify some benefits and have chosen not to seek work is it because the elephants in the room the ones who own and essentially control every asset on this planet are just too powerful to deal with is that the excuse for ordinary people to go after us parasites who just want to make the best of it  call me selfish but if you want me to work on top of all the issues i have in life and the shittiness of any therapy pay me 2000month and thats for working part time i can already hear the harumphs of some conservatives in the crowd for traditional 9 to 5 slavery id ask for 3000month of course none of these are realistic with my willing to reeducate myself in a school thatll screw it up for me anyways like all of them but for real this is what id decide if it was for me considering that im already living check to check of course i could budget my finances better but again why do i have to bother in a world thats going to treat me like shit anyways and before you ask i just know its going to im going to worn it out with all my concerns until it just yells at me and gives up if it gives a damn so most the time people wont care which im ok with but when they do then for fucks sake try to be on my shoes for a while actually i take that back please roast me and see where it goes im sure youll feel so great for kicking a halfdead train wreck instead of the real oppressors cause thats what lifes about right stomping on the beaten rather than doing something productive you talk about productiveness as an unproductive lump well so do the overpaid politicians sitting on their asses who just talk and maybe come up with another way to terrorize the unfortunate  i can totally relate to that mcdonalds worker who trashed the restaurant for getting firedhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvotdgtjveujy  so you went from not wanting to work to blaming other people for your misery yes cause most the time due to my condition that most people apparently dont read abouthttpsenwikipediaorgwikiaspergersyndrome its all these stupidass gatekeepers with their belief systems from the 50s holding me from every goddamn opportunity when i actually care then again why would i care if i know whats going to happen anyways oh thats right thats why i gave up in the first place to be momentarily somewhat comfortable until some shit eventually finds its way to my pathetic life,ph9kay

military to escape that sort of life i was above average in school and had excellent grades but college wasnt an option for me due to my familys financial situation during my time in the military i got to experience life outside of my small town which helped open my eyes to a lot of things i used to be racist homophobic and interested in fascism while military life is quite different from normal working life the principal was the same you wake up put on your work clothes work a full day and go home to get ready for the next one we got weekends and christmas off the main difference was that we were provided food and shelter even if we didnt live in the barracks we also had free healthcare which included dental it was hard at times but that mentality was always there like a little voice telling me to work harder and grind to pass barriers and get promotions   then i got sick and received a medical discharge along with my 100 rating i started receiving my payments 1 month after i returned home i took my diagnosis and discharge really hard and fell into a deep depression which i am still struggling with today i still experience all of the negatives that some people blame on having to work like stress anxiety and depression they just come from different places we still sometimes struggle with bills if an unexpected expense comes up but for the most part we make it by without having to worry about having money  ampx200b  i used to think life was just work we went through school to prepare us for working life and we were expected to take what we learned and continue working until we either couldnt or could afford not to i believed that was a good system and that in exchange for providing our labor we could live comfortable lives even before i started receiving my disability i started having doubts about the current way we do things i watched my father break his body to try and provide for our family and we still lived in poverty the system wasnt as black and white as i once thought but i didnt really understand that until i could look at it from the outside instead of from within  i dont think anyone can argue that most wageearners arent being exploited for their labor for example during the pandemic a company like kroger made record profits while their workers experienced some of the worst working conditions in recent history to repay their workers for their sacrifices kroger paid a small bonus for a few weeks then raised their minimum starting pay to 12 an hour i watched as my friends started to get sick with covid but were forced to go into work to bend over backwards for people that didnt care enough about them to wear a mask when i speak to those friends about how they can make their situations better the response is usually theres nothing i can do they were already poor from the lowwages and hours adding the rent increases and the end of the eviction moratorium just made things worse their company didnt develop the virus but they profited at their workers expense and purposefully keep them in a stage of lowwage work dependence that is hard to escape if i knew i either had to accept that agreement or starve i would want to find a way to dismantle that relationship in any way possible but most people i talk to will stand up for the company excuse their behavior or acknowledge and accept that reality without wanting to change it depending on the thing that is taking advantage of you gives you a sort of stockholm syndrome that i feel a lot of people either dont notice or dont acknowledge    ampx200b  ampx200b  i spent the first few years without having to work doing nothing i sat around played video games cooked some decent food went on a long trip or two but for the most part i just existed right before the pandemic i got bored and worked for the census temporarily i can say that i enjoyed the work i did which consisted of locating homeless encampments and training doorknockers but when it was over i wasnt keen on trying to find another job the census job had just enough freedom and flexibility that it almost didnt seem like work and i wouldnt be able to find that environment outside of that unique situation  i started to learn more about politics as i said i was pretty right wing in my youth when george floyd was murdered i was sort of woken up a bit i started to see things that were once hidden to me and my veil of ignorance started to lift i dont necessarily attribute that to not having to work but not having a job to take up a large portion of my time i spent that time educating myself i spent hours reading about anything and everything from bronte to kropotkin i watched videos and read articles from those in the black community and started to actually listen to black voices for the first time in my life i went from denying my privilege to acknowledging it and actually wanting to use it to help make a difference for those that suffered at its expense   i picked up a guitar again for the first time in years and used my time to practice  i took up painting which is something i never considered before but i am starting to fall in love with  i taught myself how to crochet and even made some small projects  i was given an opportunity to reflect on my life and the world  i was able to improve my relationship with my husband  i spent a lot of time training and enjoying time with my dogs  i had the freedom to work on my mental health  i had the time to cultivate meaningful relationships and repair previously broken relationships  i learned to value things other than valuable things which was a difficult concept for me  i did all of those things and more without worrying about how my bills would be paid or whether or not i could afford to get sick my time was spent how i wanted it to be spent and not on what was required for my survival or for the profit of others i feel like i have been able to live my life more fully and freely than if i had to work which is poetic considering that we are told work will lead to a fulfilling life  ill try to answer any questions,ph1gaz
4479,How my employer tried to steal my furlough pay,ive read a fair amount of stories hateful managers and companies here so i thought id like to share mine too  i worked at a small familyteam restaurant in the uk after the first lockdown i had never been a waitress before and i was interested the industry it was hard work 40 hweek split shift but i liked the team and how much i was learning coworkers complained about salary and holidays the service fee was for the company in the uk its for the staff but not in my country so i didnt noticed and holidays were fewer than supposed i didnt care bc i wasnt planning to stay for long   i was put in furlough 80 salary during the 3rd lockdown december then the manager told me that after january id get only the amount of furlough the the govt gave her for me turns out that they were paying me a third of my wages under the table without telling me and then had been topping up my furlough out of their pocket they got tired of it and decided to let me rot with barely enough to pay rent they even had the balls to ask me to tell them if i get a second job because then the govt had to reduce my furlough allowance which i knew was total bs  i didnt knew my actual salary until then bc i had never been given a payslip i had the feeling id get into trouble if i asked so i didnt i was so angry and mad i decided to return to my country like everyone did where lifes cheap and dont need to pay rent enjoy my furlough and probably never come back i told management id be back after lockdown she was so angry we all left without telling before her that she took days off our holidays  i enjoyed 45 holidaylike months in spain hiking with my family visited local villages with my bf improved my cv decided id stay there took interviews i bought a 15pounds flight in case they wanted proof of my return and waited until the very last payday the day before my departure to tell them i wouldnt come back due to an ill relative partly true i wasnt 100 honest cause i couldnt bother to argue still it was 13 days notice  the manager phoned me 6 times and sent me angry 2 minutelong audios demanding me to return she then proceed to extort me during several days she basically said you scammed the govt so give me your furlough money so i can return it or ill get my accountants to report you for that and for nonessential travel during lockdown and youll go to court whenever you come back to the uk i asked her for my endofemployment documents so i could clear my taxes in the uk and she said not until you give me the money i called hmrc labour dept and they were shocked they insisted that my furlough pay was for me and that i was free to quit my job regardless that their extortion and not reporting my resignation asap would lead to an investigation because they were still getting paid for my furlough i reported this all back to them and got it all fixed they just got like 1 week of pay  because i was still in uni and younger than them they thought that was one of my first jobs and that they could play with me however they wanted when actually i just took longer to finish uni bc i had to work and put up with a lot of shit before them i purposely removed a lot of my background from my resume so i could get a shortterm gig however this was the final kick i needed to realise that bosses give a shit about you al the we take care of our employees is all bs   now im a freelancer i agreed to work on a project with a local business before quitting that job have been getting more clients since then i couldnt have made it without that furlough money tho i still work as hell but i love my job i make more money and it all goes to my pocket even needed to find a partner to split work on my own schedule from home and with my cat napping next to me   tldr familyteam company tried to steal my furlough money jealous that i had been enjoying holidays out of it and then quit,ph67q3

4540,The day I decided to quit,inspired by the sorry im late i sat on my bed in a towel for 34 mins staring at the wall post  so i was hired in march 2020 right as everything went into lockdown my main responsibility at this job was field work collecting data points with a surveygrade gps of storm sewers manholes etc with the end goal being a digital interactive map application that city employees would use to hopefully make their jobs easier yes i went to school for this  bs in geography this of course required travel which was not allowed during lockdown so we were all just doing pretty repetitive tasks from home during this time when the travel ban lifted pure insanity ensued i found myself driving 25  4hrs hours each way to some remote town to collect data for weeks at time picking up other peoples projects that had fallen behind etc all while technically being a new hire in training still i didnt mind i felt like i was really helping and doing a good thing well this didnt last long as after about 3 months of this i was more burnt than karen on her tanning bed   fast forward another month or so and the data collection slows down as its getting colder its just office work mainly and i start coming in later and staying later still getting all of my work done as this seemed to be the only way to combat the burnout we were still having our bi weekly zoom meeting that for some reason we were required to be at the office for and i was not as i was already boiling with stress and thought this rule was ridiculous so i would attend these meetings and then take about 3045 minutes at my apartment to gather myself before going in one day upon arriving at the office im yanked into my supervisors office with my other supervisor present and they proceed to grill me which i still feel like i deserved the thing that threw me off was not one bit of concern for what i may have been going through mentally and just all about how bad im making them look then my female supervisor makes a rather strange comment that shed be very disappointed if she found out her son was doing what i was doing ah okay i see fuck that that comment still gives me weird feelings to this day of course i get the whole were like a family here rant as well i had enough there was no way i could continue this job with any dignity after that i knew i messed up but that situation was too much   i worked for about 3 more months to get through a few more months of my lease and i was gone i hope this is at least an entertaining read for you all i know i messed up and i dont wish to gain any sympathy here but just a personal account of being burnt out trying to impress your employer  take care and dont work so hard,pglhxe

4542,New manager at big defense contractor trying to screw me over,i work at one of the big three defense contractors in the us lockheed northrop grumman etc  the companys policy is that with 5 years of experience and a bachelors degree you are eligible to be promoted from engineer to principal engineer  i have worked at this company for almost 5 years now with september 6th being the mark of 5 years i should be eligible for promotion based on these criteria alone  the kicker is that i recently transferred from one group within the company into another so my manager changed i spoke with my new manager about promotion and was told that i dont have 5 years of experience in this particular group so id have to prove myself capable of operating at that level before i would be eligible for promotion   i spoke with my old manager in my previous group and was told theyd happily take me back and put me in for promotion if i did   basically it is boiling down to the fact that the new manager wants me but wants to pay me less than i deserve and reprove myself as an employee in their group,pgl3i2
4543,Boss finally changing inefficient processes after two years of me complaining.... but only because I'm leaving to go elsewhere,to say i am beyond frustrated is an understatement i have been in my current quite high up position for over 4 years half of that time has been spent going around a merry go round with two higher ups complaining about how inefficient processes have been and that theyre making my job a lot harder and more stressful than it needs to be finally got to a boiling point last month when i was shouted at for not doing enough despite working through the entire pandemic period doing 3 peoples jobs and being severely underpaid so i applied elsewhere on a drunken whim and after 2 weeks of interviewing landed my dream job with a 55 wage increase  then i told work i was leaving so of course my boss has finally decided my job is too much of a hassle for a new person to deal with so is finally changing the processes i have been practically begging them to change for the last 2 years i feel like screaming because i have wanted this change for so long and have felt so unheard and washed aside for that whole time only for them to start making the change because of some unknown person who we dont know and theyll undoubtedly pay them a lot more than what i was on anyway  the only consolation i have is that me quitting was a shock as was my turning down their generous counteroffer  which was only 5k pay rise that i would get after i put in all the work to change my job to become what my new job had already offered me everyone at work has been saying how much theyll miss me and how stupid work have been and that theyre proud of me for bettering myself  i still cant help but feel sad and angry though its a stupid little thought but it does make me feel like i wasnt good enough for them to make things better but that just reinforces my decision to leave this place and go somewhere else  sorry for the rant theres been many a time ive openly sobbed at my desk in work because of how stressful this place has been and i hope this is the very last time or one of the very last times this toxic place will make me feel sad or tiny fuck my boss,pglsxb

4630,Talking points to help people understand that work is not something that should be at the core of your identity,these talking points are not for people who already use this sub you all understand this  theyre for people who are receptive to antiwork ideas or at least sympathetic to them but havent quite put the pieces together in their head  what i would like to ask someone in this position are some of the following questions for people you know well and are concerned might be identifying too much with their work you can pick and choose depending on what you think a person would be receptive to  when you introduce yourself in a casual setting how quickly does your job titledescription tend to come up  are you eager or willing to talk about your job if its asked early in a conversation  or do you prefer to talk about things that are more personal to you so that other people get a better sense of who you are  which do you disclose first your job titledescription or your ethical values  if they disclose their title first why is that more important than your ethical values  for people who are a part of an often nonvisible but marginalized minority which comes up first your job title which affects you while working or your minority status which affects you all the time  do you disclose your job title because you want people to know what you do at work or because you are trying to avoid a certain perception or stereotype  is there something you like doing more than your job that you would like potential acquaintancesfriends to know about  do you allow others to direct you to talk about your job at the expense of other things that you think are asmore important  do you talk about your job before talking about your family  if they say yes are you ok with people thinking that your job is a bigger part of your identity than your family  may add to this later feel free to add additional talking points to get people to realize that they are identifying too much with their work,pgnunk

4646,The economy would be much more efficient if we eliminated sales and marketing.,if there was ever a bullshit drain on the economy its sales  take healthcare for example a significant percentage of your insurance premiums go to pay commission to the salesman that sold the policy to you or your employee  insurance companies are denying life saving treatments to patients while their top salespeople get paid handsomely  i have nothing against hard working people that actually do something and happen to sell  for example an actual engineer that actually works on a project may do sales related job functions  this is way different than a pure bullshit artist that just hustles people and brags about hustling people    hustling should only occur on the ball field  everywhere else its a drain on the economy and in the case of healthcare is literally killing people,pfxg6w

4665,Just some ramblings I wrote at 5 AM (I work at 7),for context i am a 21 year old who works at target as a cart pusher ive worked there for only 3 weeks  i just wanted to say that i literally do not take care of myself when i have a job my life is literally slowly falling apart as i continue to grind out miserable shift after miserable shift and lose more and more of myself in the process the small part of me that wants to work out play music draw decorate my room eat healthy make friends and just try to be happy in general has been repeatedly smashed down as i do the same thing over and over and wake up feeling like crap every single day is it really worth it to lose myself to literally become a shell of a human being with no likes or aspirations at all for 15hr i dont think so i dont feel like myself i feel like a robot doing the motions and being miserable the entire time this is not sustainable i will quit soon and hopefully start to regain my desire to live and my humanity because the real me he cares about those things he has a desire to do better he has hope for a happy life the person i am right now just hopes he crashes on the way to work every single day and has trouble sleeping because hes dreading the next hellish day every single night he gets off a shift and goes and buys junk food because he just wants anything to feel better after being miserable for so long he doesnt work out because hes already exhausted and he literally doesnt care if he gets fat he throws his clothes on the floor and literally doesnt care what his room looks like im barely ever there anyway why would i care why would any of those things matter when i am at target more than my own home when less than 30 of my day is in my own control target literally has more say over my own life than i do and you know what they use it for to make sure that people have carts so that they can buy more useless things so that target will make more billions of dollars im so fucking glad thats what my life is dedicated to not the last 3 weeks of my life has literally felt like 3 months each day has been a marathon im starting to feel disconnected from my family and friends because none of them understand why i feel this way i genuinely have a hard time empathizing with someone who thinks this is good i love my family but they really just dont understand just how much this wrecks me they think that if i do a different job it will help they tell me to try a different job or just keep working at it not realizing that i have literally thought about killing myself every single day for the past 3 weeks i can barely remember anything ive done other than work repeatedly and yet my family tells me theyre happy im sticking with it and working a job why would you be happy that i am destroying my own life slowly for money i am literally selling my humanity and my desire to live for money thats not a good thing they work and not only are they fine with it they are happy i will never be happy if somebody else controls my life it doesnt matter what i am doing if its not under my own control i want no part in it and working literally makes me lose my spark my desire to live and try new things and be better a life spent working for someone else is not a life worth living i would like control over my own life back  it feels like a very normal human natural desire to want control over your own life so why am i so alone in this why is this so easy for everyone else my friends just work and then come home and just do stuff and theyre fine my coworkers go to work and do the same thing every single day for years and it doesnt eat them up inside how i genuinely dont understand i feel like every human being would feel like me when forced to work but 90 of people are completely fine with it i just dont understand but thats why i dont want to try therapy ive done it before multiple times and its never helped nobody else understands the therapists think that i am mentally ill or that i need to try another job or whatever but to me it feels like the mentally ill thing would be to be happy in such a miserable existence to just accept that thats how life is and continue to grind out your day to day life doing monotonous tedious work how do they not have a voice constantly telling them that its not worth it because this isnt worth it this isnt worth living i am literally staying alive which is so much pointless work and so much effort just so my family wont be sad and that makes me sad because i dont want to die at all i have a desire to live a good life and i love my friends and family and good food and cool movies and good music life is awesome and it could be an amazing experience if i wasnt forced to literally sell my soul to a corporation just to afford a place to live and food to eat which i still cant actually afford even though im working full time woohoo ive literally just been getting through work with sheer willpower but that can only last so long and its demoralizing seeing all my friends do it without a second thought this literally feels like i am running a marathon with zero energy no sleep the night before and no food at all i am just forcing myself to take each painful step one step at a time while every else is just running so easily idk,pfsrr8

4688,My Boss was mad that I arrived and left work ontime,i used to work as a receptionist at a company that sold products it was an office job where i did a lot of paperwork met potential customers and took care of the offices many needs this included keeping the kitchen stocked for the other staff members and performing some janitorial tasks to keep things looking nice the receptionist position would have easily been a fulltime job but around the time i was hired into this position the woman who was in charge of most of the accounting work was leaving and they needed help in the accounting department  now i am not an accountant by any means i took math 11 in high school and then never took math again but suddenly i was now working as a receptionist and in charge of the accounting work she did mainly related to invoicing and keeping track of the companys money i was baffled that they were giving me these extra tasks but they were  i had two days of training to learn all my accounting responsibilities and the receptionist work and i was overwhelmed   as the weeks went by i was struggling i told my boss frequently that if they wanted me to do invoicing i wouldnt be able to finish my receptionist duties but i was brushed off each time and told to manage my time more efficiently by 330 every day i would be stressed out trying to get everything done and it didnt help that the sales staff would constantly come and ask me when i would finish their invoices they wanted to get paid   i would try to leave the office on time if i could especially since my husband was my ride home and he also worked for the company but in a different department every single day he had to wait 3040 mins because i was running around like crazy trying to finish everything i had to do i just never had enough time i tried to manage my time but new things constantly would come up during the day that needed to get done quickly and be prioritized despite me telling my boss on numerous occasions that my job needed to be two different jobs they refused to hire another person and i strongly believed this wasnt my issue if they wanted me to work two jobs in 8 hours a day it would just take longer for things to get done  every day when i left i would say bye to the other people in the office and they would look at the clock and give me a sour look apparently leaving when i was supposed to was frowned upon one day as i was leaving my boss said are you done x task you shouldnt leave until its done  i explained that i didnt have the time to finish it that day considering all my extra receptionist duties that came up without notice and he said that was unacceptable when i said i would stay an hour later if i got overtime he said that was also unacceptable   me and june stay late every day and we dont get overtime he said youre paid a salary so you should stay until all the work is done  please note that june was an extreme workaholic she would arrive two hours before work and stay till 7 or later every single day without getting overtime pay i explained that i had other commitments that i had to do in the day and couldnt stay hours overtime if i wouldnt get paid for it this was unacceptable apparently  as time went on things got worse i was behind on everything and couldnt figure out how to get everything done in 40 hours a week the truth was my job should have been two jobs and considering i had accepted a receptionist job and they threw in the accounting responsibilities on my first day it didnt seem fair i was one person working two jobs and they wanted me to just work extra hours with no additional pay  i ended up leaving the job and after i did they split my position into two you know because it was two jobs they were just trying to squeeze into one my husband stayed at the company for a little longer and informed me that they had to add another person a few weeks later so the job they wanted me to do on my own became three jobs  companies will cut so many corners to save money and the way i was treated is completely unacceptable if you hire someone to work 84 but want them to stay an hour or more each day without overtime pay then you are just completely taking advantage the lack of respect they had for me still baffles me,pg5zk6

4718,I can't wait for the day when a demanding manager asks me if I like my job,because my  very last words to them would be you seriously underestimate how badly i dont want to be here   i would really like to see the look on their faces   asking an employee if they like their job is just a huge power display then when an employee sighs in defeat and says that they do like their job it just gives the manage greater power to exploit them  its on my bucket list to really stick it to a person like that one day who asks me that faithful question do you like your job,pg1ke6

4725,Bad co worker can be just as bad as bad boss!,the company i work for is really decent to their workers not perfect but they really are trying very hard to make it a two ways street  we used to have flexible schedule they just had to put us on a schedule thankfully they talked to each one of us first to see what kind of schedule we want because too many workers were abusing it they would come in way too early or too late then barely get anything done because no one is around to help then they would spent most of the shift doing nothing which then creates issue for other workers then lead to stalling in everything  they had a meeting about this a few times yet half of the people just made no efforts to show up at a reasonable time  then there was this one worker who have walked out twice first time she was mad because others were picking on her due to her poor performance before she walked out she would go and completely fucked up bunch of works that took me and other co worker two days to fix  she crawled back and apologized they let her back in as something similar to quality manager she completely slacked that one off which got bunch of us in trouble when we all called her out on it she stormed out few days ago she came back and want to be a front office lady she have absolutely zero people skill and definitely doesnt look the part at all just today she walked out again because she did something that got one customer complained to other company we work with which got them to call the manager when the manager come to her she screamed at the manager then stormed out and slammed the door  now the front office people are storming to try and fix all fuck up and covering the gap that she left which also means we have to scramble to try and make sure things are running smoothly  i fucking hate badpoor bossmanagers especially those that take advantage of workers but bad co workers should be a huge part of anti work in my opinion as well,pfxit6

4739,Am I weak for bring unable to handle school?,i see a lot of people here talking about how the 95 work yourself to the bone lifestyle makes them deeply unhappy since it leaves very little room for free time and happiness i was going to school not too long ago but i had to leave due to the impact it was having on my mental health  id have to wake up way too early to the point where i felt like i had weights attached to my limbs then spend 6 hours in school by the time i was getting home i was just completely burnt out from the day but then i had homework to do as well and then after homework was done id have about an hour of studying to do  when all was said and done i had two maybe three hours at the most of free time i liked to play games or see my friends but after i had finished all of that i was just completely wiped out i didnt have an ounce of energy left in me to do anything that would help me to blow off steam all i could do was just lay there half awake half asleep  during the weekends i could finally have my rest and free time thats a lie by the way the teachers always gave us weekend homework so even when we were supposed to be able to at long last get some proper rest it was still hindered  this was if it isnt obvious by now highly unsustainable for me things ended up hitting a boiling point and once boiling water is out of the pot you cant put it back in i either had to leave school with a broken mind or stay and risk taking my own life or becoming an addict the current education system is setup with a onesizefitsall approach and unfortunately for me it wasnt a fit  the reason the title of this post is what it is is because most people i know were able to finish school its left me wondering if im the only one who wasnt strong enough to make it through even if it would have killed me to do so the thought that i had to be a mindless robot every day shadowed the passion of my teenagehood all i wanted was to spend time with family and friends engage in some of my hobbies and figure out who i was and what i wanted however the intense amount of work and pressure that was being thrown at me was just too much  so the question is then was this a problem that only a minority of others and myself had or is this commonplace among people my age today  tldr is the intense amount of work and pressure that is being pushed onto students today more than what is acceptable and needs to change or is it simply the same as its always been and people just have to suck it up,pfudj6

It's ehh.,he is a cnc programmermachinist very talented with the mastercam cadcam skills all of that stuff the company he works for produces pumps for all the aircraft you can think of ranging from military jets to commercial planes   its long hard work from 7am to 430pm every day 5 days a week yes he is hourly and gets paid overtime but because it is hourly he gets cut in pay if he has to take a sick day or if he asks for vacation  because without the overtime the normal pay is lower   that reminds me even with the overtime his pay is below average compared to the rest of the city where i live   so he has to work 45 hours a day to make stagnating wages hmm thats not right,pfnfyb

4767,My experience,working as a car detailer at enterprise car rental i am 24 years old and in school  college   previously worked here for almost 3 years i enjoyed the work a lot i really did but i ended up leaving here is my experience and what i think about the job and little about it  so at least my area i had to be at enterprise for 730 in the morning till 530 or more  ill explain later  or monday its always 700 to 530 and you can work half days also aswell i mostly never had a problem with the time part but  ill explain more  so i never had half days so i was working monday 700 to 530 tuesdays 730 to 530 thursday and friday i was a 1200 noon till 530 dinner and every other saturday  i had to stay pass 530 if their was cars to clean but whatever  but it was extremely mentally draining from the heat to cold all the weather and running around for management it got old so fast yet they gave everyone gift cards like crazy and also buy food for all of us and drinks coffee etc  i enjoyed it  but still corporate just kept taking in a shit ton and wouldnt increase our wages also i had to clean some brutally nasty cars cause they didnt want to make the customer mad so they would make us clean it which us i mean 2 people in the bay it took one time to clean by myself a shit show took me 2 hours and 15 mins straight yeah it wasnt fricken fun at the end of all that pay check was around 850 every 2 weeks or sometimes less they always kept below 40 hours max i got was 35 so yeah what the fuck they are also so stupidly picky with full time i know someone that bust her ass off and she aint full time but shes like 60 hours a week and she makes somewhere around 20 an hour which i find bullshit cause they dont want her full time cause of benefits but yet 45mins away another enterprise a desk girl is there and shes full time with benefits but not her i dont know she does cleaning in the bay and everything the other girl nope guess she dont get full time cause of smaller town i call laziness and corporate greed  the work  you work by getting cars cleaned so you bring them into the bay you start vacuuming everything the seats in between the seats and centre consoletrunk aswell so you got to get everything out crumbs every little thing you also get stuff to assist you like different noses for the vacuum but not every location has thisthen going to wipe the dash interior cubby holes cup holders everything which is fine getting rid of all stains coffee anything thats gross even the touch screen its all there on the wipe list after that you do the windows the glass cleaner  self explanatory you clean the glass and windshields including the trunkhatches windows if it smells really bad you spray it with deodorizer which doesnt get rid of the smell it just hides it which is dumb they should invest in real scent killer but you use this mostly if someone smokes or even if it smells terrible then you wipe the outside with brushes and then spray the hole car off  car cleaning  then you bring the car out front and park it and bring the key in and grab the next dirty one rinse and repeat you also have to drop off cars at places either in towns or shops even other enterprises to swap cars  this i dont mind makes the day go by   so your base of operations is the bay which is like your home keep it clean buckets full with soap for cleaning the cars and tubs and containers full so they are all standing by ready the bay at least i worked at it sucked majorly other areas have fans for the summer to keep you cool not this one so youll roast and sweat to death and the heater for the winter struggles to keep up with the cold we had to keep all doors shut to keep the heat in from the heater that was struggling to keep the bay warm and to melt ice off cars in winter  it needs a massive upgrade but they are to cheap to bother  with any of that i always bring it up pay  when i was there i got 1425 covid hit so i lost one possible wage increase so another year i got 025 cents so i made 1450 i shouldve been making 1475 but yeah and i think for the work we do we all are underpaid heavily why when you can work at ford as a detailer for 2000 an hour and you have a much updated and better bay and equipment i asked for a 050 raise to bring me up to 1500 an hour they wont budge and they dont care which sucks cause higher ups are sniffing their own farts while we do all the stuff and deal with customers for my personal opinion the pay sucks ass and we all deserve better pay i dont care what anyone says and it needs to be livable wage they also brought on new policies so if there are dirty cars around 530 you got to clean them all before you can go to prepare for tomorrow and this policy is trash one time i was stuck till almost 7 i think this is absolutely unacceptable and inhuman but i dont mind stay for a tiny bit but jesus it got to far at times and also the customer is always right you might have to deal with picky customers ive dealt with one over the almost 3 years  everyone at my location was good chill and same with other locations but yeah thats my explanation and experience i felt undervalued and under appreciated thanks enterprise for 3 years that went so downhill fast,pfn23z
4768,It feels like a lot of the middle and upper management jargon is just to cover their incompetence,especially for white collar workplaces  we want a  go getter   self starter   takes initiative  then endless meeting about strategic this or that streamlining ad nauseum   basically they dont want to be honest about we dont know jack shampt just come in and fix everything for us no actionable inputs or insights just hunches and jargons   this especially happens when you are a new hire and middle management expects you to deliver the moon amp fix everything instead of realizing their own shortcomings and setting up the right expectations and processes   we would have been better off having a structured workday like they did at the factories instead of this nonsense about hustle and results oriented approach that really is not helping anyone,pfpnuj

4773,Are There Any Inter Union Groups,ive been considering some of the things people have said about calls for general strikes for a while now as well as some of the things ive read on here casually discussing unions there are some questions i have that i realize now id just like to ask those who are currently in unions kind of just out of curiosity to help further my understanding of how they work  first do unions talk to each other it just seems to me to make sense that even if individual unions within industries or specific companies dont have directly common interests they would at least have existential interest in each other as in whether unions exist at all are there conferences of union leaders from different industries or specific interunion organizing groups if so what are the top ones  secondly do unions ever help workers in other industries or companies form their own unions to me it would only make sense if they did since one would think if they believe unions are good for themselves then surely they would be good for others does anyone have any stories or articles about a union in one industry  say construction workers  helping a totally different industry unionize  like factory workers  it just seems like there should be some larger union organizing forces at play and if no such organizations exist why not,pfmeaj
