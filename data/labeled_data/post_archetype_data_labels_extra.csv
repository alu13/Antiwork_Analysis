[The Abolition of Work](http://www.objectif-exhibitions.org/MEDIA/PDF/JOURNAL/TheAbolitionofWork.pdf) - Bob Black

[In Praise of Idlness](https://libcom.org/files/Bertrand%20Russell%20-%20In%20Praise%20of%20Idleness.pdf) - Bertrand Russell

[Laziness as Truth of Mankind](http://www.workaffair.greteaagaard.net/satelite_files/malevich_laziness.pdf) - Kazimir Malevitch

[Why Are Beggars Despised ?](http://grammar.about.com/od/classicessays/a/beggarsorwell.htm) - George Orwell

This one is longer and maybe a bit unrelated but it's interesting for understanding why work is so valued in our society:
[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism](http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/1095/The%20Protestant%20Ethic%20and%20the%20Spirit%20of%20Capitalism.pdf) - Max Weber

She didn't clarify exactly what she meant by this and the book itself has nothing to do with antiwork sentiments, but I thought it was appropriate somehow.

I'd like to hear explanations any of you might have but my thought process was something like this:

Like combat, you are in a situation where you are compelled to perform tasks where the alternative is literal death (don't fight in combat -&gt; get killed by the enemy, don't work to get money -&gt; die of starvation in the streets)

Also no one *wants* to engage in combat (except maybe psychopaths), they just get in there, do the deed and get out. In my opinion work should be the same way: get in there, get your money and get out without attaching yourself to the job itself too much.

Allied soldiers engaging in combat (coworkers) shouldn't be thought of as friends but as emotionless cogs in a machine working towards a specific goal.

Although I guess depending on your worldview you could interpret this differently as a pro-work view in that it's your ""duty"" to fight (work) and sacrifice yourself for your country (company), but I thought it was an interesting thought experiment and it may help others to view work in this way.",0.0,timeisart,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/9y8dtf/work_is_combat/,0.0,1.0,1271,137,www.reddit.com,anger,Negative,0.5565698742866516,0.006278432,anger,Neutral,0.5464468002319336,0.0008787969

The way I see things is that I've been born at a disadvantage in a society that favors the outgoing, charming, and charismatic smooth-talkers. Now, I have no desire to participate in the rat race, but if I'm going to be pressured by my peers into jumping into the fire then I should at least have the capability of succeeding, otherwise what you're telling me essentially is that I'm only useful as a wage slave. If you're going to tell me that my life is only worth $10 an hour, an apartment, a used car, 10K's of debt and an unfulfilling waste of youth job, then I'm gonna tell you to go ahead and fuck yourself. I don't give a shit about having a ton of money or a fancy car or any of that. It's the hypocrisy of those who do care about material items telling me that I can't have the same things, but that I should still play the game. I am fully aware that there are ways to escape the rigged system and become independent. To successfully do that usually requires some kind of artistic talent, psychopathic behavior, high level of skill at something, and a bit of luck. I have none of that, so basically I'm screwed. But I still won't play your game. I still have the right to enjoy my life in whatever way I can. So quit calling me a loser just because the circumstances of my life have led me down a dead end and I'm not a dumbass who will fold under the pressure and go along with a wayward society.

Has anyone found out how hard the pro leagues can be the hard way?","We always hear stuff like ""follow your dreams!"" and the best recipe for successful wealth is ""pick something you love so much an make a career out of it!"".

And indeed you see to many people and not just kids and teens, but even adults, think that being a professional MMA fighter would be a fun job or assume just because you love eating cheeseburgers you can make a career at food eating contests, etc.

Recently I attempted to go pro at Magic The Gathering. I used to always beat my friends as well as other random people at bars and restaurants in betting matches and win big bucks. I won a small local tournament earlier this year so I decided I would go pro. But when I started this month I was getting my but whooped against even bottom tier ranking pro players and even amateur tournies that are above the ones I used to win at the local level. I practically lost all my gambling money and a large chunk of reserve cash I put specifically for this career on a rainy day.

In addition I never thought how stressful and hard stuff I used to do such as organizing my magic deck could be when your paycheck is dependent on it. And I'm so surprised how even the worst of the worst players at upper level amateur contests and professional gambling and dueling can be! Every trick I used that easily won me cash against friends and other people in my local neighborhood was easily countered and I could not develop any new strategy. In addition even just buying the equipment to keep up with the recent trends is extremely expensive.

So I am curious if anyone here ever tried to go pro at their favorite hobbies and backed out instead for an easy secure job or college like I did with Magic? Why do so many people especially commentators giving advice think that not only will you excel at something you love if you work at it for a living, but you will still easily stay in said career despite failures and setbacks simply because you love the job?

Its repeated so often in the media and by commentators that you'd think its a guaranteed formula! But I learned first hand the hard way even the bottom levels of professionalism of your favorite hobby is so difficult you might end up hating the hobby (which I actually did with Magic after I decided to abandon pro gaming for almost a month until my sister convinced me to start playing with her again).

I was looking forward to a new challenge in a space that I felt confident in and leading a team. First week went very well but just as quick, everything started to fall apart. 

2 designers were let go and I didn’t know about either until a few hours prior to being let go. When I asked I was told it was budgetary. We never filled those 2 roles. When asked about resources, I’m told to do what we have. 2 out of the 3 remaining designers on my team aren’t even full time. The client we are dedicated to requires full time people. I’ve never worked so hard in my life with such lack of respect. Last Friday I was told my role was shifting to be a glorified project manager. I asked numerous times for an official job description but was never given one and was forced to make a decision. At first I said yes. By Wednesday I sat back as I was being yelled at and talked down to in front of my entire team even though I hit deadlines. My team shouldn’t be slacking me pity messages. I called the account manager that night and I told her I wouldn’t be working after the end of the month. She guilted me into working 3 days extra to make it a full 2 weeks. 

After putting in my notice, my whole team began spilling details about how high the turn over is here.

We need to consider expanding terms.
Fascism didn’t work out too well back in 1939-45, communism didn’t work too well in practice either.

Capitalism has limped along but changed face over time and the only periods in which it could truly be said to be even close to ‘working’ is when there is a strong and burgeoning middle class but, someone always has to lose for someone else to win and the ones with the most resource know the infighting will be between the poorer people.

The concept of time labelling these flavours of capitalism might be more helpful.

Is it miltonfriedmancapitalpunishmentism or is it SalvadorAllendecapitalism?  These distinctions are important given the vast difference in goals yet using the same system.

The legal system is a game to the rich but life or death in many instances to the poor.

Ideally we figure out a way to replace these outdated and binary left v right views into something that takes a more complex worldview, how about we try some kind of holistic altruism?

If we could create something that future generations would feel thankful for it would be a good place to start

Politics needs to be broken down to be several smaller systems each about representing the voices of those represented and the powers limited to not allow police states anarchy, politicians, chaos or oligarchs to reign.

How do you achieve this?  Well an example is to shift the way money works.  

Bitcoin has a public visible ledger, so we find a way to invent ‘taxcoin’ so every tax dollar is actually visibly used to further the interests of the people taxed and implement checks and balances.

Build into taxcoin a way to generate ‘welfarecoin’ and ‘feedthehomelesscoin’.

Put all politicians on a capped equivalence of what the value of 70k is worth a year right now with their travel covered while they are employed, and jail the fuckers when they embezzle and commit fraud, then use the way it was done to reprogram these systems to detect it.

Penalise narcissistic behaviour and force politics to be about how can they add value to the world rather than act like children.

Bring back lawyers who know how to actually write a statement of claim

Abolish systems like workcover

Create a means to provide free healthcare and education globally

Upgrade the school programs each year with more knowledge so that your least educated people today are on par with your highest educated a decade ago

Forcing fields of science and medicine to continually develop rather than stagnate

Legalise and regulate and have research into every discovered compound on earth and its affect on people.

Focus on preventing then curing rather than medicating 

Maybe we need united goals beyond resource control and policy into how to best find human harmony.

When you start thinking longer term about what we are doing and how things tie in, we should consider systems and how they interact, how the output of one system could be the input of another where possible and reward environmental efficiency.

I’ve always wanted to be someone who was reliable, to the point it’s become a tragic flaw, and for years now, I’ve put everything and everyone ahead of myself to the point where my health, both mentally and physically, are in bad places. I used to be a collegiate athlete on a scholarship, but due to injury and being unable to compete, I lost it and my mental health took a turn for the worst and I blew up to almost 500 pounds from 267 pounds. After dropping out of college for the first time, I sort of gave up on myself and just aimed to be there for everyone else to prove I was still good for something and to feel like I wasn’t a total failure. Along the way, I picked up this bad habit of eating fast food to deal with stress because I couldn’t say no to anyone or anything because I felt guilty. After the loss of some close friends and family, though, I decided to reclaim my life, but it feels like my job is stripping that away from me. 

I was recently asked to come back on a whim after being told at the end of last school year they couldn’t offer me any reassurance that I would have a position for this current year. I work in a school as an “assistant,” but really I’m a substitute teacher without a license, and I work the same hours as any teacher in the building, often more because I am also a wrestling coach, and I can be here ranging from 12-17 hours a day if we have meets and morning practice. I only get paid for six-and-a-half of those at $11.41 per hour, and lately it doesn’t seem worth it. In addition to working on my health, I recently made the decision to go back to college, even receiving interest from NCAA D3, NAIA, and JUCO coaches to revive my athletic career and give me some networking opportunities, and work towards my goals in life, and I’ve made tremendous progress in both. However, upon returning, I find myself unable to say “no” and eating fast food or at restaurants more frequently again because it’s convenient with the little time I do have to myself, and my grades have dropped in the month I’ve been back. I had a steady gig as an Uber and Lyft driver and paid my bills based on 2-3 days of driving out of the week, and I got way more time to work on myself and my routine. The people I work with are all great and they certainly like me, and the feeling is mutual, but it doesn’t feel like this will do me well in the long run.

It’s my first big girl job. So far it’s been okay-  very slow. My mentor is great very helpful but busy and grouchy sometimes. He’s never been mean to me always helpful just never gives me work today. Yesterday- after weeks of doing nothing I asked him what I should be doing all day? He said, after complaining about training people, that it’s “not his problem”. Yesterday after work my husband tested positive for covid. I have no symptoms and feel fine. Yesterday as soon as I found out I told my manager and called our health center. The Health center said I can stay at work unless I have symptoms and to get tested on Friday. My manager said the same thing. So I come in today and Ken barley looks in my direction. I go to get something I printed and one of my coworkers was already there and handed me my printed pages. Kens page happened to be with mine so I go to ken and say hey are these your pages 
He immediately yells at me and says 
“Throw that shit away, don’t fucking touch my stuff. I can’t believe you didn’t tell me yesterday your husband had covid. You know my wife is sick how dare you come into work”. 
I’m fucking flabbergasted. Have never been yelled at before like that by a coworker and he’s never been mean to me. I told him I’m doing what the yard hospital told me to do and our manager told me to do. He wouldn’t listen and kept cussing. So I sat at my desk and cried for a bit and took a walk. Then I went to my manager and told him what happened and what I should do? Cus clearly I’m not welcome here. He said stay Bcs that’s what medical said. He put me in a corner office away from ken. 
Then ken came and apologized and told me his wife has stage four lunge cancer. I don’t hold anything against him and I understand why he reacted the way he did. 
But now it’s awkward and he’s my only mentor and ho can teach me. 
I just got my 40 hours pto. Also my husband will now be out from work for ten days and our company (we work for the same) shuts down for 10 days during Christmas no pay u less you use your pto. My husband has no pto Bcs he just started so if I can work I need to.

The extra $600/week payments on unemployment have just started for most people. Now depending on the state average maximum unemployment rate is $450/week. Some states are more generous like Massachusetts with a maximum benefit payment of $823 for an individual or $1,234 with dependents. Some states are horrible like Mississippi with a maximum benefit of $235. Each payment is for a weeks worth of benefits. Average payment is about half the regular wages. For those on the lowest income tiers they are going to make more on unemployment than if they work. While you cannot quit your job and collect unemployment there are now exceptions. If you reasonably feel unsafe working you can. Many grocery stores have been working overtime to secure PPE, install sneeze guards for the cashiers, moving to one way aisles and stuff like that. They do not like having to spend this money but they’re doing this so they do not have to worry about massive resignations and people collecting unemployment. 

Now here is the thing. If you’re earning near minimum wage you’ll likely qualify for $150/week in unemployment. Add the extra $600/week and you’re looking at somebody who was earning less than $300/week now making $750/week. People who are making closer to $15/hour are now going to make close to $900/week instead of the $600/week. Not as drastic but still better. For the average unemployment payment to match the extra benefit payment you’ll need a wage of $20.88/hour in Mississippi and $45.85/hour in Massachusetts. If people get used to this payment over the next two months they will not want to go back to earning between $7.25/hour to $15/hour.

Background Info: 
Boss A: highest up, owner of establishment. 
Boss B: owners daughter, boss to Boss C
Boss C: Boss to all other staff
Coworker Teeny: thinks she’s a boss and she’s not. 

I (19F) took a job at a daycare recently, about 3 months ago. My reasoning was because it was the only job I could bring my child to, on top of that I get to bring her 100% free of charge. Her father and I didn’t want to put her in any sort of childcare alone due to… well, this exact reason but worse. 

I loved my job for the first two weeks. Everything was peaceful, I could ask for help, I was actually taught things.  The day I started, my coworker Teeny, quit. She quit to go take care of her sick mother. Two weeks later, after a fight with her mom, she was back. All hell broke loose. She creates a constant dampening on every room she walks into, she’s a bully, she’s entitled, she thinks she can boss people around, she’s impatient, she’s rude, she’s snide, you name it. 

One day she was making fun of people with a disability that I happen to have. I reported to Boss B, as it was about her children specifically and it needed to be dealt with. 
Boss A decided the best way to deal with all of this, was to make us sit down and put me on the spot over and over because she can’t confront them herself. Co worker Teeny said “there must have been a misunderstanding in what was said”. There was not. This happened ONE day after boss C left for Hawaii. She’ll be back January 11th which is really starting to seem like it’s too far away for me to deal with until she comes back to smooth things out. 

Now, last pay day, I didn’t get my paycheck until 7:30pm. Everyone’s work day gets over at 5:30pm and I needed that check for an orthodontist appointment the next day. Our accountant doesn’t work weekends or most Fridays so if payday falls on one of those days, we don’t get a check until Monday. This time, this event fell on a Monday. Accountant was sick and choose not to notify one. So when boss B called, the rest of the branch  tried their best to do the checks themselves. They gave it to us on bright orange paper. 

A few days ago, boss A notified me that I can’t pump breast milk in the office, or the bathroom. I also can’t was my pump things in the bathroom  It needs to be in the kitchen, and I have to sanitize before and after. Okay, not a huge deal but definitely irritating since it means I have to pump and breastfeed in front of a bunch of kids staring at my tits; up close and personal. 

Today at lunch, all my kids from my “classroom” were in their placements waiting for the meal boss A preps everyday. Usually this would be boss C. Anyway, I ask if I can slip away for 10 minutes to pump milk because my child was hungry. I was told yet. I come back, and Teeny gets mad at me and says “there’s only two of us, maybe you can do that at a better time next time. Because this is a lot to handle. (If you haven’t gathered, we’re externally short staffed to the point it’s actually illegal lol). 

It’s not what she said, it’s how she said it. And on top of that, why do people not understand when you need to pump, you need to do it NOW. I mean, I can be out of work for a week from mastitis instead, if you want? And not only that, my child was hungry. Pumping her a bottle takes less effort than carrying her around and feeding her off boob, (which by the way, I can’t do that either, especially in the kitchen since it’s a bodily fluid. It’ has to be treated as if it’s blood.) 

There’s a bunch of other reasons I hate it here, foo. Like the yelling, lack of care, being expected to push my child’s needs aside, rudeness, snarky comments, the pushing, the grabbing kids triggers my PTSD, the discrimination, the bullying, the lying they do to parents. I would NEVER put my child in daycare after working at one.   The only reason I’m still here is because I feel nobody would treat these kids better than me.",0.0,Winter-Pianist-1584,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rheo9z/ibe_about_had_it_with_this_job/,0.0,1.0,3932,410,www.reddit.com,anger,Negative,0.4641754627227783,0.012465111,joy,Positive,0.7224030494689941,0.0013825953

She told me she had run into another old coworker from that store in Walmart.

That former coworker gave her the news that one of the worst of many bad managers at our store got fired.

He treated the customers so badly and had such an attitude that the store rating went from a 5 star to a 1 star, so they fired his ass.

This manager: 
-told me he didn't have to give me a break and ""did it out of the kindness of his heart""
-thought it was funny to run at and threaten to hug my coworker friend who is high risk back at the early height of the pandemic long before vaccines when she was doing her best to stay 6 feet from people
-regularly demeaned us especially the young female cashiers
-made fun of us if we needed to use the bathroom because he didn't like covering the register for us for 5 minutes
-when I asked him to put me on the day shift when the day cashier quit he refused and then told me I was a child and needed to learn how the world works when I argued with him about it
-would make a mistake and then pretend I made the mistake and lecture me for it as a weird game he thought was funny somehow
-hid another cashier's purse and watched amused with himself for 15 minutes as she searched for it and panicked that someone had stolen it from under her register
-would make me wait for my 15 minute because he suddenly had to go get food every time I asked for it even though he had already gone to get food and eaten it twice in the few hours he'd been working

I'm celebrating.

Oh, and the ""I don't have to give you a break"" spiel was about 2 days after I'd given 2 weeks notice. I walked out, after warning him I would walk out and giving him a chance to back off and he kept digging his hole. Since he had only scheduled the two of us in the store, he had to close by himself. 

For weeks after that he was left with only one cashier total on staff, while also being the only manager at that time because this was shortly after the end of lockdown last year and a lot of people found better jobs during lockdown. He left himself stuck on register for hours at a time every day, his least favorite responsibility. My friend went in the next morning knowing what happened but playing dumb, and he complained about having to be on register because I walked out; she went ""whaaaat? /What did you DO?"" and reported that he looked sheepish and annoyed and didn't want to talk about it.",0.0,lovelights09,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rbdo8x/asshole_incompetent_manager_at_my_old_job_got/,0.0,4.0,2625,263,www.reddit.com,fear,Negative,0.4753030240535736,0.11576316,anger,Negative,0.9419215321540833,0.9952395

I know of a graduate who have applied to over three hundred jobs (you heard that correctly: three- zero- zero) with a single phone interview to show. 

That phone interview?

I think it was for an unpaid internship. She said it was for *some* sort of internship, but we were in a group call, so I didn't want to put her on the spot in the event that resorting to an unpaid internship made her feel uncomfortable.. I just left it at that. 

The single interview I attended went perfectly. I checked all the qualifications. I had a background in science (Bachelors), I did relatable research to the posting, and I was even towards the end of my first semester for a Masters in Data Science, and one of the qualifications **on their website** that would put me ahead of other applicants was 'experience in Statistical Analysis.'

I never stopped smiling during that interview. They asked me tons of questions on my interests and how that would apply to the company; how my qualifications in SAS and analytics would enhance my undergraduate background as a potential R&amp;D technician. I had the most eager grin on my face, I knew I had this job before I even walked in the facility, and in the middle of the company tour, the HR manager even cocked her eyebrow and said, ""I don't know if anyone has ever told you, but you're an extremely positive person."" This sealed the deal for me. I was ready to get to work.

A week later, I got a phonecall back. The person who arranged the interview told me, ""The HR manager wanted to say that you seemed overqualified for the position and that you'd be best suited for a career in Data Science.""

Luckily this was a phonecall, because my facial expression was appalled. The entire time I was ready to reply, ""I understand you weren't there for the interview, but I'm focusing on my BS with my *single* semester in a Masters program complimenting my growing skills. I'm not seeing how this is an overqualification.""

I didn't. I wasn't interested in starting drama. So, I just thanked her for my time and hung up the phone.

I hate living in tiny 700 sq foot boxes. I want space. I want my own room. I feel so shut in and unable to roam. My bf has been wanting a large breed dog for years but can't because our apartment is too small for one. I'm worried he'll never be able to get a large dog because we can't afford to move somewhere bigger or buy a home. And forget about kids. 
We're just stuck here. And it fucking sucks. And I know tons of people who are in the same situation. I have a friend who rents a two bedroom apartment and has one kid and wants another but can't have one because she doesn't have a room that she can use as a nursery. 
I hate that we can't live fulfilled lives because we're forced to live in these small boxes. I think apartments are inhumane and are just another way that the housing market oppresses the 99%.

Sure it attracts the college socialist and Marxist types (I was indoctrinated as one in college, too, don’t worry 😉. And I also have a useless arts degree - graduated 2010 into a terrible economy after the ‘08 crash) but most of the complaining I see here is because of a boss that doesn’t respect you or a company that doesn’t value you. Shit working environments basically, and that’s a bummer and something you shouldn’t put up with - but what are the alternatives? 

I’m curious how many people have tired, or are interested in working for themselves? I ask because we’re actually in one of the best labor markets ever and good talent is VERY hard to find - I’ve experienced this personally - and there’s never been an easier time to freelance or start a business, work from home, and set your own rates. It honestly deeply saddens me how much opportunity there is, to see people working for shit bosses and shit companies. I get so pumped up every time I help a friend or talk to someone who wants to start working for themselves, because it’s opened my eyes to so many possibilities and changed my life incredibly. It’s not easy, but it’s much easier than the alternative and so much better in the long run. I really do think one of my callings may be to help people, like the people in this sub, have freedom and a better lifestyle when it comes to work. Not as a business, but as a personal rewarding passion and a way to serve the world and others. I really love seeing people succeed and make progress and realize their potential, warms my g’damn heart, seriously. 

I was a broke film major out of college, moved to NYC and had to Manny (male nanny) for $300 a week to even survive (my rent was $1200/month lol). I give myself credit for continuing to try new things and learn new skills, but I was very depressed for a while. Tough breakup, embarrassed about what I was doing, knew almost nobody, slept on a tiny studio floor for a while. Journaling and writing honestly saved me and kept me sane. 

After about 7 years, all while still trying to learn and acquire any skill I could that would be marketable, I finally went out on my own and made found decent success after the first 6 months. I got experience by offering my services for free, at first, but not for long. I’m honestly extremely grateful for the people who let me do this, it was a risk to them as well. I get that people exploit internships and free labor - but honestly I had no right to charge for the level of experience I had, which was basically 0, and consisted of watching online courses and YouTube videos. Doing some work for free made all the difference and opened doors I would not have had and helped me build a portfolio…so keep that in mind if you’re tempted to get too high and mighty about your value, If it actually doesn’t provide much value to the company. 

Anyway, I’m sure I’ll get a decent amount of hate on this post for whatever reasons, maybe optimism and positivity posts aren’t welcome here, haha jk. But I’d genuinely like to offer any help I can to anyone who has an interest in a side hustle, wants to work for themselves, learn a digital skill, whatever. I genuinely believe everyone in this sub could work for themselves and there’s plenty of work to go around and plenty of different types of work to do. Again, not easy, but wayyy better than the ducking alternative (going to keep the autocorrect there because I like saying ducking). I have my limited range of knowledge based on what I’ve done and seen personally, but I have a pretty solid wide range of business knowledge since I’ve worked with dozens of different business types and models. I can pretty much help you figure out how to monetize any talent or skill you might have, and I have a pretty good network as well (I’m in San Diego now but have also lived in NYC and SF - I like paying high rent, clearly).  

Happy to be of help as a resource to anyone out there, the best that I can, as I’m busy myself. But just figured if even one person gets inspired to get out of their shitty job and see the possibilities out there, then that will be a win in my book.

I am looking to maximize my salary after graduation. I still want to do science, but not lose myself in my work.

Here are my questions:
Do you like your job now? Why or why not? Was graduate school worth it? Are you working more or less now that you have your degree? How is your work/life balance?",0.0,Maleficent_Worker_31,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rumehk/work_life_balance_and_salary_after_graduate_school/,0.0,1.0,799,103,www.reddit.com,joy,Negative,0.5946940779685974,0.00058130187,anger,Neutral,0.8843470811843872,0.00053922256

The post goes onto attempt to create resentment against the purpose and mission of r/antiwork and r/union by creating jealousy and animosity against those who do strike.  It does this subtly by claiming that those that are following the missing of anti-work or are striking are privileged and that the folks that aren't cannot afford to strike.   They will pull you off one by one, from acting collectively to make change.  

&amp;#x200B;

This is a DIVIDE and CONQUER technique: someone coming into the page trying to get you to scab so that you will sabotage the union strikes, by making it seem as if there are two camps: one that benefits from striking, and one that doesn't.  This is not ok.  You should understand subtle anti-union propaganda when you see it so that you can inoculate yourselves against it.  Read up on unions and how they organized insurances to keep their union workers financially afloat during strikes and work stoppages, boycotts and slow downs.  

&amp;#x200B;

DO NOT believe that you cannot afford to fight for your rights to have a quality life for you and your family.  

&amp;#x200B;

Inoculate yourselves against anti-union, anti-organizing and anti-humanity propaganda that is spread not only by big business, but also by fellow employees and ""well meaning"" people who sound like they have your back.

I was seasonal, working full time for 6 months a year. 
Due to our field, COVID had increased our workload and complexity substantially and I was given a new role (read as increased workload but no pay raise) without proper training due to a lack of staff and a province-wide shut down. I literally had to bring my microscope home and work with biological samples in my bedroom but I was terrified of not being able to pay rent since CERB was so unreliable so I put up with it for a steady paycheck. 

3 months in my manager sends us a group text about how the owner recognized how hard we were working so she GENEROUSLY gave all staff a 60 cent raise... This was almost all of our first raises in the last 4 years.  Within 3 months I had enrolled in an online course to learn a new skill. I'm not going to lie, all my energy went into that course and the quality of my work dropped dramatically but the place was so poorly managed that nobody even noticed. 

6 months later I got a job earning 2.5 times more and BENEFITS  and when I told my manager I was leaving he completely pitched a fit about how I'd be leaving everyone in a hard spot because we were already understaffed and 6 of our annual contracts were due in the next 5 weeks. I felt bad for my coworkers but I'd been telling them for months to find new work and in the end they are adults and made their own choice so I stood firm and had my last day 3 weeks before their were due. 

Apparently it was a shit show but they didn't learn their lesson and are still understaffed half a year later. I've spoken to the two ole' timers left and both are looking for new work. Once they are gone that place will crumble since the manager had pushed all of his training duties on one and his bookkeeping and grant apps on the other and they've been doing that for no extra play since before I started there.

But I think there are a VAST number of people out there with varying skill sets and knowledge, who have a passion for not wanting to do jack shit except what they fucking feel like doing. We could get an ass load of shipping containers and convert them into living spaces plaster them with solar panels. Get some wind turbines, get some gardens going.. I eat meat but I'm more than happy to switch to solely veggies and fish if it means not having to spend the majority of my life in wage slavery. Would be helpful if we had a few engineers, construction and trades people, solar &amp; turbine techs on board who also have the dream of not doing shit. Or just people who have the willingness to learn sustainability tech and agriculture. Let's get some solutions going, some brainstorming, networking.. We don't have to live our lives in corporate bondage, social isolation and debt slavery, we really don't. This won't be for everyone though.. It's a minimalist non materialistic lifestyle.  

I'm envisioning this as a modern Epicurean movement. 

"" Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable pleasure in the form of a state of [ataraxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataraxia) (tranquility and freedom from fear) and [aponia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aponia) (the absence of bodily pain) through knowledge of the workings of the world and limiting desires. Correspondingly, Epicurus and his followers shunned politics because it could lead to frustrations and ambitions which can directly conflict with the Epicurean pursuit for peace of mind and virtues.""  

"" Although Epicureanism is a form of [hedonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism) insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from ""hedonism"" as [colloquially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquially) understood.

These trucks can have anywhere between $40,000 to $100,000 worth of merchandise. Each person on average will stage 3-4 trucks a night by themselves, and that includes 300-pound adjustable bases.

Before covid, the job was very hard but paid just enough to stick around for a while. After we got back was when the shit really hit the fan. Our crew was pretty short staffed from having a few people quitting right before covid hit, and them not hiring any new guys (8 people left in a 12 man crew). 

Past 9 months I've seen 5 guys get injured and put on light duty from the extra work of being short staffed(and guys being on light duty). The people above my managers will tell us things like ""We know what a hard job you guys have, we really appreciate it"" and then not give us a raise in July when the Los Angeles minimum went up, while also bragging about how great business is right now.

I got a $1 raise because I'd ruffled some feathers with HR, I'm pretty sure it was cheaper to throw me a dollar than risk me leaving. The People in our first shift are no joke getting paid minimum wage to unload and put away trailers full of mattresses and adjustable bases.

Also, there was a gas leak and both crews had to work a full shift while that was going on, at the time people that worked in the office got to go home. My understanding it was the mercaptan that lacked from the oil pump outside the warehouse, but it was still very unpleasant and I felt very Ill after working through that.

There's some more shit I could say about the company like how there trying to squeeze us like lemons for every drop of productivity now, or the stuff the people in first shift tell me. But I'm going to try and get off this rant and get to the main topic.

So a few days ago one of our leads got covid. He's also roommates with another guy that works with us, and it turns out he also had it. I had to come in on my day off to get tested when I came back after getting the results, I was the only one there on Friday night. Had to help pull 15 trucks with just me and my supervisor. 

They told me to stay home today, I'm pretty sure there are at least 5-6 people now that are going to be staying home for the next 2 weeks. I'm hoping all my co-workers are ok, but it's kind of fucked up that karma is punishing the company for mistreating their employees by giving all their employees covid. 

On the bright side, they can't hire temps to do are jobs. It takes a few months to learn how to operate the order pickers and how to pull the product.

189,opgouu,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/opgouu/my_employer_was_screwing_me_out_of_overtime_pay/,5,My employer was screwing me out of overtime pay so I reported it and got it back and then some. Figured you all might like this story.,"This company, I'll call A contacted my school during my last semester. They were looking for the best student the school had and that just happened to be me. It was at a community college and I had some university experience so I was killing it there (4.0 GPA)

A wanted me to do an internship which was fine but it wasn't an internship at all. It was just unpaid work. I had to teach myself things. That was annoying and lasted a month. At the time, I really needed a job so I took it. After the internship, I thought they would hire me but apparently they didn't trust me enough yet so they switched me to an independent contractor. This is problematic because it means I have to pay more in taxes and I have to pretty much lie on my tax return because I don't own a business. That lasted 4 months. I needed the money so I kept my mouth shut.

After 4 months, they hired me as a regular employee even though my job duties didn't change from intern, to independent contractor, to employee. Meaning I should have been an employee the whole time.

I thought I was in the clear. The pay was decent for my area so I figured I'd let it all slide, sweep it under the rug. But then about 4 months later, they decided they didn't like the IT administrator so they wanted me to start learning his job. The problem is they wanted me to stay 2 hours over each day and have him train me but I had to clock out and into another company they owned that was in the same building that I'll call B. So I was clocking into to B but still working for A so they could avoid paying me overtime. Of course, that's not how it works. I can't create 2 companies and work an employee 80 between both of them and not have to pay them overtime. It's even worst because I wasn't working for B at all. If this happens to you, it's called joint employment.

I wasn't hurting for money too much at this time, so I said, ""Fuck it, I'm not going to say anything and let it build up and then slam them with a complaint down the line."" Maybe if they were nice I would have been nice back but my boss is rude and manages via intimidation and fear. So of course, she has to pay the asshole tax.

In the end, it didn't work out exactly as I'd hope but it wasn't too bad either. I told a coworker and she got scared that I was going to mention her name when I complained. No idea why she'd think that. I'd never drag her into it but whatever. So they found out about it from her and within 3 weeks my desk was moved making my job more difficult, my overtime hours were stopped, one of my breaks was taken away (and then given back the next day after she talked with her lawyer lol), I furloughed for 90 days—during which someone else got hired to replace my position—and finally then I got a letter saying my position was eliminated altogether even though it wasn't. They claimed I was furloughed and the position was eliminated because of economic hardship due to covid-19 but they had hired another person about a month before I was furloughed, hired my replacement during my furlough, and had their leaky roof fixed which cost about 2 million according to my friend who still works there (probably not accurate though). I'm not buying their reasoning and hopefully a judge won't either.

After I got the letter, I submitted a complaint to the Department of Labor. They investigated the whole company and looked into all the employees. Turns out, they were screwing over a lot of their employees. About 15 people got between 300 and 600 dollars. I was rewarded about 2000 plus another 2000 for punitive damages. They flushed 1300 down the drain training me. It has already cost them but they aren't out of the woods yet.

I've also submitted two complaints to the IRS for when they misclassified me. They haven't made a judgement on that yet but they said it does appear to be the case that I was misclassified.

And finally, I submitted a claim for retaliation. I wasn't expecting them to do that but once I noticed they were, I started documenting everything I could. My boss making me move my desk near hers was the dumbest decision she could have made. She thought I didn't know what was going on but HR told IT and I'm friends with IT so he told me. I started documenting everything and while pretending I didn't know anything. I probably could have said something which was what I had originally planned but I have a lot of anxiety.

I'll update you guys on the IRS ruling and the retaliation complaint as soon as I hear something.

What's sad is that I gave these people my all and they just screwed me every chance they got. I worked there for 18 months. I missed 1 hour of work because my phone died in the middle of the night. I was really good at my job, my fellow coworkers liked me. You couldn't have asked for a better employee but they went out of their way to take advantage of me.

I just don't get it. Like, bitch, I'm on YOUR TEAM. I'm busting my ass to make YOU richer and instead of being nice and delighted you, fuck me over? What the fuck is wrong with you?

This isn't the first time they've been caught doing something like this. A few years ago, they got caught  by imports/customs for claiming some goods they were shipping was only 10,000 dollars when it was worth 100,000 dollars to avoid paying so much tax on it. They were fined over 911,000 dollars + 250,000 in lawyer fees.

I work a graveyard shift at a child therapy center, cleaning the house. I work alternating 8 and 9 hour shifts, five days a week. $13/hr. I got my first full paycheck the other day, it was $960 after taxes.

$960. For about 90 hours of work.

This is before I even apply for their health insurance, which would take another $200 or more out of each paycheck.

So is this really it? Working myself to the bone, always tired, for just enough money to pay my bills and continue existing? I don't make enough to put anything significant away for savings. I don't make enough to even treat myself to anything nice beyond the occasional fast food meal. All I do anymore is go to work, clean, go home, take care of my dogs, sleep, and repeat. I don't even enjoy my weekends because they're spent just recovering from the work week. I can't hang out with my friends because our schedules are so different, and even if I could, who knows if I would even have the energy.

Is this it? Is this all there is? Is there nothing I can do? Do I just have to deal with this?

I feel so burnt out. I always ache, I'm always tired, and I don't even make $500 a week.

I'm a college dropout, so it seems like my only options are to continue working these terrible low-paying jobs, or else go into massive debt to get a college degree that doesn't even guarantee that I'll get a better job at any point.

199,rehwsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rehwsj/action_against_amazon/,6,Action against Amazon.,"Recently the action against Kelloggs and success with Starbuck unionizing has made one thing evidently clear. Companies will try to fuck their workers for as to squeeze every last bit of profit from their bones,but if we fight back there is nothing they can do but to bow down. So I ask, why can't the same be done to amazon? 

Amazon's the biggest asshole in this space. Not only do they steal ideas and sell products to force out small innovators they also are abusing human rights at their warehouses. Amazon's treatment of workers is well know. Bezos has bought newspapers like Washington post and others to change the narrative in his favour. That mf even had the audacity to thank the customers back for making him rich enough to go to space. Why can't we thank him back by doing something similar to what everyone did to Kelloggs.

Amazon is only set to be bigger. That just means more people will be harassed while Dr Evil gets bigger . One of THE richest person in the history of this planet and he cannot muster enough to pay his workers? He owns AWS which runs the internet, he owns retail space, he owns the actual space. That is way too much power for one person. All that and he cannot pay his taxes and workers? People are okay with it? 

There cannot be a business justification to it other than corporate greed. Costco has a much better pay and working condition. They are also in the retail space albeit a different business model.
, but Amazon's economies of scale as compared to Costco is much bigger. They can easily cut profits to pay workers a fair wage. 

I'm a finance person and I support development of businesses and promotion of economy and even I agree this is corporate greed.

I won’t give specifics in order to protect my identity, but my passion is supporting others who want to start worker cooperatives. 

It’s been such a life changing thing to be part of, in terms of my own personal fulfilment and financial security. 

I’d love to get better at communicating about them, and plan to start publicly sharing more resources. Please help me practice!

I've been straight up loving these posts lately with people quitting their jerbs and never looking back.

Yes! Human beings should treat each other with mutual love, admiration, and respect. Anything unwarranted and less than this should not be tolerated. 

Previously I've posted about how much I desperately need to get out of my current toxic work situation. I've been actively trying to find something else for so long. I knew it was not a good fit right away, and I did not walk away because I needed the steady income. Fast forward years and I am still here. I still wake up most nights gripping my hands really tightly because I am so stressed I take it out on myself in my sleep. I have nightmares many nights a week. I haven't enjoyed anything in so long because I am consumed by thoughts of my situation and needing to get out of it, but I have no path to do so. It feels like I am in prison, yet even prison would probably feel like a kind of relief at this point. 

I just got another rejection email for a job that I could do in my sleep. No explanation as to why. 

I used to be so confident. My job has taken my self esteem and punched it to oblivion. I just feel so stupid and less than. It has been literal years since I have had a ""win"" or been complimented on work that I've done (I work so hard, and only get told about what I do wrong). 

I'm not sure why I am even sharing this other than my heart hurts right now. I never cry, but if I did not have a meeting starting in a half hour I would sit and let myself cry this out. 

Will the world ever be shaped in such a way that we can all work hard but enjoy our lives? In such a way that the things that we do MEAN something more than just accruing revenue to line someone else's pockets?

I am 21 years old.

Ever since working my first job back in 2016, I've been employed at 10 places. Lots of these jobs were just a means to a paycheck, but some I had decided to pursue for being related to passions and hobbies of mine. I've learned plenty, which I suppose is the one silver lining, however tarnished it may be. My most recent job has actually been a bit of a breath of fresh air. While still riddled with typical flaws that most labor jobs have, it is by far the best environment I've worked in. 

Well, now I want out.

Since the beginning of November (and I literally mean November 1st) my luck, which had previously been treating me well, turned for the worse. I was """"""pulled over"""""" in an illegal traffic stop *in my work parking lot*. Since that point, life has been rotten. Since I've enjoyed my current job more than any other I've ever worked, my attendance and work ethic had been very good. Well... I'm sitting here the eve before heading back to work after 5 missed days. My supervisors are unhappy. I am unhappy. None of these absences were my fault. I didn't want this to happen. Yet, now I stare in the face the possibility of losing my job. Does that make me upset? I.. Don't think it does, really. 

I've thought I loved many of my previous jobs. They all turned extremely sour at one point or another, usually by no fault of my own. Working at FedEx, it is currently the peak season, and shifts are greuling. Much stress is on my shoulders (ba dum tiss); the drivers I load for verbally abuse me for things out of my control; my supervisors critique me for being overwhelmed by the volume *they* are supposed to keep manageable, there sometimes is literally *no water* despite it being a very active job. These were not issues before the holidays, so my opinion of working there has certainly suffered. Unrelated to why I've recently missed so many days, though.

But what does upset me... is thinking of how I have to go find another job if this one fails. Like, this job fucking *sucks*, don't get me wrong. But it sucks less than most. My coworkers are mostly cool people. But if *this* still drives me insane, what *won't*?

I'd love to have my own business... maybe run a record store, or a hobby shop. Or be a professional musician, since I write so much music. But you need to be able to invest and risk for those goals. I don't have money, I don't have capital, and soon I might not even have a job. These are unachievable goals. 

But I cannot keep cycling through jobs like this. There's no short supply of simple work for me to get. I've done things like landscaping, tradework, retail, food service, janitorial, and now warehouse, plus others. All over the board. Nothing has stuck around. I am so, *so* desperate to leave this horrible cycle. 

Maybe I'll try and see my doctor... have him recommend me a psychiatrist or something. See if there's some way, *any* way, I can make it onto SS/unemployment. Something. My mental health has degraded so heavily and I need a break. I need a chance to actually do things other than work and run around with my head metaphorically cut off.

10 jobs in less than 4 years is just insane. Only a few have been at the same time as each other. Please tell me I'm not alone. Only 2 of those jobs I have left on good terms. I can't be the only one with this shit luck. Constantly getting abused by employers in some way shape or form, all while my sanity tanks and starts rotting all the other parts of my life as a result. 

I'm sorry for the large wall of text. I have so much I need to get out of my system. I feel so trapped. Bills are piling up quicker than they can be paid.

Being born in a capitalist society the most I hoped for was moving to a western European country that does capitalism the least stressfully but after talking to my brother who has been recently listening to tankie podcasts he brought up a lot of points that I've been hearing about like how the wealth of the richest countries are propped up on the exploitation of poorer countries and it's fixed that way so they can never get ahead. Now moving doesn't seem so appealing. 

I've been reading anti-capitalist sentiments on here for a while but my American conditioning made me instinctively distrust them and I've always been discouraged from learning on my own because learning the truth about things always seemed an endlessly complicated and insurmountable task and 'I need to focus on finding a way to sell my labor anyways.' I struggle to read or understand history. Now I'm motivated to at least try to learn more about how the world works (based and sockopilled) so I can better articulate my ideas.

Upon initially hearing about this group, I scoffed at the idea. I figured it was entitled people complaining about having to work. However, the more time I spend here, the more I agree with everyone here. I do have some questions though.

Is the general consensus with anti-work to force companies to change by grouping together as people? Or is it to group together and force the government to whip companies into shape? Or does method not matter as long as results are achieved?

I consider myself to be conservative. I desire as little government involvement as possible. I want a smaller government, fewer taxes, less military, the whole nine yards. And, as of right now, I despise the idea of forcing corporations into submission using the government. I enjoy the idea of unions grouping together to achieve the goal.

For my second question, do my ideas conflict with the consensus of this subreddit? I seriously can't find total agreement on it. Some posts are people stating that ""we aren't all communists"", and then the comments tend to disagree.

I suppose I would like a bit of information on what it means to be antiwork. Is it anti-work, or anti-corporate power mongers?",0.0,koller101,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qikx9u/a_couple_questions/,4.0,1.0,1257,143,www.reddit.com,anger,Negative,0.5590773820877075,0.00067179394,anger,Neutral,0.8420692682266235,0.00052004686

There's about 50 locations, mostly across the east coast and it's pretty decently well known in major cities where there's at least 1 location. If you don't know what it is, it's a pretty decently upscale resturant(not quite fine dining), but most of the dinner entrees are between $25-40 and the average ticket price per person for a meal is between $35-$60.

I'm a server at one of these locations, and it's a pretty high volume store. In case you didn't know, servers make tips plus 2.17 an hour typically. At Firebirds and MOST OTHER RESTAURANTS WITH SERVERS AND HOSTS, hosts do not earn an hourly wage. Instead we have what's called ""tipshare"". What this means is that 3% of my overall sales is taken out of my tips to subsidize the hosts pay. Doesn't sound so bad right? Well, with the typical price of a meal for 2-4 people at between $80-300, some nights I sell 2 grand worth of food, and suddenly 60 fucking dollars is taken out of my pay at the end of the night to pay other employees. This is legalized theft. Usually that 3% of my sales ends up being between 15 and 20 percent of my tips for the night.

BUT IT GETS WORSE because my tips haven't even been taxed yet, so at the end of the year, I'm going to have to further pay out another 15 to 20 percent if I'm lucky. So at the end of the night, suddenly that $100 that I made is now $60-70, meanwhile the CEO is worth 10s of millions and is getting fuck you rich off the backs of people he's grossly underpaying.

234,rhihin,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rhihin/struggling_to_function_in_a_normal_schedule_is/,6,"Struggling to function in a ""normal"" schedule is NOT a moral failure.","This was originally going to be a comment on someone else's post, but it would have been somewhat off-topic to the conversation they were actually creating.

I am not a morning person. I have never been a morning person. As far back into my childhood as I can remember, I've always operated this way. My peak mental hours are much later in the day. Obviously, such a thing doesn't work great in a society all about grinding out peak ""productivity"" hours. In some of the worse jobs I've worked, even allotting a more than sufficient amount of time to sleep would do nothing to keep me from feeling groggy and impossibly slow when trying to start my day the next morning, and things like penalties for being late only worsened lifelong depression tendencies under the misunderstanding that it was *my own moral failing*, as if I would choose to... not be able to get moving fast enough?

Obviously, this wasn't actually something in my control, but that leads to a depressive cycle. If I either went to bed early and couldn't make mornings work, or I stayed up ""too late"" (existing for my own interests for a while) and couldn't make mornings work, of course I'd get trapped in the habit of neglecting my own sleep. Especially since I often lie awake at night for potential hours because my brain is operating at the time it is hard-wired for, I'm sometimes just fucked regardless. As this goes on, I ended up more and more tired in the mornings, making it all that much worse.

Social views on things like sleeping in later, or staying up later, are always demonized. *""People like that are slackers""* or *""That person needs to join the adult world.""* It's almost certainly a remnant from humanity's early agricultural days, where efficiency was the difference between survival and starvation. However, it should be obvious that we are **far** beyond this stage in most places. We have so much automation, reliable artificial lighting, and other similar technology so that most jobs could technically be completed at any time.

It's not like removing the pressure of ""normal hours"" would unravel society. Either A) plenty of people would still get up earlier because they're more capable in the mornings, or B) few people would get up earlier, and most would start later anyway. If result A happens, congratulations, fairly neutral outcome, no point in enforcing this, people will do their things when ready. If result B happens, ***then why the fuck would we keep forcing a system that works against the majority???***

(The answer is obviously to keep production high so the owners of capital can make maximum profit, but I think most people on here probably could pick up on the implication.)

TL;DR: **If you struggle to function like a perfect robot on someone else's schedule, it is not some personal decision or moral weakness failing you.**

To address some counterarguments I can already anticipate: Yes, just ""resting more"" would help people function in less ideal time frames; if people would stop being forced into multiple overlong days in a row, had sufficient off-time provided as succinct weekends instead of individual days scattered throughout a week (when lucky enough to have more than one day off a week), and weren't trapped into skeleton crews by stingy employers (all things I've run into in previous jobs), then it's reasonable to tell people to ""just rest more."" Yes, healthy eating and exercise would help people function better too; if people had more time to cook and exercise, the money to afford healthier options, and weren't constantly being bombarded by enforced corporate messages to *Consume the profitable things we already knew would be bad for you!*, this problem would be more likely to resemble someone ""making a choice.""",0.0,BaneShake,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rhihin/struggling_to_function_in_a_normal_schedule_is/,0.0,1.0,3761,369,www.reddit.com,sadness,Negative,0.49209994077682495,0.05192987,joy,Negative,0.8555159568786621,0.001404362

I (35f) work in the back office of a credit union/bank. Had my review earlier this month and got a 3.5% raise. I have been with this company for 7 years and I’m now making a whopping $19.50hr. Don’t get me wrong I love working here, my manager has been the best manager I have ever had. My husband (33m) works retail and has worked for his company for almost 17 years and as a manager he only makes $22hr (I shite you not). 

He has had 8 employees under him quit so it’s him and one person running his department which needs a minimum of 8-10. The store is only allowing him to hire 1 full time and 3 PT. 

My job, we have been hiring but no real turn over which is surprising. But I work from home and my anxiety is almost non existent, until last month we were told that when the new administration building is built we will all be returning to the office. (Back story they were renting a building and the landlord sold it during Covid so they are building their own which they own the land and building)

We need to find a job that will pay me at least $25hr and definitely prefer WFH, so he “can look for a job and get a pay cut”(his words and I know he is f***ing worth more but won’t listen) 

Only problem is I have such bad anxiety (social) and depression that just thinking of going through the interview process just makes me go into a f***ing panic attack. Hell I had several after getting hired at this bank and at my last job i did attempt something “else” which put us in a financial bind.

This past Friday I struggled to will myself to do the job. It felt like a part of my soul just said "" no, this is it, you need to move on with your life."" This feeling has been building up for months but I ignored it until now. I should have started looking for jobs when I first started feeling it but I just never felt like I could get going with it. I kept thinking the feeling would go away. Now im at the point where I'm about to put in my 2 weeks notice. And once that is in i will be seriously looking for jobs in the non profit sector that i will hopefully find more fulfilling with my almost completed graduate degree in non profit management.

My family hasnt been on my side. My brother thinks i should wait until i have another job lined up. I just cant do the job anymore though...my soul is screaming to stop. My mom just retired and she said there were plenty of times she wanted to quit working but didnt. She stuck out her grueling goverment job for another year even though she could have retired sooner.

But I think more can be done if we coordinated our resources more. 

Which brings me to my idea. I am imagine a website where people donate money that is then redistributed directly to those that need it. I feel like this form of online mutual aid would be more helpful than waiting for the government to help us and waiting for unions and the labor movement to really take off again. As you know the government doesn't give a damn about us, as exemplified by the news of restarting student loan payments. And though unions are great they have a long uphill battle to reach real change. 

This idea can fill in the gaps and make that fight easier. I imagine people could donate into a large pool that's gets distributed as needed or they could donate to specific causes sort of like go fund me. This could things such as donating to a unions strike fund, or paying union legal costs or dues, helping someone make their student loan payments, or pay medical debt, people could also donate to teachers to help them buy supplies for their students, or people could donate money to pay for aid for disasters or to fix broken infrastructure like lead pipes, it could even be used for lobbying as distasteful as that might be. 

I'm not a web developer so I don't know the logistics of making such a thing but I think it would be a great way to really put our solidarity to the next level and show the world that we can make a difference by ourselves.

Boss told him to piss behind the shed. It all circles back to LACK OF RESPECT IN THE WORKPLACE,"# Lack of respect in the workplace is what has drawn myself and likely many others to this subreddit. I'll start from the beginning...

&amp;#x200B;

**OBLIGITORY READING**

# 

**This lack of respect comes in many different forms such as, but not limited to:**

* Shit Pay or denied raises
* Operating a business with unsafe working conditions 
* Increased workload with no compensation
* Negative comments from bosses about your colleagues 
* Bosses trying to make others look at fault for their own actions, or lack thereof 
* Condescending comments from bosses
* Racism or sexism from bosses
* Childish tantrums from management
* Withholding information such as allotted vacation/holiday/sick pay
* Retaliating against injured employees (deny pay increases/threats of replacement)
* Failure to acknowledge an employees medical situation or needs
* Harassing text messages

My coworkers and I have experienced all of these examples and more from one single person. He is our service manager and is a completely worthless piece of shit. A drain on employee pride and morale. We have lost good employees because they were paid and treated like shit. There have been complaints made to HR where our boss would then throw a tantrum for a few days ""I'm just pissed off about the things people are saying about me"".  There have been multiple complaints directly to the owner of our TOYOTA dealership. We have literally had our whole service department in the owners office complaining about the disrespect that takes place. Our boss almost behaved himself for a few days and went back to his default piece of trash form. 

&amp;#x200B;

We aren't going to leave and let them win. We have since unionized and went through all of the textbook anti-union bullshit from management and ownership. We voted 100% YES. We are nearing our first contract. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**MY ORIGINAL REASON FOR THIS POST**

My coworker who I consider a friend is going through liquid chemotherapy treatment. For anyone unfamiliar with this- the radiation exists your body through pissing, shitting, sweat, tears, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

When somebody is going through liquid chemotherapy they are to have a separate bathroom because of the radiation being expelled from their body. I don't know if this varies state to state or even if it is recommended by the EPA or where it comes from.  The point is- my coworker went to my boss and explained this. My boss took it upon himself to come up with his own solution of designating my coworker to go ""behind the shed"".  

&amp;#x200B;

It's fucking December in Illinois for one. Second, who the fuck are you to change the rules about disposing of radioactive waste? Third, my coworker is being treated less than a human fucking being! We have three bathrooms and surely one can be designated form him to use. 

The problem is that my coworker called me about this and was pretty upset. He comes to work feeling extremely sick while undergoing treatment and is having more and more work (physical labor) forced upon him. And to top it off we have this morally bankrupt service manager telling him that his bathroom is outside in December? **He asked that I don't bring this up with HR, boss, or our union rep.** I texted my coworker and told him my thoughts about this and recommend he talk to the owner but he won't.  I feel the need to step in or somehow bring consequences for these actions but I have to keep my word and honor his request. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess that is all. I'll gladly consider any advice that let me keep my word. I told him I wouldn't go to the company or our union rep.

Let me begin by saying I am extremely in agreement with everyone about the poor treatment of workers by companies and think The Great Resignation is a catalyst for much-needed changes in the areas of fair pay, comprehensive benefits packages addressing all needs of workers and their families, and so much more. I am writing this post in regards to the ongoing saga of ""No one wanting to work"" and the strange predicament for those of who are looking for work, are qualified and willing to give our all, and yet are turned away as postings appear, vanish, then reappear for roles we were turned down for. It's so strange how the ""labor shortage"" has not opened up the door for applicants from nontraditional backgrounds or for ethnic minorities and the disabled to fill roles others are leaving in the corporate space. 

As many of you have pointed out, it seems like the appearance of hiring to satisfy government requirements is the name of the game, while profits that could be going to increase current salaries or salary offers to new employees instead get hoarded in CEO pay and stock buyback, among other things. As someone working in the financial services industry, I note just how the loss of key contributors has not at all resulted in the scope of hiring bringing in people of color, women, or young people from non-Econ/Finance/Business Administration backgrounds who are eager to learn. Companies are agnostic to doing any form of training or imagining someone capable who's not in their same socioeconomic category.

My boss is American and no one from the team covers my scope.

I know this can sound like a brag for American folks, but my country by law has 30 days of mandatory vacations per year, which I get punished for if I don’t request 45 days before and/or if I don’t take 30 days inside a 12 month period beginning at the admission date. I can break it up until 3 leaves of 10 days each. 

Yet since I’m the only one who can do my job, I have to pretty much try to advance a full fucking month of work beforehand because I have no one to cover for me. And this is not the kind of work where nothing happens during my leave, so I have to exhaust every single scenario in a document file and hope my colleagues help, otherwise I get bad reviews if the objectives aren’t met.

As my American boss hasn’t taken this into account in his expectations of workload of me, I basically end up doing overtime “illegally”, as my company simply has a bank of hours per year overtime policy and it has to be 0 by may every year, so instead of being compensated financially I just get extra days off, for which I’d have to do the exact same fucking extra amount to work to be able to not work and still achieve my goals.

I was a pretty good apprentice. Did my work, helped where I could, didn't complain, asked thoughtful questions etc. 

Last week, my boss texted me and said that he was sorry but he had no apprentice work for me because the project was at a standstill. He referred me to another company and I honestly was up in the air on whether or not I should call them for more work. I didn't. 

Even though I was there for a little over a month I absolutely hated it. Waking up at 4:30AM, coming home and being absolutely exhausted, and a handful of aches and pain. At one point my hands were absolutely killing me to the point where I couldn't open my hand all the way. I have a history of shoulder issues and this job exacerbated it. I don't even wanna go into how my knees and feet were feeling. Lol I was also only making $17 an hour but after taxes it ended up being $12. I honestly would feel insulted on pay day because I worked so hard only to bring home $500 a week. 

I was ready to call it quits based on the way my body was feeling alone but my girlfriend said that my body would get used to it and how I worked really hard to get the job. She's not lying. I did work really hard to get the job. 

My body did become somewhat accustomed after the first couple of weeks. Things were still hurting but they hurt a lot less. Lol 

The project is supposed to be done in December so my plan was to stick it out until then and then make a decision as to whether or not I wanted to stay. Well, that decision was made for me. 

Even though I worked hard to get this job, I'm not going back. My body felt wrecked after a month and change so I could only imagine what it would be like in a couple of years if I stuck it out.

* Start Organizing or joining a Union.
* Post about it on all social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, Insta, etc.)
* If you have talents, use them (Youtube, Tik Tok, Infographics, etc.)
* Tell everyone you talk to regularly and stress why it's important and how they can help.

If a post furthers the goals, then at the bare minimum, upvote it to get as many posts on [r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all) as possible, even if you don't entirely agree. More attention is a benefit to everyone. Why care about stupid internet points when your lively hood is on the line.

On last Thursday, i got an offer at a new job and accepted. I told my boss the same day and gave my notice. My paycheck to be deposited the following day (Friday) was already in process.

We are an at will state, and I know he can change my pay to whatever he wants essentially going forward. But my question is, can he do that retroactively?

""Tips for Revolutionary Homesteaders: How to Render Fat from a Corrupt Public Servant,"" By Christopher Swanberg (ME).","Tips for Revolutionary Homesteaders: How to Render Fat from a Corrupt Public Servant.

(useable for: eliminating waste, cooking, greasing machinery and, generally, easing friction between social componentry of your machines of personal dignity)

\*For this life-hack, I like to use an obese state-court judge, past its prime (known for their especially fatty livers) and in the process of whithering (you can know when it's ripe by its condescending smile!). You may, however, choose to modify this method to take advantage of any bureaucrat or fascist population that becomes intolerably abundant for their season and which starts to harm your garden.

Note: Yields will vary depending on the source: A demonstrably racist police officer will likely produce less grease than an obese judge (though, sometimes such racist police oil is of exceptionally high-quality and very satisfying in a vinaigrette over a light salad) and a politician may yield prolific volumes of oil, but of very poor quality (politicians in nature will consume anything - even putrid garbage (politician oil is well-known for its impurities)). In sufficient quantity, even low-quality politician oil may be effectively utilized on the Revolutionary's homestead for the general betterment of conditions while you work.

\*Rendering fat also can serve as a fantastic justification for getting out and culling any ""blue lives matter"" or ""thin blue line"" sympathies from your garden, which may have grown unconscionably parasitic and self-serving. Luckily, these parasites voluntarily identify themselves with badges, blacked-out American-Flags, Him&gt;i stickers, and their exceptionally small and underutilized reproductive bits - indeed, curious at it would seem, many of these parasites openly brag about how they underutilize their reproductive bits (I've asked a biologist who told me this starts to develop at the smallest biological scale. ""In cells,"" he said, whatever that means). In no time at all, you'll become a marvelously proficient parasite-hunter, and, after your first few attempts, your garden will be grateful!)

Safety note: Rendering animal fat may be dangerous, as is the collection of animal fat. Live animals have a tendency to lash out, once cornered, and are known to claw and scratch. Do not fear, they are generally weak, having accrued fat for rendering through years of lazy exploitation of real wealth-producing parts of your garden. A single, forceful, and deliberate ax-strike, blunt or sharp end, to any point above the renderee's shoulders will suffice for permanently subduing a subject of nearly any size. Don't worry about causing pain: they are parasites causing pain to productive parts of your garden, they are thorny and hard to manage, they grow to spaces where they are unwanted, they are hard to remove, and, last of all, they are like lobsters! What appears to be their screams is just pressure being released from within their exoskeletons - they are incapable of feeling pain like you or I! Happy hacking!)

Step 1, Preparation:

Dig out a shallow pit in sandy soil, roughly 12 inches deep, 4 feet wide (may need to be wider, depending on the width of the subject, and 2 feet longer than the hight of the subject.

Fill this pit with your kindling and fuel material (I like to use charcoal - for the convenience and the chance to use my propane flame thrower) and ignite. Once your coal bed is smoldering at a constant low-to-medium temperature, assemble your cast iron army of pots and fry-pans and set them into the amber embers. Proceed to Step 2.

Step 2, Melting:

Animal fat, like that from a judge, renders at a low temperature - a little bit higher than 100°C or 212°F. Higher temperatures can lead to a less pure end product, a lingering acrid or burnt tastes in the fat you render, or even a dangerous grease fire.

Remove liver and heart - usually dense with fat - (especially in an older judge!) and set aside. (We'll address how to make the best use of these tasty tidbits in a later episode, I promise!)

Remove visible fat layers and globules from the subject's body, trying to separate meat and tissue. Cube this fat into 1"" by 1"" by 1"" inch cubes and begin placing these fat-cubes into your heating cast iron army. Animal fat must be rendered slowly. Allow chunks to liquify. Eventually, cackling cracklins of small bits of meat will turn golden and the fat will be liquid. With sufficient stirring and careful heat attendance, the liquid fat should be mostly clear. Remove from heat and allow to cool until you are comfortable handling, further. Proceed to Step 3.

Step 3, Filtration:

Of the various methods of filtering rendered fat for use and storage, my favorite is the most rusticly basic: through a few layers of cheesecloth into a recycled mason jar. Allow to stand. Check for rancidity before consuming at any time in the future (especially if you are trying to limit your refrigeration related power expenses). Remember that once-good-fat can lose freshness and its constitution - never be afraid to throw out bad fat and start again.

Rendering fat can take all day, it will leave your homestead smelling like bacon for a week, and it almost certainly attracts hungry bears that Russian as soon as they smell an opportunity for a fat-dense snack. Sometimes, rendering fat is a good distraction from work: a fun way to spend a day. Other times, it's a completely necessary chore - vital to prevent an infestation of bureaucrats from overrunning a potentially idyllic garden.

We fight so hard and for so long for things such as relief bills, better pay, better working hours, better jobs, better rights, but does it really even make a dent if we're still trapped in this nightmare capitalist system where people must give up the precious time in their lives to make others money and just to survive? Where people must sacrifice everything just to keep a roof over their heads and to pay for healthcare. Where millions are struggling and will continue to struggle under this oppressive system regardless of the small help the govt decides to give us.  

I'd like to think we are inching our way out of it but I'm also a realist and know that history repeats itself and capitalism will most likely never be done and gone. We're also still fighting many (re: ALL) of the same issues that generations past dealt with even though we very clearly have answers and solutions to do things much better. 

And yes I understand that one way to combat this sentiment is to organize and contribute but I'm much more of an educator than an activist.

I'm try to be friends with my employees, I'm really flexible with what they do, I just give them a tasks and I don't keep asking about it I just expect them to do it in the end of the week, basically they can do whatever they want as long as they give some results, but even if they can't get the expected result I ask what happened and I try to help them in what they are struggling with.
In Brazil we don't have call in sick so every time you're sick you need to go to the doctor and get proof that you were there and couldn't go to work, but I think that's a really idiot thing here, so I trust my employees when they say they're sick and I let them stay home I also don't mind if they have some personal thing to do.
I try always to give constructive feedback in the best possible way and I'm always asking what I can do better and I try my best to do every possible thing.
I know I'm not the best boss in the world but I try my best, I also know the job doesn't pay much but they can make good money when they achieve the planned objectives and goals.

My question is:
Why don't they do the minimum necessary to reach the objectives and goals that they have created?
And why now that they have left my company and are working in companies that are really strict they do everything with a smile in their face?

I reached out a few days ago asking for a specific start date, and she told me she is isn't hiring until the New Year to make sure her budget is good. WHAT?? WHY did you tell me to reject my other offers then, and that I was hired? Why did she waste my time and hurt my other opportunities?

I was so excited to return to this job. Now I'm sheepishly asking one of the other positions if they'd still like me.

And I don't even care about the work. I have 0 fucking interest in it. I never cared about engineering. Never, not once. The only way I got through college was constantly being drunk and high. It was a fucking miserable experience and it only get worse. Why would anyone want to do this?

And now. And NOW I have to get my PE license. They won't stop pestering me about it. I don't fucking want a PE license, I don't even want to be doing any of this. More responsibility? More Work? Are you fucking kidding me? Take that shit and shove it.

Last week we had a project that literally had only been worked on for a few days and was suddenly due 100% on that Friday and on that Monday my boss say me down in her office for a little chat ""Sometimes, being an engineer means working more than 40 hours."" Fucking why? I don't make these deadlines. Why is it more than 40 hours a week? 40 hours is already too much. You think I give a fuck about making these deadlines? I worked nearly 60 hours that week. By the time I left on Friday I couldn't even see straight. 

And just last week I came home sick because I got a passive aggressive e-mail about accurately tracking my time down to 10 minute intervals. Are you fucking kidding me? FUCK OFF. Why did I get that e-mail? Because I mentioned to the secretary that I was going to have to start leaving work 15 minutes early so that I could get to my class that I have to take to prep for the PE exam. You know what she said ""You still have to work 40 hours."" I don't fucking care about the time. I'm not sitting here writing down what I'm doing every fucking 10 minutes. I'm sorry, I'm not. Fuck that.

The only good thing about this career, this industry, whatever, is the pay. That's it. That's all. There is nothing intrinsically satisfying about it. There's nothing interesting. There's nothing fun. FUCK ENGINEERING

Jesus Christ. I am just so fucking pissed. I am so fucking tired. I've been working since I was 16. I always ALWAYS keep doing what people keep telling me to do and I don't even fucking get why. I'm miserable all the god damn time. I'm tired all the god damn time. I'm not even depressed, I'm just fucking mad. 

The world needs to change. Like now. fucking NOW. Fuck being lectured. Stop it with your stupid work ethic tropes. FUCK

Employers always offer the ESA minimums here. Fortunately for you, there is common law precedence for severance pay. This will roughly be 1 months pay per year of employment, if this pay falls over a bonus period, then the bonus must be paid out in full. 

The bar to prove a with cause termination in Canada is also REALLY high. You should challenge this, even if you are caught red handed. 

This is very much feelings based as well. If you have proof of a shitty employer, you will get more money. If there is some evidence it is for a protected reason (race, religion, sexual preferences,) you can get even more money. 

During your termination you will be asked to sign a release. This will limit your ability to collect severance to what they are offering. DO NOT SIGN THIS. Tell them you will need to have this reviewed prior to signing/agreeing. They cannot force you to sign this, and cannot withold your last cheque if you do not sign.

The company has been receiving grants from the US government ever since because so few labs were offering COVID-19 testing at the time. In April 2020 they started requiring employees to take a COVID test once a week. Perfectly reasonable as there was no vaccine at the time and they were hiring literally hundreds of people. A few months later they started requiring employees to take COVID tests twice a week. I thought it was unnecessary as the vaccine had become available, but I didn't read much into it. Once the vaccine had been available for a few months, the company required all employees to be vaccinated, unless medically exempt. After this, employees were required to test for COVID three times a week. At this point we were all immediately suspicious, so I went back and looked at the numbers. Both times the company upped the number of COVID tests employees were required to take, it was following a significant decrease in COVID requests from clients.

(18 college student). 

It’s not much to complain about compared to some things, but my parents’ and employer’s attitudes make me pretty irritated. In my initial interview for a part time position serving food at an assisted living facility, my employer implied that I’d be working Friday-Sunday afternoon shifts, which I was fine with. When it was time to get my official shifts, I was told I’d be working Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, and Sunday mornings starting at 5:30 am. I was a bit upset at this, but reluctantly agreed since he kept trying to guilt me into it.

My parents not only saw no issue with this, but expected me to be grateful for the opportunity to work a longer shift. I’m a typical teenager, waking up early completely fucks my sleep schedule for the next few days. I’m always visibly irritated when talking to people about it, and my parents get mad at my attitude. It’s a shitty minimum wage job that I was guilted into taking a terrible shift for, and I’m supposed to be happy about it?

Then, the other day my employer texted me asking me to change my Tuesday to a Wednesday. I said I’d prefer not to, since I’m distracted enough doing school work and I don’t want to work such a draining job two days in a row. He replies, trying to guilt me into changing, saying “the rest of us work multiple days in a row” and “life won’t allow you to do this in the future.” No shit, Sherlock, but this job isn’t my priority and it’s certainly not my life. I told him I’d take the Wednesday if he moved me off the Sunday to any afternoon, and he instantly backtracked. I’m still going to ask to change it in a few weeks, but I’ll leave it for now. 

I told my parents about his attempt, and they immediately got pissed about my attitude. Apparently, I’m supposed to give into everything, even though it’s my employer’s responsibility to figure out scheduling and I’m not obligated to change anything for him. He’s already screwed me over and been a dick about it. My dad gets pissed and starts ranting about the mindsets of my generation regarding work, and all I could do was think about this sub.

I was looking forward to it, I worked so hard to get in, and now I hate it. The whole track is based around being a cog in a machine for a company like disney or dreamworks. which i wanted at first, but honestly, i don't know if i wanna do it anymore. 

For context: I would really like my own 2D animated TV show, or to network to start freelancing with both digital and traditional art mediums. I'm super into horror/macabre and realism and wanted to produce art that reflects that. I wanted to use this degree to get my foot in the door.

But like I said this track is pixar/disney focused. They want cute, family-friendly, cartoonish animation and art. It's also a full time job in itself. Long lectures, large projects with very small time frames, etc. So much so that I had to quit my part time job just so I don't continue losing sleep trying to do my school work. And all for me to not even make anything I've liked for in the class yet. Super soul-crushing honestly. And i seem like the only person like this in my class; everyone seems so excited to be the next person that spends 50 hours a week animating clouds in the back of a pixar movie or scheduing meetings for a production team. They love these cookie cutter projects. To me that's not something i could picture myself doing as a long-term career path.

When i asked my teacher advice about freelancing, she said it was once again about networking. she then said something along the lines of ""if you think you can just make whatever you want in ur career as an artist/animator; ur lying to yourself"". Like fuck, dude. The whole reason i'm getting this stupid fucking degree is so i CAN do what i want in my career. I'm tired of jobs and projects that are unfulfilling and just leave me stressed out/depressed.

I've been thinking heavily about dropping out because i've really hated how things have been going. I feel like i would really have luck starting up freelancing on my own, but I've worked so hard to get to where i'm at to throw it away now.

I live in the United States. And I keep seeing this warning about ""family environments"". And those warnings are totally right. Every single ""family environment""  business I've worked at treated me like a revenue source, not a family member. 

Except one. I've been there almost 3 years. They've supported me, carried me through unproductive times, and they've been patient through not only my cancer but through the depression I've had since. 

We're a small company, under 100 people, owned by a wonderful couple. I'm not sure if they're an ally to be honest, in the sense of Marxist knowledge, but they've truly treated me like family. They store to stand with me through this entire journey. My wife is disabled and cannot work - frankly we've desperately needed them. 

The difference, was that they TREATED ME LIKE FAMILY FIRST.  I was never a normal hire, they hired me when i was laid off and kinda desperate. And they've treated me with such dignity and kindness.  But even their normal his are treated more like family and less like employees. They will, and do, put themselves out for their people. 

And we make a very widely used immunization tracking software. Especially now, it feels like I'm doing good work. I'd do the job for free if I had my needs covered it's that important.

So, for the few out there who might get lucky, know that it does happen, there are true ""company families"" but they're small, and driven by kind people working in the right positions. And they will ALWAYS treat you like family BEFORE asking you to sacrifice. 

And for 99 percent of us, never trust a ""family environment"".

It’s sucked, but I was really good at the job, so there were some bright spots. By far the worst part was having to beg for days off. My manager would say, I hired you to work saturdays, so you can’t request them off. Like dude you were hired to work mondays and sometimes you take them, that’s literally what paid time off means.

The final straw was after they fought me on PTO for so many requests, I knew Christmas would be an issue for them, so I followed their rules perfectly. I requested one day off for Christmas, 90 days in advance. Only to find it was rejected. I followed up multiple times, saying I wouldn’t be there, but they refused.

So I quit. My kids will only be young once. We’re going to pinch pennies and eat rice and beans for a while, but there’s nothing I wouldn’t do to spend Christmas with my kids. The funniest part is that they immediately found coverage for Christmas when I quit - something nobody was willing to do before, even when I begged.

My manager is literally the villain in every Christmas movie. And I won. I’m going to have the best Christmas ever. I’ll never be more grateful to have that time with my family.

So my friend and collegue was dragged in front of management and told he was being given a letter of direction for breaching the contract.  He was accused (and admitted) that he had publicly disagreed with his supervisor.  This is pretty much the first commandment with our employer. So the letter of direction was written, which is basically ""you'll do this or we have cause to dismiss you"".  Pretty standard wording.  However, the fine print on our contract and in the form letter is that the employee has to **accept** the letter and its terms.

So he refused to pick it up.  They slid it across the table in front of him and he just refused to touch it.  Every day they tried after work.  Sit down meeting, put the paper down, he refuses to touch it.  Two weeks of this and now there were two letters, the second one for ""not abiding by employer policy"" for not accepting the first. The union rep just laughed :)

After about a month of 'meetings', they ended up in his mailbox in the hopes he'd touch them.  To my knowledge it's been 3 years and they're still there gathering dust.

The pay was decent, about ~$500 a week after taxes. I was also working another job on the weekends at the time, which payed about ~$800 every two weeks. So, a few months of working at this shop, the owner approached me and offered me a full time position, 5 days a week with two days off. She was offering $950 a week salary before taxes. She said this was guaranteed, but could go up during holidays depending on how well business was. I agreed and everything has been great until about a month or so ago.

In short, she got audited because of the BBB and had to switch to everyone making “hourly”. She promised that no one’s pay would change, only the paystub would appear as hourly instead of salary. But for the last month or so, my pay has been anywhere from $100-$200 short. The second week I had mentioned it, and she threatened that should would need to “reevaluate her business” if she couldn’t rely on her employees to be quick. I don’t understand where this is coming from, as I’ve been putting in the same effort as before. I will admit that recently it’s been really hard, since I moved out at the beginning of this month and owe over $700 on my credit card because Of move out expenses I couldn’t afford due to my shortened paychecks.

I wanted to hear your opinions on this, and if you have any suggestions. I did already message her about it again tonight.

And my manager was a very aggressive person and a truly horrible human being. For a particular project, He used to write a Low Level Design (LLD) and give it to us to code it in Scala (a programming language). The LLD was often incomplete and written in terrible English. But his attitude was that he would essentially dump it on us and expect us to not ask too many questions— it quickly became clear that even he didn’t how what the hell is to be done. He was a fairly experienced person, but his technical prowess was limited as he had transitioned to a managerial role. That’s why, I didn’t receive any help or guidance from him (only aggressive pressure building). There was one senior engineer who would help me out sometimes, but that’s about it. After an intense grilling session, I broke down one day. And then in the coming days, there was another aggressive confrontation between us as a was done taking this mans nonsense. I was then removed from the project. 

After some time, a family friend of mine in the same company put in a word to my managers manager (L2 manager) saying that I might require some help. My L2 manager called me and asked me if I am comfortable, and then he probably had a word with my manager, saying things like don’t scold these new joiners. They are young kids, they will learn over time. Then my manager developed a grudge against me (thinking I must’ve complained to my L2) and started a game passive-aggressive manipulation and harassment. He started blaming me for random things, and would even record meetings with me (Work from home) presumably to collect evidence against me. All this nonsense finally culminated into a really intense shouting contest and then finally my L2 manager changed my team. And I still ended up leaving the company a few months later lol.

But so many places here in America either do not have a union, or have one that is so gutted that it might as well not exist.  So I'm of the current opinion that we need an organization or some type of web tool to unite labor across our borders.  I don't have any real ideas to implement for this.

My father worked for a company that produces security card reader devices. Back in the 80s, they started to manufacture a new type of high security card called a “Wiegand card”. Without going into too much detail, the card relies on metal alloy wires that have been carefully twisted to produce unique magnetic properties. These cards are incredibly difficult to duplicate, making them very secure and highly desirable. The guy at the company who machined these wires went by the name “Pops” and he was solely responsible for the wires for years. But Pops had a habit of coming in late, leaving early, taking long lunches, etc but always got his work done and was never a problem. 
      
In comes a new manager who decides that Pops’s habits are inexcusable and a waste of company money. He decides that Pops has to go. As this manager quickly finds out, Pops is, apart from John Wiegand himself (who had passed away), basically the only person in the world who understands the process enough to make the wires. Scrambling to get him back, the manager begs Pops to return to his old job. Pops says “no”.  His wife apparently makes enough money that he doesn’t need the job, so why should he care? The pleading continues for days until finally Pops says yes on the following terms: (1) he makes his own hours, (2) he comes back as a contractor (at a higher pay rate), and (3) this manager never talks to him ever again. Pops comes back and of course the company keeps quietly asking him to bring on an assistant, a request that Pops pushes off for years until he decides he’s ready to retire.

And it’s way too easy to catch these brackets. 

In my case, it’s mental illness I’ve chosen to treat. That’s gone well! But when you start needing 5, 6, 7 bottles at each refill… goddamn those copays. They pile up so fast. So I pay a tax on that, because copays are bullshit and my benefits have always been either non-existent, insufficient, or excellent but to a viscerally soul-shredding job.

The next bracket I caught was the “trans” bracket, which comes with a whole *other* set of costs and frequent confrontations with potentially violent people (coworkers, customers, law enforcement, bureaucrats…. Or sometimes just total strangers) all of whom can directly affect where my next meal comes from… AND the costs of the meds associated with that, ON TOP of the other meds. 

I’ve seriously had to cough up close to $500-$600 some months in either copays or coupons for my meds. That’s on top of the $360 a month I’m paying to even *be* on the insurance!!!! And that’s the discounted rate thru the company!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

What’s more is my trans-ness pushed me out of midland suburbia (cheap) to the dense Pacific Northwest (very expensive). I’m still trying to stably secure $20+/hr to reign in costs but realistically I’m going to need closer to $35 in this city, and/or 100% of my medical costs covered. Because how is anyone supposed to make this work????????????? It’s impossible!!!! There’s simply no math I can come up with to turn less into more!

I feel like nobody around me in any of my past workplaces cares and would rather I stop complaining about that &amp; everything else. But what am I supposed to do???? The banks and my landlord are picking my carcass dry. 

My parents warned of nightmare scenarios in other countries where patients waited 3-5 years for an essential surgery. I’m finally getting an essential surgery after 9^1/2 years—almost double my parents’ nightmare scenario. Would rather not discuss medical specifics but suffice to say it’s been almost decade of discomfort related to not having this simple procedure done. 

What’s worse is that I was on the razors edge of not getting the procedure this time &amp; starting over again because I quit a job. And there’s gonna be more operations down the road. More applications. More transphobic bureaucrats to deny them (and trust me *they will*). And more. Fucking. Copays! It’s maddening. I might have gone on longer than I planned to, but it all feels like a fever dream to me. Where does this end and when do I get to live my life?

This country professes to be a better place than most for trans people. Truthfully, it punishes us financially. Similar to how it punishes diabetics. It’s crazy think this shit is just free in a lot of places. Not here tho, cuz *freedom ain’t free*


**TLDR: I am trans and also trying to stay treated for other medical stuff.

The job market for my desired field wasn't the best at the time, and it's kind of a niche market to begin with, so I was pretty grateful to get a job doing what I wanted to do.  The owner/boss seemed like a decent guy but gave the whole ""We're a family"" spiel when I was hired.  And since it was my first job out of college, I didn't think twice about signing a non-compete agreement during the hiring process because I was just excited to get a job.

In my youth and naivete I definitely overlooked some red flags early on.  Turns out the job duties outlined to me when I was hired were vastly different from what I was consistently asked to do.  Since I was the new guy and wanted to make a good impression, I tried to go above and beyond with the hope that the carrot my boss was dangling in front of me would one day be left just close enough that I could grab it.

Well, 6 years later, I'm married, we bought a house, my wife is expecting...Life is good.  Then one day out of the blue, I get an email from the biggest regional competitor of my company.  They want to offer me a job.  Big promotion, better benefits, shorter commute for me from our new house.  Overall just a great opportunity that I would be crazy not to at least investigate.

So I take a day off and meet with them and it goes great.  Until I tell them about my non-compete agreement.  This of course complicates things but they are willing to let me try and work it out on my own and hold the job opening for me.

I contacted a few lawyers for advice and found an amazing one who specializes in getting workers out of non-compete agreements.  He gave me some great advice and told me to contact him if my boss refused to void the contract.

So I figure I will tell my boss about the job offer and see what happens.  After all, we're family right?  Surely he will understand what a great opportunity this is for me and my growing family.  Wrong.

Instead of being happy for me and supportive he is vindictive and irate.  He accuses me of disloyalty and refuses to even consider the idea of voiding the non-compete agreement.  No counter offer, no negotiation, just anger.  He kicks me out of his office and tells me to go home for the day because he needs to think about what to do with me.  Ok, fine, I call the lawyer on my way home and tell him we need to start the process of suing my boss to release me from my non-compete.

I go back to work the next morning and immediately my boss calls me into his office.  His favorite #2 guy is standing next to him with his arms crossed like some comic-book enforcer.  My boss tells me he will not void the non-compete and that I have 2 choices.  I can either resign or I am fired.  I tell him I am not resigning so he tells me I'm fired and escorts me out of the office.  

I apply for unemployment, he tries to deny it.  It's approved because the state determined I was fired without cause.  My lawyer draws up a lawsuit and a couple weeks later we are in front of a judge.  The judge took only 3 days to rule in my favor and voided the non-compete contract.  

A week later and I was at my new job and I've been there ever since.  They've been amazing throughout the pandemic, very understanding of my family needs, and just a complete 180 from everything I had become accustomed to at my old job.  

If you've made it this far, a few closing notes.  Always, always make them fire you.  If a job asks you to sign a non-compete, think very, very hard about the possible repercussions of that contract.  Don't be afraid to take legal action if necessary.  Yes, lawyers are expensive but there are many out there who offer payment plans and who are very invested in protecting workers' rights.  And finally, if you have a chance to bet on yourself, do it.  If you're not confident in your own ability to overcome adversity, no one else will.",0.0,technicallyatechguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/r7a8eq/boss_always_told_me_we_were_family_until_it_came/,1.0,1.0,3941,373,www.reddit.com,anger,Negative,0.4031331241130829,0.0022753326,anger,Neutral,0.6422072052955627,0.00046419888

I was hired more than 8 months ago in 2021 in a temp-to-hire position. Eventually, I was hired back in the autumn. I caught covid before Christmas and had to stop going to work. Because I was only recently hired I have no sick pay and therefore no money. I was told my time spent working as a temp would roll over into my benefits, but apparently, it hasn’t? So I'm just supposed to do nothing now except lose money. They won’t take me back in until I provide a negative test result which is proper, but they won’t provide me with any help? I can’t go into work, nor can I even find a new job cuz I don’t wanna infect people, but now I won’t have money to buy food, make car payments, cc payments, etc. How am I supposed to live?

I had on a black jacket at work because it’s 40 degrees outside in Las Vegas, NV in the Winter time and we have to deal blackjack at the tables next to the consistently opening doors.

So Jan 1, 2022 I worked a full 8 hours uncomfortably in the freezing cold. Hands frozen, I can barely pick up chips and pass out cards. Cold urticaria (the bumps that show from being cold) exposed to everybody. 

So Jan 2, 2022 I showed up with a jacket on and they said I cannot work with a jacket on because it’s out of uniform from the rest of the girls. 

However, I saw a girl who is pregnant wearing the Long Sleeve, Brown Shirt with Black Slacks in our Party Pit. “Can I wear one of those uniforms?” I asked. The big boss, Victor Mercado answered, “No she only gets a pass cause she’s pregnant.” 

I am cold, uncomfortable, and body is in shock and I can’t get a pass to wear the brown long sleeves and slacks uniform ? So I can still work and be warm. Mercado said “No, you have to go home.

I asked, “Can I work in a different part of the casino away from the doors ?” Wilma Rogers replied, “No because those girls started at a different time than I did and it’s gonna mess up the rotation in the system.” 

So basically the only two options are
1. Go work at the tables by the door and freeze or 
2. Go home 

I like my job and I do not want to lose my job. I love working with the customers. When I worked the last time in the cold, I felt like I wasn’t doing my job to the best of my ability. So if there is any way to provide me with a way to keep warm while I do my job I would have appreciated it.

I've followed and loved this sub for around 6 months. I almost get an actual high reading some of these stories and seeing some of the quitting texts. I've also seen some of the sad stories of people being mistreated with no recourse and felt the anger of that situation. I genuinely wanted to abolish all work.

But after the emotions died, and a cooler head prevailed I've found myself at something of a crossroads. If no one works, where does anything at all come from? Who maintains roads? Power grids? Water systems? Food production? I've seen this argument before and it makes me feel like a dirty Trumper that I'm even giving it any actual thought, which is why I made a throwaway to discuss this.

Today's work climate is horrible and there is no excuse for such low wages and terrible treatment. Really we should just let people do what they want and enforce a universal income for everyone regardless of employment status. Then no one would have to deal with these sleazy corporate assholes. But then I think a little more critically.

There are jobs that no one wants to do that are enormously important. Garbage collector as an easy example. Everyone will just take care of it themselves you say? Have you met the general public? They will not. Infrastructure maintenance is another big one. Maintaining roads, power, water, sewage is a huge undertaking and requires people who know what they are doing.

And what about general labor and manufacturing? Someone has to make literally everything we use. From blankets to to dishes. Thats all work. *I think the real fight should be for fair wages and labor rights.* Recently, since reading on this sub, I've come to believe that for any society anywhere to succeed, work should be a part of your life, and you should be compensated for it, but it shouldn't be your entire life.

What am I getting at, is that this sub seems hellbent on just stopping people from having to work altogether and really believes that's a viable strategy. I think we should refocus on being about the betterment of your life while working. Here are some universal ideas I had that I think could actually work without destroying society.

\-Enforcement of rent control. Why is a small studio more than $1000/month?

\-Enforcement of minimum living standards for landlords. EG: Rental properties must have clean running water, power, heat, and be built to certain standards. Properties to be inspected before being rented.

\-Enforced livable wage.

\-Enforced 2 weeks minimum Paid time off per year for everyone.

\-Flexible work schedule, and substantial extra benefits for those willing to work swing and night shifts. Your work schedule should fit your life. Not the other way around.

\-Four day work weeks.

\-Tax breaks for companies that treat their employees well.

\-Less/No income tax. Why is the government taking so damn much of my money?

That's all I can think of right now. This is just some spit-balling. I'm very aware that some of these ideas are unrealistic or not enforceable. But I firmly believe that simply ending all work is an idea that would never work. Again, *I think the real fight should be for fair wages and labor rights.*",0.0,MyBigFatThrowAway5,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/r99ruu/what_is_the_endgame_goal_of_this_sub/,23.0,1.0,3194,322,www.reddit.com,sadness,Negative,0.5991604328155518,0.30674466,joy,Neutral,0.7964726090431213,0.0013548395
385,s75hdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/s75hdd/corporations_are_shady/,5,Corporations are shady,"I worked for many years as a restaurant manager after I left the Army back in 1997.  I was injured as a result of my military service, something that started fairly minor but has now become a much more serious injury, and I have been considered a service-connected disabled veteran by the VA for years now.  I adapted at work by delegating heavy lifting and other things that my Dr advised me not to do.  Not a big deal, did it for many years in several different companies as my disability progressed.  There was never a problem with me delegating (I was a manager after all) and my employers were aware that I am a disabled veteran though I did not specifically ask for reasonable accommodation.

Fast forward to 2020, COVID hits and all of the employees were sent home while the managers had to run the takeout-only operation during those first few months.  The physical aspect of it was more than I could handle - it's more than just packing to-go bags - and I was further injuring myself by continuing to work, so I took FMLA hoping that things would settle down and employees would eventually come back, at which point I would be able to continue as I had for years, no problem.  I even mentioned to HR in a correspondence with them that delegation would be the only accommodation I would seek for my disability when I returned to work.  At no time did anyone from the company engage in a discussion with me about reasonable accommodation (the ""interactive process"" under the ADA.)  

At the end of my FMLA period, I was terminated for not being able to perform the job requirements.  No discussion, no options, nothing, completely going against the ADA.

I say all this to say that many, many companies and individuals talk a good game about supporting the military and those who served and especially those who were disabled in the line of duty, but when the time comes to really support a disabled veteran, they pull a bunch of shady shit and try to sweep us under the rug.

I actually hope they can't afford me so I can resign.,"My company is planning to increase prices at the beginning of 2022 and I am long overdue for not just a raise but a cost of living increase. I make lousy money ($17 hour) for basically an art director position. I actually like my job and my company, but I think its about time they pay me what my experience is worth. I've been short changed for WAY too long, and as soon as I heard that prices were going up I decided to demand my cut.

For a bit of context, I have been working at my job for 4 years. I have worked here longer than anyone, and have seen literally every position in my small company turn over twice or more. I know where everything is kept in the office, I manage the server, and help train new employees (which is to say EVERYONE) on how our workflow operates. I feel like I am pretty good at solving problems as they come up, and I have excellent working relationships with a lot of our clients.

So despite liking my job, I am ready to move on.  I just can't keep this crazy train on the rails any more for the low, low wage. I genuinely hope they can't afford my raise (ideally $25 an hour) and I can resign. I really want to focus on finding a job in a different city that I can put down roots in.

Our souls were created for play, not work.  Here's an example of where we are currently at.

So we have a virtual widget, let's call it a shape.  The company in charge of the shape employs many people.  Each one has a task.  Refine the shape, plan the shape, analyze the shape, program and maintain the shape, create new shapes, have countless meetings about such shape, compete with competitors and their shapes, AND OF COURSE, MARKET THE SHAPE TO CONSUMERS.  The question must be asked, do we really need the shape, do we honestly need more shapes, can we live without it?  If we can, how can we say that each person employed is doing any semblance of meaningful work?  It is all abstraction, we are creating work for the sake of work, instead of simplification.  Employees are not growing food, they are hacking a shape to consumers, telling them that they need the shape when they can easily do without.  The shape may even be harmful in the long run, but of course, the company doesn't care; profit above all.  Thus we are more and more having a great disconnect between work and reality.  We are creating more work when we should be creating less.  Work for the sake of work.

I asssistant managed front and back of the house at a small resturaunt for about a year. The owner was an alcoholic whose well-to-do spouse gave her the funds to keep the place open.  It was her pet project and the employees were her pets. She referred to us as her children. I was 28. She was in her 40s. She didn't know how to run a resturaunt, paid $7.25 hr. and yelled at us a lot, especially when she'd been in the wine supply.

She would use the place to throw after hours wine parties for her friends and use us to serve them. I think that's what she really wanted the place for.  It never turned a profit anyway. 

Some of the regular customers she did have were belligerent to staff and there was one that pooed all over the bathroom just before casually going back to her table to eat her lunch. 

Eventually, I needed some time off for for personal reasons and that bothered the owner. She put me on some sort of probation for being ""unreliable"" just before she went on a 3 week European vacation. She was unreachable for further discussion.  So, I put my two weeks notice into her inbox the first day she was gone, worked for two weeks, and then stopped showing up. One week later she called and asked wtf. Gosh she was so dissapointed in me. I thought it was, and still think it is, pretty funny.

I worked overtime during October for basically the whole month due to quarterly payroll tax payments and filing. The following month he gave me a backhanded compliment. He appreciated me for working hard despite costing him (aka OT rate). He then says he's putting me on salary at 42k per year. 

Now I leave at exactly 8 hrs of work and I'm noticing he's trying to make me feel guilty. Plus he loves to tell me about how he use to work for little money. I feel like he thinks I'm going to work more despite the salary ot exemption.


What would you do? I don't want to quit because just got medical and simple ira plus I'm going to Africa next year for vacation. Should I keep completing my work and leaving after 8 hrs, quit, or tell him what's on my mind?

He was shocked and asked if I have other offers on hand, which I told him I'm perfectly happy with my current job, however, I am open for interviews and if the new job is good I would join, I don't think he'll be reaching out again.

Isn’t there something else you’d like doing?” My answer….,"No, because I’m great at this job, enjoy meeting new people and also enjoy making my own schedule (I was in retail sales and management since I was 14 and started working and while good at it, hated the condition) I can take time off whenever I want, be able to save a significant amount of my income and not having to work myself to the bone 5-6 days a week for way less money than I’m making here working three 8 hour shifts a week. 

What I don’t tell them i me that yes, the money we make is variable of course, you do still end up making a good average every month/week regardless of good or bad days. I also have another business as a professional makeup artist as well and can take booking whenever they pop up, short notice or not. It gives me freedom. 

After which they usually respond “you can’t do this forever” and I always laugh because of course I know that and I have made long term investments and have other little things that make a few hundred in residual income for me a month currently and plans to be able to buy a house and live comfortably when I decide to finally stop dancing. 

The thought process that all girls who dance either don’t really want to do it or don’t plan well with the money they make is absurd (some girls are like that when they first start but most girls are very smart with their money) and to top it off if we don’t like a club or management we can just leave and find somewhere else to work pretty much anywhere. 

I just wanted to share how weird my job is basically every day, at least half of the guys who walk on there ask me this as well as a bevy of other questions about my personal information every shift. Honestly it’s the most annoying part of the job. 

People may look down on the sex industry but it’s a damn good one if your good at it, take care of yourself/your body and are smart with your money.

I am currently on my first year of teacher training through a programme called Teach First. From September to March, my anxiety and depression levels have been the highest they have ever been from a job (I was previously a project manager). 

Since the lockdown was enacted here in the UK and schools closed, my mental health has improved tremendously. I am still required to set work online for my class, however I have time to cook, clean, relax and effectively spend wonderful quality time with my son and wife. I had always hated work in general, and would get really bored with a job after about 8 months and quit. I also like different things and to learn new things, so I've worked in so many different industries (retail, sales, fitness, translation, project management, now teaching).

I have always thought that the grass was greener on the other side, i.e. that there was a job or industry out there that I could enjoy and excel at. That is why I got into teaching, in order to make a difference and to have direct impact on positive change in childrens' lives. 

Now that the UK govt have announced that we will be returning indefinitely from 1 June, my anxiety is skyrocketing. It is almost like a bodily response - work is a virus and my body is trying to produce antibodies to get over this condition of disease (work). I now know that I want to be a stay at home father and not work at some job. This sub and various anarchist texts have really helped open my eyes to the slavery and indoctrination that we are subject to with regards to work culture. It is toxic and I want to escape in any way that I can.

Sorry for the rant, just needed to vent a bit and say thanks to you all for helping me through this.

My job has become infinitely worse since the pandemic. I’m in the hotel industry and while we were hit hard, we have remained open since March with business slow but steady. Since the pandemic, the quality of our guests has gone to complete shit. In the past month alone, we’ve had someone overdose in one of our rooms, several homeless people who have skipped out on paying, prostitutes, drug addicts, and drunk perverts harassing our mostly female staff. To add insult to injury, we’ve been expected to take on the extra work of the furloughed staff responsibilities without any extra pay. I was asked to come into work an hour early twice this week because my coworker got sick, something my manager apparently didn’t think of when he decided to knock us down to the skeleton crew to save a few bucks in March. If anyone wants to take a extra day off, it means all of us have to shift our schedule or work an extra day with barely any notice. Let’s not mention the amount of verbal abuse I get from guests everyday; being called a communist for wearing a mask and having grown adults throwing temper tantrums because *GASP* they have to ASK for housekeeping or it won’t be done!!!!????The fucking entitlement  and stupidity of people is absolutely disgusting that I have lost some of my faith in humanity. My coworker had a guest throw a balled piece of paper at her the other day and what did my manager do? Absolutely nothing. When we go to him with our concerns he laughs it off and gaslights us into thinking it’s no big deal or that we should just be expected to take it.

Today, after yet another horrible interaction with an ungrateful, shitty guest, who decided to berate me because she didn’t get her SUPER important extra towels, I finally decided that I was fucking done. I went into the bathroom and broke down. I called my boyfriend and told him I can’t take it anymore. He told me to just walk out right then and there but I didn’t. The ONLY reason I didn’t is because of my coworkers.
I shared my concerns with them and turns out every single of of them feels exactly the same way I do. They are burned out , fed up, and tired of being gaslit by our GM. We’ve decided to confront him on Monday telling him what our demands and needs are. Honestly I really don’t know if there’s anything he could say to make me stay. I could accept a raise, but is it even fucking worth it to sacrifice my sanity and health for a bunch of people that couldn’t give enough of a fuck about me to wear a mask for two minutes while I check them in or a manager who can’t be bothered to defend his staff? I don’t think so.

The only job I can think of that isn’t going to complete crush my soul is something, literally anything working from home so I can spend time with my dog and be a. I’m so fucking tired of slaving my life away to make someone else richer while I sit her and degrade myself going to a job that I despise everyday.

I also believe that the 40-hour work week is just a legancy from the Industrial Revolution.)

I have found that there are some companies which ditched the 40-hour work week and work shorter hours but I was wondering if maybe there were more that I haven't heard about.

TL;DR: I'm a poor American and I have no choice but to play ball in our current capitalistic hellscape, but I hate this game so much that I want to die.

\--

Yesterday, my employer told me that they want me to take over the position of someone in my department who's retiring.  Last night I found myself on a highway overpass, thinking about the drop to the asphalt below and the best way to get over or around the fence.

I can't do this anymore.

Every job I've ever had, I flamed out of spectacularly.  I leave in tears; I leave having nervous breakdowns; I leave a suicidal mess.  For a long time, I thought it was just me.  That I was too depressed or anxious to handle working like a proper adult, that if I just got the right combo of meds for my mental health issues, I would be able to do it.  My dad's told me I'm the ""sensitive one"" (with my more reliably employed sister being the ""strong one"", of course) and scolded me for not being able to handle it when things get ""a little hard"" at work.  Everyone has to deal with stress on the job, he says.  Why can't I just tough it out like everyone else does?

*Why can't I?*  I've spent years furious with myself that I can't find a meaningful balance of work and life.  Even as I grow in my understanding of how rigged the system is against people like me (a poor mentally ill queer fat woman), I still hold myself accountable to the expectations of that system.  I still, *still* fucking feel like there's something I'm missing, that I'm doing wrong, that it's my fault I can't find a way to have a job, to keep my home, and still have time and energy to do the things l enjoy.

Currently, I work reception at a busy vet's office.  Earlier this year I buckled under the pressure of short-staffing and took 3 months of leave (unpaid, because I hadn't been there a year yet).  I saw doctors and started therapy during that time, trying to find a solution for my chronic overwhelming fatigue.  I've made changes, I'm seeing progress.  I'm doing better managing my anxiety.  I'm getting a handle on my health.

My employer has been great through this whole thing.  They let me stay on the books so I could keep my insurance as long as I paid them my portion of the premiums.  They made a part-time work from home position for me so I could ease back into working a month and a half ago.  They're the first place I've ever worked where I felt like they value me *and* what I can do for them.

And it's not enough.

All these improvements-- all my increased energy and better mental health choices and reduced, easier work-- and I still can't do it.  Household shit still doesn't get done; I can't maintain my healthier diet while working, even PT from home; I'm still finding myself having to choose between basic non-work responsibilities like laundry and housekeeping and the things I enjoy, like writing and sculpting and my animals.  I'm realizing, as I get angrier and more fed up with capitalism and America's current society as a whole, that even if I were the best, healthiest me I could ever be, *I still won't be able to make this work*.  Not at the level I'm employable at.  Not as a poor person living the American dystopia.

I'm tired of of this.  I'm tired of cutting away at myself, my interests, my desires to accommodate work.  I'm tired of being told to give up more of my pets or to dump my disabled SO to make more room in my life for the mental and energy demands of a job.  I'm tired of people telling me that if I just had the *right* job this wouldn't be a problem.  I'm tired of being advised to go back to school so I can 'make something of myself' when I can barely even handle the minimum responsibilities in my life as it is.  I'm tired of the goddamn struggle.

It's not even that I don't want to work.  I goddamn do.  That's part of why I broke down so hard yesterday, when my boss told me that they want me to take over the call center and they'll need me back in the building, full time, before the end of the year to do so.  These people have been good to me and I don't want to leave them in the lurch!  But right now I can't even handle the gentle, part-time position I'm working in balance with the rest of my life.  Running the entire call center, a job that really requires at least 2 people, solo for who knows how long?  I can't do it.

I am exhausted, folks.  I have been trying as hard as I can for my entire life to be 'enough', only to realize in the last year that 'enough' is a goddamn lie.  The only thing that matters is money, which I don't have, yet I am forced to operate in a system designed to keep it so that I never will.

Everything feels so futile right now.  I've fought so hard to make it even this far, convinced that if I just gave enough I would be able to make it financially, and that once I made it financially I would be able to focus on the things that really matter to me.  All I want to do is feel secure enough to be able to write and sculpt, and take care of my partner and our pets.

I guess I've reached a point where I no longer have the strength to give up myself to capitalism, I no longer have faith that the effort will reap any worthwhile reward, and yet I have no feasible way to opt out of this system.

I don't know what to do, Reddit.  I don't know how to go on playing in a game that's this rigged, that I will always lose.  I don't want to give up on the idealized self I can see at the top of the pyramid of needs from where I'm scrabbling around down here in the first and second tiers, but I don't see that I have a choice.  It's work or self, and I can only choose work.  But spending my entire life working to just barely scrape by doesn't remotely seem worth it.

I was able to walk off that overpass last night, but I honestly don't know how I did it, and this morning I'm wondering why I bothered.

Folks, how do you keep going when it's hopeless?  From where do you find the ability to tolerate the intolerable reality of the current American sociocultural landscape?  What point is there in trying, knowing that I'm in for a miserable lifetime of pain and futility?

Locally we got almost 30cm, some places got up to 60. I was trapped in my condo complex, and I called my bosses to let them know. Most of the coworkers were also stuck. The bosses and owners were pretty resigned to the fact no one could get in, and we're not able to log into a VPN or something from personal computers to work. It was a snow day.

I felt weird at first, like it wasn't quite right. Like I was doing something wrong. I didn't get ploughed out until after noon, but I didn't hear from anyone at work so I stayed home. I watched bad alien horror movies and the two Hotel Transylvania movies I hadn't seen. I cross stitched on my year long Dino Alphabet. I texted family. I worked on something spiritual for the first time in weeks. 

While I had Capitalism Guilt(which is what I call that uneasy feeling when you ""should"" be doing something), and the Sunday Scaries on Monday, overall I felt so rejuvenated. I felt happy. I made three meals for myself, I drank a lot of water. I felt functional as an adult person. I felt like a person.

I'm back to the office today, back to the racism and homophobia, back to babysitting an inbox for a good chunk of my day. At least today I have some actual tasks to complete like payroll.

It showed me just how even one extra day off would be such a huge benefit to a lot of people. I'm going to gently pry my coworkers today and see how they all felt but I suspect a lot of them felt the same way I did.

I realized that what I did yesterday, light tidying, cooking, working on personal projects... That's what humans are meant to do in these colder months. Even though I was stuck at home I didn't feel as isolated as I usually do.

461,rxqv7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rxqv7j/offered_a_salary_way_below_my_range/,5,Offered a Salary Way Below My Range,"Okay so this shit happened to me today and I knew I had to post it on here.

A few weeks ago, I applied to an Executive/HR Assistant job. On the application, I listed my minimum salary as $48,000, which is about $23/hour. A week later, someone at that company emailed me saying they would like to speak with me over the phone about the position. A few days later, we spoke, and she told me that they're changing the position title from Executive/HR Assistant to Office Support Specialist, because they're still trying to figure out how to divide the different types of work among staff (something along those lines). While that was disappointing to hear, I told her I was still interested in the position, even though it was a red flag.

During this phone call, she asked me to confirm my salary range, and I told her my minimum was 48k. In my mind, I was thinking that if they were willing to still pay me a minimum of 48k, I could deal with the position title switch.

She eventually lets me know that they'd like to have me come in for an in-person interview with a few people. I went, and I thought it went well, although there was no talk of salary or benefits.

The day after the interview, she called me and asked me for my salary range again, so I told her. She asked if I was willing to be flexible about it, and I said I could be a LITTLE flexible depending on the total benefits package. She said okay, and that she'd get back to me.

Earlier today, she called and told me that they'd like to move forward with hiring me. They decided this position would mostly deal with payroll and invoice reporting. She told me about their benefits package before she told me the salary, and let me tell you, their benefits are GARBAGE to what I'm getting now. This is what they were:

* Medical (50% employer contribution)
* Dental (15% employer contribution)
* Vision would be on me
* 15 PTO days (sick &amp; personal time combined, what a joke)
* short term disability, DEPENDING on your position and tenure
* 11 holidays (pretty standard)

While listening to all this, I'm thinking, ""I hope they'll at least offer me a good salary."" At the end of all that, she says they can start me off at $17.50/hour, and after 30-90 days, they would consider bumping up my pay. COME AGAIN?!?! I was so shocked I literally stuttered. I told her that's less than what I make now, and she said okay, what about $18/hour? 

How the FUCK do you go from my minimum of $23 to $18?? I said I was willing to be a little flexible, not completely fucking downgrade. I told her I would need at least $22 to consider, and she said she would get back to me, even though I knew damn well they wouldn't hire me at that point. But on the slight chance that they would offer me $22/hour, I double-checked my benefits at my current job, and this is what they are:

* Medical (93% employer contribution)
* Dental (93% employer contribution)
* 37 PTO days (sick &amp; personal combined)
* Short and long term disability
* 12 holidays

After reviewing all that, I emailed her (respectfully of course) and explained how my current job pays for most of my insurance, and that they give me more PTO. Because of that, I'd actually need at least $25/hour to consider the job. I would literally lose money otherwise. Needless to say, she responded a few hours later saying they can't move forward with me.

I'm in disbelief that they wasted my time with multiple phone calls, emails, and an in-person interview just to lowball me like that. I told them multiple times what my minimum salary was. Why did they think I would downgrade that much??

 I was successful as a registered nurse functional assessor and went through intense training for 5 weeks with a virtual teams mentor , and had to pass all kinds of assessments and tests or would face an immediate 'exit point' which was not advertised. By the end of the intense 3 months of training and intense observation , half the 'new entrants' have been fired. Bare in mind these were skilled health professionals that consisted of experienced Doctors  nurses and physiotherapists who had left highly skilled jobs. 
If you pass, you're still in probation for 6 months which can only be extended once and then is an exit point. You're then micro managed by a young call centre drone type manager who has a script such as 'managers discretion' who keeps piling the work load on until you're working until 7pm every night for free. 
Your reports are 100% audited and completely subjective and for the first 6 months you end up doing amendments for 95% of you reports, nearly doubling your work load. 
If you don't keep out you are performance managed and have stats thrown at you, then pushed out of the company. 
If you do overtime you are paid per report you complete however  you go into the office and you may have only been scheduled 5 cases, of which 50% do not answer . If you do not achieve an A grade for all of your reports you are paid at 50% of the agreed rate...weekend cases are extra scrutinised for this reason and hardly anyone gets all A grades...robbery 
If you are off sick, you have to phone your non clinical manager every day to give them an update AND speak to an OH nurse every 3 days , my manager wanted to know when I'd been to the doctors , what they said and what my tests and results had been (it was gynea related) and I said the OH department are aware so I don't need to tell you anything about my medical problems, only if im fit for work, so he performance managed me and when I had my back to work interview and disclosed some anxiety , he extended my probation by 3 months to give me 'support'. 
During my back to work interview I was in businesswear and my manage was wearing trainers and tracksuit bottoms with Dr dre beats round his head , I said thank you for showing me the same respect I have shown you for a formal meeting 🤝 🤣.
The next day I got to work and opened my emails and saw an invitation to my investigation meeting that day at 4pm - reason for investigation : evidence employee lying about reason for absence. 
I asked what the reason was and the manager said ""you originally called in sick with potential pregnancy symptoms and then became vague about your health, and one of your colleagues has whistle-blown and said you told them you had lied about being pregnant in order to get away with your absence"". 
 As a normally cool calm and professional person, I actually hit the roof and told him what an idiot he was and that never in my life have I been 'managed' in such a ridiculous and borderline illegal way before ...and instantly resigned .

They came out of the shower s*uper* excited about this idea they just had and said to me, ""I'm the devil. Y'know that video you showed about \*insert their astrological sign\* being the devil? I believe it."" And went on about how they're going to get their boss to fake reprimand them in front of a staff member that works for them. 

They want to do this so that staff member then kind of... has comradery? With my friend against their boss as a sort of ""Look at us against the man!"" (They're watching me type this up and are currently saying it's not about them together against the man, but rather they need the staff member to do things when they ask them to and without them having a comradery the staff member won't do it.  (I do not agree with this *still* and tried to explain to them that it's literally still the same thing but they did not want to hear it. I have told them to find another alternative, I don't think they're going to listen to me)). I have offered other solutions over time to my friend about how to manage this particular person, and while this staffer doesn't always do the job they're supposed (in terms of skipping entire tasks that fall back on the company), I always call out my friend on how they treat them differently than other staffers and how that could affect their work/willingness to listen or do tasks assigned to them. 

I said all of this to say, your managers are not your friends, and this is the shit they think about while in the shower at 9 in the morning.

473,qiulu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qiulu8/crazy_job_story/,5,Crazy job story,"I see ppl posting crazy work stories where employers were ridiculous and I felt like sharing mine. This was before Covid (thank God) so I no longer work there but it is still my biggest F U company to date.

Short version: Worked for a grocery store for 3 years as a model employee. Told them I was going to be temporarily disabled 3 months in advance and would need accommodations. They did not abide (or rather said my accommodations were simply my already overworked manager helping). Instead they gave me more work for no extra pay and with no reasonable help. When I told 1 customer I couldn't accommodate their last minute request, I got written up.

I worked for this particular grocery store for approx 3 years. I made $13/hr as the head/only cake decorator. Now this store was one of the highest grossing cake stores within the company so needless to say, I was busy. We had several orders daily on top of a large display case I had to keep up with. Due to the large quantity and being the only decorator, my manager gave me permission to use the display case as just display so I could focus on orders and the grab n go section. 

One day due to medical issues, I needed to get foot surgery done and so I told my boss, giving her a 3 months notice so she could talk to corporate about finding a temporary replacement while I was healing. Dr said I needed to be out for at least 2-3 weeks and then when I came back I had to be cut to part time for the first few weeks as well. Even though I had been with the company for 3 years, I was only alloted 1 week of PTO (and this was combined vacation and sick time). At the time I was living paycheck to paycheck so I told the Dr I couldnt abide by his orders fully. Id take my 1 week off then work PT for a couple weeks but I needed my full paycheck. 

Immediately after I came back, corporate came in and did a redesign which caused my workload to literally triple. I reminded them about my temporary disability ontop of being part time for a bit. I told them it was going to be hard enough just keeping up with orders let alone all this extra stuff. Corporate basically said ""Too bad, we're doing this so figure it out."" When I asked if I could have extra help, they suggested my manager. My poor manager was already working 80+ hours a week without helping me. She wouldnt have time. So they said, ""Your foot problem is only temporary, she will be fine."" I then asked if we would at least be getting a raise for all this extra work and was told no. As frustrated as I was, I loved cake decorating and I have a fear of being unemployed so I dealt with it.

Cut to about a week and a half later (so still in my boot/scooter and part time). I had about 5 mins left on my shift but since I was in the middle of an order, I knew I'd be late. I get a phone call from a gentleman asking for a custom cake to be made and delievered within the next 3 hours. Now granted his custom order was not complicated, I knew I was already going to be late. Honestly, I didn't want to stay even later for someone who ordered at the last minute so I simply explained that we needed at least a 24 hr notice on custom orders and deliveries (which is the truth according to every bakery person I've worked with. We just sometimes break that rule if we have the time/ability to.) 

However, I hate just straight up saying no so to help accomodate, I said I would be happy to write a quick message on a cake from our grab n go section and see if the delivery guys would be available for his request. He of course became irate and after telling me off, hung up and apparently called corporate. About 15 mins later (so already past my shift so my husband is waiting for me in the parking lot but I'm finishing up my last order) my manager received a phone call from corporate demanding I get written up for ""refusing someone service, making up a policy that doesn't exist, and causing the company embarassment.""

At this point I'd had it. Id been a model employee with them for 3 yrs, I went against Dr's orders as I practically had 0 PTO (even though I rarely called in sick or took more than the rare Friday off so I could have a 3 day weekend to travel to go see my out of state family), I came in early/stayed late leading up to my surgery as I was told 1 week prior that no one was stepping in to take my place, came back to to find myself being forced to make extra product with no help and no raise and now I get written up. 

So I straight up told my manager, ""Im not mad at you. You are simply doing what your boss told you to do. However, just know that if I'm being forced to sign this, I'm not coming back. I am so sorry that that means you get screwed over but this is BS and you know it."" My manager understood but didn't want to loose me so she got with our store manager and fought corporate about writing me up. Corporate kept being a**holes afterwards so I quit a bit later anyways.

This morning, my housemate (unbeknownst to me) had massively overslept until almost 10:30 this morning when he was supposed to start at 9. I also found it hard to wake up this morning.. struggling to exit the Christmas/New Year laziness I suppose.

Anyway, I was working at home when the doorbell went, and I buzzed in whoever it was assuming it was a parcel or something (intercom doesn't work, thanks block management agency). I turned around to plug something in on my desk and all of a sudden my housemate (who I didn't know was in) was at the door in his dressing gown having obviously just woken up talking to some woman who I soon after found out was his boss/line manager. She must have run up those 4 flights of stairs pretty sharpish!

Apparently she has done this to other colleagues of his if they're unreachable on a work day, and apparently it is fine to do this under the guise of 'concern for the wellbeing of the employee'. Now my initial thought was that this was BS, because lets be honest if my housemate had gone into hospital that morning and had eventually let them know via me or the hospital, I doubt his manager would be running to his bedside at the hospital now, would she. We live in a small city quite near the centre so my housemates office is just 1 mile away, making it easy for his boss to wander over here unfortunately...

488,sg1iiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sg1iiz/update_going_to_name_and_shame_my_now_former/,5,Update! Going to name and shame my now former employer who instructed us to lie to have protestors arrested.,"If many of you recall I posted a few weeks ago about my employer who instructed us General Managers to lie to have potential protestors arrested. 

I deleted the other post out of fear of losing my job. As of yesterday, I quit. So now I will recap the story and tell you who it was so you can protest away!

The Thursday before MLK Jr. Day we got a text message in our General Manager group chat (approximately 20 people in it including 3 Area Managers and our Senior Area Director) from our Senior Area Director that we were having an emergency Zoom meeting that evening. Once the call began, we were told of some potential protesters that was threatening to come out on Monday (MLK Jr. Day) and we had to rearrange our schedules so we all had to work that Monday it was mandatory we worked that day because we were the ones who only allowed to handle any protesters we may get. We were told that if they showed up, we were to call the police and made sure we told them that we felt threatened and to make sure we got a copy of the police report and make sure the cops have that included. We were also told that we had directly call our bosses and specifically told to not fill out and send in any incident reports to insurance and HR like we normally do if there are any issues on company property. Now she didn’t explicitly say to lie, but she said very specifically to say that we felt threatened for our safety which I’m pretty sure would result in the protestors being arrested. We were also told that we were not to discuss this matter in text and in email and that if we had any question or concerns to call only. Again, fishy as FUCK! After posting on here because I thought it was a shitty thing for them to try to do, lie to have protestors arrested, and seeing everyone’s response, it gave me some courage to speak up on it. I contacted my direct Area Director (she is under the one who instructed us to do this) and told her I felt this was illegal and that I would not lie for any one in which she agreed and said for me to use my judgement and if I felt the need to call police, then I should if not then don’t unless they parked their cars in the drive thru and interrupted business which then we would need to have them removed for that. She said some of these protestors at other stores were very hostile. Needless to say the day it was suppose to happen, we got 3 inches of snow so no one showed up. So I made a text in the group when people were talking about the snow that I guess none of use was going to have visitors when I got a call and was told not to post anything about that in the group chat. Many people were wanting to know who my employer was. I didn’t want to say as I didn’t want to lose my job but since they decided to drop a bonus incentive program that will effectively cut my yearly income by $10,000 (roughly 20% of my yearly income) so I quit. 

Bojangles in the Knoxville, TN market. I won’t say managers names or franchise name as I don’t know what legal ramifications they can do to me because I don’t have proof of this being told to us except the other people on the call but I’m not sure if any of them would speak up. But know this. Protestors they are scared of you.

Today I had a repeat delivery order. Recognized the name, bagged it up and went to drop it off along with one other delivery after that. Arrived there in probably 10 mins or less.

Now, I’ve dropped off to this house about three times before, so I generally know where to go to drop it off, but all the apartments were close by and look the same in the dark so I had to call the guy over the phone and tell him “I think I’m outside your apartment” and 
he slammed open his door, walked to my car and started calling me stupid, incompetent, how I dont deserve a tip, how he’s gonna call my manager and get me fired because I suck at my job, literally just going in on me. Telling me how I should know where to go because I’ve been here before, how my memory sucks (even though i pulled up to the right place anyways)Also told me I should find a different job. Completely unprovoked. 

I was so caught off guard I had no clue what to say, because in my mind all I was thinking was “he’s this mad over a phone call?” I ended up just giving him his food and driving off. 

I got back to the store like 20 mins later, and my manager asks me what happened on the delivery. I told him straight up, and my manager told me he was being a dick over the phone too. I didnt get in trouble, but it just blew my mind, how angry someone could get for no reason.

It's a small business and it's a yoga studio; when covid hit we went 100% online and she cut our pay per class which made sense at the time because we were teaching from home. When the studio opened back up she asked can we stay at the lower pay till she gets back on her feet. I was okay with that for a while but then I learned she spent her PPP loan on her monthly APARTENT rent. Not the business whatsoever... the studio is probably going to wind up closing because of this. I told her I can't teach for this price anymore because when you figure in gas and time I'm actually not really making anything. She told me she can't pay me more and tried to give some sob story because nothing is ever her fault of course(even though she's never present when we need her or working on improving the business).

I was on unemployment for the rest of the year and hoping to get rehired at the bookstore once things got back to normal but it never happened. I've work with my father in his towing business in order to currently pay the bills and job searched and applied everywhere but I never hear anything back and when I do they always offer between $7-9 bucks which is isn't even possible to live off of. I currently am in the process of being hired to be a school crossing guard for $15 a hour but with only 3-4 hours a day. My sweet girlfriend has offered to put in a good word for me at her office and try to get me her job because shes moving on but it doesn't feel right for me to have her do that but a part of me feels like that would be better in the long run because then I'll have experience working at a office and will be full time with decent pay I can live off of.

Also would like to add that I am Sales / Operations and I have one client that pays my salary 1.5X over. In addition I manage a few million in company accounts. To top that off I double as IT as I am computer literate and an exception googler. I have saved them thousands in IT costs. Not to toot my own horn but I am a literal Unicorn of the industry. 

So we work with a VERY HIGH client that has dropped a project that would require us us to quickly hire 5-6 additional employees to handle. 

Unfortunately I have young child with sensory issues and he recently had to be removed from his daycare. With Covid staffing issues finding a new one has become tedious. 1 in 60 locations said they didn't even had availability. I have been leaving every day 1300 to Dad can watch him on the mornings and i have the afternoons. (were slow at work so no big deal)

Why don't the workers of this country unite under a ""united workers banner""?  Like the kingdoms or tribes of years past.  Fighting together in common cause against an enemy.  The working lower and working middle class make up this land with a majority of the population falling into those categories.  This country's government was founded upon the principle of ""by the people, for the people"". Why can't we all agree on forcing the hands of politicians? Do we as Americans really need such a large gap between us based on gender, ethnicity, beliefs, or religion???  We are all Americans. We are all human for that matter. Who the hell cares how we live individually? One common denominator for most of us is we all work. So why can't we be treated better? Why do we have to suffer at the hands of major corporations? Why do companies like McDonald's, Walmart, Home Depot, etc. force most of their workers to NEED to collect food stamps?  Why do companies like Pfizer and Moderna and J&amp;J profit billions from government monies while people suffer financially during a pandemic?  Why do people in the federal government own million dollar plus homes and collect 6 figure paychecks when most of what they do is squabble and argue?  Ask them to take a pay cut for the greater American good and see where it gets you.  Years and years ago things were so much simpler.  Like in WWII- the world had a common enemy. Well nowadays we all as Americans also have a common enemy. Ourselves.  I'm wondering why we can't unite. Why can't we ALL band together and run this country through it's government. I'm NOT suggesting ANY violence or attempted takeover like back in January.  What I'm suggesting is holding politicians at the federal, state, and local level accountable for their campaign promises and their actions. I don't care if they're blue or red, left or right, or totally neutral.  They NEED to come to accept responsibility for the offices they hold and the people they represent so the big tech or big retail or big pharma companies that we all work for fall in line with no other alternative but to respect each and every one of us whom work for them and share the profits made!",0.0,oldsmobile39,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rbk2d6/proposal_for_changes_in_the_usa_workforce/,6.0,1.0,2261,243,www.reddit.com,joy,Negative,0.5937727689743042,0.013511514,anger,Neutral,0.7771685123443604,0.00038817048

When I was 21, I was a healthy, somewhat well off young woman, having a baby. I had private health insurance that cost me almost as much as my room rental. I wasn't a 'single mom' but my son's dad and I called it quits and decided to coparent while the kiddo was still in womb. I gave birth, and my $800 insurance refused to cover it, or allow me to add my child. I was now $12,000 in debt. At three weeks old my son's dad was over for a visit and fell while walking with him to the changing table, he did a great job, he held that baby's head so tight and so close to him, but our son broke his arm, at three weeks old, so I called an ambulance, he was just a baby and I wanted help, now, medical expenses were no where near the list of shit I needed to worry about. After eight weeks, he was all healed up and no one but those close to us would ever be any the wiser that he'd broken his first bone so young. It was traumatic, and I was the only one not too afraid to touch broken arm baby, so I had eight weeks of literally no help, and then the bills start rolling in, I'm now over $30,000 I'm debt. An addition to an already awful experience that I was just not prepared to deal with. I paid everything I could out of pocket, but after only two and a half months of having a child, I was no longer ""well off"", and I never would be again. I moved out of my shared housing and back in with my parents ""to save money"" but really I couldn't afford to be anywhere else. Fast forward two years, I still lived with my mom and dad and kiddo, and the kiddo starts getting a rash, he starts walking like an old man, he's still uninsured because the state wouldn't approve him no matter how many hoops I jumped through because I lived with my parents and our household income was too high, but I couldn't afford $700 a month for him to be insured, if I also wanted him to eat and go to daycare sooooo, priorities, I had to go to work to be able to do anything for him and he had to eat, I couldn't make it work. We stayed in the hospital for over a week with him while they tried to figure out what was wrong. He finally gets his diagnosis and we get a grocery list of medication to go get for him. I arrive to Walgreens and the pharmacist says our total is going to be $567, I was dumb struck, I had $89 to my name, I broke down immediately, and this woman, looked at the mother of a dying boy and said, 'thats why you should have health insurance"". This was it, this was the moment that radicalized me to my fullest. My baby was on his death bed without these drugs and I was being shamed for my lack of financial stability. They were going to let my kid die, and look down on me for it? What the fuck. So I start making calls, I had a beater of a car that wasn't in bad enough shape for the scrap yard but I was gonna' take it so I could be $250 closer to where I needed to be. I was losing my mind. I was in shock, and I was more scared than I've ever been and the pharmacist is just watching me, with angry eyes. I'd finally put together a plan, I'm getting ready to call the doctor and find out what medicine is absolutely necessary and what can wait until my next pay day. Then another pharmacist steps out from behind the counter and he comes to me and says, ""ma'am, I'd like to start by giving you a hug if that's alright"" and this stranger just let me sob on his shoulder, he let me cry, and he told me, ""I'm not letting you out of this store without those meds, no matter what"". He spent the next forty minutes finding generic brands, seeing what was a larger dose than necessary and explaining to me that we can do half's for now and then when I get paid do the other half. He found a way to get my kid's drugs to me for $62, and in a moment where my heart was full of so much hate, he showed me that I didn't hate people, people are often good, and kind and I love people so much (especially him lol), but people were all working in a completely corrupt, system. A system that would sooner have my baby dead than let me not pay for his life. My view of the world had changed entirely, in one hour, in a Walgreens. I had no idea that this was only the tip of the medical trauma iceberg for my family, and at the tip of that iceberg I was already over $40,000 in debt.

I took a promotion to assistant manager with the understanding  I would get a large pay increase when I got the full managers job.  Well the company made some moves and I got the full managers position faster than expected.  When I talked to my director about the promised increase I was told ""I can't justify another pay increase so soon"" but still stuck me with the title and responsibilities.

It sucked but I pushed on.  They then stripped 75% of my team due to payroll being over budget, expected me to continue doing field work on top of office work and refused for months to listen to my concerns.

Well, a competing company that had seen my work offered me a 20% increase, no more weekend work and no more overtime work.  I obviously took it in a heartbeat.  My boss was shocked, my project manager went into a fit asking why and I just told him ""no one listened to me for months, I didn't get the pay I was promised and I refuse to do double the work because you think the budget is more important than I am.""

The kicker?  The project manager is so terrible at listening he forgot I quit and expected me to work the weekend after my last day.

Whatever level of performance you have there's always another level.,"I noticed this during my stint as middle management. Whatever level of performance my team was doing. It was never enough. They expected me to be constantly nipping at their heels, trying to squeeze out that last bit of effort. The problem was I was familiar with the jobs my team was performing and could recognize they were already at peak safe performance. I'm not gonna ask someone to break themselves just to get an extra percentage of production. That's insanity, you need to keep a good team in good shape. But no, there was always more production to be squeezed. 

Problem was my teams were consistently the top performers. I'd come into a struggling department and revitalize it. I think it must have really pissed off higher management that I could do that without running around behind people screaming like a dog foaming at the mouth. But predictably they would move me to another struggling area and the guy who tried to fill my shoes would flounder. Nearly every time they were surprised by the level of effort THEY had to put in to replace me.

The worst was when someone died. We had prospective franchisees in for a branding seminar, and a large, older dude had a massive stroke in the middle of his presentation.

Im really not even sure if this is the right place to post this, but I’ve been lurking for a few weeks and perhaps some lovely Redditors could give feedback or advice.  

To be frank, I’m a manager and have become more discontent in my role because I see how the company takes advantage of management and employees alike. The problem seems to stem from the top down. As a result, I’d rather buck the trends and go my own direction when managing my team. Unfortunately this also puts me in hot water as I have no filter and tend to make comments like “Gee wish my team could close early” and “oh, we can afford coffee and hot cocoa for finance, but because our department isn’t money making it’s out of the budget - totally makes sense” (we’ve been money making for a while since our role keeps expanding). My father has always been of the mindset that “you’re a company man, you stay neutral, you back the company” so maybe this is a generational gap thing. Fact of the matter is… I’m probably the least company man possible here and I know it irritates senior management, and the only time I toss around company rhetoric I do so sarcastically.

My latest frustrations stems from the fact that last year my company let go somewhere between 2000-3000 people. This year all hourly associates who were left were given a pay raise and the starting pay was increased from $11/hr to $15/hr (36%). I was excited thinking that my team members were getting an equivalent or at least comparable raise. I just found out that our most senior staff only received a .50 raise, or about 3%.

On top of the raise, team members have taken on additionally responsibilities that were previously covered by 2 other departments. This is obviously a trend though because it’s been covered by most major news outlets and I’ll be the first person to say it sucks because it affects the number of metrics that I need to monitor to appease the powers that be.

I’ve been pushing for remote working the past two years because we have the infrastructure in place to support it, but senior management are completely against the thought… “oh they’ll just goof around and get no work done.” That’s just nonsense - we have metrics to monitor non-work, and I don’t mean that wiggle mouse crap some employers implement to see if someone is at their PC or not. Team members have even expressed interest in this because of the number of times we’ve had Covid scares over the past two years. This just reinforces my opinion that we pay for presence not for work because we could probably accomplish more from home than in the office.

Earlier this month, senior management had one on one meetings with team members to see how things are going. I guess they got smart and decided to do stay interviews. However, morale on the team is just as low as it was a year ago and the same grievances continue to be voiced - discrepancies in the pay raises and increased workload.

However, the real burn here is that the concern has been expressed time and time again by my team members and it keeps falling on deaf ears. It’s to the point that I’ve contemplated quietly spreading little brochures promoting unionization throughout the offices and starting an automated twitter account directed at the employer that retweet’s Unionization themed posts and articles that while using SEO to maximize views.  I see other employers in the area and the power that unions wield, which as a manager it’d probably suck getting accustomed to the new norm, but the team members deserve better.

I think it’s wonderful that people have stuck with the company for 20+ years and I’m happy to share the time with these wonderful people, but the past two years have been rough watching everything going on.  I feel awful and completely powerless to help them. It’s a straight slap in the face to those who’ve worked their butts off for years, yet no one can do anything.  For years I’ve felt like the company hides behind their “open door policy” pretending that things change, but in reality nothing ever changes.

But I don't want to feel wrong for wanting fine dining, a bigger house, a nicer car... even model train sets, I used to love them as a kid and they're so fucking expensive now that only the richly retired seem to have them now.


What else? Oh yeah, I remember when complimentary therapy used to be a thing. Like, I used to be allowed to go to the doctor and just ... talk. And the secretary couldn't care less why you were in there, it wasn't her business. And the doctor rang you up personally just to check you were ok, without actually needing money or reason. Even invited you to the pub on occasion or stopped and chatted in the street or tailors shop if you happened to bump into each other.


Oh yeah! Tailors' shops!! I used to go in one with my grandad, just to get socks or underwear - CHEAP underwear - because they were essential while necessary for comfort and hygiene. Now, to go to a tailors, you need Money and a sense of belonging. If you seem like riffraff, it's too expensive before you get in the door these days. But the tailor even measured you up, offered a nice new tie and made everyone in the family feel included in the choices and kept you up to date on your sizes because, well, people change. You appear, grow up, get fat, shrink and disappear; you needed clothes throughout each transition. Now it's all merely whatever fits-close-enough and is cheap enough in the supermarket... but ever notice how it doesn't quite fit you properly any more?


This all seems so unreasonable now. I think the word was ""bourgeois"" perhaps, and too much of it is deemed ugly. I'm kinda made to feel guilty for even looking at that extra slice of cake, bottle of nicer wine or expensive cut off the fresh butcher's block.


I don't want silly money, I don't even want to be a millionaire, but I'm so sick and tired of just 'surviving.' I want to Live. But no, it just doesn't feel fair to want all this anymore and that's not right. I have to be a millionaire to get the things I want and to have things the way they used to be ... and that's not right either.

Not because ethical political parties don't exist, but because the wealthy people who control the current unethical parties are too powerful to let someone they don't like thanks charge. 

I don't have proof to support that there are powerful people who decide who gets to be president and who gets to pass laws, I just believe it from what I see. The few times someone who has honourable ethos actually becomes president, they are either killed, taken down by other means, or the changes they made are reverted as soon as they step down. Those who control the world have the power to put the people they want in the government and they also have power over through other means, like corrupted judges, police and military higher ups, etc,

If someone has proof or indication that the above isn't true, they are welcome to enlighten me.

Back to my point, the basis of their power is money. Through vast wealth they control almost everything.. except other wealthy people.

So in my head the only real way to counteract their wealth is with wealth. Wealthy individuals with honourable ethos needs to group up and push their own agenda, push their own candidates for presidents etc. They can also focus on using their wealth to improve humanity wellbeing in other ways, like nonprofit humanitarian aid, fighting climate change etc.

Wealthy people with honourable ethos might sound impossible for some people but I don't think that's true. Again I don't have proof, I just feel it's actually impossible that there aren't any ethical corporations that treat their workers as best as they can. Ask yourself, if you were the wealthy owner of a business, would you not treat your employees as best as you could? I know I would, I can't be the only one.

Also don't forget, we live in an era where a lot of people make loads of money from YouTube, blogs, etc, ways that don't have workers to take advantage of.

So, if you ask me, you should probably focus on achieving wealth and using it to better our world. Although, personal exploration, expression and freedom do come first, so try to build wealth in a way that fulfills you, and that's probably the best way to achieve wealth. 

I understand that we live in suffocating times, but I believe there also more opportunities than ever.

Once a year they would power off their HQ building, a task that took two days - Saturday to power down all computers, and Sunday to power them back up.  Everyone,  employee and consultant alike were expected to work at least one day on these weekends.

One year they scheduled the weekend so that the power-up on Sunday was *Mother's Day*.

As soon as that email came out, I immediately volunteered for SATURDAY, adding that I would not be available on Sunday.

3 hours later they cancelled the Powerdown and announced it would be rescheduled later.

I want to see the 1% pay their fair share of taxes. The faster they do it the better.

How does anti work perceive a change to the tax code where we adjust the tax brackets to be a multiplier of the median income? Below is an example. I'm not committed to any of the multipliers but I just wanted an example to facilitate the discussion.

Median income is $40,000.

1% tax bracket (25x median income): 50% above $1,000,000.

0.1% tax bracket (250x median income): 75% above $10,000,000

And so on.

Again, I'm not committed to the tax percentages (they could be higher) or the multiplier (it could be lower). Really I'm trying to systematically make income inequality their problem as much as it is our problem in a very tangible way.

info: Lacey is nothing short of gorgeous. she used to be a model and you can tell. she's tall, has big curves, a skinny waste and legs for days. part of our dress code for servers is to tuck in their shirts so it doesn't look messy with their aprons, and this causes Lacys butt to show really well.

recently, he's been making remarks like ""you remind me of my daughter"" and ""your boyfriend can watch us f***"" and Lacey isn't having any of it anymore. she brought a manager into it and the manager told him to either quit it, or leave and Greg laughed it off. later, it was brought up to our GM and he thinks Lacey is ""asking for it"" because she ""shows off her ass"" to all the customers. now he wants to write her up for ""asking for it"" (his exact words)

Work is one of these burdens, that you will carry your whole life.","I just had a little talk with my parents, and I cannot really see myself ever working fulltime 40hours a week on this planet, even part time would be such a pain for me. At this moment I will write my final exams for a better degree in a few months. Actually because, my parents forced me to get a better degree. So at this moment I’m working around 2 days a week for 3-5 hours. 

But I’m just doing this, because I don’t really know how my future will look like, and I wanna survive later on. I’m not working for buying a new iPhone or something like that I just wanna survive later on. And on top of that, if I would like to I could do that as a part time job which would be an option, but I don’t wanna work part time or full time, such a pain!

I mean, why do you have to work everyday 8 hours in order to survive, imagine even if you have a part time job, you nearly spend your whole day at the workplace. 3-5 hours two days a week, I’m okay with that nothing against that.
But it’s such a mindfuck that, you can’t even survive with that capacity. You will get paid yes, but not enough to survive.

But the fact, that I told this my parents and my mum immediately said that I should look for something which I do enjoy and which does make me fun. And I just left and nearly cried because, that’s something like the majority of people does think. They just say oh just look for something what you would enjoy.

Why do we even exist? I mean, at this moment I think just for work. I cannot enjoy other things, because it just fucks my mind. But I will not let me brainwash from the government or other people. But the system as it is, is programmed that you’re trapped.

I mean, you got thrown into this world, maybe you got made by accident, and now every human being has to work the whole day in order to survive, who the fuck thinks that this is okay

I personally think, I wouldn’t enjoy any work. Because which human does like it, to do the same thing or nearly the same thing 8 hours, or just imagine being at your workplace for 8 hours.

I was invited to stay with him for a couple of weeks by my parents, in order to get some life experience, and see how good my own life was in comparison. 

At first I was shocked to learn many places didn't have running water and toilet paper and that people slept on rugs on the concrete floor, sometimes 7 people in a room and washed clothes by hand. 

After a while however I realized that it was perfectly fine to soap up and them wash using scoops of water, squat while taking a dump and wash butt with water. Even sleeping on the concrete made sense as it was nice and cool. 

It was always warm and sunny so no need for fancy clothes. I could pick an array of wild berries and fruits right out of the jungle and the local gardens were all bountiful and lush. The locals caught frogs and other animals and cooked them and there where small convenience stores and food wagons everywhere if you wanted a (very) cheap meal. 

I had been told how gruelling and hard working the rice fields where, and while that's true, a lot of it had become mechanized and the harvest season wasn't all that long, so for the rest of the year they were straight up chillin. The village tended to come together and help each other in the rice paddies too so they got the job done quick.

I found that most of the working age men and women only worked long enough to have enough money to go back home and chill. Some worked a couple of month construction in Bangkok or a factory or whatever then straight back home to chill for a couple of month etc. 

If someone needed to drive in to the big city to shop they could always borrow or rent the car from that one guy who had one. 

Medicine was socialised, to my big surprise and the old lady next door paid a couple of dollars to fill her insulin prescription. ( I know because I drove her to Surin Town to pick it up)

I started hanging out with a group of locals and none of us, including me had any money but we all got by just fine. We scrounged up money for beer and BBQ, drove down to the lake to drink and listen to music and to eventually fall asleep on the roofed teak veranda. While money was tight it always seemed to work itself out, there was always someone who had some or could get a few bath. (No my parents didn't send me cash and my uncle had a meagre pension.)

It was supposed to serve as a wake up call for me but it only made me question who really had the best quality of life. 

The slow and leisurely pace of life out there in the village felt magical to me and being back home working in an office has never quite been the same since then.",0.0,MajorAccountant,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/pt1vd9/story_i_was_brought_to_a_poor_area_in_thailand_to/,103.0,1.0,2666,292,www.reddit.com,joy,Negative,0.41824692487716675,0.001305046,sadness,Negative,0.8128212690353394,0.00071147573

Seriously.,"With most TV shows around the world being of American origin, we've heard a lot about the American Revolution: how you started a war with Britain because they overtaxed you and how to this day you still celebrate their defeat.

Where the hell are those people?

You work for bosses who wipe their asses on your rights and mix their expensive whiskey with your tears; you have the wealthiest people in the world in your country but you struggle to pay rent; you endure humiliation after humiliation from the shittiest managers imaginable because you think you don't have a choice. WHAT.THE.FUCK.

I live in a third-world African country with a useless and corrupt government, weak economy, and enough crime that you'd be hard-pressed to find someone younger than 20 who hasn't been a victim yet. Despite this it is still a better country to work in than the USA. We have labor laws, paid maternity leave, paid paternity leave, worker protection, even government-funded institutions that defend workers. How can a government that has brought it's country to the brink of collapse take better care of it's workers than the self-proclaimed ""greatest nation on earth""?

It's time you fucking did something. Not that I care too much, mind you. In my mind the USA is a warmongering, earth-destroying, greedy shithole, and the world will be better off it the entire country would burn to ash.  But that's on your leaders and your corporations, not on people who work themselves to the bone to be able to almost afford rent. And I'm convinced that most if not all of you will change America if you could.

I'm guessing that your revolutionary heroes would have found a way to change it.",0.0,ominousbarkingdog,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qrpbrf/its_time_for_american_to_reclaim_to_revolutionary/,2.0,1.0,1677,177,www.reddit.com,joy,Negative,0.8502421379089355,0.93574,joy,Negative,0.41605669260025024,0.00059919286

This happened little over a month but the reason why I'm sharing now is because of how bad I got cussed out today by a customer over nothing important, and the constant inspiration lurking this sub has filled me with.

I won't say what family relationship or company name not because I care about the company image but over the sliver chance something comes out of this. The 3 characters are FM: family member, M: Manager who relayed the final decision and GM: General manager who decided to veto the day off.

(Note: this family member does have health issues that keeps him from working most jobs and takes very seriously to maintain his health)

So we both work at a car wash and the job is ok for the pay. Very laid back setting and not a whole lot of ""busy work"" needs to happen when there's down time so very relaxed environment for the most part. FM has had some health problems and wanted to have an extra day off to try get better. This was something to be permanent too. He works 5 days a week 40 hours a week so we both had the general expectation that he might not get it because lets be honest thos days and hours are so normal and forced on us that it's crazy to have 3 whole days off. Nevertheless me made the decision to put his health above the company and asked for the day off (as he should). And the conversation went 1 sided.

FM: ""Hey GM I was thinking about taking a 3rd day off for my schedule""

GM: ""What for?""

FM: ""I've been having some health problems that I think is correlated with work and I want to see if an extra day off might help with that.""

GM: ""Are the health issues because (says the specific health issue FM has)?

FM: ""Yes""

GM: ""Idk let me think about it and get back to you tomorrow. ""

FM: ""Ok ty.""

*The next morning*

M: ""Hey FM did you try to request an extra day off?""

FM: ""Yea how did you know that?""

M: ""Because GM told me that there's no way we're gonna let that happen.""

FM: ""Wth, how come?""

M: ""He called me right after talking to you yesterday and said if you get another day off you'll spend less time at work and be more focused doing things non work related.""

FM: ""Yea thats the point, it's for my health.""

M: ""Well he gave a firm no so I don't think he's gonna talk to you about it again.""


We both weren't surprised GM said no but we were baffled that his first and ONLY response to the extra time off was because ""he'll spend less time at work"".
I am happy to say that FM is actively looking for a job and landed interviews and ready to leave at a moments notice when he's ready.

Last year, I had a job description change moving to an engineering department that added extra duties and responsibilities but no added benefits. But a promise of a pathway to advancement.

Then he asked if I was even doing what was in my job description, and I could potentially make a 4% merit increase next year which was about .87 cents more an hour, it being a big fucking if. And including my $800 bonus which is tied to mostly company metrics which I already know sucks this year.

I support the anti work movement. I agree that we need to take down the big heads like Jeff Bezos and (this might make some mad) Elon Musk. 
However- 
After many years of searching, I have finally landed at an incredible job. I work as a paramedic in small-town Arkansas. I have spent the past handful of years being exploited for cheap labor, having my paychecks shorted, etc. I’ve finally landed at a job that I ENJOY. We have nice ambulances and equipment, competitive wages, I even earn an hour of PTO for every hour worked on federal holidays.

After all, those are two groups already hidden away from society in residential facilities so most have no relationship with those who live behind their prison like walls. They don't care about school children dying because they aren't dying in high enough numbers to effect everyone personally so it's worth it to them to keep the freedom to own guns. They view having guns being taken as a bigger loss than thousands of innocent children.

It was noted during your interviews, you told both
our recruited and the hiring manager that “they
wasted your time because they were late” and ""you
took time off from work just to hear a low ball offer
and that we should have posted the salary range in
the job description” He told you that we do this so
people won't apply just for the money. After which
you replied “what money?”

I went to college and took out loans. Started working at 16, usually two jobs, and 15 years later I’m now making decent money (at least for my field of social work) and guess what, this sucks and even “meaningful” work is soul-crushingly bureaucratic. To pay off my loans took my entire twenties working 60-70 hours a week. Then I saved to take a break and travel, but covid. So really there’s no way out of the machine and there’s never a good time. Leaving my job right now is suuuuch a bad idea but who cares. 

So I’m taking my savings and fucking off to Africa. Maybe it’ll be a huge mistake, maybe it’ll be cool. Either way, it’ll be different. I should wait til after covid but I got the vaccine and this shit will last forever so fuck it. Plane ticket bought, replaced myself in my apartment, sold the car and everything I own. I’ll get a little apartment and do some freelance work online and make cute little meals and get a dog. Maybe start a journal idk. 

I can always come back and make money but our entirely lives will pass us by waiting for the “best time”.

For management this is a mandatory requirement and a week ago I put a bid in for a new spot. 

   My job has mandatory OT within reason most the time so I had gotten this approved through my old HR and safety manager so I could go. [Both no longer work at the company].

  My supervisor was ecstatic I put a bid in and that I was signed up for the certification [This was a month before] and told me to not tell my Leads as they were threatened by me going out of my way to further my career.

   I was asked to do OT by my lead, explained what my class was for and that I could not attend OT at first he tried to argue then I explained I had approval from 3 higher ups and he dropped it.

My second lead came in the next day and heard about the situation and decided to directly confront me while I was working.

Lead Asshole: ""You arent required to attend this class so you jave to do OT.""

Me: "" I paid 100$ for this class so unless you reimburse me its not happening. Plus this was already approved.""

Lead Asshole: ""I dont care, that is up to me to decide and I decided you have to work.""

Me: ""I already scheduled this class and got approval I am not working OT.""

Lead Asshole: "" I dont like this attitude your getting with me. Keep it up and you will be going down a very dark path. I tell you what to do, YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO. Do I make myself clear?""

Me: "" I do not care LA.""

At this point he attracted the attention of my senior co-worker who approached him.

Lead Asshole: ""Ill be back later to finish this.""

I wont even lie I was absolutely furious and nearly walked out. I ended up going to my supervisor who was extremely annoyed and didnt understand why Lead Asshole even went up to me. He said he would handle it and handle it he did, he even told me if this continues please report him to HR.



I wish I could say this was the first bad instance at this job, but remember everyone most management personnel want subservience not equals.  They want absolute authority over us all the time. If you let them walk over you once they will just keep doing it.

It's straight up indoctrination of classism. If they're doing the same work, why are they paid less. This doesn't teach the 'value of a dollar'. It teaches kids they have no bargaining power and should accept bottom of the barrel wages. It's entrenching our current issues as workers.

Marxism was beginning to spread throughout not only Germany, but the entente as well. Soldiers weren’t able to understand why they were fighting and dying for a war they didn’t ask to be a part of, and they were hearing about Russia’a switch to Marxism and both sides soldiers liked the idea. In addition German citizens were being demanded to starve for the war, and be grateful for it. Germany’s Kaiser had no choice but to end a losing war.

So all the sides agreed to an armistice, because delaying the end of end war (which would end up becoming ww2) was far more favorable to them than the dangers of the whole world turning to Marxism as the Russians had done. You will even notice the Allies avoided war until they were certain the western population were anti-Stalin. We now refer to it as “appeasement”. (P.S: I, too, am anti-Stalin. He was a very bad guy, but the founding principles of his Government were workers first. He just didn’t follow those principles.)

I say this because all the posts lately are: “my boss is a dick”, or “maybe if they paid us enough…” it would cost very little for employers to increase wages, and they know this. So, just as the world calmed down after WW1, so too will the world calm down after wages are increased, and the people running the World know this.

I've worked throughout the pandemic as a keyworker. It's been horrendous. I'm not a nurse or anything, I'm a pest control technician. I can't wait to leave. 

The company wasnt clear on what they wanted from us at the start of the pandemic. So my colleagues booked things off wrong because they had no other instructions. Now 3 people have been dismissed for gross misconduct. I've been so tired these past 6 months that I was getting anxious I'd done something similar without realising. It would have been an admin error really, but grounds for gross misconduct.

The pay is shit. They advertise a graduate scheme when it isnt. I've had to bash the heads in of over 100 rats in lock down and I thought I could do it. I was desperate enough for the job to deal with it. But I can't anymore. 

I've been covering 3 different people too for the past 6 months. Some who've been on long term 'sick' too. (when in reality they backed out when shit hit the fan with covid). 

I'm just done with it. 45 hour week (supposed to be 40 but you end up working your lunch break). Disgruntled customers who don't want me to help them and who won't help themselves. For what? There was rumour of a bonus at the last team meeting. Instead they're putting trackers in our vans and making it so they can take hours from us as and when they like. Not even a thank you for the hard work during a global pandemic. 

Oh and they're taking £750 off my last paycheck for training. (Such bullshit really).

I'm glad to be going. I gave my heart and soul and it still wasn't enough. I'm just done. 

I wanna get out before shit hits the fan for me too. I've another job lined up anyway. I was offered it in march and they've yet to rescind the offer despite me asking every couple of weeks so I'm hopeful.

The best bit? I can go live with my partner. If we go into lockdown again I dont have to not see him for 10 weeks. We'll figure it all out even if this job doesn't want me. The new job is a civil service job. So if they still want me at least it's better pay by a lot, flexible hours and less hours.

My family makes a fair bit of money and so we're well off, and as such, my sister and I are quite privileged. Now, they're thinking about getting my sister and I a car to share, which is fine, though I really dislike driving. In return, they want me to get a job if I take the term off from college....for some reason? I'm a generally lazy person and I fucking hate effort, but I do my fair share around the house. I do the dishes, take care of the dog, clean the house (often a bit late, but it gets done!) and I cook. I wouldn't consider myself the master of timeliness or cleanliness, sure, but I'm not a slug and I'm not ungrateful.

Here's the situation, though. I'm considering not going to in person classes for my fall term, mostly because Wisconsin is garbage at keeping people safe from the coronavirus (I live in Chicago, for reference). Online classes are available, but I'd be taking geology online, which is sort of...hard...and my ADHD makes focusing like that near impossible. In fact, last time I took online classes during spring term, I was probably at my worst mentally. I figured that between my asthma and coronavirus, I shouldn't go to in person classes (even if there are strict safety measures), but I also don't want to take online classes that will suck the life out of me. But wouldn't a job at a grocery store basically be as unsafe, if not more? How the hell do I tell my parents that they're insane for making me work for...basically no reason?

After graduating I applied to graduate schemes and I had no idea how difficult it would be to get a place and how many hoops there were to jump through (communication and numerical psychometric tests, usually 4x500 word answers, assessment centre and then a final interview). In the end I gave up and the last time I applied to a graduate scheme was 2018. I lost all belief in the hiring process.

I also applied to positions in the general jobs market and this was worse, because I was mostly met with silence, except for anything to do with teaching. With exception of a few temp roles I had no work. I haven't had a job since June 2019.

I live with my parents and don't pay rent. I go for a run most days, watch tv and spend hours on the internet.

Why have I stopped applying for jobs? Because I know the only way I can get hired is to retrain in a niche. I applied to graduate entry medicine last year, sat the GAMSAT and did work experience. You are allowed to apply to four universities - I was rejected from one and offered interviews for the other three. I had one interview last week.

If I get in then I will have security for life, if I don't then fuck knows what I am going to do. Maybe physio.

616,qbshoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qbshoh/masters_degree_32_hour_shifts_and_homicidal/,5,"Masters Degree, 32 hour shifts, and homicidal clients for $19.45/hr","I’m a big fan/lurker of this subreddit and it’s great to see it growing and gaining traction. I also see the regular “it’s just a bunch of whiny fast food workers” bullshit that people use to try and delegitimize the concept. So I figured my story might help illustrate that this is a problem in ALL KINDS of workplaces/career fields, even ones you would never consider. 

I know this is long, but I have no idea how to make a tl;dr of it, so, buckle up! 

So my first job straight out of grad school (MSW) was with my local mental health crisis team. I wanted flexible hours and that was their big selling point - “pick your own schedule!” I was too naïve to realize that actually translated as, “we are so horrifyingly understaffed that every single shift needs coverage.” And, being a social worker, it seemed like an awesome opportunity to help people in a really tangible way. 

I had zero wage negotiation skills and had done very little research into typical local rates for my education/experience level (totally stupid of me, but I didn’t know any better) and so I took their offer of $19.45/hr without blinking. I mean, that’s almost $20 whole dollars an hour, right?? I’m a real grown up now. 

So I start working. It is, as you would expect, intense. The shifts are (supposed to be) 12 hours during which you evaluate 4-6 people, a process that can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 5+ hours depending on the situation. It is inherently tense and high stress, but I made some awesome work friends and found out I was actually really good at the job. 

Fast forward maybe three months. Retention is shit, people coming and going left and right, so I start picking up a little more work, and then a little more…doing a 10a-1a instead of 11a-11p, that kind of thing. Then we lose our main overnight person and it suddenly becomes mandatory that everyone pick up one (or more!) on call overnight, which was paid at a flat rate plus any in-hospital hours (for context: the team was required to staff the emergency room from 7a-11p and have someone on call and available to drive to the hospital if needed between 11p-7a, even if someone else was still there working late). 

And somehow, somewhere in all this, maybe 6-7 months in, the 32 hour shift became A Thing. 8:30a-11p in person, 11p-7a on call, 8a-6:30p in person. In a row. I wish I was kidding, and typing that and thinking I ever believed that to be even remotely ok makes me feel a little sick. But it was A Thing, and not just for me. They even tried to sell it to us! “Hey, finish almost all of your work week in less than 2 days!” Never mind we were all also working 10+ hrs of overtime a week as well…

So imagine that shift, stocking shelves (not knocking anyone who does, but it’s obviously a way different work environment). Hellscape, right? Now imagine that shift when you are constantly being bombarded by people in immediate crisis, some of whom are very verbal (and sometimes physical) in communicating the fact that they don’t want your help. Or by fumbling police who don’t know what they are doing, panicked family members who you too often only have nice words for, state agencies demanding you prioritize “their people”…it goes on, but I think I’ve made my point. 

It. Was. Bananas. 

I lasted 14 months, somehow. Never did get a raise. The last straw was a situation that happened in which I was briefly taken hostage by a person who REALLY didn’t want my help. I handled in professionally, but had a little meltdown when I finally got back into my car, because, you know, I’m a human with emotions and all that stuff. So I called my boss shaking and crying, kind of expecting her to go “omg holy crap ok go home, take a pill, so sorry that happened.” Instead, she said “oh wow ok. Well you know I need your report and you need to finish the assessment, so take some deep breaths and a coffee break and I’ll see you in a half hour.” I not only had to work the last 8 hours of my shift, but because of staffing issues, I actually had to attempt to FINISH ASSESSING the person who had just held me hostage and was now at the hospital in handcuffs. Obviously that didn’t go well. 

I gave notice the next day, and provided a detailed exit interview to HR. I watched the poor lady’s jaw drop and her face get paler and paler the longer I talked. I swear she turned a light shade of green when I said “oh and about the 32 hour shifts…” All of the crazy stuff being pulled was apparently kept pretty well insulated within the department. The larger agency didn’t have a clue. 

As I mentioned, I made some amazing friends who also managed to survive that hellish situation, and was happy to hear that the supervisor, director, and department head all went on “administrative leave” and never returned. 

And here is the real kick in the nuts, lest we let the agency itself off the hook: a few years later, I thought to look up how much insurance companies pay out for the type of assessment I was doing: $695 per assessment. Minimum. Some private insurances were over $1k. And I was making…$19.45. My agency was turning a $2,500+ profit, per day, per clinician. So seriously fuck the system. 

Anyway and in conclusion, this was 15+ years ago, and I’m in a much better place, professionally and otherwise. But let me tell you, there’s a certain ring tone I used to use for those on call shifts that still gives me the cold sweats when I hear it. 

So, to all the crabby lurkers looking to justify their “lazy fast food workers” perception - hi!

I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/r3tasi/should_wait_staff_get_paid_a_livable_wage_yes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) about 20% tipping, and wanted to ask few questions.

1. For some services like Food delivery (Uber eats or DoorDash), does it makes sense to tip based on order value? Irrespective of whether food was worth $15 or $150, the driver did the same amount of work.

2. Do tips from food delivery services really paid to the driver? I read that services like DoorDash etc. guarantee x amount per hour including tips. For example, let’s say driver is guaranteed $20 per hour including tips. If customers pay $18 tips per hour, DoorDash will add $2 to make it $20. If the tips are $5 per hour, they will add $15. So effectively, customers are paying tips to business and not the driver. Is this true?",0.0,___run,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/r3xkle/questions_about_tipping_for_food_delivery/,23.0,1.0,881,93,www.reddit.com,joy,Neutral,0.4149712920188904,0.00039757323,anger,Neutral,0.8936553597450256,0.0006633356
622,reaqbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/reaqbm/leaving_my_job_right_before_thanksgiving/,5,Leaving my job right before Thanksgiving,"A number of years ago, I worked as a ""server assistant"" (busboy) at a ""fine dining"" restaurant. I was still new to work at the time, and so far had maintained my naiveté about working hard to be rewarded.

I worked the day shift. I usually arrived early, sometimes worked late to set up for the dinner shift, would take extra work opportunities when asked, etc. 

My boss, while not a dictator like so many I've read about here, was still a piece of work. One time he asked me to dress up in a suit to help run the front of the house for a dinner shift. I had just gotten a new suit for a wedding I had attended, so I wore that one. When I arrived the boss complained that I looked better than him and insisted that I remove my suit jacket so as to not make him look bad. In retrospect kinda crazy, but I just did as I was told at the time.

Anyway, back to the story. I'd been working for a bit less than a year and was planning to quit the job before the end of the year to go on a road trip with a good friend before I started at a community college the following year (moving to part time evening work). I had been transparent about this plan with my boss for months.

Thanksgiving was coming up. My boss wanted me to work ""for the team"" and ""as a family"" on that Thanksgiving. Despite being young, my parents had fortunately helped instill a reasonable prioritization framework in me. For Thanksgiving, I wanted to play some football first thing in the morning, help cook the Thanksgiving meal, and be with family for the day.

But I also wanted money. I was quitting full time work and I wanted to save up as much as possible. I was dumb enough to not have used any of my accrued vacation, thinking I could get it paid out when I left rather than taking the time off. However, as I learned just before I left, paying out accrued vacation time was only required after over a year of employment (at least in my state).

So I came up with a deal for my boss: pay me my accrued overtime anyway, even though it wasn't legally required, and I'd work Thanksgiving ""for the team"". Seemed like a win-win to me.

My boss said no. So I quit before Thanksgiving and spent time with my real family.

I don't know what my boss thought I would do, but boy that felt good. I still remember the feeling and get to relive it through the stories I see here. Keep it up.

Last year I worked for what is considered one of the top security companies in the US. I usually spent my time watching cameras and whatnot. But when the pandemic hit we dropped down to 5 people from 10. All of us were working doubles everyday and I lived 40 mins from work so I never got a full nights sleep. I also worked on weekends one time working a 20hr shift. Suffice it to say I worked my ass off and later in the year my parents got COVID. Because I came into contact with them I was told I had to stay home for 2 weeks even with a negative test. I asked if I would be getting some type of pay seeing as I am forced to stay home but they told me I would not be receiving pay for 2 weeks.

back when I was a junior web developer my second job in the UK was with a pet food distribution/manufacturer/seller. They basically had a money printing machine and wanted to build their own it systems and direct to consumer site. 

This is where when I was hired with some great developers and really great cto. We built some nice systems over the space of a year and half. CTO was really a nice guy even got us a office away from the old school financial team where we would often build things to late and then go out partying all night and be back in the office in the morning. really had fun

We had basically built a bunch of systems and many of the seniors in the team were thinking of moving on and I planned to move into a bigger role and work there for a bit longer until that Christmas party. I was having a alright time when suddenly bumped into the FD at the bar. Clearly drunk we started chatting and he explained he read a ""book"" about programming and didn't think it was that hard. Think I said (drunk) that accounting wasn't that hard either. He wasn't that pleased with that but thought it was a Christmas party and it stays there.

fast forward the Monday and our access was removed and the it department are sitting around most of the morning. CTO then comes out of a meeting room and explains that they are restructuring. I at this point have a flash back about the Friday night and panic. I get the CTO aside and spill the beans. He just laughs and says if it's them good luck.

luckily this is the UK and we don't/can't get let go so quickly so got a few months paid holiday and moved on. they have been doing the rounds with ex Devs to get support every couple of months and we share them still with each other.",0.0,ZuluChuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/r2xv7p/get_an_email_for_support_almost_a_decade_after/,0.0,1.0,1846,197,www.reddit.com,anger,Negative,0.39073753356933594,0.0016893034,sadness,Neutral,0.470020592212677,0.00046475942

I've worked in restaurant management most of my life.  I have been at my current place for over 10 years.  I do really enjoy working in restaurants, but this last years has been really eye opening for me.  I've had a lot of big changes in my own life.  The biggest is that my wife and I had our first baby who was born with some medical issues that require many hospital visits.  We also bought our first house.  I have also been in the hospital for heart related issues, which have hopefully been resolved now with medication I am on.  Not to mention all the Covid related craziness as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoy working in and managing my restaurant, but life has kind of put things into a different perspective for me.  I've been working close to 60 hour weeks the past few months just to help fill gaps in the schedule.  We are busier than ever and only have half the staff we need.  I don't have much say in regards to wages, so I just try my best to keep everyone happy.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking for a long time about a switch.  I want to find a new career that would be a better fit for me.  Something where I don't have to work 60 hours and not see my family.  Something that didn't require me to drink gallons of coffee and energy drinks to just get through the day (which probably put me in the hospital to be honest).  Also nothing that would require a college degree.  I already dropped out of two colleges and am still paying off loans after making some bad decisions.   After buying my house, I was really happy with how attentive my realtor was with me.  I was thinking of maybe exploring becoming a real estate agent.  It's essentially a sales job, which is something I am good at.

The idea of becoming rich, though ""rich"" is a rather wide term, is about as real as Santa Claus, in fact I think it's sort of a Santa Claus for adults. 

The rich often blame the poor for being poor, but most people born rich stay rich, and most people born poor, die poor. 

There are several reasons for this, but the main is that a poor person trying to become rich is like someone trying to become a farmer. A rich person will be born with the land in place, buildings for storage and grains, tractors, and money for seed, fertilizer, etc. It's hard to blame someone for failing then, because they had the start for it.

But if a poor person has none of that, then the path to being rich is much, much longer. How can you place blame for that? You can't choose if your born rich or poor, and blaming someone for being born poor is stupid.

The other thing is mentality. Just as the farmer born rich has all the items needed to be successful, their parents knew how to grow their money. In turn, the rich person will know how to grow their money. The poor person will not, as their poor parents had no money to grow, thus that knowledge will never be passed on, having never existed in the first place. It's the very same reason large sum lottery ticket winners are often broke within a year or two. 

There is nothing wrong with being poor, and more people need to embrace it. Of course by that I mean at least being able to cover your basic needs. Having enough money for rent, food, etc. 

There is, however, something entirely wrong with being rich enough to solve world hunger, homelessness, etc and doing absolutely nothing about it while fucking off on a penis shaped rocket. 

No one should blame the poor, ever, and honestly they are probably some of the hardest working people on the planet. They should not be looked down upon, thought of as ""less than"", or seen or thought of in any negative light. 

Capitalism will brain wash you into thinking people choose to be poor, when it's not any further from the truth. Fight it.

My job avoided paying and earlier this month a bunch of us walked out due to poor treatment. HR, managers, and payroll ignored me about my pay owed to me while working there through now. 

The wage board informed me today that they cannot recover the bartending loss because the employer is allowed to pay me server wages as a tipped employee. They also said they can recover the minimum wage of $7.25 for hosting but not the $11 because as long as I’m being paid federal minimum wage, it’s legal.

“ Hey there. Haven't spoken to you in a while. Hope you are well. I've got something going on that you might be interested in.”


Y’ALL!! The NERVE of this fuckin’ guy! I am so shook right now and I just want to write it out here, hoping that maybe you folks will be able to commiserate with me. I apologize in advance for the length of this tale and I will include a TL;DR at the end. SO: 


I worked at this man’s small business doing highly skilled specialized labor. (I’m going to refrain from mentioning the industry/job name because although I hate this dude, I don’t want his children to go hungry if the internet does a Google review smackdown on the business.) I have two degrees, one of which is a master’s, and a further specialized certification in my field that cost $12,000. At the time I was hired I had 6 years of industry experience. Not a ton, but not none, either. 


At the time I started, he had an older gentleman working for him. This guy, though very sweet with lots of community experience/knew lots of customers, to be quite frank - his work SUCKED. I mean, truly abysmal. Making expensive mistakes that even the most basic technician should not have allowed to happen. I did what I could to suggest other ways of working, ways to streamline various aspects of the business and what tools to buy that would improve the workflow.


Eventually, the old dude couldn’t keep up and I felt bad for him, but I also was unwilling to let our work go out completed in a shoddy way. I never was mean to this guy or lorded anything over him, but I did point mistakes, etc out to the boss (who shall heretofore be referred to as HDIC- Head Dick In Charge) because he needed to know about this guys issues as it would (and did) cause major customer issues and loss of revenue.


Eventually, this old guy retired, and it was just me doing all of the hands on labor and shop maintenance. Then the pandemic hit. Everyone was panicking, figuring out how to make things work. I was so committed to trying to make things work that I told the HDIC &amp; Co that if I needed to work a couple weeks and have my pay delayed until they got their PPP distribution, that I was willing to do so. THAT is how much I cared. I poured everything into not only doing my work, but also being directly customer facing because HDIC and his wife didn’t wanna be in the store waiting on customers, and didn’t wanna hire more people. 


SO…a few more months go by and I’m doing my best to run the shop on my own but it’s not easy, especially with constant interruptions and having to do sales in addition to the actual labor. Not to mention, trying to figure out how to run the show on your own with no guidance at all was difficult, as I had more industry experience than HDIC had, by a long shot. I would also get major pushback ordering supplies so we could have items on hand for customers in order to improve turnaround time. He would also get really shitty product from his cousin “in the biz”- products that were so crappy I’d spend an inordinate amount of time repairing them before they could even be sold.


Well, things kept getting more tense. HDIC would have WILDLY variable moods. I mean, I have an anxiety disorder and recently diagnosed ADHD, so I can totally empathize with that. HOWEVER, I have been seeking treatment for those issues, and not just letting them fester. But with this guy, you never know what you’d get. One day he would be SO happy, in such a great mood, “we will open a second store”, yadda yadda. Two days later he would come in, everything would be doom and gloom, woe is me, “we are broke”, “I hate customers”, etc etc. It would have a noticeable effect on the staff, myself included. Just came across as either very manic, or so morose he couldn’t function. 


Eventually, we hired another employee for the same role as me. I was super enthusiastic about this, as this employee (NG for New Guy) had TONS of industry experience (47 years vs my 6 years) and he was incredibly good at his job and his work was excellent. We had differing political views and other outlooks on life, but we were still quite cordial and I enjoyed working with him and learned as much from him as I could. 


So obviously, with his experience level, NG commanded a higher wage. I understood this, but I also knew that it was likely my boss was gonna not enjoy paying out so much more in salary. I was making $20/hr. I also commuted 1.5 hours round trip on tiny backwoods highways to get to work. There was also no insurance and no sick leave. I got 5 days paid vacation that year. New guy was getting paid $35/hr, and one of the conditions of his hiring was that he would get 3 weeks vacation a year. Hmm. Okay. 


Once HDIC was paying out this salary to NG, that’s when the problems really escalated. Suddenly, nothing I could do was good enough. I wasn’t working fast enough, not producing enough, and I was bitched at for being on my phone. Despite the fact that much of the time, I was on my phone looking up parts to order for customer orders from our various suppliers as it was faster than using the catalogs.


One day, first thing in the morning, HDIC told me to come in the back with him so we could “talk”. He told me that my phone use has become a problem, and that he asked one of the guys who owns a store with an operation similar to ours that he knows on one of the industry forums we all belong to how he would handle an employee being on their phone too much. According to HDIC, this business owner told him that he would “take their phone away and throw it at a wall”. 


Mind you, HDIC is a man who has over a foot and probably a hundred pounds on me. (I am short and female.) Additionally, I had very recently had to break up with my fiancé (who also was a foot taller and bigger than me) because he physically assaulted me. It was so bad I thought my ribs were broken, and had to go to the hospital to get checked out. HDIC knew about this, as I had to miss a day of work. I was still very much suffering from PTSD and intense bouts of fear after the assault, and this was compounded by the fact I had to go to court for an order of protection against my ex. 


So when he said that, and had me alone in the back room and was essentially telling me he’s going to take my $900 phone and hurl it at a wall, I was so freaked out I didn’t even stand up for myself. I went into quiet panic freakout mode, with a mental script that went something like “Oh god oh god he’s angry oh god what’s he gonna do next oh god just don’t make him angry just be small and say you’re sorry”. After he left the store I went to the bathroom and shook for a few minutes to regain my composure. Rather than air this where customers could hear, I texted the store manager from the bathroom what HDIC had said and told her “If this man tries to put a hand on me or makes any attempt to destroy my property I am going to the police and he’s gonna have a lot bigger problems than an employee who is supposedly on their phone too much. I feel physically threatened and intimidated and this is absolutely unacceptable.” After that, HDIC’s wife comes down to the store and is really kissing my ass, trying to apologize “he would never do that”, etc etc.


Things just got worse from there. 


The next big issue happened regarding bonuses HDIC stated he would pay us employees. Myself, NG, store manager, and one sales girl. At 10k sales for the week, we would each get $100 cash. At 12k, another $100. At 15k, another $100. This was not written down anywhere, but okay fine, I will take you at your word. We got paid one round of bonuses….but then, the goalposts started to move. “Oh well this week is a short week we can’t do it this week.” After a time, HDIC changed his mind and said bonuses would now be given at 10k, 15k, and 18k. And if we went above 18k, we could talk about more. Okay…kinda bullshit to just change it up mid year and not even at the end of a year/quarter or whatever but ok. The final straw for me was after an event we held that allowed a third party vendor to come in and do a store takeover. This means we would allow this vendor to set up only their products, and we would do the promotion for the event and split the profits. Okay cool. So, in ONE DAY we sold 35k of goods. I was pumped! Extra $300 cash that I really needed. 


Boy was I wrong. When HDIC paid us bonuses, it was only $200. Keep in mind, this was like, the third or fourth time we were supposed to be paid a bonus according to whatever levels he had said he would pay out, but that he had welched on paying. So I asked him what was up with that, and how come it wasn’t $300+. He was very snippy and dismissive with me. Basically said “I set the bonuses and I’ll pay them when I please.” Like, okay. If you had said “I’ll peel off some hundos from the giant wad I keep in my pocket at all times and give them to you guys whenever I please, that would have been one thing. His business, his rules. But that’s not what he said. And I feel that in business, you make a verbal agreement, by gods you STICK TO IT. Otherwise everything goes sideways. He was so dismissive and with such an attitude that I started to see red. 


When HDIC left the store, I went to the sales lady and said to her “okay, please confirm if I just heard everything he said correctly.” She got a resigned, frustrated look and confirmed that I had. So that’s when I am talking with her and “saying this is bullshit, this is not what we agreed to. How is it that we make him 37k in a day, and he can’t stick to the bonus structure?!” I then said “ACKSHULLY I do know the problem. And the problem is that HDIC is GREEDY.”


A few minutes after I said that and was back at my work desk working, HDIC comes screaming in on 2 wheels to the parking lot and storms in to continue “talking” to me about the bonus issue. Apparently, he had been monitoring the security cameras, which, unbeknownst to all of us, were also recording sound. There wasn’t even a camera close to where I was when I was talking, so the audio recording equipment must have been decently sensitive. He was listening to the live feed because he KNEW I was pissed and that I would talk about it. (There were no customers in the store when I was discussing it, ofc.) I said to him that I meant what I’d said, and that if he doesn’t want to keep his word, then I accept that but that he shouldn’t expect me to be happy about it. 



A month later, their issues with my “performance” continued to mount, and I was pulled into the office by HDIC’s wife and the store manager to discuss my performance “issues”. Never once before had I been given a quota of labor to hit, but I was told at this meeting I was not meeting the quota, and that my job was in jeopardy. I pointed out that I’d never been given a quota, and that doing things like repairing crappy “new” product made by HDIC’s cousin and waiting on customers when I should have been working were also affecting that. They also wrote me up for being “insubordinate” to the boss about the bonuses, even though I did not curse at him or raise my voice. I was told basically to shape up or ship out.


I’m sure you can see where this is going. 


I started to keep a meticulously detailed log of all my work, down to the 5 minute increments during the day. I kept a running log of the labor I was producing to ensure that I was close to the required amounts. Regardless, last year, on New Year’s Eve, HDIC’s wife and store manager informed me that they would no longer need my services. I was understandably upset, as I’d been keeping my logs and I knew I was hitting goals. HDIC’s wife said that the computer logs said otherwise, and she wouldn’t even look at what I had written down. In effect, I was being called a liar, in addition to a shitty employee. I was so upset I started to cry and begged them to reconsider as I really needed a job. She refused and basically told me bye cya never.


I spent 4 months on unemployment and only survived because my state was still doing the extra pandemic money. I ended up getting a remote WFH customer service job that actually paid MORE than the store job, when taking into account lack of commute, benefits, etc. And now I had badass health insurance! And no more commute!


Things kept trucking along this year, and I was notified by a friend of an opening at one of the most prestigious educational institutions offering programs of study in my field. My original goal was to be a professor, but tenure track jobs are hard to come by. Long story short, after 2 phone interviews, the school flew me out and I did an exam, presented a lecture, and did a panel interview. Not ONLY was I given an offer of employment, but I also successfully negotiated 10% higher salary, and a 5k moving expenses reimbursement. So in a month, I’m going to be moving across the country to live in a beautiful place doing my dream job and getting paid 2.5x more money than I’ve ever made in my life. 


And HDIC? I did some recon and called NG, and asked if he knew what HDIC wanted. Apparently HDIC has expanded the business to include a wholesale segment that’s selling a couple of niche type products, and is likely tired of doing the work himself and wants to hit me up for help. The difference in my skill set to what he would be wanting me to do is like asking a master painter to produce a bunch of color by number coloring book pages with a box of broken RoseArt crayons. Not that I’m a master, but that’s just to illustrate the difference. How fucking insulting!! I was very cordial and replied to HDIC’s text and said I hope him &amp; fam had had a good holiday, and that I’d call him tonight at 7. 


Fuck that. I’m ghosting him harder than a shitty Tinder date. CYA NEVER, BITCH!!


TL;DR: Boss at small business is a dick to an employee that worked very hard and cared deeply about the success of the business. Worker injured boss’ fragile ego by asking about promised bonuses that had gone unpaid. Boss sends wife to fire worker. Worker gets dream job and way more money than she thought possible.

Take Hong Kong for example. When they protested, they broke their points down to 5 clear concise points. 

Personally I think what you guys are doing is stupid, but it’s because of the hate for people who genuinely might’ve worked hard. Stop focusing on the “how can I attack an enemy” and start focusing on the “what benefits us in the long run.” Be clear and concise and people like me won’t be able to say “oh they’re just lazy, oh they’re just bitter.” CLEAR. CONCISE. SIMPLE. Rallying ideas. Because a lot of you ARE just lazy people hoping for some revolution so you won’t have to work. Sorry, that will NEVER happen. If you have people rallying behind this, which a lot of people see this “ideology” as, myself included, you’ll make no strides.

At my last job I was told ""if you take care of us, we'll take care of you"" so I strove to put my best foot forward. There are several different ""makes and models"" of the machines in my industry and the workers are typically compartmentalized to running just one machine. But I took it upon myself to learn all the machines and run them well while minimizing waste (waste is a major metric in my industry). When review time came around everybody else got 3.1% and I got 4.2%. Some might see this as victory, but as a numbers oriented person I saw this as utter defeat. If I'd rested on my laurels and done the bare minimum I'd have gotten 3.1 but busting my ass everyday got me an additional 1.1%. Not worth it, and I expressed my feelings on this matter. But they said, ""We're sorry, but don't worry because we'll make it up next year. This year our hands were tied."" 6 months later I received a ""sizeable promotion"" without a pay increase, because ""this gives us a lot more room for growth come review time and you should receive a stellar raise"". When review time came everybody else got 2% and I got 3%, but our 401K program was put on ""temporary hold until further notice"" so my 3% raise amounted to -1% when you take away the company match to my 401K plan.

additional detail: Yes, this was during the initial covid burst. But we were an essential business and we'd never been busier. I don't produce toilet paper or hand sanitizer, but the goods that we produce also experienced a giant boom.

I left for another employer in the same industry with a starting increase of 7% plus better benefits. I've now been at my new employer for 18 months and the climate is healthier, the benefits are great, and my pay is currently 25% higher than it was when I left my old employer.

TLDR: Bad raises and cutting of benefits will not be tolerated, leave immediately.

I moved to Utah in June and even Google says you have to make $22/ hr to live here. I was making $25.50 at my last job for 30-35 hours but without my husband wouldn't even be able to live on that with my loans, insurance, and just eating. 

The house we rent is $1557/ month and the average price for a home here is $280-400K depending on the area and size. 

Now that I'm unemployed and we're living on my husband's $70K (apparently the ""sweet spot"" to live comfortably) will still struggle to have a down payment when we're ready to buy and health insurance for a family of 4 is just off the charts for decent coverage.

I'm so god damn tired. I have worked myself into a relatively cushy office job but that makes no difference. I work the same 40 hours as everyone else, doing tedious mental gymnastics for a local health board's IT department.

It's, on paper, the best job I've ever had but all I can think about while I'm at my desk is crawling home to spend an hour with my kids before they go to bed.

I had a taste of a ""free life"" when I was still a kid. I was homeschooled between the ages of 11 and 15, and the sense of freedom to be able to up an leave the house any day of the week and go anywhere I wanted was massively under appreciated by 12 year old me.

I had the same freedom in 2008 after the recession hit at I was unemployed. Besides degrading myself for an hour or two a day by groveling for a job I had total freedom over my time. It was amazing.

I've been constantly employed since 2010 and I've never had the time or money for a holiday. Every day is more exhausting than the last and not even weekends are a rest because those two days are my only chance to maintain my rental property to the standards laid out in my tenancy agreement.

I have retired Boomer family who advise me to work extra hard in order to stand out at work. To push for more responsibility in the hopes of promotion, to strive for my dream job. But no matter how many times I spell it out for them they don't get it.

My dream job is to not ever need to work again. To spend all my time exploring hobbies and chilling out with my wife and kids. To finally feel rested.

It's never going to happen for me.

Currently in college and feel like the one life I have will just be sucked up by work :(,"I spent the majority of my life so far chasing after accomplishments that society deemed commendable. I'm currently in my second year of college at MIT, and I would say I've done a pretty good job at this. Won a bunch of shit for computer science and research, got paid a shitton of money last summer for a software engineering internship, etc. I really don't have anything to complain about and am really grateful to be where I am, but I feel doomed to either sell myself to industry where I'll work 40+ hours a week doing software shit that other people are forcing me to do, or go to academia where I'll have to basically sell my ideas for a living, and make way less money. 

Last semester, I took a really intense workload and worked 90 hours a week on schoolwork and extracurriculars, and even though I got ""so much"" done I just felt empty by the end and now it seems so pointless and stupid. I like computer science and am really good at it but I also like art and playing the violin and writing and music production and so many other things that I also want to keep developing my skills at, but I feel like I can't. Everyone around me seems to just love working on the one thing they are majoring in. 

I'm probably graduating next year. How can I live comfortably without working 40 hours a week after college (and eventually still be able to support a family)? I imagine there's something I can do since software pays pretty well but I don't even know where to start or how to even find jobs that are less than 40 hours a week.

I'm professional in my mid-thirties. I played the game “right” and I have no chance of winning. 

My family were poor. I started working in my teens stacking shelves, working in bars, flipping burgers, doing site labour for groundworks, whatever I could to get myself through university. I got my masters, then a professional qualification in finance. 

I got a “good” job out of university and did the long hours and corporate ass-kissing. I got promoted. I moved jobs for a promotion, twice. I worked longer hours and gave up more of my life. 

I’m remunerated better than a lot of people but still towards the bottom end of my profession for my experience and position. I bought a beat up house and fixed it up top to bottom. Got married. We paid for it all ourselves. We have it better that most but mentally it’s broken us to get here. 

From the outside all is well and we’re successful. Inside my wife and I are screaming. We’re burnt out, exhausted and miserable. No time for anything but work. 

At work I’m treated with a level of interpersonal respect that I never had in earlier jobs but I know I could walk away tomorrow and they’d have my position filled in a matter of days. After a week or so they’d never think about me again. 

To progress I’ll have to show willing to take increasingly callous decisions. My work is meaningless. My profession vacuous. The company is pointless. If it vanished tomorrow nobody would care. 

I cannot do this for another 30 years. What’s the point in earning more is I have no time for anything else. A week or two off in the summer and a slightly nicer meal in a restaurant once a month. What’s the point.  I’m coming to realise I cannot sustain this. My existential malaise could in fact be a more clinical depression.

I also need to be recognized, I want to please my employers, I want to do more than what is asked of me.

I have been working at st-hubert (restaurant) as a dishwasher for over two years, and I have always been a model employee, I have never been late, I have never asked for a vacation.

I'm very concerned about the quality of my work, every task I'm given must be perfect.

And of course, I have never had a pay raise.

But the fact is, about 1 year ago, my boss started to give me cleaning tasks, like cleaning a room, washing the floor, etc...

As I said before, every task has to be perfect, and I always do more to get the recognition of my boss, that he says ""wow, that's a good job"".

One day he asked me to clean a room, his office (the whole floor of the restaurant is covered with a kind of black sticky substance, very very very hard to remove) so I spent at least 4 hours cleaning the floor of his tiny office, everything was perfect.

I already talked to my boss that I wanted to do less tasks like that, to put me in another job, that the tasks he makes me do destroys me"" he just answered me ""at your age you can't be hurt"" but always the same tasks! 

He noticed my good work, and since that day, he started to exploit me properly, I was doing almost all the housework of the restaurant, he said that what the others were doing compared to me was absolutely not comparable.

I was doing the complete cleaning of the fryers, the desks, the outside, the kitchens, to the point of completely ruining my back, even if I was in pain and exhausted, I had to make sure to impress him, that he would say ""wow"" every time, it was almost an obsession (maybe because of a lack of attention when I was young, I don't know)

But one specific job had more or less finished me off, I had to clean the entire parking lot of the restaurant, it's 80m x 80m... it was FILLED with garbage, windblown plastic, no joke it looked like it had been abandoned for years, I spent 2 days full time cleaning it, in the end it was PERFECT (not my back)

AND AGAIN, NO PAY RAISE

About 2 months later he asked me to do the same thing again, I got my weird introvert courage and said ""give me 20 bucks and I'll do it, this is not my job"" when I said it, I felt like it wasn't even me saying it.

He started laughing, and the conversation went like this 

""can you repeat it?""

""give me 20 dollars and I'll do it, it's not my job""

""ahahah you think you have a union to protect you? I'll make you do anything I want, I could ask you to clean the toilets for eight hours if i want""

""ahah, what's the matter with you"" (why aren't you the slave I took advantage of for a year)

""I don't have to prove anything anymore""

And I just quit my job after.

Our insurance is stupid expensive and worthless. I’m constantly in danger of losing my job bc of government contracts. No retirement, and they cut back our travel, which means now we can’t keep our currencies up. To top it off I’m the director of a 6 person medical team. But for the last 4 years it’s literally been just me. Doing the work of an entire team…They won’t spend money to being anyone else in bc well “your numbers are really good”. Oh the gov also completely cut my budget to zero so everything is breaking and I can’t even buy sanitizing wipes or therapy equipment like tape. Did I mention they took away my office? Yup I’m now performing medical care in a completely open non private room. Had to sweet talk a cyber guy just to get a laptop…me the guy who had his desk taken away. I have to do so much work, just to do work and I’m tired of it. Big boss talked to me yesterday and gave me a long line about how money is so tight and they’re just not sure how they can help me. Wanted to make sure I was doing ok though and to tell me what a good job I’m doing. I even brought my kid in for 6 months during the last year when I could have stayed home for free. I knew if I wasn’t there everything would fall apart and I have a thing for helping people. My health is declining, I’m always tired, never have time to do anything fun or even have friends. 
TLDR I’m tired of being treated like a literal pos and I’m finally at peace with calling it and finding something new. There’s got to be more to life than just wrecking your mind and body to make other people look good.

That said, I really dislike the dynamic of someone telling me what I'm worth to them, and employers paying different employees differently for the same work. It's not that I'm being unfairly compensated,  it's that the structure of compensation in employer/ employee relationships is entirely dependent on the whims of the employer. 

Unions exist to protect people from being exploited by employers. But what if we took our skills,  banded resources together,  and started creating more employee-owned businesses across the board, across multiple industries? It could result in fair pay,  greater equity, and employees would have a vested interest in the successes of the companies.

I know it's been done before,  and I know it's not possible in all industries. But it seems like a viable solution. 

There are a number of different structures for profit- sharing companies. How can we support each other to build a better version of capitalism?

I have 2 degrees and 20 years of experience (wish I hadn't got the second due to the great student loan scam.) Every single place I have worked has done something to screw over their employees. 9 years ago I was the main artist and production manager for a print shop. Within two months I was able to move them from being in the rears on production and by alot. I'm taking stacks of work orders to smooth sailing. Great right? Well I stayed on for 4 years with small raises, all with the promise of higher pay being dangled infront of me. While working for said company the affordable health care act passed. I was on my honeymoon on the isle of man (great place btw) and when I returned I found out my health insurance was cut (shop had less than 25 people) and my vacation was cut due to ""restructuring of benifits"". So one week of my two week honeymoon was taken away and I was not paid for it. Along with this they did not increase salary (I left making 13.75 us). No big deal, I found myself another job. This time at a very large retail nonprofit. Over the 5 years I was the art director and designed and developed every facit of this massive organization as well as single handedly designing, sourcing, and implementing the new look and branding for their stores. With this extra work I put in, I thought I would atleast get to a decent living. Not so much, 1% raises was the max due to them not having a budget for marketing. So after 5 years I left for a better opportunity in the for profit world. Was hired on to rebrand and clean up for a company in the industrial world. Great! I got their brand on track and started implementing marketing campaigns that gave them a massive up tick in sales and engagement. Also was asked to design two websites and create a 300 page catalog of their products. I was their a year and half. Covid hit and work from home started, no biggie but then I was told the company had been sold (why they wanted the branding updated) and laid off at Christmas. I look up their ppp status and they also received 1 million in loans that were forgiven. It matched the time line of me being let go so no penalties. So from the start this company never wanted to have me forever, just to help sell the company and they got a free million bucks. 

Tltr: Almost every job I've had as an adult has taken advantage. I thought it was an issue with me, but this community has shown me its the other way around. Still unemployed.

I love this sub wholeheartedly, and think it’s a great means of holding shitty employers accountable.  Long story short, I had a bipolar type one related mental breakdown while on FMLA leave at my former company.    I was in a full blown state of psychosis, and I wasn’t in the right frame of mind to call the hotline.  So, once I was admitted to the hospital, my mom called the employee attendance hotline, but had to leave a message.  She told them I was hospitalized for an indefinite period, gave all the necessary info for them to call her back, and they never did.  This was over the holidays.  They fired me on New Years Eve, and blamed ME for not picking up their calls.  Needless to say, I feel all of the pain, anger, and frustration on this sub, maybe more than most.  

Since then, I was surprised to find out that there ARE companies that truly care about you - they are rare, but they do exist.  I’m currently working for a tech startup company, fully remote.  I want to put this out there for any of you who are looking for a genuine change.  We are hiring for more Sales Development Reps, which is what my role is - and here are the benefits (as I think that’s what we all want to know.) The company is called DataRails.  

Uncapped PTO - take it when you need it.

100% company paid health insurance, vision, &amp; dental for BOTH you and your dependents.  I never knew this even existed.

401k with company match, immediately 100% vested. 

11 and 1/2 paid holidays per year 

40 hours paid sick leave 

Generous compensation with less than 10% of a gender pay gap.  Compensation is based on experience, and I have some history with sales and they started me out at 60k (I did negotiate for this, and they happily accommodated.)  I don’t have any college degree.  

The company does send occasional gift baskets and swag.  

It is fully remote, you can live anywhere in the US.

When I suffered from bipolar depression while working here, they let me take off as much time as I needed to get well again, and continued to pay for 100% of my healthcare benefits each month.  I started up work again, and I’m so glad to be back.  I never thought I would be lucky enough to work at a company like this.

I can’t escape.,"So I (soon to graduate university student, only went because winning a trophy for my mother seemed better than implied homelessness) basically expressed to my mother and sister (college aged) that the idea of having a 9-5(6 nowadays) is bothersome to me, and when it became apparent that I hate school and working (nothing but papers and deadlines), they went with “but what would you do all day?”, and I couldn’t give an answer since I knew that “hobbies” would have earned derision for my apparent laziness. Then my sister started with the “if you work hard, you can have freedom” and “just work harder” and before even questioning how we turned out so different, she started going on about how her friend started a hair reviewing channel reviewing sponsored wigs from China on YouTube 2 years ago as a high school senior and had 100k now and made enough money to buy her own Mercedes. She praised her friend for having the “work ethic” (which, given the evidence of min wage laborers that work all day, makes it clear that “work ethic” is doublespeak for money-making ability) and said that she might be able try something like that in YouTube too and buy her own Mercedes. I tried to tell her about all the factors that she would need to even stand a chance (consistent uploading and editing, parents who wouldn’t try pressuring her to get a job since successful YouTubing nowadays is a full time job) but it was completely disregarded. She then went on about other side hustles I could try (completely ignoring my counter arguments about needing marketable business ideas, investment capital, free time, or a combination of the three)

When my sister was done lecturing me, my mother then asked me to come home from school since I had the opportunity (virus closing schools) but I refused because my home environment, while not directly abusive anymore, makes me uncomfortable since I don’t like being around the people who live there.

Am I crazy for not having this “work ethic”? Do I really have no options if I want to avoid homelessness? I’m not even asking to improve my standard of living, is having the opportunity to maintain it (a small dorm-like room with internet access) really that much to ask for? Especially when many other students in my school (especially international) are born with much more than that that they will have access too even out of graduation.

I thought it was $3 an hour but talked to him tonight and I misremembered it. His brother worked at the same one and confirmed it as well.

He will be 70 this year and started working at a rubber hose factory in 1970 for a starting wage of $4.50 per hour. He was a factory production worker. Not supervisor or anything above a regular worker.

This is $30.72 an hour today. We all know the inflation calculator is ""broken"" because housing costs, healthcare, education, etc have all outpaced inflation. 

The factory is still there, curious I looked on Glassdoor and some other sites and their starting wage is only $14-$16 an hour, for the same role my dad had. 

Now lets have a look here:

[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015021301612&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=406](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015021301612&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=406)

In some states, like Ohio, production workers were earning $5.12/hr in 1974, or $27.50 today, averaging about 41 hours a week, which would be $1127.50 a week today. 

That's $58,630 a year with no college needed. 

Reading down further, 75% of plant workers got **7 days of PAID holidays** or more, and 3 weeks of PAID vacation each year after 10 years of service, 30% getting 2 weeks after their 1st year. 

**It gets worse.** 

In 1975, in Cleveland, a union laborer or helper (basically someone nailing plywood to a house frame) made $8.10 an hour, or **$39.88** today. Today, even a union laborer in Ohio only makes about $22 per hour. 

In 1975, the median weekly earnings of ALL workers was $185 per week, or $910 today. 

A white male over the age of 25 made $235 a week or $1156 today. Today the median for all workers is only $989 per week, and with all the equality laws passed since then, means most people are paid about $250 per week less than in 1970.

In 1975, retail trade workers earned **$3.34 an hour** which would be **$16.44** today.",0.0,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/muk6t1/here_is_great_link_if_you_want_to_make_yourself/,52.0,1.0,2005,209,www.reddit.com,sadness,Negative,0.507399320602417,0.0019364551,sadness,Positive,0.5368809700012207,0.03541928

And I am not ashamed to admit, I imagined getting to say what I said, but didnt actually think I'd be given the direct opportunity. Me: Well, you dont give employees, let alone recent cancer survivors, two weeks notice, so I dont see how this place has earned that courtesy.

I didn't really do much  ""research"" just some lite googling I just want to blow of some steam if I got something wrong please correct me.

I was browsing Youtube and saw a video about Tesla and that they had problems with a german union, short summary Tesla builds a giant factory in Germany but doesn't what his worker in a union. I watched it and was baffled at the points made in the video and how defensiv of Tesla the creator. So I looked at some other videos on Youtube and read some articles. The videos were all the pro Tesla the articles more neutral. To the points the enraged me.

Firstly was how IG Metall was framed as the bad guy that just wants to protect the german companies from the foreign Tesla, so IG Metall bullies Tesla.

Which I don't even doubt that is to small piece true but how is this bulling when the consesquence of is that Tesla is handled like every other german autombile factory and if IG Metall succeeds the workers will most likey have better working conditions and benefits.

Secondly the lies/misinformation about german unions that if the worker were unionizing they can't be paid more then the union standard and the worse benfits.

I don't know a single union here that would stop a company from doing more for there workers.

Thirdly that Tesla would themself a good job to get their workers the best they deserve.

The track record of many other companys shows that they give a shit about their workers and even if Tesla was the exception(which it isn't) why should one make exception for just one compan.

Fourth fourthly ? they sat the union and germany were anti enviornment because Tesla produces electric cars and that is good for the environment.

 Even if Tesla could alone safe the planet should it through every means nessary.

Why?

The goddamn Log-Ins

I'm not sure if I'm just an idiot or what but the complex log-in systems that all these company websites have is really fucking annoying.

I try to apply for a job but it's done through brassring, apparently, brassring got rid of its universal log-in system so every time I make a username and password for one company website via brassring, it overrides a previous username and password I made for another company website that also used brassring so I'm constantly having to either make new logins or reset my logins for every single job I apply for and the ridiculous login requirements for these job websites are unnecessarily difficult to meet.

If I do manage to login I have to look forward to the job applications asking me to upload my resume and doing absolutely nothing with the uploaded resume as it proceeds to ask me to fill out everything manually, then I have to deal with those goddamn personality assessments that take 30 minutes to an hour to complete.

I am susceptible to sensory overloads and these goddamn job applications are like the number one thing that triggers them.

Why can't I can just apply over email? Why do I need to go through a digital kafka maze to get a Job? Are companies doing this intentionally? Is it some massive scheme to just demotivate American workers so jobs can be moved overseas or do they just want to be cruel for shits and giggles?

I'm Dr. Devon Price, and I am a social psychologist, author, and the writer of the book [Laziness Does Not Exist.](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Laziness-Does-Not-Exist/Devon-Price/9781982140106) The book began as an essay on Medium, which some of you [may have read here](https://humanparts.medium.com/laziness-does-not-exist-3af27e312d01). 

The book is all about the history and present-day consequences of something I call The Laziness Lie, which is a cultural belief system that has three main tenets: 

1. Your worth is your productivity
2. You cannot trust your own feelings and needs. 
3. There is always more that you could be doing. 

The Laziness Lie has its origins in Puritanical beliefs about motivation being a sign a person was blessed by God, as well as the indoctrination that was used to justify enslavement and keep working-class people separated along racial lines in the wake of abolition. 

Today, hatred of Laziness is used to justify all manner of biases and systems of oppression -- everything from how onerous we make it to access disability benefits, to the constant pressure we feel to ""stay informed"" by jamming our heads full of social media junk data, to white nationalist sentiments that the country is being stolen from them by lazy ""degenerates,"" and so much more. 

The book's listed as self-help, and does have some prescriptions for readers on how to set better work-life boundaries and unlearn the Laziness Lie where they can, but it ultimately advances the idea that we need way more systemic change to fully ensure that everyone has the freedom to stop working/overcommitting/being exploited.

Reading y’all’s stories and text exchanges has been so enjoyable and has me reminiscing about my past employment history, I’ve had a lot of terrible managers the more I think about it. I’ve always known my job history wasn’t enjoyable but the sheer amount of boneheaded management I’ve encountered in my life feels staggering. For context, I’m 35 and have been working nearly nonstop from the age of 15 until I got laid off last year for Covid. I wanted to share my run of shit managers, this post will likely be a little long…

*Papa Fratello’s* - Italian joint that didn’t last long, dumbass manager replaced tile flooring for carpet. Babies throwing spaghetti now needs to be cleaned off of fucking carpet. 🤦🏼‍♂️

*Stonewerks* - fancy-ish steakhouse/bar that had me, a teenager still in school, working dishwasher duty until close… at 1:00 am. I put up with it for a semester and into the summer to make some money but quit 30 min before my 4th of July shift. Fuck y’all I’m gonna go shoot off fireworks. 

*County Line BBQ* - my dad got me this awesome job with him on the riverwalk. Except Gina, the other manager, does all the hiring and she did not like me because I want part of her plans. She had me squeegeeing the front walkway during a rainstorm 🤦🏼‍♂️

*Sonic* - the lunch manager would literally just disappear, he claimed to go pick up his daughter and take her to the babysitter… I basically worked as deaf to manager in his absence because somebody had to. 2 weeks after I left he was fired by corporate. 

*Blue Cactus Cafe* - bbq again, but this time working with a ton of friends. Easily my favorite job looking back but ownership/management was so bad we routinely had to fight them from making extremely poor choices like cleaning out the old smoker. Everything broke in this joint and more often than not we just dealt with it like when the ventahood stoped working on a summer Friday 🤦🏼‍♂️

*Blockbuster* - manager refused to acknowledge my changing availability due to school schedule. Would schedule me for 5:00 on a day I have a class until 6:30 and would still need to bicycle 6 miles to get there, then act confused and annoyed when I roll in around 7:15… I’m not skipping the class I’m paying for to work at fucking blockbuster. 

*Steak-N-Shake* - I got hired, watched 20 minutes of a training video, got pulled into the office to talk, that talk revealed that this location that was actively hiring was going to close its doors in 3 days time… da fuq? Why are you hiring if you know that???

*Red Mango* - yogurt shop that hired me knowing I dislike yogurt. That manager leaves and is replaced by a young girl with zero **work** experience. Not just no relevant food service experience, no work experience at all and now she’s in charge. She didn’t like that I bossed her around without even a second thought, accused me of stealing $400 worth of product. Every square inch of this place is covered by security camera yet the owner tried to bully me into not watching the footage… fuck it, I’m out I hate this place and y’all anyways. 

*Dicks Sporting Goods* - oh you showed great punctuality (a quality severely lacking around there) and effort working 55 hours this week…? Yeah, you’re on schedule for 4 hours next week to compensate. Can’t have you making full time hours, those people are entitled to benefits. Went back maybe a year after I left and an old coworker told me my old section lead blamed me for hiding shoes missing their pair instead of dealing with it properly. He also said he stood up for me against that accusation saying “that sounds like more effort than I would commit to not doing something, I’d simply say I didn’t do it and leave them in a pile” 🤣

*New Balance* - spent years working a skeleton crew and being mouthy at managers and owners. I was really good at sales and was punctual but opinionated, Covid hits and I called them out for being grossly irresponsible trying to remain open to sit face to face with old and injured people during a global pandemic. Managed a good “fuck you all” moment on my way out the door for the last time there.

Some really messed up stuff happened, showed me that the company was NOT what I thought they were (bad values, bad people). This happened on the Friday after I turned in my 2 weeks that Monday. I explained the situation to my boss, and I’ll admit I cried a little, but I asked if I could rescind my 2 weeks. They said absolutely. 

Now - I interviewed for another position and honestly wasn’t expecting them to come back with a competitive offer - they did. This new job is 5 minutes away from home versus my current 45 minute commute and is just all around a better opportunity and environment. Everything is comparable - PTO, benefits, it’s honestly a step above my current job. Am I a bad person for considering taking this job? I can’t help but feel guilty about doing this to my boss so soon after previous events. Boss has been guilt trippy since I rescinded (I’m so glad you stayed, I don’t have to learn all the stuff you do, I don’t have to stress about finding a new person, etc.) I would take it in a heartbeat if it didn’t mean doing this to my current employer and company.

He's pretty fair most of the time with some intermittent red flags. This also happened a few months ago or so. So one day a fellow employee asked me about my wage so I told them cuz I don't care. Word got back to my boss and he came up to me and said it was very unprofessional to talk about my pay that I should never do it ever. I was kind of upset honestly. (My pay is slightly higher probably than most people in my department at a grocery store I work at. I only make 15.50 an hour and they have plans to make me a manager elsewhere in this grocery store.) So I went home and found that discussing wage is absolutely legal under the national Labor relations act. I'm just kind of upset and don't know exactly what to do. I'm having a discussion with the store manager in a week or less who hired me and wanted to make me a manager and I'm going to ask for a nice raise, to get into the 401K program early, and to get more responsibility to justify the raise I want which is going to be like $5. I guess I'm just looking for a little advice and maybe what I could do or what you guys think I should do because there's other red flags at this place and just plain annoys me that my manager is trying to underpay everyone basically and keep them at a low wage. Many people don't speak English or don't speak it very well and I worry that they are the most taken advantage of. They work very hard, so many people do in the department. Thanks for any help.

Owners of bakery state cash tips will be pooled and held by them to be used for purchasing water bottles/snacks for staff,"On mobile, sorry for any weird formatting.


For context I am in California, working for a franchised company with 50+ employees. Most of which are 16-17 year olds and this is their first job. The owners are 40ish and this is their first time owning/running/opporating a bakery, and are originally from Utah. 



Like the title says, I just started a new job at a franchise bakery and on our first day they announce that cash tips are pooled and held by the owners/managers and will be spent on water bottles and snacks. And occasionally pizza! *insert eye roll* (Disclaimer: this idea may or may not be the suggestion of the owner's sibling who also runs a franchise bakery but isn't doing very well) 



We do get credit card tips, they are reported, taxed, and appear on our paycheck. Rumor has it tips average us an extra $3-$4/hour. Which is probably the reason they only intend to pay shift leads $16/hr. (I havent gotten paid yet so I don't have a baseline.  I am also annoyed at their justification for low pay. I have rent to pay and can't rely on a good week of tips to make or break my month. I have 7 years of industry experience and we outsold every store in the U.S. on our soft opening day, I like to think I played a role in our success) 



Is it legal for them to withhold our cash tips? They justify it as buying stuff for us ""like family"" but like. I bring my own water and snacks. I appreciate the occasional granola bar or crystal lite pouch but I would rather have my $2 a day or whatever. I can see the potential issue seeing as how 40ish people cycle through the kitchen in one business day, none of which work more than 5 hours and (from the 3 days we have been open) we have gotten exactly $4.62 in cash tips. So i can see how pooling it can be more effective. 


However I didn't agree to this arrangement, it was mentioned as an oh by the way and it is rubbing me wrong. I have looked on the California Divison of Labor Statistics website [Division of Labor Statistics Website ](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_tipsandgratuities.htm) but it seems a bit vague on this specific issue.

Please tell me if I am over reacting or if this is sketchy because it has been a *rough* first week.

801,r3lrq4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/r3lrq4/the_line_between_working_out_problems_and_quitting/%27,",5,The line between working out problems and quitting,"Hi Reddit,

What are your boundaries with quitting vs “hold on, maybe we can work this out?”

A few weeks ago my boss surprised me with cake (please continue to listen before judging the situation) for my birthday. The day she did it, however, I was in a shit mood. I was frustrated at the lack of structure in the workplace and on top of that my coworker being late (boss’ sister) being late for an entire hour (she was supposed to get there at 4, she didn’t arrive til 5 which is when I was leaving).

I work at a spa. What makes this more frustrating is that because her sister was late, a client was late getting inside to their room (I was busy helping two others). 

This entire event triggered a major depressive episode, where I barely had an appetite (my two subsequent shifts I didn’t eat) and was crying everyday for a week.

This  surprise happened on a Friday night and when I came in on Saturday, I was so pissed I didn’t want to be in the space. The entire day I was grumpy (everyone knew it) because of how stressed out I was. I wanted to talk to my boss but because she was busy filming stuff I didn’t feel like she had the space for a conversation. I did my job, I helped clients , answered the phones. But I was guarded and withdrawn from anyone I didn’t need to talk to. 

When I’m leaving we briefly talk - she says “I don’t like your energy you should stay home tomorrow.” I immediately break down and just tell her how much surprising me stressed me out, how literally just checking in with me would’ve resulted in a better outcome, etc. 

My boss is the epitome of a nice person. Her voice is airy and she’s gorgeous so it’s easy to feel connected to her. She’s a listener, will ask about your personal life, and genuinely cares. 

However - the way she acted during this entire thing with me being stressed literally because of something she did was fucked. When we talked later in the week she just said she doesn’t want me to come to work like that anymore. 

I mentioned I have depression and anxiety (was diagnosed). She basically said those were excuses and that when I’m at work “all of my problems stay outside the door”. She apologized but she was distant; I don’t think she’s sorry at all. She expected me to show up with all of that behind me and was frustrated I wasn’t. 

I talked to loved ones and decided to quit(am looking for other work first) But apart of me wonders if it’s the right move. 

Do you think we should talk again?

TL;DR boss surprised me, got stressed out, am being told to shove my problems down and be at work.

Today we have what's more akin to a wild west style of free market capitalism where lobbyists have torn down regulations so that big business can do just about whatever it damn well pleases from not paying their employees a fair wage to holding absolute monopolies (I'm looking at you amazon) to down right not paying taxes. 

This same playbook was applied in the banking industry where the deregulation lead to the sub-prime crisis in 2008. We need some form of mixed Market capitalism for us to remain a solvent nation (which we probably won't remain so for very long) and for busineses and jobs to generally exist, however, what we have today is nothing short of modern day slavery that utilizes tax payer infrastructure to turn out huge profits while paying depressed wages. They're literally gutting America and its workers of our wealth and efforts. Much of the profit is rolled into property to hedge against inflation since the dollars future is bleak at best and that helps those with wealth protect what they have and earn more all while making it harder for anyone starting out to get anywhere. It's a viscious cycle of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. 

A big part of the problem seems to be money in politics. Lobbying on behalf of big business today is bribery. We need to get money out of politics and replace a majority of our leaders with people who actually represent us and can help balance things out again with a whole host of legislation like that which has been proposed on this subreddit - rent control, workers protections, inflation adjusted minimum wage, etc. Essentially the people with the most influence and wealth deserve the most oversight and regulation.

What if I want to, you know, not be homeless? Guess I could spend $1000 a month on rent/utilities. Can't find a studio or 1 bedroom apartment for less than that within a 25 mile radius of my job. 

But wait, I guess I kind of need to eat. Good thing I have a whopping $12 a month left over for food. 

Gas/car maintenance to get to work? Nope, guess I'm walking. How bad could a 30-mile round trip commute on foot be? 

Medical expenses? Phone bill? ANY semblance of ""leisure""? Guess I have to give all that up, too. Going to the doctor... what a wasteful luxury. Good thing walking 150 miles a week should keep me healthy. Memorizing my work schedule will be ""leisure"" along the way, since I won't have a phone anymore, or, you know, money left over for a pen and paper.

I knew the federal poverty level has it's problems. But I didn't know it was THIS BAD. Perhaps I'm a little naive. How the fuck is ANYONE, ANYWHERE, considered ""above poverty"" at 12k a year?

You can potentially build a passive income . Bloggers can earn an income through advertising / sponsors and authors through advances, sales and royalties ( sky is the limit )

2. It can be extremely meaningful and rifling if your writing is authentic and true. If anything, due to market saturation, the writer that provide honest true perspectives do better.

3. There can be deadlines but you’re rarely on the clock. At worst you’ll be given a time frame to submit something but it’s up to you how quickly it gets done 

4. With a laptop, you can literally write anywhere. Writing lends well to travel and altering environments that can create new writing perspectives.

5. Writing can change the world and how people think. Anti-work as a movement wouldn’t exist without the seminal essays, books and articles that came before us.

During this time Ive been mentioning to him that I feel like I'm struggling to understand a lot of things about the business but that just makes him insist that I need to work more and get familiarity, fair enough.


What he really meant was, ""I'm going to give you work that is going to be challenging and I will not be around very much, if at all to help, you should be asking your coworkers and if they don't know or can't help you're shit out of luck"". I mean it's not an unusual approach but man I feel so stuck. The most recent thing that got me fed up is a managerial report. It started off with me just clicking the button and emailing the report, but at one point it stopped reporting correctly. I've been sending this report to the president of another location so he calls me up and starts talking about the report and of course I have no clue what he's even talking about. This goes on for a few minutes I apologize a few hundred times and go on with my day. My boss ends up ""helping"" me fix the report (tell me what to type with minimal explanation).


Since then that report has gone to shit, I feel like the manager is just looking for little inaccuracies to make me stress, but I also doubt he has the time for that. So a few times a week he will say something is up with the report that needs fixing then once that is fixed, it's another thing. They are typically small issues, but I have so little understanding that it takes me atleast an hour each time. And then that just makes me feel guilty, that it's taking me so much time. So I'll spend the majority of my day just panicking more or less. 



At this point I don't know what to do. I wish I could tell my boss to fuck off and collect unemployment for a month or two to find something else but it's looking increasingly unlikely. I don't know what I want to do, I want to think I still enjoy technology, but it's really not enjoyable to be pushed my businessmen who I know don't care about me.  Every week I just try to get through the week so my anxiety will calm down and I can have an appetite again. I really just need a hug, it doesn't even make me feel any better than a lot of IT professionals struggle with this, just makes me feel like doomed to live the rest of my life like this unless I switch fields.",0.0,zRandomGuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/mzyazn/tired_of_the_anxiety_and_just_not_knowing/,0.0,1.0,2721,273,www.reddit.com,sadness,Negative,0.46394792199134827,0.3173207,sadness,Negative,0.8519999384880066,0.0005274568

Educate yourself on modern slavery,"I feel like most of us here can agree, regardless of where we fall on the political spectrum, that modern working conditions sucks for most of us. But I feel like this sub focuses a lot on personal anecdotes and not enough of institutional, global abuses.

If you want to be antiwork, it can't just begin and end with how you are individually affected. Yeah it sucks that your boss is making you work through lunch. But we need to amplify the issue of slavery too. This is the place for it. The modern world is built on the mass mobilisation of labourers globally. It's not just about restaurants underpaying wait staff. 

We need to talk about the fact that there are over 40 million slaves around the world. 71% are women, 26% are children. Slavery is endemic in the fashion industry, cobalt mining for lithium batteries (in your smart phone right now), in fishing industries, fruit picking, as well as domestic and sex slavery.

Slavery is still a global issue. Yes, it disproportionately affects Africa and the Asia Pacific, but there are 13 million slaves in the UK today. 

Slavery generates $150 billion dollars in profits annually, a third of which is generated by the developed world (where most of us live).

We need to be talking about this on r/antiwork. Anti slavery should be an antiwork stance. And we need to take steps to monitor our consumption of goods that utilise slavery in their industries. Mindful coffee and chocolate consumption, buying fish and produce from reputable companies, not buying products from infamous companies like Nestle, boycotting fast fashion whenever possible. More importantly, we need to be spreading the word on this. If we want r/antiwork to spark meaningful change, it can't begin and end with Western unionisation and mass resignations. We have to extend the fight to everyone.

I got there within my designated time slot, only to wait almost 30 minutes to even begin the interview. Think I would've gotten the interview, being 30 minutes late? Big money on a solid 'nope'. But fine, whatever.

The interview went alright. The interviewer, however, didn't seem to barely care that we were having a conversation. I'd ask questions, and he'd just glaze over them, or cut me off mid-sentance to continue telling me about the job. Now, would you hire someone who constantly talked over you, and barely have half-assed answers to your question? Again, lots of money on 'no'.

Now, my state has legalized weed, but obviously it's not federal, so stores can still drug test at will. Not a problem, I understand there's liabilities and processes. The kicker here is it was never once mentioned by either interviewer. Not one single word about it, so I was under the impression it was sort of a 'don't ask, don't tell' situation. I ended up getting a call back and offered the job. Manager said I'd get an email for all my on-boarding paperwork and such.

When I get into accepting the job, the first thing it says is 'we are a drug-free workplace blah blah blah'. As I said, weed is legal here, so I tried calling the manager to ask him if popping positive for THC would be grounds for not getting hired. If so, I would've been upset to lose out on the higher pay, but I understood, and just wanted to clarify to make sure no ones time was wasted if that was the case. I called on a Friday, and figured I'd probably have to wait until after the weekend for a callback. Monday rolls around, still no call, so I call back and leave another message. 

It's now 2 weeks since that, and I've heard absolutely nothing from said manager. Nada. I've tried calling once or twice more, and left messages, to no avail. He just completely ghosted me, because that's obviously the professional response. 

Bottom line: make these people earn your respect, don't wear it on your sleeve. Of course, be professional and civil, but also remeber that *you're there to help* ***them*** out, not the other way around. We need to end this notion that companies and employers are allowed to communicate or not, whichever they see fit, and hold them accountable for the same things that would make a person 'unemployable'.",0.0,SeductiveSoup,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/s7377p/wouldnt_it_be_nice_if_prospective_employers_gave/,0.0,1.0,2374,281,www.reddit.com,anger,Negative,0.5062036514282227,0.02366467,joy,Neutral,0.34527280926704407,0.0050415355

Additionally, when I told her I couldn’t do overnights anymore, she didn’t let me change my schedule. I had a suicide attempt in November 2020 that she knew about and survived, and only then did she let me switch to my evening position when I had a doctor’s note.

Boss brought over very scarce rapid tests to prove she could work,"This is a friend of mine who works *extremely* hard. She's the kind to put up with all sorts of toxic work environments to constantly prove to herself that she's a hard worker.

She got the job she's at now because she **finally** quit her previous one after 3 years of abuse. The owner was basically like an abusive boyfriend. Constantly yelling at her, and then buying her gifts to make up for it. She felt indebted to him because he gave her money to move into a place, bought her a new laptop, and many other things. I kept politely reminding her that he was doing this because he relied on her so much, and literally couldn't run the business without her, so instead of treating her with respect he yells and then makes up for it.

Anyway, she snapped. She got an offer from another place quickly (she has an excellent reputation for being a hard worker) for a lot more money. She got a good contract and was treated well... for a bit.

Wasn't long before the same problems crept in. Unfortunately, saying yes to everything and over working yourself means employers quickly take advantage of you.

Her housemate tested positive for COVID and she was required to isolate. Where I live, rapid tests are $35USD for a box of 5 and VERY, VERY RARE. He brought over three of them to prove she was well enough to go to work. She took them and it came back positive.

Problem is, she has no sick leave from work but doesn't have ""personal leave"" that is paid. If you have no paid leave available from work, the government will support you on lockdown ($540USD/w). But if you have any kind of leave, no matter how small, they won't pay you. So the workplace, in an act of revenge, paid her on personal leave for a whopping $144USD/w. The leave is reserved for things like bereavement, and takes a long time to accrue.

**So not only did she go from one incredibly toxic work environment to the next, they took rapid tests from people who really need them, and then stood in her way of getting $1500 for two weeks off and gave her $200 for the two weeks instead.**",0.0,MetalDetectorists,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rzh1rx/friend_is_isolating_as_her_housemate_tested/,0.0,1.0,2059,231,www.reddit.com,anger,Negative,0.6673872470855713,0.0107528595,joy,Negative,0.4745843708515167,0.00085577986

Single Family Some

By parents own two rental properties, one has been a
pain, and they are getting to the point where they cannot
physically deal with it themselves and have asked me to
help.

His morning the tenant sent them an email, about their
“rent forgiveness” proposal. They currently owe $9,000
in back rent, and pay in chinks. $500 here, $200 there.
Went is $2,250 and comes are around $2,800. These
properties are my parents only source of retirement
income. In their proposal, they outline backdating a
monthly rate of $2000 to April 2018 to effectively flatten
their k owed.

Not only do | want to send an email saying no to their
proposal, but | would like to include a rent increase form,
along with a new lease to sign (they have been month to
month for over a year it seems).

In the current climate, how do | find the exact steps to
take legally? Of they say no, or put up a fuss, what am |
allowed to do (no current lease, election moratorium,
small claims court)? I'm in the greater Seattle area and
would greatly appreciate any advice.

I just want to share my thoughts on this, because I think all the talk about this is only hurting the sub. 

I think there is something really endearing and beautiful in that interview. 

Just a guy, saying they want to work with dogs and maybe teach someday. That's the whole point of this sub. We are no politicians and silver toung devils. We are just people who DONT WANT TO WORK IN THE MACHINE. 

You can't stop complaining about the mod looks and demeanor. Maybe it's because most of you are Americans, but this kind movements don't need  charismatic leaders. We are all losers in some way. We just want to be happy. 

The cringe in that interview was the Fox News Anchor. Do you really think a Fox News employee has more dignity that a dog walker?  Why do you want to play the media game so desperately? Fuck em.

And you know what? There is something reasonable in deleting posts about that interview. If someone new comes to the sub, instead on getting Hooked on antiwork rethoric, they're gonna see a bunch of teenager drama in the front page. I don't mean it's ok, but just food for thought.

And in that line, I don't want to sound arrogant, I don't have clear answers, but I have an interesting question.

My old job was at a college in New England, US, as a campus security. I am an alumni of same college, and was given the job as a temporary position until I could get into my degree's industry. I was hired as a full-time employee, with administration knowing fully that at any moment I could leave to pursue my intended career. I was given a contract for one year, with the statement ""could leave at any time to pursue his career,"" so that it couldn't be held against me later for breaking a contract.

In November, I got an offer to take some training courses for a week, sponsored by a Union. I had the vacation days from the college to be able to take the week off with no problem. While I was taking those courses, I got a job offer that required me to take 2 more weeks of training (with reimbursement for travel as well as daily wages). This was a huge pay raise compared to what the college was giving me, so I was okay with not getting paid by the college for ""being sick,"" because I'd make more just to sit in a classroom.

I came back from the Union training, to find out that my supervisor had scheduled me for 4, 12-hour shifts: Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year's Eve, New Year's Day. He wanted me to do close to 52 hours of work a week, with the extra 12 unpaid, so that my coworkers could be with their families for the holidays. I told him that I'd like to be with my wife for Christmas; I'm a newlywed, and it's our first holidays together being married. He told me that my wife wasn't as important as my coworkers who had been married 30+ years.

I had originally come into his office that day to give my 2-weeks notice, because of my job offer. My final day just happened to be the day before Christmas Eve. He rejected my resignation, telling me that's too bad, I still have to work those 4 holidays, because if I don't, then he has to fill in those shifts himself. So I took back my 2-weeks notice, and instead told him ""It's in my contact that I can leave when I want. When I step foot off campus today, I'm not coming back."" He told me that wasn't acceptable either.

I walked off campus. Emailed HR that I was done, effective immediately due to a job offer. Got a response back almost immediately that said good luck, and congratulations.  About 2 hours later, I got another email from HR that told me I should at least finish out the year, and not resign until 2022, and do those 4 12-hour days, so that my former co-workers could have the days off; and that it was wrong of me to ""betray my family"" like that.

Hello my fellow anti workers, forgive me for being long winded; but this rant is due. 

TLDR; I’m disabled, fell down at work; boss laughed at me. Walked off of the job after being there for over 12 hours, got fired, and HR isn’t your friend… especially when they are cheating with your supervisor. Never get talked into doing unpaid overtimes and working holidays due to your coworkers/supervisor inept skills. 

Well, I suppose this is going to be my first and longest post on reddit. To start things off, a little about me; I’m disabled, walk with a cane due to a limp (due to damage to my spinal cord), and I love working with and around computers. Networking, active directory and policy management, malware removal, penetration testing, network hardening, and even down to the nitty-gritty of building and repairing computers. Of course, I’m hard-headed… my disability never kept me from much, other than walking, and the doctors I was seeing at that time deemed me fit for a handicap placard. Yay! Thanks for the free parking, doc!

About 6 years ago, I was let go from a pretty bad situation. I was on the mend from spinal surgery and due to some bad filing of paperwork, I was left out of renewing disability income. I found a job immediately, It’s work I’ve previously done, managing data and records. The people who were supposed to be training me, didn’t want me there; they wanted their friends from other branches in there. So, a non renewal of contract and unemployment kept me searching for better opportunities. 

Fast forward to almost running out of unemployment, I finally found the job I was waiting for. It was simple enough, just basic run of the mill entry level support desk. Then I was told by this company, that the position wasn’t available anymore, and due to newer requirements the position was changed to network and system administrator; all of which matched my current abilities, and I was brought on board. The pay, of course, wasn’t great. 

I thought I’d stick it out for a year or two, learn a few things and grab a few certificates and be on my merry way to bigger and better things. 

Now, my dear readers if you are still paying attention; don’t ever be afraid to walk off of the job or refuse an offer after accepting it for any red flags. Realize this dear reader, moon-walk out of that situation for any red flag you see. 

The first red flag, hiring and not knowing the law. As I am on pain management medication, that can cause a false positive for pre-employment drug screenings, I let my employers know about this. It saves a massive headache, and they can fax my doctor’s office and verify that I’m taking pain management medication and for what purpose. The drug screening place they were contracted through didn’t accept the fact I was taking that medication, and left it off of the paperwork. 

Of course, I got a call back stating I failed the drug test… from there it was a 5 minute phone call with the only lady who worked in human resources and we will call her HR. HR said they would take it up with the board before they hire me. OF course, when one of the board members saw it, my reason for taking it, doctor’s notices, and all of the paperwork; I was told “I guess it ok that you take it, as you already explained your disability and need for that medication. And since you were honest with us, we are glad to have you on board.”

I have no idea how many laws were broken just at this moment in time, but I’m fairly certain quite a few were. 

I should have run for the hills at this point in time… even asking where I can park, as it was a “first come, first serve” parking, and I was scheduled for a later shift than anyone else, I had to park in the back. Management got to park near the front, but a person with a handicapped placard and obvious mobility difficulties was told to park in the back. When I confronted HR about this, I was told, “employees park in the back!”

Now, onto the second red flag, and the meat and potatoes of this story. I don’t live in a small city, by any stretch to the imagination. I would have to guess, there would be about 300,000 people living in and around the surrounding area including outside city limits. Of course, when dealing with small to medium sized businesses, a certain amount of cronyism and nepotism will start to develop. One of these cases was the brain dead IT worker, we will call him BD for short. 

BD was related to a board member, a few co-workers, and one of the senior management. BD did “well enough” on employee reviews, that they just got tired of him in one department and sent him to another department. This, after 15 years, landed him in IT. Did he know anything about IT? no. Did he know anything about computers? no. Did he know how to make a new plug for a network cable? Definitely not. Was he friends with his supervisor? Yes. With HR, Yes. Was he just there for the paycheck? Yes, and he stated this fact on several occasions. 

His major solution to everything was rebooting the computer. Reboot it until it either started working, or stopped working. Then, if that didn’t work, call someone else and offload work. Would he pay attention to what was going on at that point in time? Heck no. ESPN sports center on his phone was a much better option and had his fullest attention. Was there ever a point in time that he had to do any mandatory IT based training, H E double-hockey sticks to the naw. Why was he kept on board? He was my supervisor’s best friend. 

Of course, this being a small to medium sized company; people have to wear many different hats. Somehow, our department got merged with maintenance. Needless to say, we were an IT staff of 3; and somehow it became an army of me fixing problems all the time. 

Now, one of the main reasons I was brought onboard was to be the person who bridged a bunch of gaps in knowledge. …and a warm body to answer the phone and troubleshoot when everyone took vacations. Supervisor told me this, and I was given pretty much free range of anything and everything. Something needed to be implemented, do it. Something needed to be fixed, do it. Basically, over the course of 5 years; I was everyone’s first call for everything.

I was even doing jobs outside of my job description, and scanning in paperwork. I didn’t scan in much, because I was either at my desk doing remote assistance or off at a job site getting someone’s computer back online.

This happened due to a variety of reasons, I was always at my desk and answered my phone. Supervisor told me, “I have other important things to do”. BD IT guy was out half of the day, driving around and delivering supplies to various locations and other maintenance related duties. When a problem arouse at any location while he was there, he would work on it. Of course, you know how this went; “high school group project”, look busy and click the mouse on random areas of the desktop. When he couldn’t get it resolved, he would call me. On my off time, at doctor’s appointments, and at other random times when I was scheduled off; my phone would ring. 

This led to the catchphrase, “call the\_damned\_dan, he will know what to do”. Lightbulb broken, call the\_damned\_dan. Forget how to code in your door key code, call the\_damned\_dan. Forget your password for a website that I had no access to, call the\_damned\_dan. You get the picture. I was THE go to guy for everything. 

Due to poor maintenance, lack of migration cleanups and whatnot; there were always several ongoing issues. One of these issues was anti-virus management. My supervisor, in his infinite wisdom stated that we didn’t need any antivirus measures on any of our servers. “Only users can infect networks”. Of course, this led to a major outbreak and took many hours of resolving the issue before out network became virus free. I was told to lie to everyone about the ongoing issue as it “wasn’t major.” No idea if I broke the law at that point in time, but there was an unreported data breech; I was informed that no one need to know about it. 

Simply put, a bunch of cyber security protocols were never implemented, “because it was easier that way.” …this would come back to bite them in the butt.

At this point in time, I started to experience major burn out. I started having massive panic attacks due to lack of sleep and overwork. My pain levels were at an all-time high. I wanted to do the right thing, and bring it up to my supervisor that I needed help. Not just extra training, but a full set of extra hands. 

“Oh yeah” he said, “we get moved over to our new location, we are going to bring on a new IT Person.” 

Cool! Cool! Cool! I thought, then I asked, “So, will I be a supervisor?”

He replied, “no, we need to bring in a project manager.”

I asked, if this is something I’m already doing, and talking to vendors about ongoing issues and planning upgrades, why not promote me and hire another network administrator? 

He replied, “you’d never be qualified to do this in your lifetime.”

I snapped back at that point in time, “Wow, that struck a nerve.”

Needless to say, he retreated back in his office and shut the door for the remainder of the day. 

This was the 3rd and final, red flag. This isn’t baseball, there shouldn’t be three strikes. 

Now, I’m sure why everyone is asking themselves; why didn’t you make a complaint? It wouldn’t have mattered. There was grapevine talk of how my supervisor was having an affair with HR.

It was time to move on. I originally planned in 2020 to look for other opportunities, then covid hit. It hit our area hard. Since we do a lot of on site person to person transactions, a lot of our staff was hit. We were considered “essential workers”, and required to show up. Management remotes into work, and we had to show up. To say the situation was FUBAR’ed, is going beyond that descriptor. They allowed many to go maskless, and didn’t require staff to wear masks. They put everyone’s health and pay on the chopping block, except for their own.

We used to get annual raises, and semi annual bonuses. Since I was on a first name basis with a lot of fellow coworkers in accounting, they told me the management and board voted to stop pay-raises, and to halt new hires… for anyone below them. Since everyone was working half hours, and half-staffed at all our locations, this hit everyone hard. If it weren’t for the government bail-out checks, a lot of my co-workers would have defaulted on their mortgages and car payments. 

Of course, walk outs happened. And more new management staff was brought in, while everyone at our locations were short staffed. Management’s solution? FREE PIZZA! Potlucks! Also, during the hight of covid, to throw an extravagant Christmas party during the height of covid… that was quickly canceled when people saw covid was here to stay. 

Fast forwarding to a few weeks ago, a major ransomware hit us. It hit us hard, and fast. I put in the details on how to fix it to my boss and our vendor (his bestie) months before. I was told, “don’t worry about it, if you can’t get it fixed; we are going to be moving to the new location shortly. I need my vendor’s attention elsewhere.” This vendor, of course, handles our day to day firewall needs and updates. To say they were never done, is an overstatement. They were never done on time, and the licensing was always out of date. And of course, I never had access to the license to update any of our firewalls. 

I asked for help, I was told this was my own show. I had a previous writeup that stated I never asked for help. I was going to make sure that never happened again.

I worked tirelessly to fix this problem, constant scans, setting up a new antivirus server because the old one was corrupted. And was pulling 20 hour days for a week solid. At the end of the week, I collapsed while moving equipment right in front of my supervisor when he was drilling me about what was being done. 

The conversion is as follows, “Is everything scanning? What’s going on, how are they getting through.” 

“Yes,” I replied, “My current knowledge and understanding of the situation is that they are attacking though…”

WHAM, I hit the floor, HARD. My leg gave out due to stress, exhaustion, and overexertion. All while carrying a monitor to check some systems that ran headless (without a screen attached). 

My supervisor laughed at me. I asked, “Did you find my pain and suffering amusing? Am I a joke to you?”

He replied back, laughing, “No, it wasn’t that. You have no knowledge.”

I stayed there, for a few more hours, having started work at 3AM, I needed to be sure I covered my 8 hour shift. I messaged HR about the fall, stating I was going home, I was exhausted, and to ask my manager about it. 

Of course, I cried. Talked to my wife, aunt, cousin, mother in law, and great grand mother in law… and they told me to just make plans to leave. I had already have some interviews planned, and coming up; now was the perfect excuse to move on. My great grand mother in law told me, “son, I don’t want you working for someone as evil and hateful as that man; he wanted you to fall because that’s the only thing that brings him joy, other people’s misery.”

He never reported it, even denied existence of it happening.  

HR messaged me back, stating I was on paid administrative leave until the ongoing investigation was over. I was fired two weeks ago. Of course, they had to hire outside help to solve the issue. The vendor (supervisors bestie) helped and covered up his mistakes. Things finally got patched. I was blamed for the whole situation, even with the evidence stacked in my favor and my reports. 

Now, why did he deny it and HR never looked into it. I was told a while back, that HR Lady and Supervisor were having an affair. No one could really prove anything, except that it happened in one of our garages with a set of cameras only he monitored. They’d always take their breaks and lunches together, and would always “talk” with their offices doors shut. 

Now, I’m not the one to believe in conspiracy theories; until I caught a glimpse of her shade of lipstick on his shirt collar. 

In passing, I said, “nice shade of lipstick you got on there.” 

He replied back, nervous as hell, “Oh, that’s a cherry doughnut!” (He’s a hard core diet fanatic, and against bread and gluten) while quickly wiping it off of his lips. 

“Get it on your shirt collar there too, right by the ear Bub?” 

Needless to say, embarrassment was quickly shown upon his face. The shade of red he turned matched the shade of lipstick of HR. HR quickly walked away.

If it also weren’t for monitoring the content filter after a hardware failure, I would have never found my supervisor’s unblock for the website… HINT HINT, their motto was, “life is short, have an affair.” After that moment in time, I finally understood why he was “too busy” for any actual work. 

HR won’t save you kiddies, especially when they are having an affair with your supervisor. 

This job abused me, and wore me down; in mind, body and spirit. I kept having to cover for my supervisor’s and coworkers’s inability to solve problems. I worked unpaid overtime and holidays, and never got so much as a thank you. I never had time for hobbies unless I called in sick.

Life is WAY too short for people like this. Leave while you can, find some place that treats you right, take up a new hobby… or just go do nothing. When is the last time anyone bragged about doing that?  

Other than getting fired, and the tremendous amount of pain I have been in for the last two weeks; things are going better than they are before. My pain is back to a manageable state. I got accepted for the masters program at my first pick of school I applied to. My wife’s business has started kicking off into high gear. And, best of all; my energy levels have kicked into high gear; I finally got most of the small renovations done around the house. 

I hope everyone in r/antiwork is doing well, and remember; HR isn’t your friend, and never do more than you have to.",0.0,the_damned_dan,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/q5074h/bad_management_and_hr_this_long_rant_is_due/,6.0,1.0,16052,1184,www.reddit.com,joy,Negative,0.48040592670440674,0.0103610065,anger,Negative,0.9391140341758728,0.007499187

I worked directly for the President of a small business. A woman had been interviewed and admitted honestly she was leaving her last job due to issues of sexual harassment. She had not left the job yet, but was actively searching and trying to get out. My boss says to me, ""Why would anyone stay at a job like that?"" Implying there was something wrong with her judgement. He followed up with, ""I mean, I think everyone gets a do over. You just leave a place like that and act like it never happened."" 

I was dumbfounded that he didn't understand that not everyone had a rich dad to fall back on (like him) and could just walk away as a ""do over"" because there were bills to pay. Or also not understanding that toxic environments have impacts beyond the time people are in them. Or also not thinking that maybe that bad workplace should address its issues so people don't need a do over.

Needless to say, he was absolutely toxic himself, I was sexually harassed by multiple people in the company including him and I was honestly lucky enough to find a job fairly quickly when I had to go for my own sanity. 

But reading these antiwork posts makes me feel like we've got a societal ""do over"" possibly happening. But one that can change the nature of the game instead of just acting like it never happened.

The purpose of that post was to empower others to not end
up like this particular candidate. | want people to know their
worth. | made that post at the risk of my job because it’s not
right that many don't know what their skill are worth.

| learned a lot from my recent post. | understand and now
feel how my post made a lot of people feel, especially the
candidate that was directly impacted by my choice. It
doesn't feel good and this should have gone differently. The
deserves to be paid what she's worth from the company
despite what she thinks the job responsibilities are worth.

While this is common practice in the hiring space, it should
not have been a public learning experience, but an internal
one.

| hope for some it was a message about worth, but | don’t
take lightly the salary disparities that happen in
corporations. It is not to be made light of. While that was not
my intent, | have to acknowledge the impact of my
statement.

| hope to one day be able to help candidates be aware of the
salary ranges they should ask for before it ends with another
45K difference in pay.

I'm optimistic that you will see my heart and know | meant
no harm.

I'm not a risk take, but | took this risk for another person. |
don't know what race this candidate is, All | know is that this
candidate didn't realize that they were worth so much more.

It's a college town and really there isn't THAT much money here to make. You end up just leaving off to cities 2 hours in either direction on the highway to find ANY kind of decent jobs. To keep this brief, computer science from your standard higher educational institutions are a rip off. Now a days with tuition being what it is and with the nature of how mathematic thought works, you really are better off just teaching yourself. It's really not that bad and currently, I'm on dynamic programming algorithms and getting a bit closer to finishing my own studies on discrete mathematics. Didn't get there just out of the blue but I am ALOT better now than when I started. All that said and done though, I need work and this is where I'm gonna have to nod to everyone on this sub for. 

The work over here is such bull shit. It is a suburb where the precious decent jobs you would expect are just not that frequent and easy to find. Competition here for them is a bit ridiculous to say the least. So you end up taking what is available, which are really just three things... trades (this is really not a stable as people say they are nor do they pay well), retail (fucking horror stories just from mid to lower management all included... customers can mostly be hit or miss), and restaurants.... don't get me started on these... they are NOT worth your time and everyone reading this knows it.

All three in this college town just do not offer much in terms of stability alone. You end up seeing some really shady shit all over the place. They know that with the three colleges here in the area that there are plenty of people to choose from. As such, you're treated like complete shit. You are disposable and you need to keep being reminded of this somehow. 

The pay is even worse. There's a surprising amount that are actually lower than 15 dollars an hour. It might be the mid west, but the fact is... this really isn't THAT comfortable. Combine this with no benefits and keeping you part time, it's a no brainer there are plenty of people just not willing to put up with this. 

I'm one of them and lately I've been searching real hard to just find some easy desk job to get away from them while I keep studying for the inevitable career change. I'm going to be starting my own projects real soon. Once I'm out of this town, I am going to kiss these jobs good bye for good.",0.0,bigbosskennykenken,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/q9qlr3/this_sub_might_like_my_own_take_on_how_work_is/,4.0,1.0,2481,258,www.reddit.com,joy,Negative,0.619681179523468,0.51307994,anger,Neutral,0.5349043011665344,0.001443239
881,qn0r79,"https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qn0r79/just_quit_or_demand_more_money/%27,",6,Just quit or demand more money.,"This is why you should always negotiate better salary or leave if you believe you are not getting paid enough. Never work for free.

Let this sink in. The average wage in the year 2000 was $42,000 a year. Today that equates to $70,000 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but the average wage today is $50,000 a year. 

At the same time the corporate tax rate was cut by 40% for any company generating over $100,000 a year and more than 10% of all Fortune 500 companies did not pay a single penny in taxes. Now, the S&amp;P 500 Index, ETF tracking the leading 500 companies in their sector that have been hand picked by the S&amp;P Committie, has returned a staggering 103.05% since the COVID crash lows and 40% from pre-covid prices. So by any metric on Wall Street companies haven’t gotten less profitable since the pandemic.

Many people wear “paying their dues” as a badge of honor and companies love it. Why do companies love when workers are willing to go above and beyond? Because workers are doing work outside of their pay scale at a lower rate or in many cases for free. If you work for free then you are only hurting yourself and your coworkers because it becomes an expectation that you will work more for less money. If you produce for a company you should be compensated for it. 

If you are a junior developer or engineer doing the work of a senior or mid level engineer, you should demand more money within reason. Show case your talent and strive to be better everyday, and if you are then you are worth more. So do not settle for lower compensation. If the company cannot afford it then they do not deserve your talent or the effort you put in to reach the higher level. If they refuse to pay you a higher salary then focus your efforts on improving yourself and look for other opportunities while doing the work you are paid to do. 

If a company cannot produce because you did not work extra hours or have to go above and beyond then that is an issue with the company and their business mode or ability to handle projects. If executives are paid 900% times higher than the average employee they should be able to come up with a solution.",0.0,Mysterious----,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qn0r79/just_quit_or_demand_more_money/,2.0,1.0,2165,211,www.reddit.com,joy,Negative,0.8006464242935181,0.00086984923,anger,Neutral,0.4851117730140686,0.005483023
882,qqfpot,"https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qqfpot/working_after_graduation/%27,",5,Working after graduation,"Hello, first post from me on here but I need your help.

- So a couple of months ago I graduated uni in the Netherlands following a communication course (mostly focused on social media and content creation for me specifically)

But since I haven't found a job yet. I'm currently working which was my normal Saturday morning job for 4 days a week (luckily am able to have a few days off every week), in a greenhouse doing the regular stuff really.

Now it's not that this job is hard, tough or mentally draining, it's just that this isn't what I studied for 4 years or even come close to the working space I want to be in.

Recently, I've been noticing some things that I've noticed on this subreddit too. People hating Sundays cause they know they have to go back to work again the next day, feeling like you are just a tiny part of a company that you don't even like all that much. I've been feeling these sorts of things coming up more regularly and it's quite depressive to be honest, it genuinely can put me down even though I try to be as positive as possible.

- I've been applying for jobs for a while now and have send out many job applications with no real luck (all ask for work experience which I can't have if no one accepts me for having no work experience)

- So on the side, apart from working at my current job in the greenhouse, I have a big following (+100k) on social media (sorry for bragging) as I give tips regarding the game 'FIFA'. I also do YouTube where I earn very little (but just do it more for fun) and I don't earn anything on Twitter &amp; Instagram

- So I'm kind of in a position where I don't really know what to do:

1. Keep doing what I'm currently doing, working at my current job for most days, getting a decent pay check and do small things regarding my current social media following and hope a job application gets accepted one day
2. Quit this job and try to create a living of this social media thing (via selling an eBook for example, posting more youtube videos)
3. Create new ways of expressing my social media following to maybe 'stand out' more to eventually get a full-time job in the social media world (specifically would prefer to work in the sports world)
4. Maybe extend the work space that I want to work in (so not only say that I want to work in the sports world but maybe start off in another world where I can still focus on social media and creating content)
5. Try and do freelance stuff regarding social media and content creation and slowly leave my current job

For context: I'm 21 (almost 22) years old and still live with my parents.

I know this is a very broad question, but I'd just like to know if any of you have tips/advice for me on what I can do to potentially leave my current job and somehow start working in a space that I want)",0.0,FifaCMTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qqfpot/working_after_graduation/,0.0,1.0,2806,262,www.reddit.com,sadness,Neutral,0.39129701256752014,0.021480637,anger,Neutral,0.7225701212882996,0.00038268682

I come to find out that I don’t keep those tips that I make through the shift and make an hourly wage (I was aware I would be making the wage when I first started) and the hours I work is what I earn.

I am on mobile so formatting and spelling can be funny. I have been so stressed about this situation that I am losing clumps of hair. Was told this is the place to rant about it.

I am a healthcare worker specializing in COVID in a major hospital. Originally I was on lend from my OE (Original Employer) to NE (New Employer) to work in their COVID program, but then OE shut down my department as cost saving measure. NE decided to hire me to do the job I was already doing as I was 1 person doing 3 people’s job. The director at program (PD) was so afraid of me leaving that he offered a substantial pay increase, justifying the job I’ve done and am doing. Even admitting that the program wouldn’t run without me because I was the contact person for EVERYTHING. OE verbally promised me that as part of compensation for closing my department, they will pay me as long as it took for me to transition to NE.

They probably didn’t think it would still be ongoing half a year later.

NE’s HR took 3 months to even acknowledge my position and weeks insisting that I belong to a lower pay grade, about 7k lower than what was initially offered. PD send letter after letter informing of their mistake and how they got my title wrong and that the pay that was offered was justified. But not only does HR refuse to rectify the mistake, they threaten that if we insist on having all the ducks in order, it will set back the hire another 12 weeks to ‘maybe’ have a different outcome. By this time everyone from my old department has been transitioned to a new position, even my old supervisors. 

As the new year came and went, someone at OE took me off the payroll (probably thinking I’m already transitioned) despite me working remote for the 2 weeks I was originally supposed to be on vacation because the program couldn’t handle me being out for that long. 

Due to how OE’s payroll worked, I found the discrepancy half way into the second pay period and now in the middle of the third trying to 1) get my pay and 2) living on peanuts and not able to pay rent. While OE is aware of the hardship, they are more interested in arguing with NE over who is supposed to pay me for the work I am doing. I cannot go anywhere else because no one in the area will pay as well (even with the pay cut) as these two organizations for the work I am doing. 

At this point I am so mentally and physically exhausted that patients and their families are noticing. I am writing this during shift because I am in tears after HR’s latest ‘we don’t care’ email. I just need to share this with someone that I hope can understand. And I am sorry if I can’t reply, work is stressful and I have no energy after my shift to even talk to my partner. I just sleep until the next shift.

Please don’t share this story anywhere else, the last thing I need is for my patients to worry about their clinical staff instead of themselves.",0.0,DippyDottyDo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/s71d9d/my_job_has_been_in_limbo_for_more_than_6_months/,0.0,1.0,3066,299,www.reddit.com,fear,Negative,0.5340004563331604,0.0009904942,anger,Negative,0.9013487696647644,0.0009864199

YouTube: the Michael Brooks (RIP) show episodes with Richard Wolff. He has a whole playlist on the Theory of Socialism that I think is invaluable. 

The ABC’s of Dialectical Materialism by Leon Trotsky talks about materialism itself which is insightful about our relationship to the world.

A People’s Guide to Capitalism by Hadas Thier. 

Adolph Reed, who also has interviews with Michael Brooks and lots of YouTube videos and discusses the intersections of race and capitalism.

Socialism, Seriously which is an easy read about a reimagined world. 


I could go on, and please DM if you’re interested in this stuff and want to discuss it or more book reccs, but I just wanted to share. We’re realizing our power and our further understanding only builds it more. Even if you don’t desire to become a Marxist, the more we are honest about how our world works the better we can change it.

I will start with what i feel is obligatory, i am a general manager, but i read all of this and take in everything you all say and 100% agree with so much that is said. I try treat my employees with respect as i am no better than them, i just have a title in the work place. 

My view on how employment should work i feel fits this sub. 

Every employee should get a share of the profits of the company they work for, say 30%.

This of course is after tax, the fat cats at the top still make bank, but the little guys that break their backs, miss their childrens events and milestones, miss family dinners, cant go on holidays every 6 months, literally work themselves to death so the fat cats can buy a new car every year and take the family away first class on numerous holidays. 

It would make the employees

1. Want to come to work

2. Make sure the business is making as much money as possible

3. Keep customers happy (except Karen she can fuck off)

4. Able to afford basics in life and som

5. Tax revenue would increase as these are the people that go out and spend it, not ship it off to a tax haven

Then maybe america could join us in universal healthcare and we can all enjoy a comfortable life

Also, any money you make is met with ‘income tax’ like that’s the most discouraging thing in human history. Like what is the incentive to work harder when the government will just take more money. And for what? Teachers are underpaid and textbooks are over 20 years old. College is overpriced also, and most people end up paying off more debt than making money off of the degree they got. It’s not just the money aspect, it’s also social. Who wants to live in such a shit society? School shootings, riots, drugs, and hate.

Back when I was in college, I was struggling to make ends meet, and set out to try to find a job to hold me over until I graduated.  I ended up finding what seemed like the perfect job at the time, working as a web developer (this was my area of study) for a small .NET web shop making websites for various clients.

It was a small company, only having 6 total employees (including myself), and it only paid minimum wage, but it did have the additional benefit of year-end profit sharing (this is important).  I didn't really care about the pay at the time, as I was still in college and this was just a temporary thing until I graduated, so I happily accepted.

The first year I was there, we cranked out many websites for quite a few clients, and ended up making somewhere around $200,000 in profit by the end of the year for the company.  By this point I had honestly forgotten about the profit sharing benefit, that is until we had our year-end dinner.

The owner of the company took all of us out to a really fancy restaurant on his dime (somewhere to the tune of $1,200 for the 6 of us), and then gave us all envelopes.  Inside was the profit sharing bonus for the year: a check for a staggering $12,500.

I was absolutely blown away.  It was more money that I'd ever seen in my life at once right there.

Well, the next year, with the newfound profit sharing motivation, we busted our asses cranking out high-profile client websites one after another.  We did everything we could to make as many sales as possible, even coming in weekends just to finish a large project.

By the end of the year, it was still the same 6 employees, and we saw we had made just over $850,000 in profit that year.

Needless to say, we were all expecting a massive bonus that year.

The year-end dinner rolls around, and we gather at the fancy restaurant.  Boss rolls up in a freaking Aston Martin.  We're all looking at each other like ""holy shit, this is gonna be huge.""

We eat, drink, and are quite merry.  And then the owner stands up and pulls out 6 envelopes.

Boss: ""Because we did so well this year, I've decided it's time to expand the company.  We will be opening a new location in New York City."" (Note: we were about 1200 miles away from New York)

Boss: ""So, because of this, there isn't much profit to share out this year.""

He then hands us our envelopes, containing a $50 VISA gift card each.

I don't remember much of the rest of the evening as it was clouded with rage.

The following Monday, I put in my 2 weeks notice.  The other 4 co-workers did the same over the next couple months.

I'll never forget his face when I handed him my resignation.  He was legitimately confused why I would ever do that.

I ended up finding a new job that paid almost 4x as much within a week.

That company went out of business about a year later.  I wonder why?",0.0,CartoonistNo6669,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sf318k/no_profit_sharing_ok_no_profit/,0.0,1.0,2930,292,www.reddit.com,anger,Negative,0.43952441215515137,0.22233376,joy,Positive,0.6760639548301697,0.0005187473

So my story is the follow: I'm a Journalist, that's my dream job since i was a kid, now I'm 30. I did all the usual step by step progress most of us do: started writing on blogs during University while doing some paper job on the side of studying. 5 years ago a local TV contacted me to work with them. Keep in mind I'm talking about a region where there are very few local news outlet (2 journals, 2 television and 2 online journals). I've worked for them for the last 5 years EXCEPT I don't technically ""work for them"" because I was never hired instead I work as a freelancer. That means no paid vacation no sick leave of course and I also have to pay my own Job related taxes. I kept my head down and worked my ass off thinking at some point they will hire me but, despite several promises in that regard, nothing ever happened and the pandemic hit gave the Manager another good excuse to postpone my hiring. Fast forward to Fall 2021 and on an unrelated matter the Journalist Union put a focus on the situation on the Company and noticed my unusual and unlawful working agreement. So the Company, scared about a lawsuit, put me on hold from work until my situation was normalized. I've been out of work since the start of november and now, after a month, they finally made me a contract offer which is honestly ridicolous: basically 1100 Euros per month for 36 hours a week and for 18 months only. The union told me not to accept and to sue the company saying I could get as much as 100k from a cause they say I'm pretty much guaranteed to win. The problem of suing is of course I would need to find another place to work and, as mentioned above there are not a lot of those here in my region and I would not want to move.
So I'm basically fucked either i accept an offer way below my worth or I go to trial with the company and remain unemployed. I honestly don't know what I'm going to end up doing and would love some feedback.

I precise this was a point of view completely unrelated to depression and that I think that even when I'm okay. When I'm depressive, it's because this world is offering nothing aside eternal work. Saying that in order to avoid idiot linking antiwork to depression. Work is depression.

""The whole bid for submission by current managerial values is based on almost one mistake: the confusion between working and fulfilling one's potential""
Have it something right ? I'm speaking of course about the social way we are seeing work. In the way work as it is socially understood, is really one dimensionnal, like if somewhat every competency that humanity was able was separated in each individual, impacting view of life of each. We are always referencing to the quote ""work is tripalium"" and stuff in social term. Imo it's at least currently (while not in IA society :) ) a false idea to modify work, because while there is a hierarchy/domination, even from outside workforce (government manage work activities while work hierarchie = smooth/flat), there will be always some form of resistance finishing with creating new morality, new idea, and cutting off what work are mean to do : producing for surviving as a species.
Accomplishing your potential mean you use actually fun, you use imagination, you use discipline, you use your emotions, you use self control, you use your ability to introspect, you use your memory, perhaps ultimately a excellent work would be one that reflect the most the life wich all are actually living, meaning you have to use your memory in a global way, not being limited by artificial rule we are creating. A real work have part of actually not working, and not being managed for not working as it happen in homosexual company in silicon valley.
Isn't it a problem for those who are seeking actual accomplishment ? I don't mean forcibly extra uppa uda mega accomplishment, just for the stuff itself. There is ppl wich are actually working better in choosen activities / in hobby mode. Aren't you more concentrated in this place than in work ? I'm not saying that writing in reddit is a higher accomplishment than your work, probably not if you are in IT for example, but writing here require more completeness than doing 1 repetitive task for all the month there another one then another one...
The main problem with trying to submit ppl with moral (like in our typical managemental way of seeing the work world) is that it end with devaluing moral itself more than being in a complying/not complying problem",0.0,noaydi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/7ozd27/the_whole_bid_for_submission_by_current/,4.0,8.0,2770,263,www.reddit.com,joy,Negative,0.47710371017456055,0.10060358,anger,Negative,0.8009651303291321,0.00042898164

I'm 27 and I've noticed this phenomenon hugely among my age group ie. kids of the 2000's.

It's super rare now to find someone who has a really unique sense of style/personality and a niche hobby to go with it. I mean the types of hobbies that cost a lot of time of time, resources and effort, not just ""watching Netflix"" or other things that pretty much everyone is into like cooking or reading. I mean people who really go batshit for their hobbies, attend meetups, have a whole room/garage dedicated to it, spend all of their spare money on it. 

It's like we're pretty much the first generation in recent times that has not only been forced to work our guts out but have also been forced into never doing anything outside of studying/working because its a ""waste of time"". I feel like like SO many of us never got to develop those weird niche interests, and as well as not being allowed to have the interest, we're also not allowed to buy anything for it because that's a ""waste of money"" (and we probably can't afford it anyway). We're all so similar and boring, living the most basic lives in survival mode. I know a lot of it is to do with technology taking over but it seems that people from older generations are better able to utilise technology as a bonus extra to add to their life rather than it ruling their entire existence. 

I notice that a lot of 80's/90's peeps have really cool personalities and interests they've been able to develop and refine over the years. I used to think it was a time/maturity thing but the more I contemplate it about it, I really don't think so. I think it's a time, resources and attitude issue. I'm considered to be approximately the same success level as my cousins who are half a generation older, yet they have way more time and money to do cool shit. We are having kids later and later, why don't we have anything fun to do?! 

For the record, I do have hobbies and interests, I've just never really leaned into them fully. I feel like I've been brainwashed into thinking that doing anything cool or fun for myself is somehow greedy, consumerist. Buying things for my hobbies gives me a gross feeling. Why is this? And don't get me started on Minimalism. That's just another stupid idea that's been fed to us to make us want less out of life and make us settle for the bare minimum.",0.0,vibrantgray,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ni8jv5/anyone_else_in_their_late_20s_early_30s_feel_like/,14.0,1.0,2437,246,www.reddit.com,joy,Negative,0.48736169934272766,0.008890922,sadness,Negative,0.8715236783027649,0.0010529116

For 10 hours it is painful and puts so much emotional strain on me that I cant help but cry sometimes. Its meaningless and a waste of my time but i dont have a job in my actualu career yet so im stuck here. This job can literally be replaced with machines if they ever decide to build them to this role. Sometimes i wonder if its even worth it sometimes. Not just this job but all, like this world is so fucked bc of money. 

Idk does anyone have any advice on what I should do to? Whether its life choices or to stay mentally sane

I'm new to this sub but glad to be here. I went on furlough last May, was full laid off in October and have just now gone back to a new job. I'm in the second week and already having panic attacks every night. I spent a whole year being awake until I was tired, sleeping until I was rested, and loving according to my own rhythms. Trying to adjust back to their clock and being held accountable to someone else's idea of productivity has me seriously depressed. 

I keep thinking of that quote from Office Space, ""yesterday I did absolutely nothing and it was everything I thought it could be."" 

I just don't know how I'm going get back to the grind. I keep thinking of how I did it all those years, and all I can remember is trying to constantly outrun the impending doom if I don't continue to earn money. I also remember I would spend a lot of time daydreaming about a life without work.

Anyway, thanks for letting me vent.",0.0,MegaKman215,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nkfni3/back_to_work_after_more_than_year/,2.0,1.0,933,120,www.reddit.com,sadness,Negative,0.4265991747379303,0.0007048884,sadness,Neutral,0.5268874764442444,0.0013558296

inspired, and an awful seller,
what ultimately led him to the ax was
his insistence on boundaries.

He would come into the office at nine
every morning, leave at five, and be
inaccessible daytime before and
after. Regardless of deadline or
passion projects, his worldly was
determined not by his work, but by
his hours.

The core of this idea is that all persons, regardless of whether they work or not, shall have the unconditional right not to starve &amp; not to be w/o shelter."" - Erich Fromm [x-post]","Many of the evils of present-day capitalist and communist societies would disappear with the introduction of a guaranteed yearly income. The core of this idea is that all persons, regardless of whether they work or not, shall have the unconditional right not to starve and not to be without shelter. They shall receive not more than is basically required to sustain themselves—but neither shall they receive less. This right expresses a new concept for today, though a very old norm, demanded by Christianity and practiced in many ""primitive"" tribes, that human beings have an unconditional right to live, regardless of whether they do their ""duty to society."" It is a right we guarantee to our pets, but not to our fellow beings.
The realm of personal freedom would be tremendously enlarged by such a law; no person who is economically dependent on another (e.g., on a parent, husband, boss) could any longer be forced to submit to the blackmail of starvation; gifted persons wanting to prepare for a different life could do so provided they were willing to make the sacrifice of living in a degree of poverty for a time. Modern welfare states have accepted this principle—almost... which actually means ""not really."" A bureaucracy still ""administers"" the people, still controls and humiliates them. But a guaranteed income would require no ""proof"" of need for any person to get a simple room and a minimum of food. Thus no bureaucracy would be needed to administer a welfare program with its inherent waste and its violations of human dignity.
The guaranteed yearly income would ensure real freedom and independence. For that reason, it is unacceptable to any system based on exploitation and control, particularly the various forms of dictatorship. It is characteristic of the Soviet system that even suggestions for the simplest forms of free goods (for example, free public transportation or free milk) have been consistently rejected. Free medical service is the exception, but only apparently so, since here the free service is in response to a clear condition: one must be sick to receive it.
Considering the present-day cost of running a large welfare bureaucracy, the cost of treating physical, especially psychosomatic, illnesses, criminality, and drug addiction (all of which are largely forms of protest against coercion and boredom), it seems likely that the cost of providing any person who wanted it with a guaranteed annual income would be less than that of our present system of social welfare. The idea will appear unfeasible or dangerous to those who believe that ""people are basically lazy by nature."" This cliché has no basis in fact, however; it is simply a slogan that serves as a rationalization for the resistance against surrendering the sense of power over those who are helpless.
That was an excerpt from the book ""To Have or To Be"" by [Erich Fromm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Fromm), a 20th century psychoanalyst, social thinker and humanist noted for his critical dissection of what he considered to be many of the social ills of contemporary society. I highly recommend the book to everyone in this sub [originally posted in r/basicincome and r/futurology, but I would also recommend it to people in this sub] - much of his writings can even be found online, and his [interviews](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=erich+fromm) can be found on youtube.",0.0,joonuts,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/6ch11e/many_of_the_evils_of_presentday_capitalist_and/,3.0,28.0,3403,307,www.reddit.com,anger,Negative,0.5216659307479858,0.0028727164,joy,Negative,0.4789051115512848,0.00075503596
