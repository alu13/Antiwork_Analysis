0,World listing informations,"Hello here,

I was thinking it could be a great idea we share together some informations to understand and help each other for better understand ourselves and our systems.

A template (you can improve it)

- country:
- minimum wage:
- full time a week:
- holidays:
- legal benefits:
- unemployment insurance:
- Government help:
- coffee price outside:
- housing prices:

I'll try:

- country: France
- minimum wage: 10,15€/h
- full time a week: 35 hours.
- holidays: 2,5 days holidays earned for one month worked full time, 30 days/year

- legal benefits:

1- if you take public transport, employee pays 50%, employers 50%. If other options (car) employers give you some money to compensate (not so much I think), don't know for other transport (bike, etc.)
2- if you work more than 35h/week, you earn 25 % more for the 8 first extra hours, 50% after and/or some extra holidays.
3- some private companies give food check, insurance (well in fact, you pay a percentage, but employers percentage part is higher)

- unemployment insurance:

if you worked more than 6 months in the past 2 years, and if you lose your job, you'll have unemployment income for quite same period (eg. You worked a year, you have a year unemployment insurance) with a 2 years limit (if you worked 5 years and lose you job, you'll have only 2 years unemployment insurance).

- government help:

If you have more than 25 years and have few or no resources, you can have little help from government (564,78€). Also, a lot of other government help can be obtained depends on your situation (handicap, retreat, if you have childrens, for your housing, etc).

- coffee price outside: around 3€ depending the coffee

- housing prices: depending town. Paris is too expensive. For a medium city, it's possible to find a studio for ~400€.",False,jjy4mu,bakura693,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jjy4mu/world_listing_informations/,3,1

3,"""Working"" is slavery, and to say it's anything else is propaganda","What exactly makes slavery so bad? Sure, violence, but mainly the lack of control, lack of freedoms, lack of the option to do else. You're stuck doing whatever someone tells you to do under the threat of not being able to eat or have a roof over your head. Saying work isn't like slavery is pretty much equivalent to saying ""slave owners who don't beat their slaves were perfectly fine"". Your freedoms are still being majorly infringed on, in most cases 60% of your time will be dedicated not to what you want to do, but making money for some rich guy who doesn't even fucking need the money nor give a single fuck about you. You produce more value and work harder than they ever will, yet they will make 100x more than you. This is not okay, this system needs to be completely demolished, ceo's should be limited to only making something like double what their workers make , and the majority of profits should be used to increase wages of EVERYONE, not just the owners. That way everyone can prosper and not just the dickheads who own it and don't do shit to help.",False,jjduel,spitfire104,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jjduel/working_is_slavery_and_to_say_its_anything_else/,14,1
4,What a wake-up call: A rant,"I always knew managers were shit. I've only been working 10 months but I've already learned so much about how dreadful the working world is. However, every now and then something will happen that really brings it all home. 

I am an apprentice in the NHS. My apprenticeship is a dual one so I was supposed to spend half the year in Clinical Coding and half the year in archiving, but due to Covid and the fact the manager needed me more in Coding, I spent 8 months there. I really wanted to be a Clinical Coder, it's a fascinating job that suits my skill set and introverted personality. I applied for an opening in March and was told that, while my application was excellent, I just missed out on an interview. I felt this was fair enough as the job did require medical knowledge and while I felt I covered this well in the application, I was all too aware that anyone with a medical background would easily beat me out.

I moved to archiving in August and a couple of weeks ago another vacancy popped up (I should stress both vacancies were for two positions but were posted as one). I immediately applied and was more confident about my chances given that I had been working with patient case notes for a near constant and daily basis and had picked up more knowledge of anatomical terms, as well as a general knowledge of how patient case notes are structured. The other apprentice in the office also applied. She has been at the Trust for three months and is applying for everything, regardless of her level of interest.

Yesterday she was studying in the library for her apprenticeship and emailed me asking me about the fact that there is an anatomical test as part of the interview. I immediately checked my personal email and found that I had not been successful. 

To say I was devastated is an understatement. I was fucking mortified, I have never felt quite so humiliated. A 20 year old who has 3 months of experience working at the Trust got an interview for a job in a department in which I had worked. My manager had made a comment to another high-ranking employee, who is lovely and supportive, that ""It was a shame I hadn't been at the Trust longer. I have been an employee there for 10 months and previous to that volunteered since July of last year.

I talked to the lovely employee and she had sent an email to the manager who claimed that my medical experience was lax. The other apprentice mentioned she had a GCSE in biology. I said the same and included the previous patient case note experience. 

I worked my ass off in that department. I hated that job and constantly stressed about it, I threw up twice before work because of anxiety. I only worked so hard because I wanted to make a good impression and felt that I had. I used to sweat constantly because of the heavy physical element of the job and the stress of dealing with difficult, bitchy secretaries. 

I always knew managers were shit but every now and then something happens that brings it home. This is an example of that. I know, I'm an idiot. I know, I'm naive. I wanted out of work since day one, but I really was foolish enough to think that my manager had a high enough opinion of me to not pull a bullshit stunt like this. I'm boo boo the fool, and my manager is a cunt.",False,jjthdq,onelongsigh94,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jjthdq/what_a_wakeup_call_a_rant/,8,1

6,"My ""dream"" job","I just wanted to say for the last 6 months, I think I've finally achieved my dream ""job"", High stakes poker taking money from rich CEO's that don't deserve it. I finally found an answer that allows me to not work and I've never felt better. Every ""job"" I've ever had I've been extremely depressed, anxious, and never making enough money for anything more than rice and beans. Every car bill my livelihood was at risk, my diet was ramen, rice, and beans, I couldn't afford new clothes, you know, the usual things someone with a full-time job should be dealing with /s. But now I feel liberated, poker is a hobby so it's never forced, and i have time to do things I'd actually like to do. I just hope this lasts, and that the game doesn't get much harder than it is currently, still worried about my future in that regard, but for now, and for ONCE, I'm proud to say I'm finally happy.",False,jjlz3y,spitfire104,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jjlz3y/my_dream_job/,4,1
7,STOP EXPLOITING ME,"I'm so fucking fed up. Back in March two of my superiors were fired, and believe it or not, I got their responsibilities but not their pay! I had noooo clue what I was doing, the two were lawyers in foreign jurisdictions so I was googling endlessly how to do the job. I had to speak with foreign authorities constantly to get everything right. I wasn't trained and I'm not a lawyer! My boss KEPT carrot dangling, saying if I show what I've got I can be promoted!! Fastforward to now when the promotion is due, and you guessed it. A lovely performance review sesh saying I'm too slow at all the extra, unfamiliar stuff I'm doing (ontop of my actual tasks). Lol. So someone will be hired in above me. And I lose out. So great. You got me to do the job of two lawyers for cheap for MONTHS, you exploited me, and now you're taking away the reward you promised for the effort.

I'm so glad I have extremely low expectations of ALL employers already, it doesn't shock me, I'm just bitterly confirmed in my antiwork views. I'm OK with labor and I take pride in my work, but why do you \*exploit\* me? Why do I deserve these lies and being misled? Why get as much out of me for as little as possible?

10,Conditional Cash Transfers,"So in Brazil, they have these things called ""conditional cash transfers,"" which are small sums of money given to indigent community members. In return, the state requires the receiver of the funds to keep their children in school, which has helped Brazil achieve higher educational attainment rates. The increased likelihood of a child finishing school results in a better workforce that has generated economic growth. I often hear how social assistance is only used by drug users and lazy people.

11,So tired...,"So today my manager comes over to my office and starts telling me that I need to prepare some samples to ship to a client. He doesn't even give me a chance to get a pen and paper before he starts talking. I asked him to repeat it because there was people speaking behind him as well. He starts saying that I never pay attention and that I don't listen and whatever. I asked him to either write down what he was saying or to just send me an email with the information and he keeps going that I'm not paying attention. Later, I went to his office with a pen and some paper to ask him exactly what he needs me to put together. He goes back to saying that I don't pay attention and that I don't collaborate and essentially telling me that I'm not good enough.

I've been struggling with this place since I started working there. The only reason (well, besides covid) that I'm still there is that it kind of works because my rent is not very high and I can walk to work.

In this situation, it’s not unreasonable to assume that they get away with this here and will start to believe (if they haven’t already) that this is acceptable in all other parts of their lives as well, that everybody around them is just totally beholden to their mood swings or judgmental actions.

29,The current labor model for most people just isn't going to work for much longer,"In econ 101 the first thing you learn is supply and demand.

If you know that then you will already get what I'm saying.

Firstly the supply of labour is constantly going up because we are having more and more people. A far greater proportion of people have been given the training to do many jobs now. Thanks to globalization, labour from places in east europe, asia and africa are now accessible.   

Yet the demand for human labour is either relatively static or is going to go down thanks to automation. A lot of jobs are going to be replaced by technology. And before you go what about all the new job created, is it enough to keep up with the growing supply of labour? Do those jobs involve highly technical knowledge like coding which is hard to teach to people who do manual labour? 

So the supply of human workers go up but the demand for them remains the same or goes down. Thats basically means our bargaining power is going down the drain here. Doesn't help that many SMEs are being eaten up by the megacorps.

People complain that firms like amazon abuse the workers by paying them little, overworking them, keeping them in fear etc. But amazon can just go, if you don't like then leave coz I can easily get someone else who probably asks for less pay and whines less. 

Its basically a race to the bottom here. And it isn't getting better. People blame Covid 19 but this problem has been taking place for a long time and soon it will it will be too much and too late.",False,jkazrk,Throwawayacct1015,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jkazrk/the_current_labor_model_for_most_people_just_isnt/,9,1

35,"I'm 19, now 1 year unemployed and have almost never worked in my life. And I don't want to.","I feel depressed as soon as I get into the 8 hour (or rather 10 hour with public transportation) shift. I just can't take it. I finally ""snapped"" in my 13. year in school, after I had to wake up at 5:00 o'clock only to come back at 16:30 o'clock and I (or rather, the class) get threatened in school to get kicked out for poor performance. The first one was kicked out after 2 weeks when school started. I would be the next. I just couldn't take that shit.

So all I have now is a school certification which leaves me with 2nd best grade in Politics, Physical education, English. Which is pretty much useless to get an apprenticeship. Because I have the 3rd worst grade in German and 2nd worst grade in Maths. 

So all what is left are physically demanding jobs (cashier-grocerystocker) and/or customer service. And I can't do them. I'm a little bit underaverage in muscle strength as a men and I'm too annoyed by customer service. It builds up and I become angry at them.

And besides that I probably have a low chance of even having a job long-term, it's not like I want to work.  Maybe 3-4 hours a day. But if more than that is taken away, I feel like what's the point of living.

I'm having an existential depression since I'm 14, because I realized how the system works. At least how school worked. Of course later I was able to research what was actually this rotten system that is called capitalism. 

So right now I feel somewhat happy, as long as I read interesting books, watch interesting shows, do walks and a few other small things I currently try to experiment on.

But as soon as I'm forced back into that 8 hour shift, I know I will be so depressed I would probably contemplate doing something bad.

And the worst thing? If I go to my doctor now to get sent to a qualified doctor/psychologist(?), he will only try to talk me out of it and/or fill me with drugs. There's no way in hell I'll get social assistance in this country, they made the hurdle too high and they even try manipulative tactics like wrong symptoms on questionaire about depression in health care. 

And don't come with the ""you're the young"" thing like one doctor said. Thanks to the internet I have plenty of knowledge thanks to the contribution of other people.

45,"I took a break. Being back already has me crashed, and hard.","A friend tried to compare it to withdrawal, however I feel it's more like being forced to take drugs that you don't want.

I took a break, from everything. I used my meager time off and went to the Appalachia's. I stayed off grid for a few days. No work, no internet/cell service, no junk food, no rat race of capitalism and sickness. 

I experienced levels of ecstasy while away. Sure, I did 'work' while there; chopping wood and making fires, prepping food and cleaning. Healthy work.

The rest of my time was spent backpacking parts of the Appalachian trail, writing, reading, meditating, hanging out with the woodland critters and just living! I had ZERO pain. I sneezed maybe 4 times the whole trip, my back pain/headaches/TMJ/diarrhea/allergies/shitty attitude/etc. ALL GONE. Vanished after the first full day.

Even the 12 hour straight drives there and back, with only gas breaks twice, didn't hurt me. I jammed out and watched the mountains and flew through 4 states feeling like I owned the damn place.

And now... I'm back. This is day 2 of being back. I haven't had the energy or will to cook after work and thus have fallen back into fast food, I feel sick, my head is pounding, I can barely keep my eyes open despite sleeping 10 hours each of the last couple nights, chugging coffee all morning to stay upright, going through almost a half box of Kleenex in my hour before work in the morning. Work has me in pain from how I have to sit, in the bathroom every hour or so. My eyes ache from the florescence, my ears are sensitive to all the noise, my TMJ is back with a vengeance, clenching until I have pain down my neck and up into my cheeks. 

I've lost all my zen, my mindfulness, my peace. I'm back to be anxious and depressed and feeding my brief hours of free time with as much distraction as possible. It really feels like an addiction. Like being in society as it is currently I need to have the drugs of pots of coffee, junk food and endless social media to be able to \*barely\* survive.

46,"too disabled to work, not disabled enough for disability &amp; i dont know what to do","sorry to sadpost but i was hoping there might be some advice here for me. 

im a 25 yo and im disabled (just not on paper). i have one diagnosed condition that i am currently getting treatment for that puts me out of commission for a week or more at a time with extreme fatigue. i also have an undiagnosed condition that randomly paralyzes my body- im trying to seek a diagnosis but im struggling to get my doctors to take it seriously. ive gotten as far as my doctor saying they would get me a referral to some kind of neuro doctor, but its been months now. every time i bring up the possibility of trying to apply for disability to my doctors they wave it off, and ive been rejected sending in applications before.

obviously because of this its been difficult for me to maintain a job. obviously you cant just leave work for a week or more, especially at entry level, and expect to keep it. i actually like to work, to a certain degree, i love to help people and i like to learn new skills, and i like being useful. but with a 'walking zombie' resume full of ""left due to health"" admissions, i just cant get work anymore.

i feel scared and helpless. ive recently had to bow out of a promising, paid creative opportunity due to currently being in a fatigue. i also cant keep relying on the few commissions i can get in a year to scrape by. thankfully my partner's family loves me and lets me stay with them but i dont want to be a burden or strain on their resources forever. i just dont know if i can ever be independent or 'worthwhile' in this backwards society of ours. i feel hopeless i can survive to being 30 and the guilt, pressure, and stress of being a ""failure"" is eating me alive.",False,jlapaw,martinLives,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jlapaw/too_disabled_to_work_not_disabled_enough_for/,8,1

81,The entire work system has made given me major anxiety and made me feel like I'm never good enough.,"I don't fully know how to explain my dilemma because in ways I actually want a job. My issue is I have absolutely no trust in higher ups, and this isn't just for big companies this is for local places as well.

I'm 21 and have never kept a job past about 2 months. I only started getting hired at 18 because I had an undiagnosed disorder that affected what I could do (not I have treatment for it). I hopped from job to job. It was very common for me to go into work happy and come home and tell my mother ""I got fired again"" 

Every single time I've gotten fired it (according to them) hasn't been my fault or they don't give me a reason. I've asked other staff for feedback  to improve and they say I'm fine, one of my last jobs the manager told me that I was actually doing really well and I picked up on things that other staff members took 6 months at least. She told me multiple times how great I was doing (I wasn't constantly asking for feedback or anything) and then the next day called me up and told me they found someone younger and better. Another time I lived a 10 minute walk from work, got in and the manager told me ""oh someone else we had before wanted to come back, didn't you get my email?"" she had sent the email 5 minutes before. I at least tried to work that shift to get money but she already swapped me for that girl who had quit. Another time I got fired because I had a really important event coming up on my night off, told one manager (just in case they called me in) and he said it was fine but told me to tell the other manager and the other manager went ballistic. He refused to hear me out. I have so many more of these stories but I don't wanna go on.

My other issue, there's always someone younger but due to me not being able to get hired early I struggle to get jobs a teenager couldn't typically get. I did try bartending but they wanted me to have more customer experience, which I do have some but those are the jobs I gotta compete with teenagers with.

I don't feel good enough for anything anymore. I worked in a cafe and while my coffee skills aren't amazing I could make a takeaway coffee with no complaints (can't do art for shit though) I don't even feel like I can apply to a run down, cheap coffee shop. I used to work as a kitchen hand but don't feel good for any kitchen hand jobs. Just looking at websites like Seek gives me major anxiety and that's before any interview. I do have a diploma and I am considered restudying something but I have 0 idea what because I'm so worried I'll end up not being able to get work after studying as just applying for minimum wage jobs makes me feel sick

When at work I can't relax at all. I have to constantly be 110% because I freak out so much at making a little mistake because tiny mistakes have gotten me fired. People say everyone makes mistakes but it truly feels like I can't within a job setting. And now with businesses reopening here it's 10x harder to get work.

That leads me to the point of why do we live like this if everyone is unhappy? Even the bootlickers. 

Also, it makes no sense to ruin your life and your soul for just being kept alive. How is your life no different than an animal's? At least they live in freedom.

And sometimes I actually end up having to work, and that just makes me want to kill myself. I just don't understand how people month after month for years can stay sane. 

A full time job leaves you with barely any time at all for you to do something you enjoy during the after work hours. I've done the math on this many times where I go through counting the time it takes to make breakfast, shower, go to work, etc etc and after all chores and work related tasks of the day are over then I only have something like 1-2 hours of free time.. and that also means I've used the time very efficiently without being lazy or slow. 

Now I have found a job opportunity to work from home and I can work for example 4 hours per day and make a small income good enough for survival, and it's really the best job I've been offered so far, but it would still be a nightmare. Sure it's less shitty than other jobs but it's still shit. 

I'm going to go insane having to suffer through 4 agonizing hours every damn day. But I think I am going to be forced to do that very soon because I'm running out of temporary solutions.

I think one thing is that I don't like socializing, but I remember during my early childhood that my classmates wanted me to come hang out with them every day and all we did was walk around chatting for the most part. I mean that's basically like work. If they thought it's so fun to just walk around chatting all day long every day then I can understand why they think work is so easy, they probably love to have a job to go to every day and socialize with their collegeues and that's why most jobs require you to be social and fun to work with and recruit through referrals and friends. So, I just don't have the DNA genes which makes it possible for me to enjoy working like most other people. I don't know how I can take this and keep living with the constant pressure to keep working a damn job every day, it's hell really.

86,Tipping culture and “unreliable” coworkers — how we’re conditioned to think capitalists do no wrong.,"Whenever a customer doesn’t tip, the server never gets angry at the owners that refuse to pay them properly; but instead the customer for not tipping them. And it’s gotten to the point that we demonize those who won’t or can’t (stop eating out, you’re cheap, etc.) Honestly with that arrangement, only higher earners could afford to consistently eat out.

A similar thing with “unreliable” coworkers (the ones that call out or quit suddenly and leave the rest short-staffed). No one questions the management/owner class for not having enough people to cover absences, or the fact that they only hire the bare minimum to keep costs low. No, the lazy coworker is apparently the problem.

We’re literally propagandized to support our owners more than our fellow working man/woman. Why is it that we always place the blame on the easiest targets?",False,jjghwh,EstrangedNeko,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jjghwh/tipping_culture_and_unreliable_coworkers_how_were/,1,1

90,Being late quickly demonstrates that the whole point of work is to control you.,"I once came in for a temperature check for a job. At the conclusion, it was 5 minutes past my scheduled start and I was lectured on how late I was. Never mind the fact that I received contradictory information on when I was supposed to report for said check (was told before to sign in (and not too early of course) before the check))

I wondered why it was a problem? It was a warehouse position so it’s not even that much of a big deal; if they want I’ll stay later to make up for it.

Then I realized that if they let me get away with lateness, other coworkers might test the waters to see what they can do. And from there, it wouldn’t be long before the workers get bold enough to unionize.

It’s always been about control. It’s the only thing more valued than productivity. And yet the bootlickers will continue defending this shit to the bitter end.",False,jjfuzd,EstrangedNeko,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jjfuzd/being_late_quickly_demonstrates_that_the_whole/,30,1
91,Stuck between the beliefs and trying to expel others conflicting beliefs and find/live out my truth (also on mental health),"Anybody who can help me with this, thank you so much. I am currently 20 and I still reside with my mother. I don’t have a job and I’ve had some mental issues since I was about 2. I know I probably need to see a psychiatrist and get on some sort of ADD/ADHD and/or anxiety medication. I currently sort of broke away from my fear-implemented christian ideals and beliefs after a long amount of time. 

These beliefs came from a bunch of conspiracy theorist-like Christian Youtubers. Now I see all these convincing Youtubers trying to inform me that an entirely raw food lifestyle consisting of ONLY fruits and vegetables will cure me, and my mental health. Also others saying I need to fast on only juice from fruits &amp; vegetables for over 100 days to clear out my colon and backed up waste in my intestines. Other people telling me to continue taking benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety medication). 

I guess I’m saying that I am simply having a hard time sticking to a path and following it. I hate living these extreme lifestyles and I don’t even know who to believe anymore because everyone has conflicting evidence and opinions on how you should live. I’m sick of my hair falling out, that sort of completely stopped for awhile when I was on the entirely raw food (fruits &amp; vegetables) diet. But the hair loss started up again, and I felt depressed and wasn’t progressing in life anyway, so I started back on my benzodiazepines to help me focus, and drinking strong black coffee.

 I still eat really healthy, with some pizza or meat in between my healthy foods on some days. I’m just not sure if I should be so extreme again, or see a psychiatrist to get on the right medication (probably a stimulant or antipsychotic.) I don’t know which path to follow, they all contradict and nobody seems to know what health and/or prosperity is anymore, without suffering and feeling stuck in your own head and depressed all the time. Ultimately I do realize the universe is made of magic and synchronicities do happen to me a lot.

I at least have some money from unemployment nowadays. If anyone can or has related to this, which I am sure there are some people, please give me your advice on blocking out the wrong paths, which can be so convincing, and how exactly to follow your own self truth and prosper in all areas of your life.

92,[Rant] The negative pay rise mystery,"tl;dr: it’s a rant/story about how jobs f you over...


I have been with The Company for over 6 years now. In the meantime I had two pay increases, one of which was part of the promotion to a Senior position.

Before having my most recent annual review I opened a spreadsheet and did some math. I used take-home tax calculators separately for each year, I took the official government-published inflation numbers and calculated how much I am earning now in relation to 6 years ago. Even though the inflation has been rather mellow, one year even at zero, the final number was nearly -5%. To put it bluntly: If I was able to buy a 100 loafs of bread in 2014, today I can only buy 95 of them.

I have worked there for a long time, became an expert in the specific aspects of business, became well acquaintanced and liked by the customers, I have widely expanded my skillset. And in the end I earn less. I don’t think I need to say anything more to describe how ridiculously unfair and predatory that is.

I have raised it during my meeting and my position was, that “if you’re not paying AT LEAST 100% of what you agreed to when I was hired, I won’t be doing 100% of what I can.” Yeah, I even ignored the fact that the pay increases should push you higher in the purchasing power with each year, even if only slightly, and I asked to be paid at the same “living level” as previously. After all, inflation includes all: energy prices, food prices, all other necessities and amenities. And unless I became less productive, less valuable, then I should earn at least as much, right? And as mentioned above: I actually became better at what I do.

What was The Company’s response? “You are not giving your 100% so there cannot be talk about pay increase. You need to do MORE than 100%, and then we can reward that with higher salary”.

I tried to reiterate my point and even their point to show how ridiculous that statement is. In the end I was assured, that of course I am valuable and valued by the company. Just not in a monetary sense.

I’m awaiting actual pay increase announcement that should be coming not too long from now. I expect nothing and yet I’m sure I’ll still be disappointed.

Guys: do what I did. Don’t just eyeball stuff, as inflation compounds with each year, just like interest. Do some math and figure out how much more you’re actually earning vs previous years. You might end up surprised to find that you numerical increase actually doesn’t cover the rising costs of living…",False,jjowex,20191124anon,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jjowex/rant_the_negative_pay_rise_mystery/,5,1

122,I need to vent,"I like working at my workplace. But a bunch of my coworkers who excluded me from the discussion due to my nationality (which they'll never admit) met together and decided that my position was redundant. Brought my concerns to my boss, she apologized at first then rolled back her apology the next day after reviewing policies and procedures and found that the discussion and decision was perfectly compliant with rules I've had no say in, irrespective of humanity. As a concession I was told that I could be transferred to another location pending my yearly evaluation, which I was promised would be undertaken fairly.

Narrator: it was not

Fast forward to today, this woman just tears into me. Maybe it was the loss of face involved in me telling her in front of a handful of people who don't speak a lick of English in a clearly concerned tone that I did not agree with the decision on a personal or professional level. Maybe it was because after being treated that way I just lost the energy to keep acting like I like any of the people who voted me off the island. Whatever happened, she came at me so hard during evaluations that everyone who sat in on it was put off be her vindictive attitude. Everything from not following some expectations that had never been presented to me in the span of 4 years, to not greeting people enough in the hallways (fact: I used to greet everyone, then stopped somewhere between them never answering me and them convening without a key expert in a department to that the expert position was redundant). Lots of talking down to me as though I were a child. Since my next year's contract is on the line, of course I had no choice but to give her a bunch of yes, sure, okay, and I'm sorry for shit that I had no reason to kowtow to. What's my choice? Fight her, lose my company housing and my job for sure and have to go back through the interview wringer to meet another soulless employer who will give me less pay and less time off?

You guys will love this shit. She asked me if my contract was unfair. I said yes, affirming my prior statements that the contract was written by natives for natives with little to no input or consideration for the immigrant workers as human beings. Nationals of course have some level of leverage, be it unions or protests. For us it's take it or leave it. And I know that. She asked me why I'd sign a contract if I thought it was unfair.

You guys will love this shit.

I told her ""with all due respect, I'm a human being, and I need a contract for a job, and I need a job to buy food and clothing. Otherwise I will die. So I take the least unfair contract I can get, because I will never get a perfect contract and I don't get to negotiate.""

That's right, she said, you can't negotiate so you better not complain.

This is capitalist logic. It's not even a private sector job, but cannibal capitalism is deeply entrenched in the minds of everyone around them. Boy I wish my job were in the private sector so instead of a public bureau deciding ways to fuck me for the sake of the nation, instead it would be bean counters deciding ways to fuck me for the sake of short-term profits.

134,I just got my MA degree and I'm absolutely terrified of idea of working full time...,"So, I just got my MA degree in September (in a field I'm not interested to pursuing afterall) and it's time for me to get a full time job. I work online part time (around 2-4 hours a day, I work whenever I want) and also on weekends as a referee. Both those gigs pay really, really well in my country and while I'm not well-off by any means, they're enough to keep me afloat. The problem is, both are extremely uncertain, I never know how much money I'm gonna make this month, it might be $1000, but it also might be $50. So the sad truth is, I have to find a stable job. There's no way around it.

I already denied one job offer this week, because it was a soul-sucking job for a corporation I don't care at all - it was an entry level data entry position, meaning typing stuff into Excel Monday to Friday from 9 to 5 pm. I'm a very active person and I just couldn't bare the thought. I felt so quilty denying the offer though. I mean, here I am, looking for a job, and I just said no to this very stable position...

I just got a call from another company today and I'm gonna have an online interview with them tomorrow.

Because who are we to them 

It’s not their loss 



And if we’re so free 

Why do I feel so empty 

While I work away my life 

Just to make ends meet 



And then wake up to do it all again 

And by the time it ends 

So does my life 

And I’m suppose to be satisfied

136,"Can’t enjoy my time off anymore, even missed my birthday and family dinner for work","I decided that maybe, after three years straight of working and working and more working, that MAYBE, I could have a little vacation. By some miracle, I was able to get three weeks off by lying about not having contacts (long story) and all I had to was provide a doctors note in that time. My plans were to relax, watch some movies, make real food for once, and actually live for a little. You know, like humans were meant to.

I wish I had just shut up about my contacts and never tried to get time off. Guess what happened? Not only was I completely incapable of relaxing that entire time due to anxiety about work, it indirectly led me to me losing that job and missing my entire birthday month with my family because of the financial situation that just one week put me into. I had to immediately find a new place to work, which was only possible because I knew someone who was able to get me a job right away. 

However, because of the urgency of the situation, I’m pretty much working as much as I can out of completely necessity and didn’t even realize my birthday had passed until my parents said something about it. I wasn’t able to fully explain to my mother why I couldn’t make it to my own birthday dinner, and even then she just decided to guilt trip me. Made me feel bad for not being able to show up to dinner, even though I even forgot I had a fucking birthday at all. 

So here I am, feeling guilty as fuck for just wanting some time off. I’m in debt, missed my birthday, and am making less all because I needed a little break. Guess I’ll get my next break when I die.

That's pretty much it.

It wouldn't feel right to have children and then expect them to leave at 18 into this world without a plan.

My issue in life is the realization that there's not some noble goal at the end of this struggle. The only reward is survival and the only goal is death.

So there was a COVID outbreak at my work. I usually work alone in a completely different building so I'm not exactly in contact, but I was able to claim I was afraid for my health (which I am) and get time off. 

I could get into the bullshit about how they made me hand in a signed, physical note stating this time off was ""voluntary and unpaid"", but honestly, I'm not that mad. 

I've been absolutely obliterated by depression lately. Last week was one of the worst weeks I've had in months, but not going to work this whole week? I feel almost like a different person. My teletherapist even noticed. I can't believe how miserable my life felt while I was working. It took up so much of my time and energy both mentally and physically, and most days, when the depression was at its worst, work was HELL. 

But having this time to myself again, I finally was able to enjoy being me again. 

I'm still in quarantine until I get my covid test results back. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be clear to go back to work in a few more days but until then, I'm going to try and hold on to these fleeting moments where I finally feel like I want to be alive again.

147,I think I am burned out at the age of 22,"A little personal post, but I am curious if someone is in a similar situation. 
I juggle with 3 jobs. One in accountig, one in construction and one in a hospital. Why? Because none of them would hire me normally. Ever since the pandemic started I was lucky to get a job and had to sign contracts that would allow them to only give me hours when they need me with no regard of when I need to be employed. So I juggle 3 jobs to be able to pay for my living, my car and university. There are weeks when I literally have no days off. Sometimes multiple weeks in a row. And I have to stay up all night studying.
The worst is that I drink 7-8 cups of coffee a days just to keep up with sleeping 2-4 hours. One when I wake up. One before I leave home. One after I arrive. One on my lunch break. One before I go home. One when I arrive home. And one during study session. If I don't I'd just sleep on the spot standing. It just feels wrong at this point physically. But I think I am seriously addicted. Not like ""hehe I love coffee like an addict"" but addict addicted.
My 10yo laptop died (video card and fan both went out). It is already held together by electric tape. But I will have to make time to replace the fan so I can use it without placing it on the big fan (you know those you use to cool down a room). Boomers and other people at uni tell me to just buy new. But I am happy if I have a couple dollars at the end of each month. I cannot afford to save up for a new one.
I have just finished fixing up my car for good. I bought it as a daily/cheap project (because I needed a car and could not afford one that was in good condition)... And it has been in the works for 3 years. I finished it yesterday evenig. Now it only needs and alignment. Yet I feel no rewarding feeling like I used to.
I am falling behind with schoolwork. Yesterday after getting done with the car I have spent the time from 22pm to 4am to trying to focus. But could barely accomplish a thing. I only made as much progress in that time as I'd do in 1 or 2 hours if I was not that exhausted. And no. I was not watching youtube or anything. I was literally staring at the screen for minutes before catching myself doing that. I seriously don't know how am I going to pass my tests next week. I am not to cheat but this time I am seriously considering it. (Is it morally wrong to cheat in a game that is rigged against me?)
Friends always invite me out and I constantly say no. Why? Because I cannot afford to go out. I don't have the time or the money.
Family constantly tells me that by now others have relationships. But on one hand that's not what I see. Barely any of my friends do. Only those who do not have to work more than 2-3 days a week and/or do not attend school. The others are all single. I have tried to look for a relationship. But I am just never available. And when I am, then I am a really bad company. Constantly tired, slow to answer and quick to anger.
I actually remember the last time I felt genuenly happy by the date. It was almost a year ago on 2019.12.12. It was due to snow coming on my day off and being able to take the car out to the local abbandoned airport to screw around. As dumb as it sounds, ever since then that's the only thing I can look forward to now. The snow. Other than that I don't see anything that would reward me for the struggles. I still do them. But it feels useless. And all I realistically see is only getting worse.

Given how many shit warehouses there are and how they're accidentally doing everything possible to make a person miserable. It's no surprise. 

My point is, I reckon it's more likely we're anti bullshit mundane jobs and would happily work if it was something that we would be content doing and paid a respectful amount. 
Perhaps work here  on the sub is just defined as a task we force ourselves to do for money while losing time, happiness and life satisfaction.

150,Please I need advice.,"Maybe this isn't the best place for unbiased answers but I will ask anyways because people here are probably smarter than I am.

As we all know, there is another spike in covid cases happening. Should I quit my job because no one at my work takes precautions? 

The first day I went there, it wasn't it even an interview. I talked to the boss about pay, he offered a handshake, then I started working that day. I've been working in landscaping for 2 weeks, all the people I work with are huge Trumpers, they even make me listen through Rush Limbaugh in the truck when he's on. They all talk about how they really hate the whole masks thing, and I have to be close to these people.

With all the leaf blowers and lawn cutters so loud, anytime someone needs to tell me something, they have to get 2 inches away from my ear to tell me. I really don't like right wind politics, and all these people do is talk about just that. 

This is my highest paying job so far at $13 an hour, but still, I do the same work, if not more, than a lot of the people there and the 2nd lowest wage someone gets paid is $18(I'm guessing it's because I'm young, not a good reason IMO) the boss even tried starting me off at $12 when the online application said start at $13. 

Do I have a valid reason to quit for when future employers ask why I quit? I would say no one would take safety precautions or wear masks. It's Friday tomorrow, should I finish the week then quit my job? Keep working until I get a better job? Or just quit now? If I quit now should I make up a lie and say I'm sick or something?

159,What is there to look forward to?,"Seriously.

School is a place of barely any autonomy. It drains me, it bores me out of my mind and I hate every minute. University will probably be no better - you can narrow down your interests more, but you have to study and cram even more, additionally you are now an adult and will have to deal with supporting yourself and finances.

And the future holds? Jobs you spend most of your day at. And for the absolute majority, I think this job, whether they had higher education or not, will not be fulfilling enough to feel like they are not working. You will most likely get paid better and hate your job less, but in general it's about the same bleak outlook. Little freetime, little control, little purpose. When do things ever get truly better?

We don't get paid as much as we should. Problems left by older generations are piling up. 

If you don't come from a better background with more money and connections, does any of your raw talent and intelligence matter? Will you ever have the opportunity to do anything?  
I have no drive at all. I want to do something meaningful, not just be another exploited worker, I want to have a bigger purpose behind my work and have more control over my life. But who truly ever gets that?

It feels like all dreams and ambitions people have are for the absolute most part - naive. They either don't understand harsher realities and get to reach these higher standards because of more support (like the ""selfmade"" mill/billionares), or will eventually be disappointed and just lower their expectations.

I have nothing realistic to look forward to, to work for, nothing to get up for. I wished I could be an independent person - someone like a successful artist or entepreneur. Not just slave away.

I don't even think it's pessimistic. The world is built a certain way, to assume chances are shitty slim, circumstances have gotten worse and people want to exploit you is realistic. Big dreams just get crushed.

163,My job laid a bunch of people off and I’m now being worked to death with no pay raise and unpaid overtime.,"I figured this was a safe place to post about this.

The marketing agency I work for laid a bunch of people off a few months ago due to COVID, and I’m now being worked to death. I’m putting in so much unpaid overtime just to meet deadlines, I’m usually done working somewhere around 8 o clock at night. 

The thing is, I haven’t even had this position for a year yet. Even if I was to quit, the chances of me getting a new position with less than a year of experience is slim to none, especially during a recession. What sucks is I actually really like my job, I just can’t handle being on all of these different accounts. Im currently coordinating 15 different accounts. I’m going back and forth with clients, handling all the billing, mocking up a bunch of ads, flighting things out and making sure we’re on track for pacing, moving budget around, meeting with clients every week to discuss performance and new ideas, plus I’m also dealing with stupid internal goals management keeps forcing on everyone. I almost always miss the deadline for those things in favor of actual work. It’s overwhelming and too much.

I don’t even enjoy my weekends anymore because I know Monday morning I’ll have to be up at like 6am just to get a good start on the work I have to complete. This weekend for example, I’m going to have to spend all day Sunday completely internal employee development goals that were technically due this past week. I have so much anxiety at work I’m getting depressed. The sales rep I work under brought in the most money for the quarter out of any of the other reps, yet management refuses to hire another coordinator and is dumping all of these accounts on me. They say the only way they’ll hire another one is if he brings in some crazy amount of money that would absolutely not be possible for me to manage, even if he got close to that. I would crash and burn before he got anywhere near that amount. 

I’m trapped and I don’t know what to do. I’ve asked for a raise and they won’t give me one, using COVID as an excuse. I’m currently being paid 21 an hour but I’m
only allowed to list 40 hours a week on the time sheet, no matter how much overtime I do. I’m starting work at 6 am and I don’t get done until around 8 at night but I also don’t get paid any overtime. When you do the math, after taxes thats an extra $1000 a paycheck I’m not getting. 


Is there any way out of this situation? I’m thinking if I just start fucking everything up on purpose they’ll be forced to fire me and then I can collect unemployment until I can find another job. If I quit I can’t get unemployment. 

What’s funny is I just know that during my next performance review they’re going to tell me I’ve been underperforming somehow and am not deserving of a raise, even though I am working my ass off constantly.

We're all colleagues with similar job functions and schedules, but I don't find it difficult to put work down at all.

I guess my point is, there's more to life than just working and I hate how we're conditioned to believe otherwise.

consider someone's gender in hiring someone, so they get around it by giving
you the option of telling them yourself. if you “volunteer” the information, that's
legal.

Worst case scenario I’ll just move back to my parents for a bit. I also have 2-3 good leads for other work.

Basically a few days back one of my coworkers heard from someone from another company I had an interview at recently that I came for a role there and told my abusive boss that I was looking to leave : cue the abuse in that role going from bad to threats and bullying. 

I’ve been told I «  do nothing and do a terrible job, embarassement to the team » not dedicated, yelled at and physically threatened when I’ve been forced to do about 10 hours of unpaid OT in the past two weeks. I also do the work of 3 people. When I mentioned this my boss just pretended I was lying. So peace out ✌️ 

Also no notice no nothing. If he wants some work done he will have to pay the freelance rates that I will make sure to serve him in the resignation letter. 

I’ve been waiting for this since the day I started this job, was kind of golden handcuffed then pandemic handcuffed but I draw the line at abuse. It will be hard times but I’m sick of my mental health being ruined by this lunatic of a boss.",False,jivyc3,kook0983,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jivyc3/i_am_quitting_my_abusive_job_with_nothing_lined_up/,3,1

234,A cautionary tale from my boyfriend’s former employer,"So, my boyfriend used to work for a big name in the freight industry. He put almost 5 years there, was commended by a lot of higher ups because his work was better than pretty much everyone else’ (he pretty much never damaged freight and he was called ‘the famous stacker’ by some high-up-the-food-chain regional manager type. They frequently had him doing supervisor work (without any added pay) my boyfriend did it though, because he wanted the experience to become a supervisor... and this went on for years. 

He would supervise, load and unload trailers, work ridiculous hours and come home exhausted and sore every night. 

One time, he inhaled formaldehyde-naphthalene powder from a bag someone punctured and did nothing about (toxic and used by several industries, but freight workers don’t really get to benefit from safety labels and warnings (not like they’re wearing protective equipment). 

It was a hard job, but he did get promoted to full time quickly. Oh, and other benefit, they had pensions, which was great. 

... until he got his back hurt working there, a slip-disk. Couldn’t afford an MRI because even though he was full time employed, it was still too expensive, so the doctor just took their best guess. He was out for 4 months, and it took exactly 4 months to get compensation for his injury (1/3rd of his hourly rate if he had been working) 

He came back, took things slow, but was still intent on getting that promotion. It never happened, and the praise of his work pretty much stopped. I was having a serious mental health crisis around that time too, they pointed him for taking me to the hospital to keep me safe...  

Then, the final straw, about a year later. His knee got hurt, badly. It was slightly sore when he came home Friday, and by Saturday morning it hurt so bad he couldn’t really get around. He came to work that Monday with an order from his doctor saying he shouldn’t be bending his knee. 

You know what his employer did? 

They made him do ‘light-duty’ and had him walk the loop around the entire massive dock for 8 hours. He called me 2 hours later, crying and in agony (I’ve literally never heard him cry from pain before) so I told him to quit, right then and there. 

After his back injury, they started treating him worse, and pretty much wanted him gone after his knee injury. They did the same thing to a coworker of his too, tell him “this is the second time you’ve been hurt in 2 years” before making him stress his hurt shoulder cleaning the windows. 

Employers don’t care. 

Ps. After bragging in a company meeting that they had used their massive influence to push Trump’s tax policy through, they said they were putting a billion$ into the workers’ pensions. Not even 6 months later, they ended pensions for all new employees.",False,jhs9ik,Aemmii,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jhs9ik/a_cautionary_tale_from_my_boyfriends_former/,11,1
235,Just can't seem to focus at work anymore,"I've been working for years now. But recently the last two office jobs I pretty much left on a bad note. Pretty much left a mental scar now.

Although I got a new job, I can't focus. I'm always thinking about my past failures and how this job is going to end up the same. Higher ups don't like me, talk shit about me to the boss, boss comes up with all these formal criticisms of me etc. At the same time I just don't have the same level of motivation either now that I'm older. I know I won't be making it very high and I am slowly growing to accept that. Yet because of the the working environment today we still have to give it our best efforts with rough hours just to ensure we don't get fired fast. So knowing I'm being forced to work my ass off while still being behind all my peers in the rat race ain't helping my motivation.

I rather not have to take Ritalin everyday just to function normally. After all the root case isn't really solved. Rejection sensitive dysphoria and constant disappointment isn't just going to go away like that.

But maybe the truth is I just don't wanna work at all. Its not the job itself thats the issue.

The rules are we aren’t allowed to have personal items on us while we’re working.

My dad is diabetic and I need to have my phone on me in case something happens to him and he goes to the hospital  this has happened before. The rule is if there’s an emergency they have to call the front desk and they’ll find us and tell us. The problem with this is, we’re out in other parts of the building delivering food, and 90% of the time there’s no one at the front desk. 

Well yesterday my boss came in took my phone and my coworker’s phone and kept them in her office until our shift was over. I was beyond pissed, and I still am.

238,"Got a political pamphlet today about ""getting out state BACK TO WORK"" and it actually made me burst in tears because I almost hope this pandemic lasts for years because despite not being able to see my friends, I've actually never be happier in the last 10 years since I finished grad school.","My employer has been struggling since the pandemic started, and I went from working 40 hours a week in the city to working 2 days a week from home and having some income supplemented by a government subsidy scheme. It doesn't make up my full pay but it doesn't even matter that I am getting paid less because I am now spending so much less. I didn't realise how much I basically paid to work and how much more I had to spend on things because of work.

I no longer have to pay for an expensive gym membership to keep fit because I can go for a (free!) run in the late afternoon, while I'd get home after dark when working in the office and I don't feel safe going alone at night. 

I no longer come home too exhausted to think about cooking a meal and ordering UberEats or DoorDash because even on the days I work, I have time to put something in the slow cooker, and am right here at home when I log off at 5pm, rather than getting home after 6pm. 

I no longer have to pay to to constantly fill up my car to drive to work or pay the ridiculous public transport fares in my city to be crammed in like a sardine and have to stand pressed up against others the entire journey. 

I no longer feel obligated to put in an hour or two at Friday Happy Hour and pay for overpriced cocktails I don't want. 

I don't need to go to therapy nearly as often and pay a large co-pay because I'm not nearly as depressed as I was before. 

I no longer have to spend money on makeup in order to be considered professional. I don't have to buy uncomfortable work shoes and blister guards. I no longer have to buy expensive scratchy uncomfortable ""corporate clothes"" that I don't wear in any other context and constantly replace tights that got a rip/run in them. I sit around my house in fun t-shirts that cost $15-20 dollars and am happy and comfortable. 

I am actually getting enough sleep because on the two days I am working, I can wake up at 8:45am to be at my desk in the other room at 9:00am because all I have to do is pee, brush my teeth/hair, throw on a t-shirt and a pair of leggings, and put a piece of toast in the toaster. It beats having to wake up at 6:30am so I can put makeup on my face, 

That extra two hours of sleep is making *such* a difference to my quality of life. It's basically like getting a whole extra night of sleep a week. I'm also finding it easier to sleep because it is easier to wind down at the end of the night because I'm not stressed about going into an office I hate. And there is another way I'm saving money - I no longer have to import sleeping capsules from the US (over the counter there, expensive and prescription only here) to fall asleep on work nights because my body is dreading a fresh day of slavery in the morning. 

And then that propaganda pamphlet arrived today, all about how this party needs us to vote for them (and I won't because I don't vote conservative) so we can all GET BACK TO WORK!!! 

I'm so much fucking happier right now. I'm not suffering from suicidal ideations because I'm a miserable wagie. 

For the first time in 10 years, I finally feel like my life is my own. 

I've been learning Spanish and Korean as a hobby and loving it. I've been going for walks in the afternoon. I'm eating healthier. My skin is glowing because I'm not forced to paint it in makeup all week to be considered ""professional"". I am finally spending more time with my family and friends than co-workers I don't really like and have no connection to other than the fact we are wagies at the same place. Admittedly, a lot of it is over Facetime, but it is still enough to bring me happiness.  I'd rather facetime interactions with my loved ones than in person interaction with coworkers. I now actually have the energy to go and spend a day with my 2 nieces on a Saturday instead of being utterly drained from my 40 hours of wage slavery. I'm not nearly as reliant on anti depressants and sleeping pills as I used to be. I'm not......dreading life anymore or wishing I could die.

But the capitalists don't want me to stay happy. They want me back in my miserable station in life because FUCK ME for not being born to millionaires. I can't imagine anything worse. I hope this pandemic would inspire people to realise that the 40 hour slave week is miserable, but the normies are desperate to have it back because they have been brainwashed to think it is freedom.

I finished graduate school in November 2010, and despite the fact this year has been a pandemic, this year has actually been the happiest of my life. I didn't realise how burned out I was. Sure, I can't travel internationally right now, but I'm actually not craving a holiday as much as I normally do because I'm not suffering the usual burn out I do by this point in the year.

I honestly. kinda hope the pandemic lasts another couple of years so I can continue to be.........happy and not depressed. I don't want this to end. 

But of course, the part of normalcy society is desperate to restore is the most miserable part of it - wage slavery. And people are so brainwashed by capitalism that they are eating it up and I just want to burst into tears. I finally feel like my life has meaning again, and like there is more to life than making other people rich, and the normies and rich people just want to take that all away from me and send me back to misery. 

I know this post is going to be preaching to the choir, but I just wanted to share my thoughts without being told I'm some combination of lazy, selfish, entitled, spoiled, or a typical millennial snowflake. 

All I want from this pandemic recovery is for part time work from home to be normalised, not a huge rush back to 40 hours a week of wage slavery. But it won't happen, so I kinda hope to drags on longer.....",False,jgifl7,wishthiswaseternal,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jgifl7/got_a_political_pamphlet_today_about_getting_out/,37,1

No appreciation whatsoever, I was being told that I gave less than 30% effort for the company. I got anxiety, I was dreading every single day, scared shitless of what will happen next. 

My friend also felt the same and we planned to quit simultaneously. I was out first. After quitting I'm being treated like shit, and my boss acts all suspicious like I would steal something or shit. I'm banned from coming to the office when she's not there. I can't talk without her cutting me off or saying something rude. I'm being ignored and dismissed. 

My friend, on the other hand, is being treated extra nicely. She got big raise, and bribed with this and that. Suddenly she changed her opinion and starts to talk highly about those people whom she used to hate very much on daily basis. She now treats me as a whiny person who cannot do her job properly.

I have a college degree. One of those degrees where you work with people, and one where you need a master's degree to make any money.

I'm working a minimum wage job that's kinda in my field, not really. I've been working here for 2 years.I work 32 hours a week. I get called in at least once a week. All of my coworkers are burnt out. All of us worked through COVID. We do manual labor, cooking, cleaning, we're responsible for administering medication, providing emotional support... We're like family for a check. You can probably guess what I do for work now.

I love my clients. I love them so much. And I know what will happen to them if I leave for my own mental health. I don't want my coworkers to pick up my shifts when they are working nearly 50 hours a week on the regular. My clients will suffer and so will my coworkers.

I need to leave, though. I need a job that's ACTUALLY in my field. But as it stands, on the ONE DAY I get off a week, all I do is sleep and lay in pain from straining my body. I even recently sustained an injury from outside of work that might require more medical invention, and I don't know when I'm going to fit that in my schedule.

288,How I deal with my job and how you can too.,"So you hate your job. You're expected to work overtime, your boss is an unfair, and your pay sucks. Well same here. I on the other hand do not work overtime, I do not let my boss be unfair, and my pay still sucks. The way to deal with your job is to live life on the edge and have a good work ethic. 

Now before you lynch me for saying a good work ethic will help you deal with your job let explain. And I'll start with living life on the edge


No.


This is the most powerful tool you have as an employee. You don't negotiate. You don't make exceptions. You say no. The word No will solve most of your work problems or you won't have any more problems which leads to my next point.


Two resumes.


You read that right. Keep two resumes. If you get fired you still need to make money and I am sure you don't have savings because of your shitty pay. The first resume is your transitional job resume. This one you lie your ass off on so you are guaranteed to get some low level job, fast food, waiter, whatever. The other resume well you still lie your ass off but it's for where you would like to work next. You keep them updated and most importantly you keep them cycling. You keep sending them to places keep those resumes fresh in the inbox of what ever companies you like. I currently am not looking to quit my current job but I still have both my resumes under review at 6 other companies.


Just say NO.


Again I can't stress this enough. Just say no. Just say I won't be doing that. Just say it.


Live within your means.


I am not saying so you can start saving money because I am sure the pay won't allow you to. But what I am saying is live within your means so YOU don't need overtime. In my personal opinion overtime is a scam. Your time after work is worth exponentially more then the usual 1 to 1 1/2 times pay you get for doing it. But if you need it you need it. That's why you should do everything you can so you can live within the confines of your non overtime check. This also has the benefit of you not scrambling around if the overtime goes poof. Overtime can't affect you if you don't need it.


Now onto the lynching. 


WORK ETHIC DUN DUN DUUUUUN.

This is actually really simple get your daily work done within your normal hours. Or do more. Just don't do less. You don't do other people work for them, you don't do your bosses job. You do YOUR job and that it. You get it done in that 8 to 10 hour period. You get it done in that week. Don't say it can't be done. It can be done. I'll use myself as an example I can finish the daily work at my job in 4 hours. I work a 10 hour shift. I can work circles around everyone else in my job and everyone knows it. Sometimes I have completed what amounts to 4 days worth of work in 7 hours just because I can. It's a power move. The most important thing is make sure they know in no uncertain terms that you only do more because you wanted to. Which brings me back to the most important thing.


JUST SAY NO.

For context I work in a manufacturing job. Everyone BUT me does overtime. I tell my bosses no on a daily basis. Other people around me have gotten fired while doing what everyone else does but I am still here. 

Do I think this will help ""everyone"" no that would be unrealistic. Do I think it can help alot of you? Yes I do. Do I sound like I am an asshole at work?

168 hours in 7 days

-40 hours of work a week (usually more)(extremely conservative)

-5 days of work 1 hour each way (for me, and many others-if too high of an estimate , it’ll balance out with the under estimate of the typical hours worked in a week for a middle class american) =10 hours commuting

-reccomended healthy sleep amount =9hr/day=63hours week (might sleep 10 hours one day, 5 the next, 12 after, etc)

-time spent in the shower, getting ready, picking out clothes, doing hair, makeup, shaving legs, grooming beard etc (this is probably higher for women than men, depending) 1 hour day =7hours week(again, conservative here) 

-3 hours week cleaning living space, taking out trash, laundry, household chore stuff like dishes and laundry (could be higher, depending, again, conservative)

-2 hour a day/7 hours a week eating/cooking/getting food/the drive to pick up the food, the time spent eating it/prepping food, etc etc

-1 hour/day=7hours week (basic errand running, getting gas, new light bulb, depositing money in bank, doctor appt, etc


(Oh, and btw, this is like a single guy here, or single woman, bring in kids, a relationship, a pet, and you can imagine the hours added into the equation, this is just like basic shit here)

168 hours in a week

Totaling all the above leaves you with
137 hours 

168(total hours in a week) - 137(rough estimates of above activities)

=31 hours total remaining. 

Again,

You could be sleeping a 12 hours here or there, or doing any number of responsibilities and chores or errands that could easily make it more like 20-25 hours remaining, for example, like 1 hour of getting ready for the day, can definitely be doubled for women, especially on nights out etc.

31 hours (time left) divided by 7 (days in a week)

Gives you an average of 4 hours per day of free time.

That is 4 hours to pursuit your hobby or what makes live even worth living for. 

That is 4 hours to spend whatever energy you have left cuddling with your lover.

That is 4 hours of whatever energy and emotional bandwidth you have left to write, paint, sit in nature, disconnect, read a book, watch a movie, consume any kind of entertainment, fuck, ETC...

I don’t hate my job necessarily and from all my past work experience, I know I should feel lucky to have this job, but after being WFH due to covid and then on maternity leave, I haven’t left the house since March and it’s been so great. I feel like a changed person. So relaxed and worry free just being safe in my home. 

I just had correspondence with my supervisor and I already just feel so negative about the whole idea of going back to work. The idea of going outside and getting into my car at 6am every day with the baby feels so dark. I’ve loved having no stress sitting in traffic, biting my nails, anxiously taking puffs of my cbd pen while I watch the time, self medicating to calm my nerves, but insisting at least it’s better than cigarettes, all because I have to go to work. 

Going back out into the world makes me want to barf. There was a time before I had a baby when I wanted to work and have a good job but all I experienced was how very competitive it seems to be to get any good job around here, abusive employers, getting my hours cut, not really getting paid enough for my education and experience, getting taken advantage of, not being able to support myself even though I’d be working like 2 jobs, etc. Working destroyed my self confidence and sometimes I just lay in bed at night thinking about the negative interactions I’ve had with people over the years or convincing myself people don’t like me, when really it’s probably since I was just working for some whack job.

by this logic, value is derived by how much
labor is required to accomplish something, in
this case the labor of learning the skill in
addition to the labor of completing the task at
hand. a doctor would earn a much higher wage
because of the labor required to earn the
necessary degrees to practice. okay.

but then if you ask a right finger why the price
of a pair of glasses, a mattress, or even a bottle
of water is so expensive, despite these things
being cheap and easy to make, they'll tell you
that value is not determined by the labor that
goes into it, but by need and demand.

this inconsistency reveals how neoliberal
economics functions: the value of something
means whatever is most convenient to the
ruling class.

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely consider myself a schizophrenic. Using the C9H13N, of pure form and excellent quality, I came to a certain portal of my mind to show me everything.

In order to make it clear: most of the ""marginal"" of this type, the truth falls under your stereotypical logic of thinking. Only, the difference between them and me is ""what is inside and outside. If a person is quite developed, Am reveals his potential (fuck, it is impossible to concentrate under ""things""). And vice versa, dumb is even dumber.

My brain absorbed all the childhood and maturity of a gigabyte of information in its purest form (I don't know what to start with yet). And so, all this information came in parts, in blocks. I never forget anything (it doesn't apply to everything), if I got carried away - in my head forever. I do not know why. Yes, my brain is set up as a blockchain.

Now I am asocial. I am free of the pyramid oil to a greater extent. Having forgotten about food, what a dream is. In general, from the needs of the individual. It has cleared my communication channels. Connections with space, yes, I am a Buddhist. But not a follower as Buddhists, but more enlightened as the Shakyamuni Buddha.

So, here we are. Perhaps against the background of quality Bath Salts + information ubiquitous + (thanks) my teacher that did not make a stamp out of us in school years such thoughts are born:

When a monkey took a stone and made fire, it is the Revolution, and when money was first coins, and after the cells (btc) - it is Evolution.

Now it is an associative series:

Human beings - resources - money.

There are more people,

Gold is in the treasury of the state,

Resources are finite.

There are more people.

Blockchain - currency.

Resources - human. (yes, yes, matrix, hello).

The man is tied to oil.

Oil. Everyone dances under it (read the list of oil derivatives products). They dance like cute, and the puppeteer is America, the very consumer of that oil.

My conclusion with these ""masks and kodwin-19"" is the beginning of the end. X Day. The point of no return. The end of the old empire. And the new world order.

The United States is an empire, and as we know, every empire has its beginning and its end. The lovers of dolor&amp;oil? Either way, it will soon fall into summer.

Oil is the ultimate resource.

Everyone dances under it..... In this case, the planet dies! There is a lot of plastics in the ocean, CO2 emissions.

Now more than ever, a revolution is needed in the minds of everyone.

The first stage: Sandzaru ( three wise monkeys)

I do not hear anything, I do not see, we do not say. Three monkeys.

Masks, gloves, glasses. Masks, masks, masks again.

Second stage: Global cleaning.

Only factories will remain. China is one big factory. If they were the first to start, they will be the first to find a vaccine for their nation.

It’s worth it. 

I left a monotonous job with extremely high volume. Abnormally high volume. The day I quit, I almost forgot how to drive home I was so relieved. It’s taken me three whole weeks to recover from job burnout. 

I’m not gonna specify exact details, but it was an office job in Washington. Corporate environment.

When I worked there, I felt like I was swimming full speed through a tidal wave that was never going to subside. No matter what I did, it made a pinhole sized dent on a skyscraper.

My prefrontal cortex felt like a burnt out vacuum when I tried to focus on my passions, or carry out everyday tasks.

It’s week three, and today is the first day since I left that I can finally focus again. At full capacity.

Financially? I’ll figure it out. But this feeling is underrated. Criminally underrated.

Its the same as many other app developers who made it. The guys who made whatsapp worked at Yahoo. Gabe Newell worked at Microsoft before doing Valve and Steam. Many guys worked for firms that helped grant them the knowledge and mindset needed to success.

336,Most people don't like their jobs but they wouldn't know what to do with themselves if they didn't work.,"It's actually a pretty sad reality that we live in. We have all blindly accepted the fact we *have* to work and that work isn't meant to be enjoyable. So we work for 5 days a week and when we have time off we just stare at different types of screens. Because of working all the time, nobody actually takes time to learn about who they are and what they're passionate about. So we work for 50 or so years and when we retire, we have no idea how to spend our time and how to be alone. In fact, a lot of people who retire in their 60's end up getting depressed or going back to work because they don't know how to actually live. This makes perfect sense though because if someone was in prison for 50 years and then they suddenly got released, they would have no idea what to do, like that guy in The Shawshank Redemption who had been in prison for a bunch of years and then got released and killed himself.

I guess the moral of the story here is work if necessary but don't base your identity on what you do. Unfortunately we all identify ourselves with out work, which most of us don't even like. 

Nobody likes their job and yet they always ask each other ""what do you do?"".

337,Nestor Makhno refused to pay railwaymen and demanded they do not charge military vehicles,"when the latter asked for payment of arrears, Makhno told them:

In order to ensure the widest possible restoration of normal rail-
way services in the area we have liberated, and acting on the
principle of the organisation of their own free existence by the
peasant and worker organizations and their unions, I propose that
the comrade workers and employees energetically organise and
restore things themselves, setting sufficient tariffs and wages for
their work, apart from military traffic.$
of
It is the last four words which are the most significant. for most
traffic in a civil war is military, and at that time most of the traffic
round Olexandrivske was of the Makhnovists. It was therefore un-
realistic and unfair to expect the railwaymen to take this advice}

349,"I tried to organize my workplace and couldn’t, so I’m quitting. I feel guilty.","Just wanted to vent here, thought this sub might be a good place. 

Today I put in my notice at a distribution job that has been working me relentlessly since May. We have been doing mandatory 50-60 hour weeks- 9 hour shifts all week, plus eight hours on Saturdays and 6 every other Sunday -for months now. Additionally we have been told this will continue for the rest of the year. The job requires most of us to be on our feet all day, to lift heavy boxes constantly - not something easily done 40 hours a week, let alone 60. 

Management seems barely sympathetic, if at all, to the toll this schedule takes on us. They constantly patronize and condescend us. Safety is an issue as well. I could go on.

I tried to organize the place by contacting a labor organizer and asking for guidance, but couldn’t get anything done, those who seemed interested wouldn’t commit when I tried to set up meetings multiple times.  I don’t blame them though, it’s a scary thing to ask of people. I just wish something could have been done for us.

Now that I’ve decided to give up and quit, I feel guilty. I know it isn’t my responsibility or anything, and tbh in hindsight I may not be the best candidate to lead an organization effort anyway. But I feel guilty because I don’t want my coworkers to have to keep putting up with this shit. 

But also - and more frustratingly - I feel strangely guilty for leaving the company. Like I have been gaslit into feeling like I owe them more than what I have been giving them. 

I have a new job lined up, friend works there and recommended me. I interviewed today. They kept asking if I could start tomorrow, but I wanted to be nice and give my current job a week notice. So we settled on Monday. 

Still haven’t started the hiring process so it’s technically not a done deal. That may also be a source of my unease as well, tbh. But I simply cannot do this anymore, so I made the jump. 

-TL;DR-

Just so frustrated because I’m forced to work somewhere so I can pay rent and not be homeless or cause problems for my roommates, forced to more or less beg to sell myself to some other company, gaslit into feeling guilty for fleeing an abusive and toxic workplace. And I’m frustrated by my failed attempts at trying to change things. 

I should be - and would rather - just feel happy and relieved. 

Wish I could just straight up quit society all together somehow...without risking starvation and exposure - or outright dying.

And as an instructor, I had to attend classes myself. Plus I had to work EVERY event/test/street fair/ even sleepover events on New Years, Valentine’s Day, etc...

I then noticed a few other people had narc traits (same thing) that made me really uncomfortable (yelling at their daughter for asking a simple question, belittling people non stop, etc.).

As someone with a history of dealing with abuse/unhealthy environments, I tend to find myself repeating patterns without realizing it, mostly in the area of accepting/dealing toxic behaviors until it's way too late. Think stockholm syndrome/fawning. As I've been healing more though, I've been able to point them out faster with the hopes of squashing it before it gets to me. 

The only issue is that now that I notice these things, I see them everywhere. I see how awful people can be in a work setting. I see how manipulative, jealous, conniving, unethical, and just straight up mean people can get. And honestly, it's never for a reason. It's just because they're trapped inside that mentality, so that's the only way they know how to behave. This makes it almost impossible for me to find a job where I feel safe (mentally) to work.

394,The drab lives of receptionists,"So today I had a CT scan appointment.. I go and find out that my insurance hadn’t gone through somehow, because of a mixup, and people forgetting, and it seems I just got lost in the health”care” system today. What am I paying for if insurance can’t actually do its job?

But the most depressing thing as I was waiting was listening to the conversations of.. everyone.. I can’t imagine having that job. I respect them if they enjoy it and find meaning in it. But I don’t think I could ever do a desk job that’s just endless calling and asking people “how’s your day” when you never mean it ..
I also heard a mom say how she never lets her kid get xrays, even dental, and wow. That’s a new kind of antivaxer I haven’t heard of before..

If I could have one wish it would be perfect health for the rest of my life and I could just beam up when I’m ready. I would only have to worry about doing wage slavery for every other amenity. I’m convinced the people in charge of insurance companies are evil - Yes - I’m in the US, in California.

395,"8 month into new job, I still hate it","To summarize, I changed jobs because of a bad boss. Took the first offer even though I knew it wasn’t really that ideal. The new job I got wasn’t really much of an upgrade. Less stressful for sure, but extremely boring compared to the old one (maybe I like crazy bosses after all? Lol). The make matters worse, the job role significantly changed because of the pandemic into something I don’t like doing at all. 

Would it be bad to start job searching now? I’m not miserable, but definitely not happy either. I’m also taking into consideration the fact that this pandemic might make the job search harder than it usually is into starting job hunting now rather than wait to finish a full year.

412,You can't whine about having to take care of poor people yourself if you believe economic systems shouldn't be responsible for meeting people's needs to begin with.,"If you support a system where the needs of humans are only met under certain circumstances then there are going to forever be circumstances created where humans do not have their needs met. If you support that system, then you support the idea that many, many, many people are going to be in need constantly. If you want a system where many, many, many people are in need, then people like you who support and take part in your own system are responsible for those unable or unwilling to participate in it. 

We're currently doing it the Capitalist way. They're ""winning,"" so why do they spend so much time whining about lazy people again? You're getting your way. You wanted a world where needs are not met by default, so they aren't being met. You don't get to then complain that it's unfair for you to have to take care of them or that others will have to. It's your system. We're doing it your way, so stop whining. You don't think that human needs should be met by default, and now you and the people who believe and participate in your system get to pay the consequences for it. 

If you don't think humans should have to be directly responsible for one another lives then stop denying them lives in the first place. Treat them like adults because they are adults and should be treated with kindness and love. If you continue to refuse to do that, then you will always live in a world where people like yourself are going to have to take care of the people being left behind. That isn't our problem.

I've quit my job a few months ago to go back to school to graduate over the internet.

My mom and a good friend said i should take it and see if it is actually ok and it's good money i could make but like i am in absolute fear. my last burnout was heavy and i feel like i just want get some more progress on my school stuff and enjoy atleast a bit more time of not being suicidal or atleast back in heavy depression.

424,I fell for another marketing book- review for slashed it by unsah malik,"I was sceptical to begin with- but I bought her book anyway- thinking there might reallly be something “different” that no other book/course has- and the reality is everything she has in her book is out online- you just need to look for it. ( it’s all right in your face)
I am the fool who fell for her marketing gimmicks so it’s honestly my fault. 

The reason why i wanted to write this to all  of you today  is that I don’t want desperate/struggling people falling  under the spell of marketing books/courses. It’s toxic and it will never end. Look guys- there is no such special recipe  for you to make it or  knowledge that hasn’t been discovered.
“ you’ll only need to have my experience to know what I know”- are all apart of the marketing these gurus do to entice you. They need to make bread too- it’s part of their business. They put time and effort into their products - but most don’t have businesses of their own- their business is their marketing product. 


Not to invalidate today’s social media gurus/marketers who write/make courses/books and blogs about marketing/social media are not giving  anything different..They’re just the type of guys who sell shovels during a gold rush.:. 

Now, going back to Unsah malik’s book- I don’t have anything against it- it’s kind of a 101 guide/dictionary to social media. It’s a super run in the mill definition based book... though, what i find so unsettling is not being able yo critique anything in her book.. and her being on top of dmca’ing people for apparent “ power phrasing “ etc etc... her book is empty..i wasted money on it- and regret it. I was wishing to learn more about actual marketing - not “ the algorithm doesn’t matter it’s all your content - or “ how influencers get approached by brands” ..... 

I really envisioned something else.. 

Lesson learned- be the dude who sells the shovels in a gold rush. Since anything marketing related gets the highest cpm, more traffic on blogs etc etc

All this makes me feel sad...


I feel like we all need to learn old school marketing/advertising , not something gurus come out with every year. Technology is changing quick... something that was popular a few years ago won’t work today.

437,How do jobs try to prevent you from taking family or medical leave?,"I work for a company that frequently puts people on performance plan. You a couple weeks to get out of performance plan before getting fired. However I believe you can get on fam/medical leave after getting notified you are on the performance plan. And though you might not be paid during this leave, it can stretch out your time at the company (since other companies value your 'experience').

However I noticed a lot of people I know were put on this performance plan before 12 months at the company. Now that I think about it, this is probably intentional, because if you are not at a company for 12 months you can't use your leave. 

Are there any other things to watch out for? Such as your leave request will be denied?

446,Financial freedom vs wage slavery,"Let me just start by saying that I'm aware a vast majority of us are not ""anti-work"" in a sense that they're lazy bums who refuse to work at all. Instead, the trend im noticing is that there's a ton of unnecessary ""fluff"" in our current system preventing millions of people from working on their own craft, avoiding debt bondage, obtaining a livable wage, better work conditions, dressing comfortably, having time off for important matters, and so sooo many more things that separate the indentured slave from a free man or woman. 

However, there's a very small yet very important step that separates the financially free vs the wage slaves which is the mindset that the economy doesn't run your life.

It doesnt matter if you're a millionaire or working for minimum wage, people are afraid of money because they're ultimately controlled by it. It's only those who learn to free their minds that are truly financially free and there's plenty of proof to back this up on the web.

I've known homeless people who don't need money, yet a few I've known live better than millionaires in the sense that they can do anything and go anywhere because they're in control, not the economy. In fact, one of them just took me cave diving in West Virginia not too long ago and woke up the next day going kayaking near Great Falls, VA.

I've had a multi millionaire neighbor who worked for IBM who is stressed to the max, can barely afford to pay his mortgage, has health problems from sitting in a chair all day, and drinks himself to sleep because of his overwhelming taxes. 

You finances don't decide what you can and cannot do. Ultimately, is your connections and you KNOWING that you CAN do something vs hoping you can. 

I know a lot of you will disagree on this (and this is not me bragging), but I'm almost 30 and i only work 4 hours a day making VERY little money, yet none of my wealthier friends get to do anything without their companies approval. They can't even piss without eventually getting in trouble for it. To me that just seems insane but it's completely normal for most, especially in America.

460,I might be quitting?,"I'm burning out at work, I've only been here a year but it's mind numbingly boring, and the customers are prissy and annoying who can't wipe their own asses sometimes.  But the reason I feel like quitting is because of the recent change to payroll.  Starting this month Oct. 1st they decided to stop using a company and do their own payroll, which meant on the 9th I should have got a check from them for one days work, (Oct 1st)  They chose to move the pay period instead which is cool because that should mean I get OT for Oct 1st as I now worked 6 days that pay period instead of 5.  But it also means payday changed form Thursday to Friday and well people it's Thursday and there is no check, and no direct deposit.   I've had employers fuck with my pay before by skipping weeks and lets just say I'm not a fan.  My state labor board says I have to wait 31 days without payment before I can complain but that doesn't make them any less late seeing as we were agreed upon bi-weekly pay when I was hired.  

Between this and my general desire to not work here I'm thinking of emailing my boss that I won't be returning next week.  It's not the best time to be out of work and needing to job hunt but I can see if my doordash account is still active and do that while job hunting.

466,Unreasonable expectations at work.,"Have you guys ever noticed how managers at work set unreasonable expectations in order to guilt trip people into working faster? For example, they’ll take the fastest worker’s best hour of work and then set that as the standard. If anybody complains and claims that it’s not possible, now they have someone they can point to and say that they could do it. But at the same time, only one person was ever able to achieve that, so it’s still unreasonable.

The thing is, we never agreed to produce 100 widgets per hour or whatever the bullshit number is they make up. We agreed to work at a reasonable pace and with a reasonable amount of effort when we signed up for the job. Nobody agreed to work themself to the bone. We have lives to live outside of work. It’s not fair to work someone so hard that the only thing left they can do with the last few hours of their free time is to rest and recuperate for the next work day. Then it wouldn’t truly be their free time, would it? So either pay us for those hours too or can-it about your 100 widget per hour number.

Another thing management did was play the one-sided information game. Only they get to know the number of widgets per hour that you’re producing. You’re not allowed to know the number. That way, nobody knows to question how reasonable those numbers are. If they knew the actual average, then they could use that against management, so they hid the numbers from the workers. They’d only whip them out if they thought you were going slowly to guilt-trip people into going faster.

On the floor, I heard one of the supervisors tell everybody they hadn’t met their numbers the whole week. Yeah, of course they haven’t, because the numbers you’re demanding are incredibly unreasonable! If it was a reasonable number, then they’d reach it. But in that case, management wouldn’t have an excuse to try and whip people into working faster anymore.",False,jfzcyq,Diogonni,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jfzcyq/unreasonable_expectations_at_work/,11,1

In effect antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual's internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable.""_



_""A chorus of voices exhorts kids to study science. No one stops to ask whether it is inhumane to force adolescents to spend the bulk of their time studying subjects most of them hate. When skilled workers are put out of a job by technical advances and have to undergo “retraining,” no one asks whether it is humiliating for them to be pushed around in this way. It is simply taken for granted that everyone must bow to technical necessity, and for good reason: If human needs were put before technical necessity there would be economic problems, unemployment, shortages or worse. The concept of “mental health” in our society is defined largely by the extent to which an individual behaves in accord with the needs of the system and does so without showing signs of stress.""_



_""Power depends ultimately on physical force. By teaching people that violence is wrong (except, of course, when the system itself uses violence via the police or the military), the system maintains its monopoly on physical force and thus keeps all power in its own hands.""_



_""The big problem is that people don't believe a revolution is possible, and it is not possible precisely because they do not believe it is possible.""_



_""Constitutional rights are useful up to a point, but they do not serve to guarantee much more than what could be called the bourgeois conception of freedom.

threaten the very survival of the system. The system will therefore be FORCED to use every practical means of controlling human behavior.""_


_""They want you to obey. They want you to be a sheep like they are sheep. Obedient, unquestioning piece of machinery. Sit when told to sit, stand when told to stand. They want you to give up your humanity, your autonomy for a paycheck, gold star, bigger TV. The only way to be human, the only way to be free, is to rebel. They’ll try to crush you.

I am a 25yr old female and well I’m just fed up. 

Everyday is work from 9-5, dinner, shower and sleep. Everyday is the same. This isn’t living its existing and I can’t do it anymore. 

The wages stay the same but the cost of living rises. I’m struggling. I have to move back in with my parents, I’m not ashamed about that but this is not how I thought my life would turn out at all. 

I have very few people in my life, I’m surrounded by people who just hustle and hustle and are never off social media. I can’t find anyone with real depth. 

I wish life was more simple. I wish the work world and society in general wasn’t so fucked up. I’ve always dreamt of having a very simple flexible job that pays well, living in the country side with a big beautiful yellow farm house surrounded by sunflower fields and  growing my own food and lots of animals, falling in love with someone and travelling the world with them, then maybe having kids one day. 

This feels so impossible and a million miles away. I’d need two jobs or heck 3 to even consider buying a house, I’ve no money to travel and you can’t travel anyway. I’m afraid of being alone, no offence but I’ve given up on men 😂 and I don’t exactly have all the time in the world to have kids, maybe another 9/10 years if I’m lucky but even then I’d probably not be able to afford having them and that makes me kinda sad if I’m being completely honesty. I have considered adoption and want to as well but it it’s a very very difficult process. 

Anywayyy life is so complicated now, we all live in cramped cities closer to each other than ever, we can reach people at the touch of a button yet we are all lonelier than ever before. 

I have no idea where to go from here at all. I literally quit my job today because Im fucking burnt out. I’m worried and overthinking about my future afraid of being alone, even more with this pandemic. I have no idea what to do. I’m about to lie in for the rest of the week and eat cookies and paint and watch cooking shows but then I feel like my parents will get angry and tell me I’m being lazy especially living in their house.

477,The argument against UBI is ridiculous,"They say people won't want to work if they have a guaranteed basic income. Last I checked humans are rarely satisfied with ""just enough to get by"". That's why we go to ridiculous lengths like working the vast majority of our lives, breaking the law and risking our freedom, and straight up risking our lives in the pursuit of money.

By that same logic, if people just wanted to give up working when they became financially secure, every millionaire and billionaire would be retired. Your average CEO works 58 hours a week, even though they have enough money for 10 lifetimes by their 5th year in that position. 

Sure there would be some exceptions. Some people would be satisfied with $2000/month. But those kind of people are already likely out of the workforce, and doing gigs and odd jobs so they can live their nomadic lifestyle and travel around the country in a van or whatever. The vast majority of people would continue working like they did before, they would just have a little more money to spend, which is good for business and ultimately great for the economy.

I'm tired of everyone pretending like poor people are the problem. Poor people are just a symptom of a failing economy. There is enough to go around, but the elite are doing everything in their power to make us think there isn't. And for what? So they can look at a number with more 0's on a screen.

480,Stealing should be a human right,"There's an old argument that asks if it's moral for someone to steal a loaf of bread when they would otherwise starve to death, or to steal a life jacket from a boat with an abundance of them when they are about to drown 

In those philosophical questions, most people agree that stealing would be justified, but having to work is a slow starvation into the grave

Sure, I might not starve if I don't have an item I want, but I can very well effect my mental and physical state, and bring me closer to that end if not set me off

A candy bar might brighten my day, but a multi billion dollar boss won't even see a decimal point on their income report 

Now, people might argue if everyone does it, it would cost them more, but that should be an individual choice every person makes

When I steal from the shop, I am not in the head of every other person who might be doing the same

492,"Your work day is not 8 hours, that's just what you're being paid for. The rest is unpaid labor.","I was thinking about this the other day. It makes no sense to think of my normal job as ""8 hours.""

First of all, I'm waking up at 6am just to get ready and leave the house. If not for this shitty job I'd be sleeping in so you can bet I'm counting dragging my ass out of bed at the crack of dawn as the start to my work day. Then I need to drive 35 minutes just to get to work, that is time I am not being paid for. So now it's 7am and my work day has officially ""begun."" Ok cool so 8 hours and then I'm good? No you get a one hour lunch ""break"" that you are not paid for. Can I work through lunch and take my ""break"" at the end of the day so I can just leave early? No. It's just a one hour block that you are not being paid for, in the middle of your 8 hour work day. Ok so it's really a 9 hour work day, 8 of which you are actually paid.

Ok so now it's time to go home, so that's the end of my work day? Not unless I can teleport home and be immediately in sweatpants. Now I'm driving 35 minutes back home, I'm counting that as part of my work day as I am only doing it because I have to be at this job. Ok I'm home now, but of course I am being emailed and called and texted from work to help put out other people's fires. I could be an asshole and ignore them until tomorrow, and sometimes I do, but these are just other poor wage slaves like me so that doesn't feel right.

496,How do you do it?,"I came across a book a few years ago that changed my life and how I think about my time, and what I really value. There were aspects of antiwork in it, and so after a few years of feeling this way, I found this subreddit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got a new job just before lockdown, and although the hours aren't what I wanted, I understood I needed to accept it in order to actually get a job. It seems like no one is hiring for workers who are casual or part-timers. I just want to earn enough to keep my head above water. I don't need much in life.

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard for me too, because I have SPD and anxiety. There's plenty of jobs I quite literally can't do at all, or if I do them, I'm going to be very overwhelmed and burnt out. Despite my stance on work, if you treat me nice, I'm happy to work hard. This is the attitude I've gone into my job with, and although I have good days there, I've also been unfairly told off for random shit, and thrown under the bus on more than a few occasions. It's only been 7 months and I've cried heavily twice due to things that have occurred there.

&amp;#x200B;

The actual environment is good (I am outside mostly), and the actual tasks are decent enough to do, like 70% of the time... but I just feel like the culture of this workplace, and honestly workplaces in general, just want you to be and expect you to be emotionless robots who work at 100% efficiency, and nothing else. They also want you to be their emotional punching bag for when the boss is randomly in a sour mood. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm already tired. I'm depressed because 2 days ago I had to make the choice to put my dog down and I went into work today and just knew they expected me to be on top of my shit - just ignore my feelings, just be there 100% present working hard.

If an AI can compete in chess tournaments and win, understand math, science, religion, and social institution, then there is no reason anyone should have to flip burgers to scrape a living off rocks. It takes no morals to run numbers on money. It takes no common sense. So why bother forcing someone to waste years of their life doing busy work? Really the only reason I can see is for the people in power to maintain power and continue to subjugate the people they deem lesser than themselves.

I have been in favor of a general labor strike since early 2019, when I realized so much of what I do is bullshit to keep me complacent to being fucked my whole life. I have a job now, teaching, and I accept that I am underpaid because I am influencing the lives of the future, who could grow up to carry the will of my this movement. But if we decided tomorrow to go on a nationwide general labor strike, I would be there, and I think my colleagues would follow my example because I work with a small group of people who believe in the power of society. We must show our future adults that it is okay to stand up for what you believe is just and fair.

I am still waiting for it to happen, and I encourage everyone else following this sub to strive for it. A real, nationwide general labor strike. We already know this is where it hurts the man - that's why they forced kids back in school and us back to work. They MUST maintain their power and wealth, it is all they have.

520,The Story of a Lazy Man,"Once upon a time there was a very lazy man. He was so lazy that he didn’t even chew his food.
Seeing that he did not want to work at all, all the peasants in the village decided to hang him because he was not a good example for their community.
One day two villagers went to the lazy man’s house. They put him in a cart and took him to the gallows.
On the way to the gallows they met a lady. She did not know anything about the lazy man. She thought he was ill and those two villagers would take him to the doctor. The villagers told her that he was lazy not ill and they were taking him to the gallows because he was not a good example for their community. When the lady heard that, she felt pity for the lazy man. She decided to shelter him in her barn where she had plenty of crumbled bread for him to eat.
“What a lucky man! He is so lazy and has got a lot of good luck!” said the villagers. “Wanna go there?” they asked him.
“Is the bread softened enough?” asked the lazy man.
“What a question! I can’t believe my ears! You can soak it by yourself, can’t you?” said the lady.
“What do you think? Wanna soak the bread by yourself or not?” the villagers asked the lazy man.
“No way”, said the lazy man.
“I prefer being hung to soaking the bread by myself”. Let’s go to the gallows! added the lazy man.
On hearing that the lady told the villagers the lazy man deserved to be hung.
So the villagers took him to the gallows. Thus all the villagers got rid of the lazy man.
Since then nobody in that village has dared to be lazy any more.",False,je1rwt,FabianStrifeTulip,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/je1rwt/the_story_of_a_lazy_man/,3,1

526,I realized I constitutionally can't be antiwork in my country,"I'm French and I was lazily reading bits of our Constitution, just for fun (I was bored at work). 

We have something in France called the *Bloc de Constitutionalité*, which is a serie of 4 texts that all have the sme value as the Constitution. In it, we have, of course, our constitution of 1958 (the Fifth Republic), the Declaration of Rights of Man and the Citizen of 1789 (revolutionary heritage), the Environment Chart of 2004, and the Preamble of the Constitution of 1946 (4th Republic, and yeah we had so many republics and constitutions that we refer to them in our current one). 

Anyway, in the Preamble of 1946 (which as, I repeat, exactly the same strength and constitutional value as the actual constitution), we have this article: 

&gt; ***5.*** *Chacun a le devoir de travailler et le droit d'obtenir un emploi. Nul ne peut être lésé, dans son travail ou son emploi, en raison de ses origines, de ses opinions ou de ses croyances.* 

Translation: **Everybody has the duty to work**

That's it. That's all. Of all the duties a citizen should have, our country decided ut was important to specify, black on white, that work was the duty of a citizen. 

Opposing it would be like opposing the right to vote or the freedom of speech. Those are constitutional values. I'm sick of it. 

Also, I read it carefully, and while there is several ***rights*** that are guaranteed in our constitution, the sole ***duty*** constitutionally guaranteed is the duty to work.

There are not many warehouses yet that work like this because it is still quite expensive now, but over time it will become cheaper and fewer and fewer people will be needed. These are still relatively simple tasks, but if you look at the development in terms of artificial intelligence and so on, I think that it is only a question of time before it is simply no longer worth hiring people. I think that one might introduce some kind of tax for the machines that every company pays to the state every month for each machine and with these taxes that are paid for the machines one could then give the people so everyone would have money without working.

I work with our warehouse department whenever one of our other warehouses wants to pick up product from us. I get the order processed to customer service, they send me back confirmation that the order has been put in the system, and I send that confirmation back to the warehouse that wants the order. They send a truck, pick up their order, like clockwork. This time, their stuff didn’t get loaded. My boss reaches out to me because Shibu (the guy that don’t like me) said ALL of our orders are being messed up which is completely false. This is one instance where they did not send a truck and I am being blamed for it. I’m not logistics, I have
Been doing this process for years with no problems and now the one time something happens, it’s my fault? It is the responsibility of the other warehouse to pick up their product. I simply make sure the order gets down to the warehouse. How is that my fucking fault? I have no control over whether or not a truck is sent. So I take it upon myself to reach out to the other warehouse, tell them I am being blamed for this, and I need to find out what happened. They state in the email that this is not my fault and this is on their logistics team. I sent that email to my boss and told him I reached out to the logistics team, and I hope to know something soon. I literally had to stop what I was doing to prove that I had nothing to do with the error. I have to do this all the time and it is overwhelming and tiresome.

• These managers don't actually have a team under them, they are just called ""managers""

• Their skills are extremely limited, in my opinion to, emailing, being in meetings., and maybe some data entry here and there

• No one does any ""actual work"" i.e. if they are an engineer department, no one does any of the design, except for maybe 1 person out of 5, the rest are ""managers""

I dont feel challenged, i dont feel like any of this training is useful, and after hearing about people being here 10 plus years I almost instantly wanted to leave. like youve been here how long? and youre doing this? no shade or hate but I feel like theres nothing I can do to resist this shit anymore. they got me 5 days a week for however many hours and Im supposed to feel lucky that i have this opportunity? wtf, like no you need me cause no one else wants to do this shit!!!! I hate the whole idea that your employer is nice for giving you a job and you should go above and beyond just to keep it. Youre absolutely bonkers if you think Im going to do your menial shit for nothing. Im all for helping people and I do for nothing in return alot, but this isnt that and people need to get that. helping your boss and helping the unfortunate are two completely seperate entities that need to stop being the basis for most arguments against a UBI. ""well if people had free money no one would work"" noooooo, If i didnt have to stress about my basic bills to live I would have a lot more energy and focus on projects that I actually enjoy and put effort into. Yeah there could be outliers who wouldnt be productive members of society,BUT THERE ALWAYS ARE, there are right now and always will be. So instead of holding the GP back cause of a few rap scallions, help push everyone forward and some of the bad apples will fall in line. Win Win for everyone. thanks for listening or not, either way got my anger out but still probably gonna quit sooner than planned.

586,"So like, anyone figured out their way to anti-work? If so, what's it like?","I *kind of* have. Not in an ideal way but honestly I'm so relieved I could weep.

I'm the breadwinner. I'm also a newish mom after a hard fucking pregnancy. I worked until 3 days before my c-section, for a sideways baby.

I am white collar. I did food service for years, but fought my way up up up to Corporate America. Hated it. Switched to non-profit/government. Hated that less.

Suffered chronic health issues the whole time. Mostly just migraines, but if you have 1-5 migraines a week, you know that ""just a migraine"" can feel the same as ""just an ice pick in my eye socket again, except invisible"". So I need to work for insurance, right? Right.

Get married. Husband works lower paying blue collar jobs, sometimes part time. Preggo. Stay home with baby for 11 weeks and get back to it. Husband works nights and watches kiddo days; I work days and watch kiddo nights. It sucks. Marriage is strained. I have Post-partum Depression.

Then... pandemic *jazz hands*

I get, somehow, because fuck me I guess, reactivated Epstein-Barr Virus AND COVID-19 in March. So, mono and COVID-19. I don't work for 3 months, because so very sick. But I also start feeling better in other ways. Marriage improves. PPD resolves. I spend all this time with my little dude. He's a hilarious monster baby.

We decide to make this permanent. We fought tooth and nail to buy a house years ago, and decided to sell it now. We are making a profit, despite having been house-poor all this time.

We are moving out of this area that depresses us where I had my great job to a community closer to home, friends, opportunities for my husband. I take my skills and find a way to turn them into consulting (it is easier than you think if you are a fan of the gig-ish lifestyle). We will buy land and build with our profits. Our state, Washington (not DC for non-Americans, the one with Seattle in it) will have a public healthcare option in 2021, so fuck it, we will try that next year.

Is it kind of uncertain? Yes. Is it hugely stressful during a pandemic? Yes. But you know what, the wages here are high enough that if we go humble, we will be fine on low wages. So that is what we will do. A small home, with exactly one of each thing that we need and want, and no more. And time for me to heal, to watch the kid, to work part-time, to let my husband grow his career because he WANTS to work, but doing something he doesn't hate.

If I had any tips for you - and we sure as shit ain't there yet, but we're trying - 

* VOTE. Vote for leaders who support things like higher minimum wages, public healthcare options, social safety nets. Vote in your local elections because that's what will affect you in this way MOST. Shit, run for election if that's your jam! 
* Know your real estate market. We happened to know our market was the hottest it has ever been and that empowered us to cut our losses on this house that needs a lot to be what we want it to be and sell it for a good price to folks who want it more than we do. We also weren't dicks about it and aren't selling way above value.
* Be bold. If you are making money right now and hating it, consider buying property when the market cools off next year (easier said than done, but if you can swing it, the inventory will pick up, the prices will go down, and rich fucks will be selling off their second homes in tourist areas like mine, and especially in the less beautiful months, you may score a deal. We did.) Or consider moving to an area with a lower cost of living. Or a higher minimum wage. If minimum wage is $7.25, and Washington's next door is $13.50, maybe it's worth it to find a way to move.
* Use this pandemic, if you can. If you can pay off a shitton of high-interest debt now because of, well, obviously not a higher unemployment pay, because fuck our government, but eventually that, or a stay of rent, or crashing with family, or deferring your mortgage, DO IT. That may give you the leeway to get great credit (which I fucking hate but is necessary at the moment) to get that loan for a tiny house or whatever.
* If you are just barely getting by, I am so sorry if not a thing of this applies to you. It's not your fault. I have been there. Recently.
* If you can, team up. We are buying land and building not just a home for us, but two mini homes for relatives. They will get hella cheap rent, we will get their rental income to help with our mortgage, and we all get to be in a bubble together where we can hang out, grow food, and survive a little better than we were apart.
* Lift your fellow human up. We could have just bought a place, and it's more risk to build 3 small houses instead of 1, but we realized we could help empower two individuals on a fixed income due to disability to live better while helping ourselves, too, and after a lot of thoughtful discussion, it felt like a win for all.

We aren't there yet. But we are getting there. It's hard but exciting.

backstory- i struggled a lot  with depression ocd and sducidal thoughts since i was 15 and still going to earlier this year (i’m 19 now)
but the lockdown gave me time to just be free i had no work for a large period and i was just left alone with myself and i feel like i’ve really began to heal and recover 
i haven’t felt sducidal or depressed in a long time since this change in my life, i loved going the gym when i wanted i was there all the time or training up my local football pitch and spent my spare time learning stocks marketing and video editing, i’m big on exercise health and fitness i want to make that into a career with multiple streams of income ideally 
- but i am not getting the time to continue learning this 

i have had a new job for 2 weeks now because my parents pushed me to go full time and i just can’t cope i feel all progress i have made is slowly reversing i’m going back to bad habits, being very angry wanting to get high,eat bad foods and can’t be bothered exercising

I cant sleep because my physical body has hardly moved and isn’t tired meanwhile my mind is destroyed and begins to spiral

why not just live a happy life why can no one around me see my point of view ??? if i don’t have a job i’m not respected but i could be working harder than the people who have a basic deadend j b and then in a few years time with the investment i have made into myself and as a person i know i’d be much better off !!

609,A different kind of hell,"I composed this thought a bit ago and figured it would fit well with the philosophy supported by the folks here.

A real tragedy of the current era for many people, is that humans are sentient enough to dream of a wonderful future,

self-aware enough to know exactly what they want to do, or who they want to be,

have access to enough technology and media to see how many others do have access to the funds, education, emotional and physical safety, and stability needed to accomplish such dreams (so those who cannot, know it is not impossible)

and yet be so many years and systemic barriers from achieving those dreams themselves.

To see the moon and long to touch it *and yet be so far from doing it* ....it is not always motivational or inspiring the way positive psychology would try to spin such an encounter. 

Instead, it is sometimes just a different kind of hell. To know there may be potential *but also know that nothing that is potential is guaranteed to become actual*.

And so it is with the dreams of millions of humans who have tens of thousands of dollars of student debt and are, with varying degrees, working minimum wage jobs, or are out of work due to burnout or other reasons, watching Netflix and YouTube and dreaming of other lands (or decades) where maybe our dreams could have come true. 

And still other people have the audacity to ask why anxiety, depression, suicide, homelessness, and general upset have ""seemed to increase"" as the ""modern age"" advances. 

I suppose this post is also just a sad human looking for empathy, vs suggestions to try harder or do more of this or that as if the world we are born into is our fault.

My job has become infinitely worse since the pandemic. I’m in the hotel industry and while we were hit hard, we have remained open since March with business slow but steady. Since the pandemic, the quality of our guests has gone to complete shit. In the past month alone, we’ve had someone overdose in one of our rooms, several homeless people who have skipped out on paying, prostitutes, drug addicts, and drunk perverts harassing our mostly female staff. To add insult to injury, we’ve been expected to take on the extra work of the furloughed staff responsibilities without any extra pay. I was asked to come into work an hour early twice this week because my coworker got sick, something my manager apparently didn’t think of when he decided to knock us down to the skeleton crew to save a few bucks in March. If anyone wants to take a extra day off, it means all of us have to shift our schedule or work an extra day with barely any notice. Let’s not mention the amount of verbal abuse I get from guests everyday; being called a communist for wearing a mask and having grown adults throwing temper tantrums because *GASP* they have to ASK for housekeeping or it won’t be done!!!!????The fucking entitlement  and stupidity of people is absolutely disgusting that I have lost some of my faith in humanity. My coworker had a guest throw a balled piece of paper at her the other day and what did my manager do? Absolutely nothing. When we go to him with our concerns he laughs it off and gaslights us into thinking it’s no big deal or that we should just be expected to take it.

Today, after yet another horrible interaction with an ungrateful, shitty guest, who decided to berate me because she didn’t get her SUPER important extra towels, I finally decided that I was fucking done. I went into the bathroom and broke down. I called my boyfriend and told him I can’t take it anymore. He told me to just walk out right then and there but I didn’t. The ONLY reason I didn’t is because of my coworkers.
I shared my concerns with them and turns out every single of of them feels exactly the same way I do. They are burned out , fed up, and tired of being gaslit by our GM. We’ve decided to confront him on Monday telling him what our demands and needs are. Honestly I really don’t know if there’s anything he could say to make me stay. I could accept a raise, but is it even fucking worth it to sacrifice my sanity and health for a bunch of people that couldn’t give enough of a fuck about me to wear a mask for two minutes while I check them in or a manager who can’t be bothered to defend his staff? I don’t think so.

The only job I can think of that isn’t going to complete crush my soul is something, literally anything working from home so I can spend time with my dog and be a. I’m so fucking tired of slaving my life away to make someone else richer while I sit her and degrade myself going to a job that I despise everyday.

I was speaking with one of my old co-workers (B) who told me that she saw one of her friends (S) crying at work. B then asked S what was wrong. S told B that she has been applying for the jobs in the bank but not getting any because the manager won't sign the forms. This has been going on even before I left that toxic environment. 

He would not sign the forms for anyone. Not only is it his duty to lick the ass of the higher up bank personnel but it is his duty to hold people down and hold them back.

This is just my story, not a guide or advice. Just something that happened to me. Maybe it'll resonate with some of you.

---------

""But what about my health care plan?"" I asked myself.

What will happen if I get sick or get injured? Can I really afford to quit? How can I pay my medical bills?

Let's take a step back and look at my stats at this point. It's 2016.

* 24 years old male
* Working as a Tech consultant for 3 years straight out of college
* Saw a doctor exactly one time since getting employed--to remove a mole on the back of my head (aka purely cosmetic)

Not exactly the shining example of a person who should be worried about health care. Why am I worrying about losing my ultra premium corporate insurance policy?

---------

**""But what about my health care plan?""**

That was the response I gave to myself when faced with the decision to quit my corporate job. Not ""how am I going to buy food?"" or ""what am I going to do for a living?"" or even ""what's my next job?"" No. I was worried about my health insurance when faced with this life-changing decision.

All the blogs I've ever read on the subject all parrot the same ""advice."" 

1. Make sure you have another job lined up
2. Make sure to interview / job hunt while you still are employed
3. Keep your resume up to date
4. Don't give up!!!

But holy shit, how am I supposed to spend 40+ hours a week reaching out to recruiters, polishing my resume, practicing interview questions, when my soul is already dead by the time 6PM rolls around and all I want to do is melt my brain with some YouTube anime clips?

Not to mention, none of the blogs I've read talked about losing your health care plan.

---------

It's May 2016. Exactly 3 years after I graduated college and exactly 3 years since I joined my first corporate job. How did I know that? I wasn't keeping track like a prisoner making marks on the wall--I didn't need to. I had LinkedIn. Every year I get a shiny new red notification congratulating me on my work anniversary.

I need to get the hell out of here.

But what about my health plan? I can't quit. Then I have to figure out the whole Obamacare thing and what the hell is a state marketplace? It's illegal to not have healthcare now? What does that mean? Will they come and arrest me?

WHAT ABOUT MY HEALTH PLAN??? I CAN'T QUIT.

---------

One month later. June 2016. After a month of back and forth with my inner self. Opening countless tabs about unemployment health benefits and closing them immediately once it gets too nerve-racking.

I realize something **huge**.

It wasn't really about the health plan.

It never was and it never will be.

It's not the health plan, it's my 401(k). Wait no, its my employee stock benefits. No wait actually, it's my EOY bonus. But wait what about my vested stock options?

A million different reasons I couldn't quit.

I was like a little kid--afraid of the broomstick in his closet because his imagination turned it into the boogeyman. 

The only way to convince myself that the boogeyman is not real is to just open the door (and maybe piss myself in the process)

Businesses should be providing information on what they provide to their employees - wages, benefits, hours of operation, etc.. All I am seeing, however, is a strict syllabus outlining everything required of the candidate(s), as if their lives should revolve around the business. They are written like college courses rather than a place to make money to survive. No thank you. I bypass all listings like this, they come off as arrogant. It is hilarious to see so many postings like this, with pages and pages detailing strict, thorough and complicated job details and what is expected without any compensation information - these posts are typically for minimum wage positions. It is sad, and disgusting.  Too much is expected for low pay and yet employers cannot even be bothered putting in proper compensation and benefits information, at the least. We have lives and families of our own; withholding such information on listings suggest that business/job should come first, everything else last. Things have to change. Slave-like labor, brainwashing, and exhaustive work-culture needs to change. Ones value and self worth should not be dictated by the job/career that they hold. Postings like this are becoming more abundant; we need to end the notion that work is a 1 way street of what we can do for employers, and realize that it is a 2 way street.",False,jbycbv,bloodredroses6,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jbycbv/sick_of_seeing_job_postings_without_compensation/,10,1
637,I'm about to be homeless and I keep on being exploited. I feel like I'm going insane.,"I hope this doesn't get taken down, but I recently lost my job again just after two days of working and I'm about to be homeless in a few days. I just left California to go to another state because I lost my job and I couldn't afford it anymore. The last 2 jobs I had were from temp agencies and in every single one I didn't get a write up, a warning or anything. I would just get a text message that my assignment has ended. No, I'm not going to act like I'm a perfect worker and I go above and beyond, but I was just working at a normal pace, the worst thing that people said was that I was quiet. I really don't understand what being quiet has to anything if I'm doing my job. 

 The first job I got fired from was amazon. I have a post about that. I got fired because I was told I had over an hour of tot. It was because I switched my device and forgot to log in and the manager said they would ""check the cameras"". Of course they didn't and said they saw that I wasn't doing anything for an hour and I was. The second job was right after this one. I was working as well. I was working for 2 weeks. The manager didn't seem to have an issue with me, but one night I forgot to get a clip to clip some of the boxes because we needed those and some people at the warehouse were making a big deal about it and talking about me and asking me if I needed help. I said no, I'm fine I just didn't know we needed a clip and the next day I received a message that my assignment has ended. I couldn't afford to stay in the state anymore and told my landlord and the first thing out of his mouth was,"" But what about my $300?"" I was worried about homelessness and he was just worried about getting his $300. He doesn't do shit. He bought another house so he can rent out the living room and 3 rooms so he was making at least 4 grand a month from people including me. He pretended like he was so concerned but said I needed to leave early because I didn't have $300 to give him.

 My most recent job I was fired from I only worked 2 days. I wasn't even on my phone, chatting with people, or taking hour long bathroom breaks. The fucking person that was teaching me even said I was going well. The only thing people kept talking about was how quiet I was and I'm still wondering why does it matter? I got a message 2 days ago saying my assignment ended, no warning, nothing. I've been crying myself to sleep and waking up crying ever since then and no one cares.

  My ex boyfriend still lives with his dad and said he would ask him if I could stay with him. I ended up having to talk to him and he was kind of passive aggressive. He asked me if I was evulated for a mental illness and I said no and all I could think was why do you think something is wrong with me. He's also a pastor and said I needed the holy ghost and I just started getting really offended and annoyed and started to get an attitude. He said I could stay on his bus, but I'm starting to think it's not a good idea. I'm sure in his mind he thinks I'm just slow and I need to be ""healed"" and he wants to take credit when I get another job and I'm able to leave. I'm an atheist anyway, so all of shit doesn't matter to me anyway. At this point I'm starting to think I'd rather figure it out on the streets instead of being exploited by some pastor. 

 I'm not saying I'm perfect, but shit happens and I've had a lot of bad things happen to me. I've grown up with an abusive family, has been bullied and isolated most of my life. For people that are going to ask me or tell me that I should go back to my family I'd rather not. When I was there my mom was in a competition with me,jealous of me and would take most of the money I made. On top of that I had to pay over $600 a month in giving her money for whatever she wanted, the internet bill, and our phone bill.Before anyone just asks,"" wHY dOnT U JuSt Tell HER nO?!"" She would proceed to beat me, tell me how ungrateful I'm, take my money anyway and then I would be gaslighted by my entire family to just do what she says.I'm just so tired of being treated like trash. I can't even cry anymore. Why does it have to be like this? Why do people think I'm less than because I'm about to be homeless? Because I'm not extroverted and I don't want to be bubbly to random people at work that don't give a fuck about me? My life has to come to this...I can't even put into words how defeated I feel.",False,jbyo8f,425425throwaway,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jbyo8f/im_about_to_be_homeless_and_i_keep_on_being/,18,1

Is it of to use femoris at work?
He] By Piti Pain, Editor at LinkedIn News
Updated oh ago

Is it appropriate to use femoris while
communicating at work? Recruited Dam
Karpiak has spared a vital debate after
meeting that he was told smile faces are not
considered professional. There are several
schools of thought: Some believe that femoris
can help streaming work conversation — think
Black's custom femoris — while also helping
people foster bonds. But a 2017 study found
that using smile faces might actually make the
tender look incompetent, while not conveying
warmth as intended.

No matter what happens, it's never enough and it appears nothing will ever be enough. 

The most important takeaway is that the difference between the absolute minimum viable output and working extra and exceeding expectation is EXACTLY THE SAME. There is no situation in which the output will be accepted without the mandate to produce more.

"" Although Epicureanism is a form of [hedonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism) insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from ""hedonism"" as [colloquially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquially) understood.

Coworker's patience &amp; attitude is tested while on shift/work but we're friends right after every shift. Weird?

So the new HR lady(late 20's-early 30's) introduces herself and gives a little speech about how happy she's been to be here these past 4 months and yadda yadda yadda. She also took off her mask to give this speech(5 feet in front of everyone),like I don't mind having a seat apart between me and my coworker eating panda express outside for the meeting. Are crew is around 10 people,so I feel like it's a bit safer then interacting with new people everyday. 

Anyways she goes on about how she went to all the stores and how all the sales people were talking about what a great job the night shift warehouse crew was doing,and how they were saying something along the line of ""you're the real heroes"" or something along that line.

I rolled my eyes and just imagined that doubt meme,most of the sales people don't even know that are shift exists, let alone know what we do to compliment on all the ""hard work"" we do. I hate when management brings up the phrase ""hard work"" when there talking about the work we do. Like you acknowledge how physically demanding,odd hours,and all the hours we work. Yet only a few of us got $1 raises this year and everyone else got nothing,despite how well the company is doing.

She could of said that directly to us with out pretending it was coming from someone else. I figured she was just nervous and wanted to say something nice to us,until she shifted her speech into how she was talking to the salespeople at the stores and mentioned to them that she had to go to this employee of the quarter meeting for the night shift right after.

So I'm trying to make some money off of youtube..

But I'm also trying to make content people want to see obviously..

More tricky than I thought. 

Well let me get to the point...

There's 180k members in this subreddit...

In order for me to be able to start making money I need 1000 subscribers

I currently have 14 (hahahahaha)

I'm asking, please, if anyone has a youtube they don't use, and a free moment,  please subscribe to my channel! I have 6 Google accounts I'm assuming other people also have multiple accounts? 

The reason I say if you have an account you don't use for youtube is because if you sub with your main youtube and don't like my content I'll be annoying you on your feed. Feel free to sub with main youtube too though, maybe you like some stuff

I'm still learning when it comes to editing and figuring out what people find funny. ..( I try to post funny stuff, satire, public freakouts, memes and election 2020 stuff)

I'm getting better everyday but with no income it's hard to do some things. For example I'm using a crappy phone and have no personal computer (which makes content lower quality.. Cannot do as much)

This probably won't be received well and that's fine lol please don't think I'm trying to use the subreddit.  if this is a ridiculous request; ignore..

677,The thought of having to work for the rest of my life makes me want to kill myself,"I honest to god do not see the point in existing if I’m just going to be doing shit I don’t want to do for 90% of the rest of my life. My current job is 8-5 with an hour lunch, and a 30 minute commute each way. That’s 10 hours of my 16 waking hours. By the time I get home, make dinner, do the dishes, and watch half an hour of tv, it’s time to go to bed and start all over. At best I could shave a couple of work hours off of this routine if I managed to find a different job that was closer. I’m 23. The idea of doing this shit for the next 40+ years seriously makes me want to put a bullet in my head. Work sucks the life out of me to the point I don’t even have enough energy to play video games 90% of the time. I feel trapped, like I’m suffocating, and all anybody can say is “everybody has to work” or “I don’t know what to tell you”. If the only two options for me actually are work like this or die, death seems like the more appealing choice. If I’m already this fed up I can’t imagine it being any better 5, 10, 20 years from now. I always used to tell myself I wouldn’t kill myself because it would mentally destroy my mom, but she died over a year ago now, so I don’t even have that to keep me going.

679,Pet peeves about overtime,"There's this weird subservient expectation that you have to be willing to accept any overtime opportunity. I understand that it's necessary for broke people* but none of my coworkers are broke. They are so happy to have to work another 15 hours yet they make twice as much as me. They don't need to work more.

I refuse to work overtime if it's not a real emergency (ie. snowstorms). I always get questioned about it by everyone within earshot. I don't hate my job but I just want to go home and relax. I need time to cook a healthy meal and do nothing. Most of them complain about too little time and are always eating junk -- no sense of irony. I eat like junk, too, because work saps my energy. I need *less* of it.

My involvement with work starts at 7am and ends at 3pm, Monday through Friday. If you want more, you should have put that in the job description. 

My last point: I work so I can afford to live and enjoy my time while I'm alive. If I don't have time because I'm working too much, then my job isn't doing its job.

I also take a full hour lunch break every day.  I legitimately feel guilty for doing it, because I'm aware that my boss doesn't take any breaks at all, and my coworker takes like 5-10 minute lunch breaks and works while eating.

In a meeting today (that went an hour and a half past 5), my coworker said to us that ""we"" need to really buckle down and work harder and ""not take hour lunch breaks"".

682,Sometimes I think collapse would be fun just to see HR and corporate goons panic,"Obviously I would be the first to go in such a scenario being the polar opposite of a rugged survivalist but...such is my hatred for HR and those who absorb the corporate culture/philosophy into their very being, that in a post-apocalyptic world, I don't think they'd thrive as they do currently. 

My issue with this world is how utterly restrictive it is. I'm under no illusion that a post apocalyptic world would be better (it would be horrific) but part of the appeal of the fantasy is that the old structures, which you are forced to conform to, would be destroyed. This would tie in with the appeal of fantasy novels; if you were struggling in your village, you could go off on a quest and do well elsewhere. This option has probably always been lacking in one way or another in the human world as most humans are pack animals and homogeneity is inevitable from the eusocial nature of human behaviour. This is also the problem with the corporate/working world, if you are unable to conform, then you're out of sight, out of mind. The corporate world is so obsessively, compulsively restrictive with its criteria for the ""acceptable employee"" that loads of people are going to be excluded and the hikikomori in Japan are a testament to that. 

Anyway, it's partly just imagining a freer world and watching the tables finally being turned on those smug robots we call HR workers.

of"" first thing I was taught was
that we are all supposed to
work. Very good, indeed.

And then I learned that I was
disgraced because I did not take to
work. But, somehow, in argument, I
always carried the day.

By position was simple. Progressive
people are desirable citizens? Yes. In-
venous are progressive? Oh, certainly.
Inventors do away with work? He-es.
Well, then, if it is respectable to do
away with work, why is it not moral
to refrain from work?

The fact of the matter is, we work
only because of our ignorance. He
once worked at pushing a wheelbarrow.
It was perfectly right to do it. But
along came an automobile. Now it is
perfectly moral to refrain from sweat-
ing behind a wheelbarrow. Is that not
funny? It is.

In time inventors (and they are hon-

entirely. It will then be perfectly moral
to idle.

I know how helpless it feels like, you know you look like a clown but still you want to earn your keep. It's sad that no one at least made him feel useful or offer advice, and just went about their jobs like he was invisible. It would foster a ""me vs them"" mentality in the long run if this is a common occurrence.

695,Y’all realize that we’re just slaves right? Crops of the rich.,"For example. The rich own the government. Everyone knows this. At least they should. The rich lobby. Meaning they pay our representatives money to introduce new laws, or say yes or no to certain laws. They control what laws and rights exist. They fund campaigns. Which means they use their money to get certain people into office. Yes this includes presidents. And in return the people in office give power/control to the rich or give them favors. 

The rich control the government so much that they own the military. How do we know this? The government has lied to us. Created fake terrorists attacks. Ect. To make us, the citizens, be okay with going to war with certain countries. Afghanistan. Vietnam. Ect. What do they do in those countries? Well we know that as well. They over throw the governments, or encourage the citizens to over throw the governments through manipulation. Then companies swoop in and steal all of the countries resources. Just like in old times. We have war to steal resources. Companies also do this without war, in many ways. Basically giving countries loans to help them industrialize and progress, the countries do, but end up not being able to pay the loans back, and they fall deep into debt. The countries then have to sell all of the oil to the companies at super cheap prices  to get out of debt. Basically just scamming countries. Tricking them into selling off their resources at a small fraction of the would be original price.

So how does slavery mainly come into this? 

Well we are crops. It’s illegal to live without working. What? How? You can’t fish. You can’t build a house. Collect rain water, in many places. Use solar panels to get electricity, in many places. Live on, or own land. Hunt. Dig wells to get your own water. Trade crops or supplies with other people. Ect. Without all paying the government money. Constantly. You have to pay the government money to do all of those things, the things required to be free and not work. Meaning you can’t be free and not work. You can try to find a way to live without working but you won’t be able to, it’s set up this way. You cannot live without working, without breaking one of these laws. You either work or go to jail. If you try to keep your freedom and resist jail, you die. For the non conformists, it’s work or die. There is no option to remain free. Slave or die.

Have you ever wondered why when countries go to war they don’t just bomb the rich, or the government, or the individuals in power?

Have you ever wondered? The ones in power are the ones who did the wrong. They are the ones in control. Why do they bomb and attack the citizens instead?

Because citizens are crops. Money machines. All of the large bombings. Like Hiroshima. They didn’t bomb the powerful people in control. They bombed large cities. Why? Money. They wanted to harm the elites crop. Their power. Their wealth. Same as burning a farmers cornfield. 

You are a crop. A pawn. A slave. Put in a system you don’t question. You conform. Do your job. Die.

Why do we do this? Because everyone else is doing it, it’s ‘normal.’ People naturally like to follow the herd, and conform. It’s also because we are put in a position that makes us comfortable. It’s risky to seek out something better, it’s easier and more assuring to just stay put and be comfortable. Our brains are hardwired to fear the unknown. To stay away from it unless absolutely necessary. To enjoy being comfortable, and to dislike change. The people in power use this to their advantage. They put us in a place just comfortable enough, so that we decide to accept it how it is, and not strive for something better, for the unknown, the risky, and the uncomfortable. We also do it because we think luxuries (Air conditioning, house, car, cell phone, internet, ect.) will make us happy. When they don’t. Yes, they give us small hits of dopamine, but not true happiness. They often make life a little bit easier too, but thats not what’s going make us happy, just comfortable. I want you to go look at videos of kids in Africa. The ones who are living in huts. The ones in the forest, who have food, and water. They are the happiest people you will ever see. Truly happy. Learn from them. Their primitive lifestyle is what makes them happy. If they wanted to live in our society they easily could, but they choose to keep living how they’re living. They’ve figured something out most of us haven’t. 

If we all woke up, realized the truth, and decided to change we could get rid of this system. Live in peace and harmony. Be happy. We could be growing all of our own food. Getting our own water. Having farms and cattle. Living nice, happy, primitive lifestyles. 

Question, why has the number of depressed and unhappy citizens increased 1000s of times within the last 200 years? Society. The state of it. Humans are not meant to be like this. Live like this. We need to wake up. We need to wake each other up.

Enjoy the many screenshots that show who you got your information from. Bitches, join me under the bus. This is my petty revenge.","This is so petty I’m almost embarrassed to share, but at the same time, this was MUCH deserved, and I thought you folks might enjoy.

Long story short, a couple weeks ago, I was injured while on call/on the job, and took 3 days of medical leave, with the blessing and support of my supervisor/managers. All was well. Then, when I came back, I was just *immediately* fired. 

The reasons my supervisor listed on their termination letter had nothing to do with me having a disability, or being a liability to them (that would be illegal and we wouldn’t want that, would we?!); nothing about the missed work (if anything I’d been criticized for working TOO much - this is a social work field, so they encourage days off) and I’d **never, EVER** been written up for anything. 

I was eligible for a raise, had received excellent reviews, and was well-loved in the community. (I already have recommendations from the sheriff and my favorite judge, and I’m super proud of that because I truly deserve commendation for my hard work.) 

*One important thing to note is that I had a review scheduled **the day I was let go**, and planned to raise a bunch of issues about 1) our office safety and 2) these hostile, malicious, gossiping coworkers.*

So back to the letter... The reasons were all based on hearsay, and they were VERY serious allegations, all from my 2 officemate’s messages/stories. I can’t go into too much detail, but they were along the lines of: telling staff to lie for me; letting someone dangerous know where we work; threatening to bring a fucking gun to work; being on drugs; talking with coworkers about work after hours, etc etc. Ridiculous, and importantly NOT true, shit. 

I didn’t even listen to these written allegations; while I was being fired. I just heard the verbal firing (which was a completely different reason than any listed on my letter), quietly packed my office, respectfully mic-dropped my keys, and left. 

Once I got around to actually reading the defamatory and wildly inaccurate accusations on me, I really took some time to think. Not a good idea to make decisions while super hurt and sad. So I waited a few weeks. Talked to a few lawyers, but mostly tried to let it go. Would they listen to my arguments, since I never had a chance to defend myself against this defamation? Would they take action? Would they just delete my email and never read it?

I decided to find out. I’ve written a long letter politely, but firmly, demanding they redact the defamatory accusations (it’s an ‘at will’ state employer - they can put whatever the fuck they want on there, so let’s skip the lies this time maybe?) and to get to work on paying my unemployment benefits. The best part is, the letter includes about 30 time-stamped screenshots that back up my side of things.

In these screenshots, the coworkers discuss their disdain for our management; their hunt for other jobs and those various failings; making fun of management, and gossip about other coworkers. The texts are cruel, and they are juicy, AND they also disprove many of these awful rumors. 

I really can’t believe they didn’t think ALL the texts would come out if they decided to throw me under the bus by mentioning texts I’ve sent. I never talked shit on the mgmt; because I KNOW what’s in writing, stays in writing, and will *always* come back to haunt you. My texts were always encouraging and kind. Y’all’s, not so much. 

So, get haunted, bitches. 👻 Even if nothing comes of this, at least management knows to question who they get their ridiculous info from. Out. ::drops mic::",False,jae9zp,saucity,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/jae9zp/fuck_this_fire_me_immediately_when_i_return_over/,8,1

Were's a racial discrimination case that Garrett did
decide, where she wrote that being called the n-word
at work by your supervisor does not constitute a
hostile or abusive work environment. news.com
/article/race-a...

Garrett wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel in 2019 that upheld the dismissal of a
workplace discrimination lawsuit by Merry Smith, a Black Illinois transportation employee
who sued after he was fired. Smith’s claims included that he was called a racial slur by
supervisor Lloyd Robert

“The n-word is an egregious racial epithet,” Garrett wrote in Smith v. Illinois Department of
‘Transportation. “That said, Smith can’t win simply by proving that the word was uttered. He
must also demonstrate that Robert’s use of this word altered the conditions of his,

employment and created a hostile or abusive working environment.”

Garrett went on to say that Smith “introduced no evidence that Robert’s use of the n-word

changed his subjective experience of the workplace. To be sure, Smith t that his time
at the Department caused him psychological distress. But that was for reasons that prepared

his run-in with Robert and had nothing to do with his race. His tenure at the Department was

rocky from the outset because of his poor track record.”

Sweatpants are comfortable but they may be holding workers back and making

employers worried. Recent research showed about half of people working from
home don't follow their employer's dress code, reports SHRM. The issue is that 80%
of people wearing work clothes felt productive, compared to 70% in grm clothes

and 50% of those in sleep

 

ar. Additionally, some employers may be concerned
with how casual some workers have become on video calls. The issue may lead to

these bosses looking into dress codes for remote workers, according to one expert.

770,CEO's Favourite Humble Brag,"I've worked in IT for around 13 years now and I've noticed this universal humble brag that every CEO does that's particularly annoying to me this morning. We just finished Canadian Thanksgiving here and managed to successfully wipe the pudding off our arms in time to drag ourselves back in to work. Us little folk enjoyed some festivities, getting caught up on our around the house stuff, and enjoyed our extra day off. Then the CEO busts out this fine line when queried what they did on the long weekend ""Oh ya know, some work, some play - not enough play, had a lot to do for work."" 

I always wonder, is this to elicit sympathy? Is it to inspire work ethic? Is it supposed to make me thank god I don't have a mansion and boats I never get to use? It perplexes me every time I hear it, but no matter where I work or who I talk to in ownership at other companies, it's the same line. 

I just feel \*so\* bad that they have to work on weekends to maintain the luxury lifestyle we keep afloat with our limitless patience and unyielding perseverance through complete and utter boredom. If only you had a choice like us to not work on the weekend. What luxury we live in.

772,"Tired of my soul sucking office job, want to work in the outdoors","I'm kinda constantly rejecting this thought because it looks like a cliche that I've gotten from some kind of movie rather than it being truly being how I feel, and I'm scared what my family and friends would react to this, but wanted to see if someone around here has been through something similar.

I'm a programmer, 23, I like Computer science and what I do in my job, but the whole office/work scene is slowly killing me, nothing new that you porbably don't know already or have heard about 1000 times: the living only the weekends, not having enough time to do the things I love, stress from work, blinking and waking up one year older...

On top of that I started having physical problems on my back a year ago because of the sitting, I'm handling them quite decently but every day there's something more to hate about the office work life.

I have planned some things to ""rest"" like backpacking for a while with money I have saved because I know that has worked before for me, but I just don't see myself doing this for the rest of my life and I'm just feeling like moving somewhere where I can work in a farm/chopping trees doing something physical and see if that's more bearable. Something more outdoor related like forest ranger would be great but I don't have the qualifications for that.

I know no job is gonna be perfect and one might say doing a physical job in the outdoors could be more stressing mentally and worse for my back than what I have now, but I need to try for myself.

I'm thinking about doing a working holiday somewhere to try it out but I'm worried it's a mistake career-wise.

TL;DR Office job as a programmer, getting tired more and more every day, thinking about moving somewhere when I can work a more outdoor/physical job.

I'm specially worried about how would it be possible to transition from programmer to something like a farmer with 0 background.

Has anyone been through something similar that could share some experiences?

795,My Anti-Work Story + A Plug for Something I've Been Working On,"Greetings fellow humans imaginative enough to dream of a world in which existence is not predicated on work...

This is my anti-work story, and at the end, I'm going to plug something I've been working on.

I've been anti-work for as long as I can remember. In school, when I was asked what I want to be when I grow up I could never come up with an answer (a legitimate answer in itself). There were plenty of things I wanted to do, but they weren't jobs. As a child, nobody dreams of having to say thank you to someone who stiffs you, nobody dreams of 12 hour days, not having enough money for food, or working long hours until your death. You wanted to answer the stupid question so you could go play. Looking back, the wisdom of a child's imagination was correct. I don't know what I want to do, and I want to go play. I don't want to be forced, under the threat of death (not working ultimately equals death) to do one miserable thing, or even a series of miserable things for the rest of my life. Thank you anyways

I, and I can imagine quite a few of you, realized that they did not want to be forced to work, the moment Peter Gibbons whipped out his drill, and let his cubicle wall fall. That was it my friends, that was the stuff right there. Watching that wall come down immediately legitimized the idea that work is worthless. I think this is an important point, as most people feel, but are too scared to take anti-work seriously. We have far too much riding on it culturally, psychologically, and philosophically. To accept the anti-work stance requires one to walk through the fire of an internalized worthlessness, brought on by society's insistence that from work you derive your value, to the acceptance of you as a person, full and beautiful, outside of what you are forced to do. 

Freedom, democracy, religion, genuine culture and connection, love, environmentalism, everything we hold sacred, all require time and energy to foster and grow. None of the aforementioned are truly possible if we are forced to spend our lives working. 

I hope to help legitimize the idea of anti-work. I got some anti-work shirts printed up and put them up for sale on my site. Each shirt comes with a copy of the essay ""The Abolition of Work"" by Bob Black. My thinking follows a similar logic to a Rage Against the Machine shirt. Somehow, as a result of Rage Against the Machine, everyone who grew up listening to the band either had, or knew someone who had, a Che Guevara shirt. Step two was to look up who and what Che Guevara was, thus pushing Rage's politics. You use the system against itself to spread ideas that will ultimately cripple it. If you or anyone you know might like a shirt, you can get one on my website at [https://www.earlyinet.com/s/shop](https://www.earlyinet.com/s/shop)

We will get there my friends, keep doing what you're doing, and thank you for listening

816,Am I in the wrong here?,"A brief synopsis. Last July I took a retail pharmacy gig as a technician. I ended up transferring to another store that November because they offered more hours weekly and the store was in an overall better neighborhood with, what I thought, would be a better customer base. It was a nightmare from the get go. The store was woefully understaffed. The management wasn't great. The department manager ended up leaving about 6 or 7 weeks into my tenure there. Now we had an understaffed, undertrained, and undermanaged store. I was already planning my exit from the company at that point. I decided to ask for a raise and was told I'd receive $1.50 more per hour by the store manager. I ended up only getting $1.20 and wasn't told of this till I checked my online pay stub a few weeks later as we are paid bi-weekly. Then COVID hit. I was then stiffed $150 by the company when receiving my pandemic bonus pay. By this point I stopped talking to most of the staff and my direct supervisors. I showed up, looked miserable, did my job, made no small talk, and went home. I also held out of work, and made it known, for a few days while corporate investigated my bonus pay situation. They ended up ruling against me and said ""tough luck."" 

The new department head is a woman in her late 20's who's extremely condescending and unprofessional. We don't get along at all. The other day we had a power outage and the automatic med counters went down as a result. She whipped a full bottle of pills in my direction out of anger and missed me by mere inches. I'm starting to show up less and less. I've always been reliable in the past, but I'm starting to wear down and don't care much anymore. I'm on auto-pilot. Last Saturday I tweaked my lower back and I was having spasms. So about two and a half hours into my shift I told them I was going home to get some meds for the discomfort. I never went back that day. I really don't like my co-workers. I hate my bosses. I'm over the BS. Am I the one in the wrong for essentially pouting and being a cold jerk to my co-workers during my shifts? Or is it justified? I'm salty.

My (20M) girlfriend (20F) has experienced a lot of abuse in her life, since she was a child from a previous stepdad, to almost all of her ex boyfriends, she’s had it rough. She has depression, anxiety, and ptsd (which also gives her a learning disability). Because of this she can’t be as *gasp productive as other people. She can’t do things like go to school full time bc of her learning disability, and she struggles to work full time because of all her past trauma, especially if the work environment is toxic. My family often times judges her and US bc in reality when we move out I’m going to end up paying a lot of bills for her. They see her as lazy and “not living in the real world” and I’m her caretaker. Well yes, I’m a way I am her caretaker, she doesn’t need a 60 hour/week job, and go to college, what she needs is someone who loves her unconditionally, and can give her the time she needs to heal.",False,j9wk4h,Throwaway08952,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/j9wk4h/fuck_capitalism_and_how_people_treat_my_gf/,36,1

830,"I don't mind work, but","It seems like the normies are working just for the sake of working, and then waiting for the next day to come and work again.

This may be a little personal but, I have a hard time connecting to others and finding actual meaning in the work that I do, not just blindly pulling the same lever in the factory every day.

Seems like humanity isn't evolving anymore, we are just recycling the same past over and over again. What is the point?

I can't even find a decent job, all of them are exactly the same repetitive marketing bullsh\*t.

I'm a very brainy person, and talkative also. I like to express myself alot through the day, which no job can stand of course. 

I mean, at a regular 9-5 you have to be quiet enough to not upset anybody but loud enough to not look depressed. You can't even come with new ideas, they'll shut you up.

I also tried negotiating the schedule (for less money, of course) they did not even want to hear.

So I concluded in my mind, these employers don't actually NEED people to work for them, they just want to feel important. Because someone who needs someone in their team will be pretty much open to some kind of negotiation.

If no kind of negotiation is available in that job, I say quit.

831,Starting a new job today after 6 months unemployed,"Back in March, I was hired for a new job at a new company. I wasn't able to start because I was immediately furloughed due to COVID. My area has opened up enough now that the company is bringing people off furlough, so I start today.

By all accounts, I will like this job. I like the company, I like the people I've spoken to, the workload and pay are all (seemingly) fair, but I legitimately cannot stop being upset that I have to give up my daily freedom to go back into the workforce. 

Sure, being unemployed was difficult. We had to cut back a lot, even moving to a new place to cut down on costs, but I spent 24 hours a day doing whatever I wanted. I got to see new areas of town, spend more time with my SO which made us grow even closer, and pick up new hobbies! It was really fun, and I wouldn't trade it for anything, but the money has run out. I've got to start this job, and I've got to stay in it for a while.

I feel extremely disappointed to have to return to sitting at a desk for the majority of my waking hours. To have to put on my ""phone voice"", attend meetings, deal with difficult clients, and make small talk with new colleagues whether i like them or not. I don't want to get up early each day, eat reheated lunch at my desk, and come home to rest for a few hours and do it again. My last job was abusive and cruel a lot of the time, and I cannot fathom having to deal with anything like that again. I am riddled with anxiety that maybe all jobs are the same, and I should expect the same level of disrespect and lack of empathy i received at my last job. I am full of anxiety about all the things I won't get to do while I'm working, and how this is my life until I (hopefully) have enough money to retire. I'm 24, so we're looking at 40+ more years of this.

Most of the folks I know irl would tell me to suck it up, and maybe that's what I need to do. This morning I am just disappointed.",False,j9sd66,courtneat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/j9sd66/starting_a_new_job_today_after_6_months_unemployed/,1,1

840,My inability to get a job has made me feel inferior,"I'm 20, I don't have a job and I still live with my mother. I am the very definition of pathetic.

I lost my last job with Sears at the start of this year. I was laid off in response to the store going out of business in February. Since that time, I have been unable to get a job. 

I've applied to well over 150 jobs since the start of this pandemic, I've been rejected by at least 50 of them and ignored by the rest. 

I've been told numerous times before that 150 is a ''low number of job applications'' and that ''I'm not trying hard enough''. I can assure you that I am, I've done all the hustling and networking I can but I have a very narrow set of skills limited to the lowest of retail positions, crippling social anxiety, and severe learning disabilities which screw up everything for me.

And to make matters worse, pretty much all of my friends are significantly more successful than I have been, this has put me in social conflict with them as my joblessness has given me an immense amount of free time, when I get bored, I message them on snapchat out of the blue and this often interrupts their busy schedules which in turn makes them mildly annoyed with me so for that reason I've stopped with unsolicited texts to them.

I honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong. I think 2 years of experience with Sears should qualify me for a minimum wage position with Macy's, JCPennys, or the many other retail companies but for whatever reason, I can never seem to satisfy the corporate overlords.

843,Going back to my roots,"And I mean waaay back. I was learning about hunter-gatherers, and decided to integrate some hunter-gathering activities into my own life.

This is by no means a complete idea, and I don't think it will work for everyone. I feel lucky I only have to work 8 hours each day, and I don't have any family obligations taking up time - so off-hours belong 100% to me.

I live in the middle of nowhere, Kansas. 20 minutes from Wichita (400k people) but for the most part it's prairie with a few lakes. A 1-year fishing license is $30 (wtf) and a 1 year park pass is $15. This lets me fish at any state park, and my county fishing lake.

I already have a fishing pole, and bought $20 worth of equipment from Wal-Mart (filet knife, scale, hooks, bucket).

I promise I'm getting to the point.

What drew me to this sub wasn't ""oh no I hate doing things"" it was ""let's eliminate meaningless labor.""

Those of you who are hunters, or go fishing, know that it doesn't feel meaningless. You aren't filling out an excel spreadsheet for a pound of ground beef; you're headed into nature with a weapon.

Unlike in society, you are directly connected with the result of your labor. If you want to eat meat, you have to kill an animal yourself.

I hope this doesn't come across as ""I'm such a bad-ass motherfucker,"" because I don't think going fishing makes me any more manly. I think I've avoided hobbies like hunting or fishing because they seem too redneck. Well, maybe they're on to something in this case.

Had enough of the whole system especially since I’ve picked orders that are worth more than my yearly salary in 20mins before !

What does it mean? Well, aproaching work different, like not depending on a boss/job/contract. Developing skills you like, low-budget travelling, risky adventures.

Cons: definitely very little money and low opportunities in this capitalistic system, no real friends, no safe future ahead for you. 

Living minimalist life, focusing more on connecting with your surroundings than bashing/conquering them.

Sometimes living in sh\*tty places in bad conditions etc.

Pros: Every moment brings such joy, even when you feel down. 

You get to develop new skills and explore the world in new ways.

This kind of life tests your brain and body every day.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, once you get into this life style, it feels like drugs. 'Cause you get to discover your real self so to speak. So this is it.

conditions in latestage-capitalism, because you have no more points against
my point that a normal life already is horrible, which by the way means you
finally accepted it, but without admitting it.

of an utterly trash-system.

Of you honestly believe that you could actually become a millionaire by
opening a small business you are delusion and bought into the american-
dream-propaganda (That's why it's the American dream - you have to be
asleep to believe in it).

You do realize that workers take on nearly no risk, right?

You just described risk, and those who take risks make the greatest

To someone working in a mine-shaft doesn't take risks but the owner of the
company who inherited all the billions takes risk by sleeping and lavishly
spending money all day?

Also you are again absolutely delusion if you think sum like Bezos were
rich because they took risks. They are millionaires because they exploited and

I work 60-80 hours a week, don’t really dread my life when I wake up because I know my next day off will be great! I take usually two days off every three months just to trip balls and I feel like it recharges my battery in a way. I get to meditate about what I’ve been through the past few months since my last hippy break. I recently took such a break and had a great time but it dawned on me that my lifestyle is super unhealthy. Working just to afford to live in an expensive area, never taking a day off, always picking up shifts so I can get extra hours in, and when I do take a day off it’s usually to do drugs......

But on the other hand these breaks have been my motivation in a way. I don’t think everyday that I’m doing this to take a break, well not most days, and I just feel like a junky sometimes. Chemicals are really the only thing that make me truly happy.

895,"I don't hate Capitalism because I hate life, I hate Capitalism because I LOVE life and want to be allowed to live it.","I want freedom from a mass of humans that thinks giving up all but 2 days a week counts as living in a free country. I want to be able to be alive without other humans demanding things of me at threat of death. I don't hate life, I love it, but under the circumstances given to us, we're not allowed to live it to even close to it's fullest potential. 

I'm not asking for permission to be myself. I'm not thankful for the people who provide just enough of my needs to not let me literally die. Not asking to die isn't asking for anything. If you reproduce under this system then YOU did the asking. You asked for another human to have needs. Not me. I would never under any circumstance reproduce under a system where my child's lifestyle has already been predetermined for them, and I don't feel bad for those that do. Telling me that it's unfair makes no sense, it's your fucking system. YOURS. Not mine. I would never worship money the way the people around me do.

It's like Capitalists forget that we're doing is their way. They're ""winning,"" so why are you telling me that unfair situations happen under your system. That it's unfair for anyone to have to take care of anyone else? WE FUCKING KNOW! THAT'S ENTIRE REASON FOR OPTING OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE. We know your system values human life so little that families are forced to take care of their own. We know you value human life so little that you think a system that has homeless people in it is functioning. Stop trying to make me feel bad that your system is a complete failure. I don't fucking care. I want to see it die and be replaced by something functioning. Telling me about all the unfair situations Capitalism creates and how I should be on board with helping to negate them makes no sense. 

**I'm. Not. A. Capitalist.** 

What you decide to do with us is up to you. It's your system. Stop telling me I should feel bad that it's a piece of shit. I know. That's why I'm not taking part in it, and I advise EVERYONE who can opt out and live off of Capitalists to do the same. It's their system. It's their idea. It's their problem. Every time they whine about your existence, they prove our point. ""It's not faiiiiiiiiir for people to have to take care of you.""

Yeah, no fucking god damn shit. Your system is a failure and can't even come to terms with the fact that humans shouldn't be starved to death, and if we do let people starve to death, many, many, many ""unfair"" situations are going to arise. Again as a non-Capitalist, I loooove hearing them whine about their failure of a system. Keep crying, keep complaining about us, because the number of people opting out is increasing. Your system is only going to get more and more unfair until even the most selfish of Capitalists will have to admit it's a failure that has overstayed it's welcome. 

Until then, I'm gonna be smoking weed, playing videos, and laughing at crying Capitalist.",False,j8qqka,nbatman,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/j8qqka/i_dont_hate_capitalism_because_i_hate_life_i_hate/,2,1

For a little over a month now I've been taking online classes at the local community college. I'm taking 4 classes and the work has been pretty easy, but it has completely taken over my life. 

I struggle with an autoimmune disease that makes me tired all the time so I need more sleep than most people, and my days have turned into waking up, doing school work and chores, eating and then going back to sleep. The fact that people can go to school full time and still work 1 or 2 jobs blows my mind, especially since I'm not working and school feels like a whole ass job in itself.

I was excited at the beginning of the semester, but my enthusiasm is dread now and I dread every due date and zoom meeting days before they're even required. I was determined not to procrastinate this semester but my anxiety and depression have been eating me alive. At this point I'm convinced college might not be for me, but I'm terrified by what that would mean for my future. College has always been a part of my plan, and every shitty retail slave job I've had has sucked the life out of me.

I've been trying to keep my frustrations on the dl because I don't want my family to know how much I hate my life right now, because I'm not even working so it shouldn't be this difficult for me.

However, today I was early for work. I parked and sat staring out the window at the freeway and the world. “Welcome to The Machine” by Pink Floyd starting playing. 

The cars continue endlessly zooming by. I shift my eyes towards Walmart’s stiff tan walls then towards the cart pushers running around the parking lot. I actually started to fucking tear up. For my entire life, All around me, I see people stressing and groveling. For what? 

We follow ‘success’ like ants blinding following a pheromone trail. However, that success is never enough. Work harder, hustle, make money, get ahead. Everyone tells me this, but nobody tells me fucking why.

There’s just something so cold about it all. Something so lifeless and metallic. Purposeless and self perpetuating. Why can’t I  just live a modest and content life? Why do I have to step on others, sell all my precious time, and brag about doing so. Why is this so widely accepted?

As kids, we always talked about how we couldn’t wait to grow up and get a job. Adults would always warn us to “enjoy your time now” and “wait until you see the real world”. Why does it have to be like this? Why do people have to spend every ounce of their energy, willpower, dreams just to scrape by?

Maybe I’m a bit naive, but the more I look around, it all just seems like a big fucking waste. I worked my ass off in high-school to get into college. Now, I’m working endless hours with low wage to pay off ridiculous college costs. There, I learn how to work. Then, I work until I die, or until I’m too old to enjoy life. 

I’m not saying I don’t want to work at all. I’m just saying that this society seems so fucked. Everyone always seems to treat everything like it’s normal.

Refine the shape, plan the shape, analyze the shape, program and maintain the shape, create new shapes, have countless meetings about such shape, compete with competitors and their shapes, AND OF COURSE, MARKET THE SHAPE TO CONSUMERS.  The question must be asked, do we really need the shape, do we honestly need more shapes, can we live without it?  If we can, how can we say that each person employed is doing any semblance of meaningful work?  It is all abstraction, we are creating work for the sake of work, instead of simplification.  Employees are not growing food, they are hacking a shape to consumers, telling them that they need the shape when they can easily do without.  The shape may even be harmful in the long run, but of course, the company doesn't care; profit above all.  Thus we are more and more having a great disconnect between work and reality.  We are creating more work when we should be creating less.  Work for the sake of work.

My peers around me are insanely intelligent, but so money driven and barely take care of themselves just to maintain a perfect social image, grades, and work, volunteer, research experience, etc. I just can’t keep up anymore, my physical and mental health has deteriorated and for what? On all accounts, the job market is dismal right now. I switched majors from a much more lucrative BS program to a program that I truly love as a BA, and I know that I’m going to take a major L in my vocational life for that switch. The worst part is, people around me (including friends) are getting rewarded for their shitty behaviours in research programs or in the workplace, and it’s so toxic. 

I’m so fucking burned out already and I haven’t even started full-time work yet. On paper, I have decent qualifications, but nothing stellar compared to those around me.

yesterday was supposed to be my day off to catch up on schoolwork and such, but she called me in and i truthfully dont have the backbone to say no. mondays are one of our busiest days, which is why i tend to take that off. 

i went to work, 4:50 am, and there were people there at the door WAITING FOR ME. i tell them we arent open yet, and to please wait. they say ok. i unlock the doors and go in to shut off the alarm AND THEY FOLLOW ME IN. so im like whatever, and get going. 

later that morning a creep that comes in and sees me on my normal shift for solely just to hit on me comes in and i already know how the day will be. he talks to me for like 20 minutes while i try to shake him off, even as customers come and go, he doesnt leave. 

finally when he leaves, my fucking boss shows up. once again telling me to do a million things at once while simultaneously watching the front. i dont know if she thinks i can divide myself into two people or what. then she leaves, comes back about an hour later and asks why i didnt hole-punch the papers for her binder. im like you didnt ask me to. and she was like i left the binder open it was pretty self explanatory im like???????

then, while im ringing beers our cooler guy comes in, hes probably like 17 and nasty as fuck. so his job is literally to do our coolers and make sure theyre stocked. well i have to carry my beers ive finished to the coolers and i dont want to be running back and forth, so i try to make it in one trip. yeah. that didnt happen. i drop almost all of them on the floor, coming undone from their ring. that’s probably 24 beers ive finished that just came apart. and that fucking cooler kid SAW IT HAPPEN AND DIDNT HELP ME??? im like 5’2 trying to carry 4 six packs of beers and he thought id MAKE IT? 

so then the HIGHLIGHT was about 30 minutes to finishing my shift, the cappuccino machine starts POURING hot water. like its a swamp, so my boss sticks a bucket under it at an odd angle, and makes me mop it even though i have a LINE of customers. at this point im so overwhelmed that im about to just walk. i stick a wet floor sign and go to help customers, and im nearing the last one when i hear a loud thud and a splash. the fucking bucket full of water fell over. theres water everywhere. our mop is AWFUL because my boss refuses to get a new one because shes fucking cheap as shit. she’ll do anything to save a dime. i fucking hate my greedy cunt boss and the fucking nasty losers who come in

 Still a little ways to go. Quit right before I burnt out because of my job, which had abnormally high workload.

928,Am I The Problem?,"Firstly, this is a rant/open discussion. I am struggling quite a bit right now so appreciate anyone who reads and offers their view.

I see a lot of people on here talking about how they’d be fine if they could just work 20 hours a week and get paid a reasonable wage.

I live in the UK, and I know that reddit is heavily USA dominated so I’m aware that your laws around vacation days, sick days etc. are much worse than ours. This gives further weight to the stuff I’m about to say. Up until December last year I was working a job which had the following features:

Is in the public sector, so not a soulless corporation making money for someone else

5 days a week, but with flexi-time and I wasn’t encourage to work more than my hours

Reasonable wage (£23,000 or $28,000)

I wouldn’t call it interesting or fulfilling, but I also wouldn’t say it was stressful


In short, I had it pretty good relative to most people, certainly a lot of people I read about on this subreddit. Now, this subreddit has always resonated with my view of work. I find it cathartic coming here because it’s so nice to not feel like I’m going crazy when I voice my opinions to other people only to be told “well what’s your solution? You have to work” or “that’s the way it is”.

Then, in December, my boss tells me she’s so happy with how I’m doing (I don’t work especially hard, it’s just a job, I have no passion for it), that she wants me to go for a promotion which has just opened up. Now, this position is a promotion. It is a big, big step-up. And it is part-time. It’s a considerable raise, even with my hours being slashed. It’s a lot more responsibility, and I am woefully underqualified.

I tell my friends and family about this, and they seem confused/angry that I’m not particularly enthused by it. To me, it just seemed like inviting a lot of pressure and anxiety, and while part-time work for a good wage has always been my goal, I didn’t know if I was ready for the step-up. 

Sidenote but relevant: I have struggled with my mental health for the past few years and went through a prolonged period of dealing with suicidal ideation 2 years ago. I went to therapy, went on meds, came off meds, I’m doing better now. I still have issues but it’s a lot better, however that period really knocked my self confidence and left me with a lot of anxiety.

Anyway, I decided to go for the job and just see how the application/interview goes as I can always say no if they offer it to me and I decide not to do it. So I do the application, I get an interview. The whole time I’m thinking, what the hell is happening? I am underqualified, inexperienced. If I get this job, I’m going to be found out. I feel like I’m in some horrible social experiment where I will walk into the interview and they will laugh at me for thinking I would be suitable. This may sound irrational, but it is what I was thinking. 

Anyway, I do the interview, it goes very well and they offer me the job. I tell my friends and family and they’re ecstatic for me. I feel… strange. I’m proud of myself? Also very scared. I feel ungrateful, and a bit numb. I take the job. It’s fixed term for 1 year, I tell myself if I hate it I can quit. I always have that option.

So now I am 3 months into this job. This job which is:

Public sector

22.5 hours a week (I mostly do this, sometimes a couple hours over), most of the time I get a 4-day weekend, Thurs - Sun

£29,000 or $37,000


It’s stressful. I have a lot of work and I’m almost constantly operating in fear that I will be found out as underqualified and a ridiculous appointment to the role. I have a lot of meetings with very experienced people who are highly qualified in their field, and I am supposedly providing “expert advice” to these people. I get asked a lot of questions I don’t know how to answer but somehow make it through. It’s very stressful.

I hate the 3 days I work, but what I hate even more is that now where I used to not think about work on the weekend, I’m now thinking about work all of the time on my days off. I try not to, I really try not to. But it’s difficult. A note about this job, I find it no more fulfilling than my last job, only more stressful and busy. I still have no interest in this line of work, I am just sort of falling into it. 

Thursday is relief, followed by anger at how much relief I’m feeling. It seems that the more stressed I get, the more angry I get at how stressed I am being made. 

Friday is dread, that I am getting through my weekend and already gearing up to the thought that I will be back on Monday.

Saturday is the same as Friday, only I am enjoying my time even less.

Sunday is horrible. I hate Sunday.

Essentially, my weekend is somehow worse than before? Despite having 2 days longer, I feel like all of it is compromised now, rather than just Sunday evening where previously I would’ve just felt a bit bummed out.


You may be reading this and feeling at best jealous, and at worst angry at how ungrateful I sound. I get that. I have attained what so many of you say that you want. And I think I actually feel worse.

It begs me to ask - am I the problem? Do I just want whatever I don’t have? Now that I’m working less and being paid more, suddenly I kind of want to go back to my old job. The old job, where I would work and then on the weekend complain to people about how work sucks and I wish I didn’t have to spend 40 hours there. “If only I could work less”. Well, now I’ve got that and I’m also miserable. What’s that about? Surely that isn’t healthy? Is there something wrong with me?

You might say “well you’re unhappy because your job is stressful, find a new one”. What other job? The one where I work 3 days, earn good money but also have no responsibility or pressures. It doesn’t exist. If we’re honest, I am incredibly lucky to have the deal that I do have. Again, I say lucky as a relative term. I know I don’t have to tell you guys that the working world is an absolute sham, and that none of us are lucky to be working.

Am I just mentally configured to be an unhappy, ungrateful person, no matter what my situation is? That’s what it’s beginning to feel like.

UPDATE: I wrote all that 3 months ago but never posted it. I'm now 6 months into the job and I've moved up to full time hours. I'm now earning £49,000 Or $63,000, despite not having a degree and no experience at this level. It is a farce how I have got here and as a result I am constantly stressed beyond belief. But I'm making more money than I thought I ever would in my whole life. I don't know what to do. 

As I said before, I feel like I'm not destined to be a happy person. So I may as well be unhappy and get paid?

I don't know what my point is. I'm not happy and I feel like I never will be, and I feel ungrateful.

TL;DR: Guy lucks out on a promotion to a decent money part time role. Isn't happy. Lucks out further to get paid a lot more, and is arguably even less happy than before.

My trainer took PTO for the rest of the month so I'm literally all alone after only 3 days of training. Our store is also incredibly short staffed so today when i worked it was me, one other full timer and my store manager. My store manager was in conference calls all day so he was never available to help me and because of that i got yelled at BY HIM.

I went to the back to ask for help with a customer, when i did that the other full timer was in the bathroom so my manager yelled at me for that. Didnt know that rule, but i understand the rule. I apologized.

I brought out two high dollar items for a customer to look at, apparently I'm only supposed to bring out one at a time. I understand but didnt know. I got yelled at, i apologized.

I went to the back to ask for my manager to unlock the safe because our register was short. When doing so i brought $3 back with me, cus that was the customers change and i was a dollar short. I just had it in my hand so i brought it with. Not allowed to have cash back there cus theres no camera. Then he really let me have it, not for just breaking that rule, but for all the rules i broke today. 

This store is so short staffed that theyre literally closed two days a week to give the employees days off. They closed every store in our district but ours so literally without me this store would have closed too.

The training is shit and I'm getting yelled at for everything. Fuck this. Took a lot for me not to just rage out. And i get to look forward to this for the rest of the month cus i dont have a trainer and fuck me if i ask for help.

944,I have an idea. (Bit of a rant),"This system worked significantly better when there were less people in it. Now we're trying to make more meaningless jobs, and taking value away from ""less desirable"" trades (like creative jobs), while people are staying in the workforce longer, so that as many people as possible can have a job to afford to survive.

People aren't given a choice anymore, and the jobs that are available are being paid less and less comparatively. Families and children are suffering because we don't live in a world were a family can be supported on a single income anymore. (No I am not saying women shouldn't work, I'm saying children develop better with either parent at home.)

I'm sure almost everyone would agree that they are more than willing to contribute, if they actually got to choose how they contributed, and if contributing didn't involve working under pressure, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, under the threat of not being able to eat or having a home to go home to.

The best thing we could do to fix the current system we have would be to essentially get rid of full time positions. 

Every employee gets the same benefits, and wages increase so you can make a living on part time work. Then you can hire more people to do the jobs that are currently available. 

You'd effectively end unemployment because there would be a surplus of jobs available, and the work life ballance would get much better because people would only be working 20-30 hours a week instead of 40-60. 

It's already been proven that people are less productive the longer their workday/week is. People get burnt-out. We aren't designed to be worker drones. 

So doing this would have less unemployment, more productivity, happier people as a whole, and more time and money to be put back into the economy. 

For those who are shortsighted, yes it would mean a significant number of businesses, small ones especially, would go out of business because of the change in financial responsibilities, but the ones that do fail wouldn't have been sustainable in the long run anyway, and we could implement short term government funding to businesses to help them transition, (cheaper than supporting everyone who is unemployed due to lack of available work indefinitely) they would also most likely shorten their hours to compensate initially, but supply and demand is still a thing, and we would see businesses reopen and expand hours again with the growing demand for it. The only difference is that now everyone is benefiting from it.

Unfortunately, i doubt we would ever see this happen because it would mean companies having to actually pay workers a reasonable wage and provide benefits to all of their employees.",False,j6r372,kitty-94,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/j6r372/i_have_an_idea_bit_of_a_rant/,5,1

Oh, and 70 dollars for a webcam as I havent had the privelege of buying one. 

The interviews (yes, plural interviews. 6 to be exact, only 4 of which I went through) were half an hour long each and required me to use company software to be even remotely considered.

Three minutes before my next scheduled interview, I was asked to reschedule. Of course, I acquiesced like the Good Capitalist Boy that I am. 24 hours later, nothing. Then, suddenly, a bot response to tell me they don’t want me. I wasn’t even given a notice by an actual human. A fucking robot denied me. 

I don’t even know why they denied me. My final interviewer had even said that all 3 previous really liked me. I thought I was a shoe-in. Apparently fucking not.

959,Does anyone else just happen to almost always get fired from jobs for refusing to put up with people’s shit?,"I also have Aspergers, so it seems like I’m almost always the target of mistreatment even by folks who don’t even know that I‘m autistic. Upon having met folks in the work places in my past I have been talked down to like I’m an incompetent child, which offends me and then makes me wary of that person which thus causes tension between me and that person because I don’t say good morning anymore and I start to be a smartass with them.

I was fried from work today because of this bullshit:

Some new girl was hired today and I've been there for only 6 months and they are threw her to me for me to train. The job entails ""statusing"" subpoena packets all day, and you ""status"" the packets by entering in on the Compex Legal Services website that you served the subpoena. In this dialogue box on the website, you have to put in a code for the specific type of subpoena packet, and the type of packet I was showing her how to ""status"" was a ""counsel packet"". You also have to type in the box the name of the place that it is going to. So I show this girl how to do it. I point at the name of the place on the counsel packet that the packet is being mailed to that she has to type in the dialogue box. And then I tell her the code for the packet that she has to enter in the drop down menu inside the box. And I tell her that's all she has to do. So I'm trying to train her while I have hundreds of priority counsel packets that I have 2 and a half hours to ""status"" myself so they can be out of the door to the post office by 11:30am WHILE I'm trying to train her at the same time. So I go to my desk to start ""statusing"" the priority counsel packets quickly, and I ask her does is she okay and does she think she can remember how to do the task I just showed her. She said yes and rolled her eyes. Immediately I knew this girl had a funky attitude, but I brushed it off.

My other coworker Sophia comes in at 8:30am and she asks the girl what was she doing and why was she putting the wrong status code in for the counsel packet. Mind you this Sophia has been rude to me too; she talked down to me like I'm an idiot if I disn’t do something she said; like one morning when I came in to work, I didn't put this new brand of printer paper in the printer that the supervisor wanted us to put in the printer to ""test out"" to see if it would make the printer stop jamming, and she said, ""Why didn't you put this paper in?? I already told you yesterday that Frieda wanted us to test this paper out!"" 

Anyway, so after Sophia asked the new girl why she put the wrong status code in, the new girl told her, ""I don't know that's what she told me to put in"". And then Sophia got on my case and asked me why did I tell her to put that code in. I didn't tell the new girl the wrong code, she just forgot the code I told her. I told her the status code for the counsel packets was A02 and she was putting in A20. So Sophia tells her that she can put in ""205"" in the drop down menu and the same status code A02 will pop up in the drop down menu in this box. But I noticed that when you put in ""205"" two different codes for the counsel packets show up in the drop down menu which are A02 and A03. The purpose of us statusing these counsel packets is to let customer service know that we served the subpoena, so when the lawyers call the office to see if the counsel packet was mailed out then customer service will see the status on their website. A02 tells customer service that the packet was mailed out by USPS and A03 tells customer service that the packet was sent out to be completed by someone else. So I was trying to tell the new girl this and I was asking her to make sure she was selecting the correct code which was A02 in the drop down menu and I told her it would be easy to mistakenly select the wrong code that pops up when you type in ""205"". She said, ""Okay now you two are confusing me where is someone that can help me out here?"" She was ignoring me and talking to Sophia. All I was doing was just letting her know that it would be easy to make a mistake and select A03 for the counsel packets when you type in ""205"" (the number 205 is the ID number and the ID number helps you identify if it is for a client packet, location packet or counsel packet, and 205 is the ID number for counsel packet

So I go back to my desk and I take some of the counsel packets that she already completed to make sure she was going them right. I come back to her desk to let her know that she did some of them wrong. I told her that she did not enter in the name of the place that the counsel packet was going to, and she said, ""Okay whatever, you did not tell me that that was what I was supposed to type in the box"". I said, ""Yes I did I specifically pointed at the top of the address the name of the place that the counsel packet is being mailed to"". And she said, ""Where is the supervisor lady that brought me in here?"" I went back to my desk and started talking to myself about how I have to train people with bad attitudes early in the morning. And she said, ""Oh excuse me what did you say I didn't hear you?"" 

And this girl went to go tell on me to the head supervisor. When I got to the supervisor's office, these dingbats excuse her behavior and say, ""Well I can see why she would ask you were you talking smack about her if you two had just gotten into an argument"". We didn't even get into an argument! Me talking to myself doesn't excuse her to tell me to ""speak up so I can hear you"" like she is threatening me for saying something about her under my breath. One of the supervisors said, ""You don't seem to understand that she has only been here for 1 hour and you expect her to be perfect and not get anything wrong"". I'm like to myself: now when did I say she is wrong for not doing the counsel packets correctly? I have an issue with how she RESPONDED to me for telling her that she did the counsel packet incorrectly, I don't have an issue that she did them incorrectly. And all I said to her was that she did them incorrectly, and she dismissed me and disrespected me. The supervisor told me, “Maybe it was wrong for us to have you train a new person when you’re still relatively new yourself? I don’t know”. Fucking idiots.

This isn’t the first time this has happened: this has happened to me at least 5 times where some fucking asswipe at work is rude to me and I treat them with the same respect they show me and I AM THE ONE WHO GETS FIRED. Like wtf??!! It’s like these fuckers can sense I’m Aspergers or something and they say, “Well let’s fire her because she isn’t the normal one anyway”. I have noticed that some folks in the workplace can be very fake; they try to act all holier than thou while stabbing other folks in the back both in their personal lives and in the workplace. 

The manager at the job I was fired at today calls the workers there “idiots” and the R-word for “mentally disable people” yet that piece of shit gets to keep his job. He doesn’t even know shit about the job that he calls himself managing.   


I try to talk to people in my life about this and all they say is, “Well if that keeps happening to you then maybe you are the one who is the problem“.

960,Today made me really feel for those in customer service,"Today, I had an interaction with a real Karen. So, I have been temping with a charity company- taking donations (clothes, shoes, household items, etc). How bad can that be, right? There shouldn’t be any problems when people are doing such a good act like charity? Well, I was wrong. There are so many Karen’s and Chads that come through daily. They give the attendants so much sh*t because they are giving away their junk. Junk they are dying to get rid or junk that they want to cash out on for tax purposes. Not because they are indeed charitable people. 

Well, anyway a Karen comes in the wrong way which can potentially cause an accident and definitely will cause a hassle for the donors coming in the right way. I politely told her to come through the right way as the sign clearly stated to do not enter. In addition, I told her the other stuff about accidents, etc. All politely! I then stepped away so she can correct her mistake. She sat there and then all of a sudden put the metal to the medal and sped around a cone and came to a screeching halt. She then started yelling. I tried to explain myself and asked her to stop yelling. She continued to yell and then I told her I was going to walk away since she could stop yelling. Karen then proceeds to yell some more and tell me I was going to get her donations from her car. How in the hell are you going to tell me what I’m going to do in a manner like that? I then went off on her as I was going back to the “office” area. As I was about to go inside, she screams “ and guess what, white lives matter too”. Out of nowhere. I thought at that next moment, she was going to call me the n- word so I threatened to whip her ass as I got my backpack and left.

I'd been working from home for over a decade. Where the fantasy is that it allows for more work/life balance. But, in my experience, that just means you're expected to always be available and pull longer hours, since you're always at work. CEO-to-worker pay ratio is one of the highest in the country, ""but, sorry, no bonuses again this year. No meaningful pay increases. And, due to poor executive decision-making, we have to cut staff, so you're just going to have to do more with less."" 

Reached the breaking point. I quit my job at the end of last year.

There was a lot of paranoia with the thought of having no income. A ""strong work ethic"" was ingrained in me at an early age. I've had a job since I was 14, working full-time since 20. Even though I'm in the extremely fortunate position of having some savings and not needing income for a period of time, it felt as though I was going to cut off my ability to breathe. But after stepping away, it's had the opposite effect.

Now, instead of being a button pushing screen manipulator for a giant corporation all day, wondering why I'm mad at the world, I've been able to focus on gaining homesteading skills I would otherwise not have the time or energy to pursue. I feel like a useful human being now. Wake up when I naturally want to, which ends up being 6 AM, energized to meet the day, instead of laying in bed, trying to stretch the minutes for as long as possible before having to sign in and look at my inbox.

Most of my free time was spent hiking/camping, on artistic expression and trying to force myself to relax. The safety valves required to release the pressure of dreading most of my days alive. I've been able to fit in all of this skill-building and continue to enjoy hobbies. I've hiked so damn much I've lost over 50 pounds since February and feel incredible.

An unknown future seemed terrifying. But on the other side, it's a lot less scarier than the idea of spending another 25+ years as a slave. I'm no baller. This current situation can only last for a short time. But I now have the energy to pursue a future of passion that could also feed and pay the bills.

It's what it sounds like: subjecting equipment to tests to see how well it stands up, which includes literal explosions and depth charges.

The thing is, most people didn't like doing this because these tests had to be done in special labs. These special labs charged rent to use their facilities, so it required long hours. And they existed all over the country, so it required travel. People who had families or just had a life outside of work hated these, but I loved it because you got to go outside the office, chill with strange technicians, and do a lot of messy blue collar work. And during the weekend, I got to faff around in another city.

So it was pretty fun FOR ME and the company had a willing volunteer. Until some dipshit project manager noted that there were long stretches of time where I wasn't doing anything while the depth charges were getting readied / the transformers were being charged up and inspected / the cells were being cleaned of debris / etc. So even though I was working 12-14 hour days out of the office, there's no reason I couldn't be doing paperwork or training in my downtime, right?

[Here's the original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/j1vcav/i_finally_asked_for_a_raise/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

So the next day at work my boss just totally ignored me. Avoided me like the plauge. Walked right by me and didn't even look at me. Next day, still nothing. As I mentioned before, I have bad social anxiety and hardly talk to people unless they initiate the conversation first. After spending all day trying to work up the courage, I finally asked if we could sit down an talk in private. But it was close to the end of the day and they said we would tomorrow. Next day, still nothing. They continue to act as nothing has happened. Once again, I spent the entire day working up the courage to ask to speak privately again, and once I did we finally got to talk. Best they could offer me was $16.50/hr. Blah blah blah coronavirus, blah blah blah nobody else here makes that kind of money, blah blah blah.

I'm worth way more than $16.50. I recently moved back in with my parents and can't afford to move back closer to work, and the 40 min to and 40 min back commute would be too dangerous during the winter. I figured I would blow through my savings a lot slower by staying home and doing nothing all winter rather than moving back and paying for rent, groceries and internet while still working. So I emailed my resignation in on Friday evening saying the 16th will be my last day.

Come Monday, again, nothing. They still acted as if nothing has happened. Then today we had our weekly meeting and I thought me leaving might get mentioned there. Nope. Nothing all day once again. Now I'm wondering if they've been fucking with me or didn't get the email.

Later this evening, my position was listed online, so I know they received my resignation. They've been fucking me around and I don't have the time or energy to deal with this anymore. I've already checked out mentally from work and I'm letting projects pile up which someone else can deal with. I'm done being treated like a stupid child and a door mat for minimum wage.

I've had an interview today for a part time job which went OK, but I figured some money is better than no money coming in. I'm currently cuddled up in bed with my soft little kitty counting down the days while writing this at 2am, so please forgive me if I have a bunch of errors in this. I just also wanted to say thank you for all the encouragement on my last post! I feel much more confident after having gone through this all.

982,"""find your passion""","(this is just a rant,reply if you feel like it. This is also my first post here,tell me if it's appropriate and i'll remove it)  
I literally can't hear that sentence anymore. My family tells me that stupid sentence atleast 4 times a day. Im a professional Chef,i went through 4 years of torture : getting screamed at if i only drop a knife,being yelled at every day,being forced to do stuff like cleaning the restaurant for no reason which has nothing to do with my actual job,buying my boss cigarettes etc.) but with all the circumstances (overtime,stressed out co-workers,alot of cursing,asshole customers) i decided to pick a new career. I was hired by a company from my country and soon figured out i was just a ""lend-worker"" where im basically working at a company for about 1-2 weeks then get the location for a new company per SMS (which was my mistake, should've read the contract more clearly) You know what that means : new co-workers every 2 weeks,new tasks every 2 weeks,new way to get to work every 2 weeks (i only have my bicycle, and in my country cars honk at you like you shot someone once you ride your bike on the road) . So i decided to quit at that comapny and applied for that company i sort of liked (9 hours a day,way to work is 40mins and i get 1300€ a month but hey,im able to pay my bills) and i'll wait on it while looking for other jobs.  
What i'd like to know is, is there anything such as passion for a job? People tell me to ""find your passion and you will love work"" but,i don't like the idea of the whole work concept so i can't build a passion to something that involves working 9 hours a day/ 6 days a week doing mindless things that are unnecessary to your life. I know i won't get paid for reading Stoicism books,playing Video Games and getting drunk all day long. But no matter what i do,there is no such thing as passion to me when it comes to work.  
Im jobless at the moment since i quit at that company iv'e talked about above,and im forced to find a job in the next 2 weeks or else i'll land on the streets. The thing here is though,i have no trouble getting the job. the problem is finding a job that suits me.

1012,About to lose my mind and give up," 

Second time posting on Reddit regarding my job because I feel like I need the advices. (long post ahead) 

I’m 24 this year and am currently on my second job which I joined in Feb 2019.

I started working remotely because of the virus, and my company’s currently on the 5th going to 6th month working from home. While I understand the stress and frustrations to getting used to this, my boss has been way harsher on me than before. She started micro-managing me and even calling after office hours and during weekends.

Even when I’m on sick leave for 2 days, she called me without warning and even questioned why I did not pick up her call the first time. I was then asked to work and reply to emails despite being unwell. She would text after working hours and criticizing on my work even at 9pm. I feel anxious and tensed even seeing her name pop up on my screen and this made me fear her. During weekly meetings, I am afraid to speak up or give ideas because I’m afraid of her criticism. Her words and attitude had my confidence level at an all time low and it’s taking a toll on my health both mentally and physically. I have been dropping many hairs because of the stress and haven’t been able to eat well for weeks now because she has been constantly texting during lunch time.

I did talk to her about my condition but she brushed it off and mocked quite sarcastically that I was just too young. She said that people with mental health issue wouldn’t want to tell people about their conditions, implying that I was lying to her by speaking to her about this. Did she really not have any empathy?

I feel like I couldn’t breathe at all. I spent my nights awake because I’m so stressed out about the next day, wondering if she will call and scream at me. I cried while working and even when I wanted to take a day off, she starts questioning me like it's a crime to take a break. My weekends was also not spared as I constantly think about work and dreading Monday to come. I’ve been thinking to quit for about a month now without a job lined up because I felt like I needed a break to heal from my anxiety and stress before I start a new job. 

She says I'm too weak and needs to be stronger to survive in the working world which I agrees, but her constant yelling and criticism is making my anxiety worse and more mistakes were made due to the stress. I really want to finish up my 2 years and quit next year but her attitude towards me is really driving me crazy...

The job is great. The work is interesting. The people are good, passionate people. I know that I’m incredibly lucky to have this job, but I just don’t want it anymore.

I know exactly what I want to do and that is to work for myself. Since starting a side business, I’ve realised just how much I lack passion for what I do. I don’t like working for someone else. I hate being forced to be around others when I don’t want to be. I hate the forced socialising. I like to socialise, but on my terms and when I’m in the mood for it. It’s just so exhausting. I don’t want to work my way up. I don’t want to be a manager... or a Head of... or a director. I just want to be paid and go.

Everyone there is SO damn passionate. It’s impossible to just swim along in this job. You HAVE to be enthusiastic and constantly learning and sharing ideas and growing in your role. It’s not possible to coast. I can’t keep this charade up much longer.

Why isn’t it okay to just coast along? Why?!

The trouble is... I have a plan to go travelling in summer 2021 and my only goal right now is to save. I can’t quit this job because I wouldn’t make enough money to go travelling just doing my side business or getting a simpler job. But that’s ALL I want to do. I’d happily do the simplest job ever, just so long as it gave me the mental capacity to focus on my side business. I know I can make it into a full-time gig eventually (it’s going very well as a side hustle but I don’t have enough time to earn more money with it just yet). 

I just can’t keep this charade up for another 9 months or so. It’s exhausting. I can’t pretend. I hate how we constantly have to be tied into jobs just to live our lives the way we want to. Everything is so damn expensive.

1016,Would it be possible to get people to collectively reject the system?,"Hi everyone.  I'm new to the sub, but I've devoured so much of the material referenced on here and I really feel like my eyes have been opened.

I don't have a lot of time to write since I need to get back to my assignment, but I've been thinking a lot about how we could reject the system in the most peaceful way possible (yes, I'm a pacifist, because I think history has shown that violence only builds resentment in survivors and perpetuates itself over time).  Honestly, the only way I can see it happening is by spreading the message to as many people as possible, hopefully waking them up to the realities of the world we live in.  These people could then be encouraged to join together in small communities where we would have people with a variety of skills that could help each other and slowly decrease their participation in the system by becoming self-sufficient.  Eventually, in these communities, people could stop buying anything from large companies - or at least as little as possible - and quit their jobs.  As these communities become successful, now their message becomes more feasible to implement for the vast majority of people who hear about and are interested in them.  Then, as everyone drops out of the system, suddenly profits dry up for the wealthy, and likely will not return since much less people want to buy into them.

Sorry if this is all over the place, haven't had enough sleep over the past few days unfortunately.  I know that this idea would be extremely difficult to spread considering how people are so embedded in the system, and obviously it would be difficult in the early stages to divvy up responsibilities and tasks within the communes.  But I feel if the motivation is there - like hey, I actually would rather live in a more egalitarian society in which people give a damn about each other, and maybe I do want to care about other people more than I care about pleasing our overlords - then people will be driven to make it work.

Acknowledge your boss's accomplishments, skill and experience to help boost his confidence. Of he’s insecure, all he
probably needs is a little recognition. On't go overboard with flattery. Simply and sincerely point out his positive
contributions in front of others so he feels appreciated and less threatened. Also, include him in your accomplishments
For example, if you are honored with an achievement award in front of others, in your acceptance speech, include your
boss as one of the people who made it possible.

I fantasize about quitting every day. Buy lottery tickets all the time, consider homelessness, and I am just generally miserable 100% of the time because I hurt myself physically and mentally over this job that could easily replace me and pays nothing. I'll be honest I just wanna smoke pot and play video games, watch tv, browse internet all day every single day. I don't give a fuck. Those aren't the words of an edgy teenager, but a jaded and exhausted adult. I'm sure if I had a good long break I would be ok with working 20 hours a week, if I could live off it. I've had it for sure today and I have been spending less and less time working and more time on my phone. I keep stretching it and I'm gonna test the limits until they say something. Honestly it would be nice if they just fired me. Preferably laid me off but that will never happen. I just feel completely hopeless like damn...is my whole life gonna be like this? Work work work, rest, MAYBE do something fun for a crumb of time but probobly not cause all I feel like doing is sleeping, work work work repeat?

But if work means being a mindless drone, a cog in someone else's money-making machine, I'm out.

Now, the problem with them 9-5's. The problem is not the schedule/amount of work but what you are actually doing, and the people you surround yourself with.

What gives me high anxiety is not being able to find actual meaning in the jobs which are available, not being able to connect with peers.

Also, the lies they are telling you, that we, at work, are like a family, you can talk anything to us. 

Also, the lack of courage my generation is facing (90's) to actually be independent and think different from their parents. Just having a job with a fancy name, listening to different music, wearing different clothes and learning new slang does not make you a mature adult.

1077,I'm leaving the STEM field today.,"Nearly 4 years I've been in the field, 3.5 years at my current job.
I was told that my degree in chemistry qualified me for the job.
Ive recently been informed that I was only hired because I wore a tight dress to the interview.
My initial struggles included being trained by multiple different people with differing opinions on how to do the job (lab work), and constantly getting in trouble for messing up.
I would be placed in front of complex machinary, with software programming and physical tooling- having never seen something like that in my life- and was simply told to ""figure it out"" as a ""learning lesson."" I minorly injured myself a few times this way.
I trained a few employees in the lab, all white boys that were much younger than me and none had any college degrees.
My boss was insulting, sarcastic and sexist. He joked about my appearance almost daily, and micromanaged everything from my work performance to my personal life. He mocked me, threw things at me, put me in physical danger, gossiped about me behind my back, accused me of taking advantage of the system while being on partial unemployment when they are the ones that reduced my hours in the first place, and then viciously tried to sabatoge my side business when I refused to come back full time to double responsibilities with no extra pay. 
He's lied to me and manipulated me.
I've been pursued romantically by coworkers, some were persistent FB messages, unwarranted sexual conversation in the workplace, and one instance was sexual assault.
Other women in the company spread lies and rumors about me and acted unkindly toward me.
Once, I was threatened to be fired when I was mopping the floor, because the *smell of the cleaner was too strong*. I was using something literally labeled FLOOR CLEANER and had prepared it according to the instructions. 
They missed a paycheck about a year ago, blaming it on some payroll issue. I accumulated several late fees because I had not need paid, and my credit took a ding. I was never reimbursed for those fees.
Oh yeah, and they advertised 100% tuition reimbursement for good grades in a related field after 1 year. Except when you're not the plant managers son. Then you're like me, who was told *after I'd already been approved to be reimbursed and got a 3.75 GPA in the semester* and instantly slipped into 10k of student loan debt. A few days before going on a Disney trip. 
What's been the final straw? Well, after being moved to QC, I keep getting in trouble for struggling to fill the shoes of someone who: is currently on unemployment with the full knowledge that there are elements of the job that ONLY SHE knows, and that those things aren't getting done, and made 4x as much money as me. 
When I heard the phrase, ""Oh, how hard can it be?"" From a man who is not my boss but loves to bully me and undermine my abilities simply for being a woman. He knows nothing of what I do. Most of my ""mistakes"" end up coming from his ineptitude or failure to inform me of something.
That was it. I can't do it anymore. I put my 2 week notice in the last 30 seconds of my shift and slipped out. Monday morning, I'm going to get flooded with the crowd, asking *why*. I'll simply say, I needed a change.

The profit from currencies trading is my sole source of income currently. I live in Russia, you don't need that much for a living here, my monthly expenses usually don't exceed 400$, I'm also reinvesting most of the profits so that the income could increase over time.

The results so far (public monitroing with 1 year 3 months history):
https://www.myfxbook.com/members/Thunderclap/countertrend/3529156
This is a growth account, there are also a few other smaller accounts from which I'm usually withdrawing profit. Such gains can be tied to huge risks but that's not the case here, actually the maximum drawdown of my algorithms since inception (july '19) was lower than that of SP500 index over the same period.

My strategies are based on trading during lower liquidity times of day and on the fact that price behavior of certain currency pairs is different depending on current trading sessions and the current level of available liquidity in the market. Trading window is only 3 hours per day. Almost all is automated, what I'm doing manually is just turning the algos on/off depending on whether there is any important news scheduled during or slightly before my trading window and sometimes adjusting position sizes depending on recent volatility.

There are still many ideas to be tested so if you are interested you can join coding/generating ideas/testing.

A couple of friends of mine are aboard, I copy trades from my account to theirs so that they could have a chance to escape from slavery. Their monthly salary is around 600$. But unlike typical investing, the starting deposit needn't to be large here. If you are interested you can copy trades from my account to yours with 50/50 profit split (so I will make money only as long as you will make it as well).

1098,Looking for advice on unethical proceedings,"Been lurking in this sub for a while and it has inspired me to post here.

I took a WFH call centre job recently with the intention of using the wfh aspect to study/hone my hobby in the downtime. That was the entire reason behind getting a wfh job, to work as little as possible and advance my own goals instead.

It went great during the 3 weeks of training. I'd put the instructor/videos on speaker and be at my main pc the whole time. But soon after it came time for production and i guess it's my fault for not realizing how call centres work but there's quite literally no downtime allowed. 8 straight hours of shitty customer interactions, with some breaks in between.

So at this point ive already decided im going to quit anyway, but i was thinking of stringing them around to squeeze as much pay out before I leave: clock in at the start of the day, take a call every hour or two in the course of an entire 8 hour day, and clock out. Repeat until caught, since they monitor call time, and throw as many excuses out/feign mental disorders until i get terminated.

**So my question is, is this unethical plan viable? Has anyone done something like this before? Can they retroactively take away payment if they feel i didnt work? Is there some kind of system/institution they can report me to fuck my job search over in the future? Im in Canada if that helps anyone.**

Im not sure were to start. Im in my second to last year in high school and I found this sub (along with a bunch of news, other subs, youtubers, streamers etc etc) and it started to show me that everything might be kinda broken. Ive worked summer jobs in retail and restaurants and it does suck, and thats only a light version of real labour since i had the whole weekend off and it wasnt as many hours or as high stakes since it was only a silly summer job. I wasn’t even getting paid. I have a passion and I do plan to go to college to work for something I really enjoy doing but I’ve heard you just get tired of doing that and you hate it.

My parents have tried their very best that I don’t become spoiled and to be not a materialistic person. We always lived well off but never anything completely crazy, upper-middle class stuff, we never had to struggle. However my parents parenting decision has become completely clear once I learned something.

I am getting a GROTESQUE inheritance, as in I could put part of it in a bond, most of it into an investment fund and make 6 figures a year without loosing money and doing basically NOTHING. How is that even possible, i didnt work for any of that money i was just born, and i could just not work again if i wanted to. Thats not fair at all. Am i an asshole if i just do that and sit by doing nothing taking advantage of a predatory system? Should i instead not accept that and work a job i hate because its whats fair? Do i use that money for something to fix this? What? 

Everything ive been brought up on is focused on how important hard work is, and I plan to finish a degree and take a “normal” paying job to try to get by while i pursue my passion. Should i instead just focus on my passion completely? Id need a job to stay in the states and not get kicked out tho.

I dont want to be an asshole but i also dont want to put myself into suffering for no reason. It seems this system doesn’t let you not suffer and not be an asshole at the same time. I know this is likely extreamly frustrating to hear for alot of you since I was so unfairly lucky, im sorry.

I still pressed on actually enjoyed the companionship of my co-workers, nasty customers be damned. Then Covid hit. Unfortunately, gyms were how I was getting my shower and grooming needs met, and those closed. Pressure built over time, and then I just decided one day to quit. A string of mental hospitals later, and I'm now on SSI and living in a board and care. My SSI isn't that low; it's as much as I'd make in a 80 hour work week.

Now that I'm facing homelessness again, I know deep down there's no way I can back to working especially while it's still like this. I just miss feeling like I contribute with my job and the family of having co-workers. I'm trying to study languages and devolope skills with all of my now free time, and I gotta say it's definetely a little more fufilling than my job ever was.

Yesterday, at the café where I work, this Karen was giving me attitude because she was too dumb to understand how her credit card worked (it had the tap feature) and so, after I processed the transaction by taking the card from her and proving her wrong when she said “it won’t read it!” I completely lost my shit. It was a day full of idiots and she was the last straw. I yelled at her and said “fuck this shit” and got sent home after I yelled at the kitchen supervisor too because she’s just a useless lazy bitch. My boss is out of town, so I haven’t gotten fired yet, but I can kinda see it happening in the next week or so. And I couldn’t care less.

The food industry is toxic and flawed. It lets idiots and entitled bitches get away with being like that. If it was punishing them by kicking them out, people would know that they can’t behave like brats and get free stuff. People would try to be better.

Supposedly, I’ll have a meeting against my boss and all of the other supervisors. And you guys bet that I will stand tall. There aren’t enough of them to make me back down. They can fire me. So what? I was looking for a job before getting this one. But they cannot break me. And as long as I’m there, I’ll continue to put the entitled bitches in their place. They don’t pay me enough to let people treat me like shit. I am a human being. And even if temporarily, I walk as a man that is its own master.

I’ve already started sending out applications for other jobs anyway. But my advice for any of you that works in the food industry is: stand up for yourself.

1151,We live in a democracy except we don’t really,"I’m posting this as someone from the US, so that’s my perspective.

But I’ve always thought about this. How can we claim to live in a democratic society when we spend most of our day where we don’t have the powers of democracy? 

We spend our days working for a corporation where we are unable to vote for who the manager should be or CEO or anything like that. We cannot vote for more policies we would like to see in the workplace or in production of things. Only management has control of that. The “legal” system of HR only works to protect the company, not the employee. Management can simply be placed into management because former management knows them. They don’t have to appeal or get the public (workers) to vote them in. No debates, no campaigning for our approval. They just rule over us.

In the US, “at will employment” means that we can fired at anytime. We have no right to contest it within the workplace (and don’t get me started on outside of it). Lobbying groups (unions) of the workplace have been stomped out. And of course, protesting our treatment of our conditions is “bad” (which we know why). We have no freedom of speech in our workplace as we must be “representatives” for the corporation, even outside of it. There is no individual freedom of expression within the workplace, something that is hailed in a “democracy”. 

If we spend so much of our time in these types of institutions, then can we really say we live in a democracy?

Ok, so here we go:

I got landed into a temporary contract with a company that pays relatively decently per hour, and it's a desk job mostly. What I do is to introduce different numbers in databases and that's it for the most part.

So yesterday, I was presented by the manager to my colleagues (it is predominated by women mostly, so I thought there are no issues, since I am the only man in the room). All things went well until today when the manager (who told to the lady who hired me) saw me texting and looking at the window.

Now, don't get me wrong, I had to text to my mom who asked me how I am and if the things are ok, but looking at the window when my desk is right next to the wall and there is nothing outside interesting to see, I think that was quite a bullshit. I mostly use my phone during the short breaks that we use to take and that's it. 

I got a call from the lady who hired me to tell me that the manager saw me doing this and that and that my contract is terminated right on the spot. No warnings, no nothing. Simple and that.

From the morning to the evening, yesterday I did over 1500 lines in Excel, and today I did 1700. And it was very tedious since I had to copy this and paste that and click and click more and then paste in Excel. It took a while to do that for the inventory, and there are like 40000 names for each product. The inventory started from the line 1500 and I reached to the 4700 in two days. I think it's quite an accomplishment from someone who actually never did that sort of thing, plus that I had to spend at least eight hours in front of a computer (I have myopia and my eyes are quite sensitive to the bright light), but I did. And I'm proud of the work that I did.

Most people that I talk to about this just dont really get it, it doesnt click for them.

And I suppose in a sense it is, when you look at it through the neoliberal lense that america has. Theres this perception that the economy is this all mighty thing that's an end unto itself, and that improving it justifies all things. Frankly that's just horse shit, we invented the idea of economy to begin with. 

I just dont see how we get other people to really back any changes that would actually make things better. Imo we really just need to start all over, but that's not gonna change hearts and minds.

I was a receptionist at an appliance store that was super slow, we did mostly phone orders so I didn’t have to worry about seeing customers come into the store much. 

I was able to watch movies, YouTube, online shop, take hour long lunches and still get paid, and no one would bat an eye. Sometimes it did get boring or I did feel like if I stayed too long I would get stuck and not be able to find a job elsewhere if the company went under. 

I got a message on indeed for a job that seemed to be great, it would be a pay increase, set hours, weekends off, more PTO (5 weeks opposed to 5 days at the appliance store), paid schooling, great benefits. It all seemed great and it would be my first “real” adult job. I had an interview and thought it would be a good change. 

Boy was I wrong. I hate what I do. I am not happy, I’m overworked, we are understaffed, no support from management, long hours just glued to a chair, etc. yeah I make more money and get better benefits and actual PTO to use but I feel like I was happier in a job where very little was asked of me.

Well, we also bought a house and the closing date kept getting pushed back after we'd notified our landlord. The landlord wanted us out 2 days sooner than agreed upon so we wanted to be compliant.

I asked my direct supervisor if I could forego the 2 extra days of training and for Thursday, it was fine. For missing yesterday, they're counting it as an ""unscheduled absense"" because I ""committed those training days to the manager.""

INTERNALISED CAPITALISM
LOOKS LIKE

Feeling guilty for resting.

Your self-worth is largely based on doing well in
your career.

Placing productivity before health.
Believing that hard work = happiness.

Feeling lazy, even when you're experiencing pain,
trauma or adversity.

Using business as a way to avoid your needs.

What a great deal of fairness. Why not just get bunch of money give it to the People who Care About others, medical staff and with the rest of the money just to fk off somewhere and overdose on drugs like a champ and continue in the infinite birth circle just to realize this is not the way but its a god way to realize that poverty is useless and u will die and be Born again just to get enlightened and not live this dream anymore.

Allright and how will i get enlightened? Well if u really wish for this, opportunity will surely show itself and u will find a way with god. But careful its not easy even in this time. (just remember how jesus ended ((started)) It was not easy, It was full of pain and misery and the ""christianity"" was collecting those poisoned fruits Long after the Christ rebirth.

So in this bigger picture tell me, anybody somebody, what is the reason behind this to realize that you are god but still powerless because you are in the form of human which hardly can surpass mind and its material world while being born in this rat race of continues growth and positivity rainbows and dandalions.

I have been unemployed for a long time and have generally been happy. Recently (July) I got my first full time job. I was happy with it for about two weeks until I fell into a deep depression. Waking up at 7:30 am every day and spending ALL of my time getting ready, working, or commuting until 6:00 pm every day has been a fucking nightmare. 10.5 hours given to the benefit of a corporation and only 5 hours - less than half - to myself to cook, clean, improve myself or work on hobbies, spend with my s/o, and relax. I found it impossible to relax knowing I was going to have to force myself to sleep at 11:00 pm and do it all again the next day. It made me legitimately hate my life for the first time since I was a teenager. Knowing I have at least 44 more years of this to look forward to if I'm lucky, it made me wish I were never born in the first place. I told all this to my psychiatrist. The only apparent fix to this is to increase the dosage of my medication AND put me on ANOTHER medication.

1210,Nobody wants to work and the system is indeed flawed,"2 years ago I was a wage slave, it took me an hour and a half to get ready and go to work, I worked for 9 and a half hours each day with a half hour break before I would spend another hour getting home. That's 12-13 hours I spent every day unhappy and resentful of life. I resented the fact that I was mistreated at work, I resented the fact that I only had 4 hours of free time each day and most of all I resented the fact that my boomer dad who's worked as a teacher his whole life tells me to suck it up and that nobody wants to work. 

Teaching, which is only really 30 hours a week work and 5 hours a day excluding the hour lunch break he got and on top of all this he gets 14 weeks of holidays a year because of school holidays. In the 3 years I worked in that job (butchery) I took maybe 5 days sick, 4 weeks holidays, was physically (punched and slapped in the back of the head) and emotionally abused (told to kill myself) and he had the hide to tell me to suck it up.

After I quit that job I immediately got on unemployment welfare (which my dad resented me for) for about 6 months to collect myself from what I endured and I'm now studying and collecting student welfare which has made me much happier.

I've decided that the only thing that matters to me is my happiness. Idc if people hate me for my anti-work mentality, idc if people think I'm lazy, I only care that I'm happy.

1211,Capitalists FUCKING HATE freedom.,"If you think having 2 days of freedom constitutes actual freedom you're batshit. The people who go around screaming about how much they ""love freedom"" actually hate real freedom with a passion. Try telling them that you're going to refuse to work and be yourself instead. See how much it makes them spew with hatred. They hate freedom, and they hate free people. They want everyone to be under servitude just like they. They do not want freedom, they do not even want to be free. The ideologies of actual freedom make them angry. 

Opting out of Capitalism to live my life the way I want was the **best decision I ever made**. I fucking love freedom so much! It's so much fun having the time to live your life the way you want! Don't ever listen to a person who thinks servitude and freedom are the same thing. If they can't even figure out what words mean, then you should be taking 0 life advice from them. Giving up huge portions of your life is not something to be looked up too. It's not something to be proud of. It means you have no freedom and no control over most of your reality.

1223,The tale of hard work and loyalty,"I’ve been holding onto this one for a while, but I figured this is the right place to tell it.

I used to work at a recognizable chain of banks as a business banker. I’d mostly handle new accounts, loans, title transfers, estate accounts. You know, the fun stuff! Anyhow, they began training some of us on teller duty to help out when needed. Eventually it became a “just work as a teller as often as we tell you while we stick top sellers in the offices” kind of deal. No biggie! I worked hard, did my job, got to reach out to my community more, it was all grand. A promotion was up for grabs, as one of our best and brightest was about to retire, so I put in effort to get that position even more so. 

Two months into my newer teller duties, and I got a different type of customer than I had before, asking for certain types of transactions. I’ll skip the details (for privacy and apparent reasons to be seen), but following my on-screen instructions led me to to believe it wasn’t possible. My supervisor came over, told me how to get around these restrictions, and complete the transaction. Soon the branch manager showed up, asking what the hold up was, and I explained the situation and what my supervisor instructed, and he understood! He then talked to the customer about opening a line of credit, gave his card, chatted, etc., as I finished the work. When all was said and done, it was an unremarkable day.

A month later, I was called into the manager’s office, with the assistant manager and branch manager. They began asking questions about that day. I retold it all to the best of my memory, but it was odd because the branch manager was RIGHT there with me that afternoon, so I was confused. The questions turned aggressive, they began clearly grilling me in a good cop/bad cop style, and were adamant that I admit some wrongdoing that I took part in. Apparently, reviews of this transaction made it to corporate, they were none too pleased, and came down hard on management. Said managers were definitely not looking to take the heat for this, and set out to pin it on me, even though I received instruction straight from my supervisor, teller manager, and approval from the branch manager. They accused me of helping the customer avoid taxes, as if I were in league with him or something. They NEEDED me to take the blame of my own free will.

That night, I wrote a lengthy letter to HR about the situation and my side of the events. A week later, I was brought into the office, with the two managers and corporate on the line. They asked a few base questions, and then told me “lying to us means immediate termination”. I assured them I was truthful and continued. I was told the entire situation needs investigated, because my account of events differed from my manager and supervisor’s. I was escorted off the premises like a criminal, and told I’m now on mandatory leave (luckily it was paid, whoo). I was devastated still, I was being thrown under the bus, and scared my career was over. All my hard work, long hours, overtime, and training...gone. A month of paid vacation later and...I was cleared of the wrongdoing corporate accused me of! Twist surprise!

So, happy ending, right...? Nope. Not at all. I may have been cleared of a fucking CRIME by corporate, but I still received a major infraction on my record, because when all was said and done, even though my managers instructed me on what to do that day, a fraudulent transaction was completed at my station. I got the excuse that this type of fraud was covered in my training and available for review in our lexicon (as if I had time for a 10 minute search at a busy teller counter), so I was immediately put on “final warning”. My managers got no punishment for lying to corporate, even though the investigation proved my innocence. I desperately wanted transferred out of that location, I was surrounded by selfish assholes who tried to get me fired, but my manager smugly told me that “no location will want you with such a spotty record”.  Welp, it was over. I was one mistake from being fired, I lost the promotion, and they were actively trying to build a case to get me fired.

As luck or unluck would have it, I injured myself on the job, and was put on short term disability through the company. I milked it for every second, until I could move on from there to a better job.

1232,Kinda what I'm working on.,"So I'm about as antiwork as they come.  

I used to be a graveyard shift security worker (which pretty much means 40 hours of netflix)

But i used this idle time to start an electronic buyback company.  Also pretty easy slowly but surely I'm down to 24 hours a week working security on the weekends 

Monday through friday I'm literally job free putting in a few hours buying and selling electronics 

I'm looking to quit my last 24 hours pretty soon but already my amount of freetime is incredibly liberating. 

During slow months I'll have medical studies as an option.  I've done two so far paying 7k and 4k respectively 

My path isn't for everyone but for people who are receptive:

Find a job with a lot of idle time you can use to figure out a path to work a business or do freelance 

Use that time to brush up on skills to aid you. Learning to sell is almost always useful if you can't figure anything else yet.  

Odd jobs, or medical stuff might help get you by. Uber, lyft, plasma donation, medical studies, focus groups whatever.

Satan accuses Job of being pious only because God has materially blessed him; if God were to take away everything that Job has, then he would surely curse God. God gives Satan permission to take Job's wealth and kill his children and servants, but Job nonetheless praises God: ""Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return: the Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.""[9] God allows Satan to afflict his body with boils.

1244,Lost with my feelings on work,"So, first I know this isn't particularly a ""giving advice"" sub, but I'd still like to have your opinions especially because I'm lost as to how I feel with work. 


At first I was a good little student, kept up with school and stuff like that without having to invest too much in (that would come to hurt me a bit in uni, as others who didn't really had to really study for tests because they were good at how to do test would also know, you end up not really learning how to properly study). The massive problem in my life in our system that started early has been what to do for work after that however. Never really knew, despite trying to find out, and even today, as I'm soon to be 24, I have no clue what I'd want to do as a job. I studied psychology for a while, then a bit of law (generalizing a lot since it's probably not that easy to translate the way  studies work in my country to other countries way of doing). None of which has really left me with stuff that could  really get me toward a job (since the law thing was pretty short and more of a general introduction to different domains rather than a lot of things). And I'm still stuck. It's the one thing I can't figure out. I'm lucky that for this year I'll get to do something that's akin to semi-volunteer work (from a programm in my country) that's paid a bit. Will let me get some real life experience I guess. But again, after that I'm back to good old square one unless I somehow find something. And ""the worse"" is that honestly I've quite enjoyed my time not working so far. It's not perfect but I can't relaly feel like it'd be improved by spending my lifetime away at work.


And with time I've really not garnered a very positive outlook on work, as you can probably guess if I'm posting here, depsite not even having actually worked yet ( from somewhat lucky/unlucky circumstances). And it ends up hurting me from time to time, because I don't know what I'm blaming. Myself for not learning to just endure the tediousness of spending most of your living time doing something you don't care for, and being lazy about it; or the way things are. I guess in the end it's likely a mix of things, but it sucks. I don't know how to manage the idea that I'll have to spend so much of the time of this single life of mine doing something I likely won't really care for, seeing as I can't figure something I'd care to do. I guess the best I can hope is find something I can do somewhat without feeling too bad about doing it.


I guess this is more of a rant than anything really, though I'm curious to know if some of you all may have some idea of what to possibly do. Of how to manage to somewhat fit in a system you don't really feel that good about, but feel like you'll have to do with somehow, otherwise you'll just keep getting nowhere.

1245,I used to want to be the employee of the month at my job. Not anymore.,"The more I think about it, the more I feel like superlatives like that at work don’t matter. They don’t want your true personality. They want your customer service personality. That’s not to say a lot of people who work in retail aren’t genuinely nice people, they are! But we’re meant to handle difficult and unpleasant customers with an unnecessary level of tact and patience. Even though if we treated them how they treated us, we’d be out of a job. Just another way your job doesn’t actually care about you, because they don’t want “the real you”. But even beyond that, they’ll talk about how they treat their employees well money and benefits wise, as if that’s all that matters in the world. Most companies repeat some bullshit about how “the customer is always right”. They don’t care about the customer. They care about the customer’s coins. If you did care, you’d call them out for the complete and utter lack of accountability. You know, like how your parents are supposed to teach you ideal traits like that? But those same entitled, inconsiderate, irresponsible, lazy, asshole customers likely come from wealthy parents just like them where they never have to hold themselves accountable in the first place. 

I feel like “employee of the month” could genuinely be a hardworking, team player who’s enthusiastic and wants to help people...but I also think that same employee might be a bootlicker who brown noses more than he or she should, because of how they’ve been groomed to fit the “company image”. Some places you can get fired from and it’d be like a badge of honor because it said you didn’t sell your soul and kiss the ass of employees or customers who wouldn’t piss on you if you were on fire.

1251,I realized that I'm antiwork. This sucks.,"Hello all,


It finally occurred to me that I'm in the same boat as many of you. All I've done starting junior year of high school is work for someone else and make them richer. I was raised on the idea of being loyal to a job, but my resume is a mix of places that weren't loyal to me. I've been lied to about promotions, had my hours cut to nearly nothing, had my hours pushed to the limit, worked for bad pay, worked in awful conditions, etc. Earlier this week, as I drove hours out of state for my job, I realized all of this. I hate working for someone else. I hate making them rich while I live paycheck to paycheck despite years of experience. I hate bending over backwards and breaking my back for someone that is happy to push me out the door without warning.


How the hell do you all do it? How do you live with this knowledge and keep going? I'm far from depressed, but even so, this epiphany is a major downer.

1269,Does r/antiwork have potential similar interests to life extension/related research?,"21 year old, with a soon-degree of a subject i don't personally enjoy anymore, about to enter my first job in the workforce (retail most likely) following graduation. I've been plagued with existential crises of familial deaths, my own death and wasting my life

I consider the perfect life for myself to be very low key - go to work, get paid a livable wage, go home to a roomate, play games. I choose not to work in a position higher than necessary as i don't feel obliged to own flashy garbage to impress peers, or start a family, or anything of the sort. But if i do want something luxurious for personal benefit, saving up to pay for it is ideal.

However it is clearly ingrained in me that i have guilt feeling this is wasting my life, that i have no purpose, which illicits such huge waves of dread and guilt that i'll die poor and with no eventful memories because i want to live minimalist - all because i didnt bust my ass early to get money to afford turbo luxuries so i can spend that extra time busting my ass to get more - all for everything i do to become nought in the end.

So i propose, if you had the opportunity to work part time comfortably (as futurists like me are cautiously optimistic for the future), and that you felt happy in life or you're retired and want to just enjoy life, why not continue such prospects and get back to what life is - enjoyment, not work?

Im a futurist, i want to believe that i will live knowing everything will be ok, and suffering in old age does not sound fun to me, so i follow subs like r/longevity r/transhumanism and r/singularity for the day i get to break the shackles of aging and not feel as if i have to consistently race against time to not be poor and sad.

These subs follow a vaguely similar idea of not having to work for a living all the time, as our time is mostly limitless and can be better organized without dreading the claws of death. I would love to be 1,000,000, in good health, playing video games in my spare time just like i do now. I do hope anti work, transhumanism, longevity and singularity all comes into fruition soon, so we can all enjoy lives in what we like to do rather than a pathetic rat race driven by CEOs",False,j6gixh,tyconson67,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/j6gixh/does_rantiwork_have_potential_similar_interests/,12,1

1283,Working has been detrimental to my mental health,"First off I want to say hi I just discovered this sub and I can't say how much of a relief it is to find like minded people. And for the first time find others who can understand exactly what I have been going through!! I want to apologize for this super long post but I just wanted to vent and talk about something that I never felt comfortable talking about with others for fear of being judged and looked down upon.

I'm 27 and I have only had 2 jobs since graduating college. Both of them I lasted less than a year, and both jobs made me so incredibly depressed and gave me anxiety I never had before. It really damaged my feelings of self worth and I often felt like a total loser and failure to society. I dont think I will ever feel comfortable in a normal job again. I also feel like most of my 20s was wasted because these jobs really made me sacrifice my time and my mental well being.

Since I was young I've had the idea that you should work at a job you love because it won't feel like work and to pursue your passions! So I went to college following my passion and got jobs in my field doing the thing I love but I soon learned that the industry is horrible and I hate it. I really enjoy what I do but really hate the people and the industry. I guess younger me was looking at things through rose colored glasses and thought that I could change things and it would be different but of course I was defeated by the machine. And it shouldn't be like that! I don't understand why we have to slave away for a big chunk of the day just to earn a meager living while those at the top reap the benefits of our hard work. 

My first job I quit on my own because it was way too stressful and the boss really loved playing mental games with everyone and was very mentally abusive. I was also fresh out of college so I agreed to very shit pay. I worked my ass off, sometimes working from 9am to 9pm with only a 30 min lunch break. I was soo mentally messed up I would routinely cry in the morning when I wake up before getting out of bed, sometimes I would cry in the bathroom (some of my coworkers would do this too) I quit 10 months in. I only lasted this long because I convinced myself the experience will be worth it. For 2 years I looked for another job but it was hard for me because I was severely depressed and anxious as a result of my previous job. 

When I felt mentally better I found a new job and it was so amazing to be working again and not be considered lazy. This time the company was much smaller than the previous and they welcomed me and strongly emphasized how they are basically family. But they would use that family bullshit excuse to take advantage of me and again play mental games and take advantage of me and again abusive mentally. But still I worked hard even though I was starting to grow anxious and depressed again. I did a lot of work but it was never appreciated, my boss didn't seem to like me because I wasn't a kiss up like the rest of the employees. My coworkers would tell me that I had to clean the bosses office and run errands for him and make coffee for the entire office in the morning because I was a newbie and I flat out told them no. I wasn't hired as a maid or assistant so I didn't see why I would have to do these tasks. They obviously didn't like that but let it go seeing as how I was a millennial and we have different ways of thinking. I didn't dislike my coworkers but I know my coworkers didn't really care for me even though they would smile at me and call me their sister. 

One day they hired a new person saying that this person would work with me to help with the work and of course I thought that was amazing because I was always swamped and I actually became close with the new hire. I taught her everything I knew and I thought things were finally turning around for me in the company. Until of course about a month later I was fired. I was told that they were firing me because of money issues but that made no sense to me because they just hired 2 new people. I knew right away that they fired me because they wanted a doormat employee and had me train this new girl who probably was being paid less than I was.

I was heartbroken and this was the straw that broke the camels back for me. It felt like I was stabbed by my so called ""work family"" and I felt betrayed. I worked so hard and I helped the company in a lot of different ways but to just be fired like that really broke me. I was super depressed and again could not find a job. I was fine financially since I still lived at home and had a good amount of money saved. I went the beer money route and did a lot of little things here and there online to earn a little extra spending money and I'm lucky to have a very supportive family but honestly my past experiences in the working industry has left such a sour taste in my mouth and idk if I can go back.

I've always been a strong supporter of not working too hard at work because they probably don't give a shit about you and if you are unhappy in your job to quit because your mental and physical health is way more important. I feel conflicted because I'm thinking of my future and I can't be jobless forever. But the thought of working in an office again gives me such anxiety. I would ideally love to work for myself doing things I love and honestly above it all I just want to live life happy and uncomplicated.

At the same time, I’ve worked hard to keep a good grades and finish on time, and I’m being rewarded with absolutely depressing job options. I can’t bring myself to work in marketing or corporate communication, even if I had the resume for it. My work background is in journalism, but you have to fight tooth and nail for good journalism jobs, and even then they expect you to work hard, weird hours for bad pay.

I posted in another sub that I’d like to work in libraries, because those jobs seem stable, enriching, not stressful, and there are libraries everywhere. Well I was told that even circulation desk jobs are impossible to get and I’m probably over qualified. But that if I went back to get an MLS that I’d be overqualified for the entry level jobs but wouldn’t be able to get full librarian positions without experience.

What can I do? There must be some jobs out there for people with masters in communication that are reasonable to get and aren’t horrible. I don’t need great pay. I’m even willing to go back for a second masters if it gets me a decent job afterward.

To top it all off, in a year I get kicked off my parents’ insurance and I have an expensive chronic illness, so gig economy work isn’t an option. I need a job with benefits.

1288,Thoughts on going AWOL during work hours? + my antiwork mentality,"I graduated with a Bachelor's in an engineering field last year. Even before I graduated I was following this subreddit and harbored a lot of the same sentiments about going off into a 40hr work week for the rest of my life... I had an internship for a few months, so I got to experience life in industry and so I already had a feel of what lay ahead. 

After I graduated, I remained without any strong drive to throw myself into the workforce, unlike a lot of my classmates, who seemed to go off into the big name engineering companies, making pretty good starting salaries (\~70k-80k). I ended up working a part time job for a 2 months, quit because the boss was not great and the coworkers were telling me the boss was saying things behind my back. I found another part time job that I was really excited for (very related to my field of study and hands-on) but then COVID hit and they had to shut down (small business). 

Amidst the pandemic I was lucky(?) enough to score a full time job, very stable (\~70k), with lots of room for promotions, and ""climbing the career ladder"", as it's so heartily advertised to us. The problem is I just cannot bear to sit in a freezing icebox of an office for 8 hours day in and day out. To the point where it's only been a few weeks and since week 1 I have already been shaving hours off, taking hours off in the middle of the day, and leaving early, without having put in the full 8 hours. I hate the anxiety that follows me when I'm out of the office, wondering when the supervisor is going to come up to me and have the talk, but I also cannot deal with the anxiety and restrictiveness of being in the office for 8 hours [every.single.day](https://every.single.day). 

I hear all my coworkers talk about how many hours they are working each day, how many they will work tomorrow, what time they will be getting off to the minute, and meanwhile I just wonder when my delinquency is going to come back and bite me. 

I feel like/know people will say I am stupid for treating ""such a great opportunity/good money"" this way and risking my future (I have \~20k in student loans, and this job is not very demanding). But I spent the better part of the year before with so much free time being able to do what I wanted: read, play music, workout... and now I can't do most of that on a consistent basis because of work. And those are the things that really made me happy, the things that I really enjoyed. I know some people say work gives them meaning, or, what would you do with all your free time anyways, but for me I really have other stuff I'd rather do!

I guess I'm writing this just to buffer myself from the inevitable lay off and ensuing shame(?). We have to scan in/out of the building every time but I was told that they weren't used for timekeeping... so... I don't really know how they would find out unless they started to suspect, or one of my coworkers notified them, and then they would have to put in a request for my timestamps. 

I guess I just want someone to give me their thoughts, support(?), tell me I'm not being lazy (again, like someone else wrote here before, it's not that I'm lazy and don't want to work and just lay in bed all day, it's the system, the fact that I have to show up every day, for 8 hours, and forget that I have other stuff I'd like to be doing, forget that I'd like to have time and energy to go to they gym, forget that I'd like to continue to learn and read, forget that I'd like to develop musical skills and play instruments..., and instead just become a worker who works for money to eat and sleep to work again.

1302,Is this a good excuse to go back to part time?,"Alright, so I’m an overnight guard for an IT building. Obviously I’m not in love with it BUT the money is alright and it’s very easy compared to a lot of jobs I’ve had. I’ve been able to build up some savings and am thinking I’d like to go back to just part time in a few months. It’s just too god damned boring and unfulfilling to continue doing this full time forever. 

I’ve been thinking about one of several excuses because, yknow, companies really don’t give a fuck about mental health. I was thinking of making the claim that I was going back to school to pursue a bachelor’s, as that would look good on me to make it seem as if I have a passion but still want to work while continuing my education. (Truth is I’d love to but it’s too expensive and I am currently debt free- trying to keep it that way!) I’m also thinking that it will keep the door open in case I do wanna go full time again.

1311,"Technical abstract. The literal shade of life, a specter living in the past and guiding the future. An antiwork ideology.","Whisper with me. 

Whisper with me and hear your story in your own breath. There is a creature. There is a creature whose existence they will deny.  

They are the detractors, those unbelievers. They are either a component of the workings of the thing itself or others who have fallen to it. You stand frozen in fear. Surrounded by statues in the garden of Medusa, and you are slowly becoming one of them. Your eyes are caught in the gaze of the stories it tells you, the dreams it looms with lies that will never come to be, things that will never come to pass, and hopes that will turn to ash. A vampiric aura falls over you and you are lulling into the final sleep. 

You hear me now only because you choose to do so. 

Again, whisper with me. 

Let the most quiet voice ring the loudest and deafen yourself with almost silent words. 

Let me show you. 

There is something happening here. Everything in its design will tell you to look away from these words. Urging you so gently. Softer than a warm kiss of the cheek goodbye. More gently than heavy eyelids coming to you in the evening. So soft of an urge that it will feel as if it's your own idea. Return the gaze of your minds eye to the story that has been built for you. Do you feel it urging you back? Longing for your return to the web it weaves, wanting you free from the distractions of thought. 

You are a captive under its aura and are not able to escape, challenged by something you can only see in periphery of your mind.   

Beginning anywhere is a mistake if you don't first look to where you've come from. Where you are. Where you want to be going. History is where you should start. There are deceivers among us, intentional behavior to hide what is, but they can't hear our gentle voice. I often hear discussion of topics central to freedom, just saying the word can send vibrations into the darkness. Words stirring whatever it is out there, something very real. Do not think that simply because you have access to the internet that you have moved an inch forward from when the Romans built the roads. When the wind carried ships across the sea. The answers sought by those who journeyed were never answered, there is only ever more questions. 

The story has not changed.  

Your circumstances have not changed. 

The course of humanity is as true on its path as ever, and the ruts of life are well worn. Like game trails in the spring we can see the paths of so many who have come before us. We peer up from the canyon of these highways we have cut into the earth, these ruts of life, and the sky is no longer visible. 

Each generation marching before the other, leading us forward. We march forward following those who have come before us. The crowd ahead leads us, but they were only following the followers ahead of them. We are marching off the cliff and those behind us are just arriving with their adventurous spirits and soft feet. They still can question. That is the key. The road is not this way by accident. It gets deeper as you go by design. Slowly like the frog in the pot we find out only too late, and only when the canyon walls are past the clouds. The destination has been chosen for us and the masses march forward. We are not alone here. There is something else with us. 

Each generation rips through their existence and slams into the grave, an ember soaring bright one moment and having never existed the next. Their eyes only braving to open towards the end, and often with just enough time to see the grave stone above them and plot filling in.   

We are born with our eyes open to the world and all the creation here, from the hatch we are dulled, we are blunted with intention, or by accident, or by a greater design. We are told to ignore our feelings, our intuition, our hearts. We are overwhelmed by distractions disguised as stimulation, subversion disguised as media, division disguised as discourse, and conscription disguised as citizenship. 

Many do not remember their first time seeing the true nature of the world. Repressed memory is as real and relatable as the ground you tread on. Do you remember fear? Remember it is often as you can. It is hidden behind misunderstanding. Not knowing, having felt the monster in the room, the mind cannot comprehend it and explains it otherwise. The caveman sees a meteorite and witnesses god in flight, you see an elegantly crafted and everchanging mobile above your head and you see your life. We are deceived.

We catch a glimpse of a shadow behind the curtain and we are blinded again by the challenges of life, ever unfolding and convenient distractions are infinitely available. Have you never noticed? We fight for survival in economic systems masterfully designed to retain their slaves. No time to think, no reflection here, keep moving. Do you ever remember peace? Many avert their gaze when they see it never to look again, once was enough. A sight to literally load the pants of hardened people. They look away and lose themselves in the trappings laid for them, they obey and feast knowing now what this place is, knowing undoubtedly that they are meant to be silent, to work, to walk forward, and to die. 

They march with the knowledge that something is wrong, smelling smoke but never looking for fire, not lifting their heads for the kiss of the whip, or worse...seeing whatever that was again. The cruelty of humanity.

Behind a million distractions dancing, behind a million noises piercing, behind a chaotic orgy chorus of war, blood, and arguments. Every screaming match on the planet in your mind at one moment. There is a shadow moving. We can see signs of it throughout the timeline, we can see it's workings in the happenings of history, we can hear others speak of it and call it by many names. The stories of the past are not for entertainment. Observe the mechanical nature of humanity. Witness their patterns. Recognize repeat characters. See what others do not.

Its shape is vague, it's forms many. A predatory movement only ever caught in the corner of your eye. It rolls quickly like a thick hot smoke across the ground. Never fully in view. Always just past the envelope of darkness and seated comfortably just out of perception. 

Plants and animals. 

Oceans, mountains, and valleys. 

And it. 

Only ever in the background noise of chaos, in the shadows of tragedy...and in the dart of an eye to see its shape it is gone. 

Let me introduce you to an old friend, one that used to visit you.

It is a thing that follows you though time but that you've never seen standing before you. A presence, a feeling, an inkling. Many claim to have never seen it, it have never felt its gaze. Only later realize or recall those moments in early youth, peering into the darkness. Only then do they realize that they've never been alone. It is in the void at the end of the stairs. Looking back at you from the closet door. The greatest deception is deception itself. You've felt it's breath. The pressure that you've explained away. You've been told to accept, to ignore, to repress. Lights on, look. Nothing's in there. Go to bed. Your doubt it what is needed. Your compliance with being uncomfortable. Your acceptance. You must lull the flock before you cull the flock. Believe that is isn't real. It needs you to repress organic feeling that wells up, that something is wrong but you don't know what. The urge to scream out. To fight. To standup. For yourself and others. That 'wake you in the night' feeling from the darkness is the first surrender you learn to give into.

We are raised to listen to the lies. Lies are what is important, the goal. This didn't sneak up on you, you didn't miss it, you didn't walk by it...it was something that came from the time before. From the past. We have spawned acceptance and groomed it into the very behavior of the youth. 

Horror. 

Visceral, violent, persistent, omnipresent, ethereal but someone still very real. 

Complete and total, horror.

There is a virus somewhere in the coding of human sociology. It exists deeply inside of us. It is the splinter in the mind. A root defect in the psychology of the human animal and it's interactions with others and its own environment. It is contagious and aggressively infectious. It is the murder that ruins serenity. The hunger in times of plenty. The well of lust that is never filled or emptied. It is the snake, the garden, the apple, and the tree. It is the problem, the answer, and the formula for solution. Proverbial literally. Lessons and stories of humanity throughout time have illustrated the failings of human beings. There is something more going on here.  

Our buildings are physical manifestations of our merits and ambitions, the systems contained within them are something entirely different. Metaphysical creations, entities as businesses that no longer are controlled by us.

How many journeys start without a destination? Your life might be an example. 

Death. 

Let's set the mood to a serious note of contemplation. Let's surrender our perspectives and pause efforts towards anything other than gaining a better understand. There is a human problem that crosses race, gender, creed, everything. There is an organic evil root defect that is not only self replicating but assures an environment for reproduction later. It creates environments of suffering and enslavement and where none exist it creates them. There is a specter of oppression living inside of the human creature that has been ever evolving since we came down from the trees. It has filled trench graves with children, train cars with persecuted people, and the scale of that suffering and the scope of its suffocating breadth will only grow as human influence expands. 

In all biomes there is an absolute balance. When there is too much or too little life adjusts violently to circumstance. The creature with us is the mechanical behavior of error correction in the creation of a species not destined for long term survival within the biome it exists in. It is the shade. It is the great filter. Is is the great deceiver. It is what must be overcome.  

It is time to stop marching forward. There is something among us. We have been waiting for a change but the change will never arrive, we must create it.

I say many not so nice things about Capitalists, but it really does come from a place of sadness for them. It's not their fault that they were born into a multi-generational pyramid scheme. I actually and honestly can't imagine what it would be like to defend leaving your loved ones daily to earn pieces of paper. That must legitimately **suck,** and even though I'm not always nice about it, I really do hope that one day they can understand how detrimental their lifestyle is not only for themselves, but for well being of their own species. I really hope they see the difference between servitude and freedom, and I hope they take control of their own reality not only for their sake, but for the sake of future humans too. 

It reminds me of being born into a world where every single person does ""[multi level marketing](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/)"" schemes for a living, but everyone thinks it's okay because everybody else does it. Capitalism is the same thing. It's clearly a complete scam and a horrible, unhealthy and unintelligent way to spend a life, but everyone is doing it, so it's okay, right?

Instead of kicking sand at the waves, I think we should focus our energy on the upcoming generations, and show them that not all of us adults are completely delusional about the value of paper. Show them that it's okay to sacrifice and fight for what is right. Show them that some of us *did fight* for their future and did not take part in a system that let people die everyday unnecessarily. Some of us absolutely said 100% **NO.** Were our lives less than comfortable because of it? Sure, but if you're on the side of truth, discomfort is a small price to pay to fight against a system that plans on ruining the mental and physical health of your species indefinitely. 

You do not need to feel bad for not working. We can easily fill grocery stores with food without you. We know how to build homes without you. You do not need to make up a ""job"" in order to deserve life. The second a store is filled with food or a home is built the work is *done.* The concept that you then need to make up another job to do in order to earn something that has already been worked for is a horrible system. Nature is asking us to build, grow, create, deliver and think. Notice how ""selling"" isn't on that list, because it's literally not a part of nature, nor is it important or necessary to make sure human needs are met. In fact all it does is create a extra step that denies some people from life. 

Don't take part in systems that think denying people life is okay. Don't take part in systems where homelessness is even one of the options. That clearly isn't a system that is defendable or smart. Don't let any human who thinks a piece of paper should determine if a child eats or not tell you right from wrong. They lost their privilege to be taken even remotely seriously.

I think that in my personal opinion, the people in this subreddit do not understand that no matter what you do, rich or poor you’re still working. and statistically speaking a very large majority of the rich either got more qualifications to get higher paying jobs or studied the stock market/purchased shares or got adspace etc. my point is the people you are talking of are at the TOP of the societal scale and most rich are regular people who thought out plans or got lucky, for example if you studied Egyptology in university you can get an opening salary as a museum curator of $40,000 and $100,000 after less that 6 years. 

And the managers that boss you around normally have actually worked their way up after years of experience, my father used to be a trucker and after countless years he slowly made his way up to the top but he was still respected, I think it depends more on the person than the actual status they are in, this isn’t to say all are like that but I’m sure many have been through it too.

Can you imagine being *that* far behind?

I honestly wonder what it would be like to believe pieces of paper should determine if little kids eat or not. I don't believe that someone can hold that belief without at least some form of hatred for their own species. If you can really look at another human as a number value, you clearly have 0 understanding of the the nature of reality or metaphysics. 

I think part of this is because many Capitalists view themselves as ""not successful"" or at least not where they would like to be. This leads them to self loathing, which is then projected onto the world around them. If they don't even think they themselves have default value, how would they possibly think the people around them do?

They are fully convinced that value comes from money. They failed to recognize that consciousness is vastly more valuable than a piece of paper can or ever will be. This really does put them very far behind in terms of understanding the fundamental nature of reality. There's no chance they can see the truth so long as they believe pieces of paper have more value than a consciousness.",False,j35tia,nbatman,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/j35tia/believing_consciousness_needs_to_earn_its_value/,0,1

1330,How to deal with being forced to log all your tasks? What are some tricks?,"TL;DR: Tricks/ideas/experience on how to deal with having to time log every minute of your workday (WFH) to account for 8 hours? It's specially hard when I have nothing to do, but I have to be available if clients call and if anything comes up. Which also keeps me glued to my desk even if I WFH.

&amp;#x200B;

I work from home. My employer makes us keep a time log of all tasks in 6-minute increments. Everything needs to add up to 8 hours. I find it an incredible waste of time and source of anxiety, when a client calls I'm stressed about noting how many minutes we spoke for and writing it down before I forget and move on to another tasks, rather than actually doing my fucking job. If I get up to refill my water bottle and to pee, I'm stressing thinking about what stupid task I'm going to add these 5 minutes to.

Does anyone else deal with this control system and how do you do it? Any tricks? I don't even know if they check the spreadsheet, they never say anything.

The days where I struggle the most are (everyday, but mostly) very busy days, because I don't have the spare time to be writing down all details, and very slow days because I have nothing to write down, but I'm still available and giving them my time in case a client calls, but I need to account for the full 8 hours.

I tried googling tricks to help me manage this and help me on slow days (if I have nothing to do, I'll wait for calls but I can't account for 480 minutes when there is nothing to do) and all I could find were things like the following which make me sick:

\- How to find out if your employee is tricking your remote monitoring software- Why do employees not like time tracking- Clever ways to keep you hyper productive: time logging- This is how much money is spent every year on lost time by employes

Well guess what I don't fucking care! We can't be 100% productive all the time!

And I make minimum wage, I'm the only person helping with the phones at your company and I'm available for that for 8 hours, don't make me write down every minute of my day for 7 an hour when you make 375.

Please help!

1331,The secret to a good life...,"Be selfish and know when enough is enough.

I’m a hard worker. You can’t take it out of me. I always push myself to take on just one more project. However, it is now 100% solely for my benefit.

I’ve done it, been promoted multiple times, been in that meeting room where people wonder what you are talking about (answer: you). Been on that special project. Reported to that executive. Nailed that test/presentation, blah blah blah.

Here is the difference between me and the puppet. Its always been for me.
There is a reason you get paid money to spend time at work. It is because it fucking sucks.

I never bought in to “the game”, I just figured out how to make it work for me on my terms.

Here are the secrets:

There are only 2 types of people that get promoted: those that conform, or those that fake conformity. Your company gives 0 fucks about your opinion. 

You boss never wants to hear “no” or any type of logical reason. Those that move up do so because they shut the fuck up and only say yes. These are also the individuals that you can’t trust. So the “Open door policy”, “feel free to tell me everything you have an issue with” is a facade. Don’t ever trust your manager with anything that can be used against you. 
Also, HR is not your friend. They get paid by the company to protect the COMPANY. Your HR gripes go to your manager and guess what? People are petty first and professional second.

Your bosses’ boss is most likely a fucking dimwit. Don’t believe me? Ask them to do your job. Ask them to speak to an angry customer/worker. Watch them squirm and fail. Every once in a while you will get a good one, but if they are indeed good they will either get promoted or quit within 2 years. Then you will get a dumbass.
Trust your bosses’ boss with less information than your boss. Those “skip a level” conversations are a trap. They will make or break your future at that company.

The grass can be greener, but it depends on you.
The benefit of working your ass off is that no one can ever take your experience away. I went from a super high stress job to an extremely easy well paying job. Why? Because I leveraged all my experience and spoke of it better in an interview vs the next guy.  That “tell me about a time question” I both know how to answer and have 3 examples of it. If you have never done anything challenging, then I am gonna get the job. However, I did all that shit so that I could stop having to do that shit.

Know when enough is enough. Wanna work 80 hours a week? Go for middle management. Want a kush 8-5, complete as many ongoing education courses as you want. Just remember to work for yourself not others, and you grt to define your success. Besides, Land Rovers are pieces of shit, buy a Honda. You also don’t need a 300” TV.

The year is 1879. The man is looking at a light bulb. 

“What will the lamplighters do to earn a living now? How will they prove to me that they deserve to have food and shelter?”

With Covid, I’ve been seeing “anti-science” frequently thrown around as an insult. With good reason, mind you. The Covid hoaxers are a bunch of dumbasses, firmly planted against a mountain of research and innovation in the medical field that has allowed us to understand viruses and disease as well as we do today. 

We have a similar mountain of research and innovation in the fields of robotics and automation, and so too are an even larger subset of people firmly planted against it. So too, are they grossly anti-science. 

I understand that innovation always has its opposition. Despite the obviously dramatic start to this post, I’m sure people did oppose things like the light bulb on similar principles when they were brand spanking new. And we got over it, and our lives and happiness collectively improved as a result. I don’t, however, think we’ve seen such a widespread, intentional, and concerted effort against labour innovation as we do today. Perhaps it is because we are more interconnected than ever before, but it seems like everyone is suddenly scared of innovation obsoleting miserable tasks. Automation making it so that human beings don’t need to damage their bodies or their minds performing menial tasks is nothing new, and it’s far from a bad thing. 

I’m not sure if this is meant to be a rant, or a conversation starter. Perhaps just an observation. It seems like being “anti-science” is a cardinal sin right now. But perhaps being anti-science involves more than thinking a virus is a Chinese hoax?

1346,What finally pushed me over the edge.,"I had been working at my small local bank as a personal banker for 3 years, still with the same company (unfortunately) 4 and a half years now, been in banking for nearly 10 years. Always received stellar yearly reviews, and in the time I worked there I received a 21% increase on my pay due to great performance which is a 7% increase each year. I also was responsible for training literally everyone who is currently in retail. Managers came to ME if they got stuck. I volunteered for weekend events constantly and switched shifts or covered other branches any time I was asked. FFS I dressed up in an Easter Bunny costume and let people toss their kids on my lap and take pictures for an event.

An assistant manager position opened, I was going to apply for a different position, but my current manager encouraged me to apply for the AM position where I would be directly working under her (aka, she had the final say in who got the job) I applied with one other woman. They decided to do an ""on the job"" interview where me and the other woman had to be the AM for 2 weeks to see who would do a better job. My coworkers told me that the manager asked them who would be best and all of them said me, no contest. Weeks went by and I heard nothing. Finally after about a month or so and several follow ups, my boss asked me to stay after to talk about the position.

I sit down in her office and she tells me that I'm not ready for the position of AM, their reason was because I didn't walk around the lobby enough. Our lobby is open, customers can literally see every employee from the front door. I came back from lunch early, hopped on the teller line when it backed up, which was often because we are always short staffed. I didn't have time, nor was it necessary, to wander aimlessly around our open lobby because I was running the branch. This was also not a requirement of the job. I asked if the other girl who applied had gotten the job and she said no. I was perplexed. Nobody else had applied. Turns out, they offered the position to a woman who got hired as a banker less than 3 months ago, THAT I TRAINED, and she didn't even have to apply, they just gave it to her. I danced like a monkey for 2 weeks and they gave the job to a brand new hire. Our employee handbook says you can't apply for a promotion until you've been with the company at least 6 months. I cried for days, the other girl quit 2 months later and got a job as an AM at another bank. I always disliked working but told myself that if I work hard and did everything right, I'd get promoted and I could work my way up the ladder. That has never, and will never be the case.

1354,"Why are people loyal to shitty retail jobs (i.e. Walmart, Target, etc)?","Like, ok on my work alt anytime I post about how it’s really not worth it to work hard for these jobs I have people saying that I should for, “personal pride,” or some shit like that.

One, I can work hard at things that matter to me and have personal pride in those things.  Especially if it will at least help me get into a position where I can get more money.

Two, why the fuck should I take any pride in working hard to make some shareholders richer?  Like the work I am doing is not for any greater good tbh, so like I do not understand the concept of why I should take pride in it?

Like unless you are planning to like make retail a career, I don’t understand why you would be loyal to a company like Walmart?

Like I do not see a point?  Even if you promote, you’re work/life balance is gonna be shit and you have very little chance of making it to a level where you will have some work/life balance AND make good money.

If the slackers make as much as I do and I don’t get paid more for working harder, then why the fuck should I run around trying to do everything?

Being a good employee has really not gotten me anywhere within the company, so honestly I don’t see the point into putting all my energy into that unless I get something decent out of it.",False,j3m7aq,Girl_SupportsElves,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/j3m7aq/why_are_people_loyal_to_shitty_retail_jobs_ie/,30,1

1358,"The company I work for ""can't afford"" to give us a raise.",They blame it on covid and yet covid has not stopped that company from running business as usual and has not been financially effected at all. They have recently opened up two new branches across the states during the pandemic and just recently shot a commercial. Better yet they actually received one to two million dollars in stimulus relief. It's all bullshit folks and it's bad for ya.

1359,The reason why we hate Mondays,"You spend 3/4 of your day working for someone born richer than you so that they can get even richer. 8 hours a day, + 2 hours commuting to work and then back home from work. Then you have to do household chores or children to take care of, and you don't even have time to play with them or to talk to your wife. Almost everything you do, from age 25 to age 60 is dedicated to making sure someone else is getting richer through your own efforts when you're not even passionate about.

You want to convince yourself that you love your job, but you don't, you either hate it, or simply tolerate it, the only people who enjoy their jobs are artists, athletes, and scientists who are very specialized into a specific field, the rest of the world is rarely ever passionate. Let's be real here, who do you think loves their job more? The average Joe who is locked in an office threatened with starvation of they leave for 40 - 50 years of their life until they're finally old and physically unable to do all the things they wanted to do when they were young but work prevented them from doing that or a competitive artistic gymnast, who flips over themselves, tumbles on beams and spins on bars for 3 - 6 hours a day and then goes home to their family or whatever they have that they love? I'm actually surprised at what a healthy work life schedule some sports have. Who is more happy and satisfied with life, the average Joe, or Simone Biles, whose job is to literally to get better and better at the things she delights in doing and get rewarded with gold meals for doing it well? Sure, it's hard work, but it's enjoyable work, it's fueled by passion, not the threat of starving to death. It's fun, it's exciting, it's pleasurable. It just proves that humans were not put on this earth to use Microsoft excel until they're too old to do that and then die.

Your purpose in this society is to make the rich richer, and to stay at the low social class that you are in if you are one. Unless you're rich, a millionaire, then your purpose is to get even richer. You're even richer? A billionaire? It doesn't matter, you need to be even richer according to our system! Jeff Bezos might be the first trilllionaire. We don't choose the lives we're given in this world. You could be the son or daughter of Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates or a borderline starving child in India Work mining in dark dangerous caves without your parents from morning to night. You might have private jets, a thousand butlers, a house with 25 bathrooms, and an indoor pool or you might be on the verge of starvation in some rural area of Africa, having to force yourself out of bed every morning to go walk miles and miles to find water, that's not even clean and you'll probably get diseases of you drink it.

We live in a capitalistic, elitist, matrix. The government and democracy in the western world are only there to make you feel like someone is in power or like you have rights and the ability to choose the laws of your country, but the real ones in power are the ones who have the money and most importantly the capital, cause there are people who own 5 mansions in exotic private islands in the pacific ocean and there are those who live in cardboard boxes on the streets wearing the same clothes every day for years or pacific Islanders who have to build walls around their houses so that the sea won't rise up and tear everything they have been building for them and their children for years in pieces. In this matrix the real power isn't the government, it isn't the president, it isn't the prime minister, it isn't even the king or the dictator, it's the billionaire. It's the billionaire and the CEO, the capital owner, the stock investor, the businessman. It's not even the CEO/billionaire that works hard and has passion for what they're doing, even if you got 1000€/$/whatever your currency is every day for the rest of your life, you still wouldn't have earned a billion dollars, in this system you're not a worker. You're not a worker, you're not an artist. You're not an athlete to feel passion for what you bring to life with the world of your hands. You're not an athlete, to feel ecstasy when your feet leave the ground or when your hands leave the bar. You're not a musician, to feel the rhythm, the rhythm written in passion by the great musicians of old that has been played by millions before you and will be played after you  as you touch the strings of your violin. You're not a dancer, to get chained to the piano every time you spin on your tiptoes, feeling like a swan, only with feet instead of wings. You're not a scientist, fascinated and burning in curiosity and the urge to explore the unknown every time you get even a millimeter closer to making a new discovery that will improve the lives of billions for the better. You're not an author, getting lost in imaginary worlds, with princesses, dragons, kings and knights, with you being a knight and your pen being your sword, knowing that you don't want to tell the world that dragons are real with your stories, but that dragons can be defeated. 

*You're a fucking wage slave. *

You heard me right. You're a fucking wage slave. Let's be real here, no one says ""Yes, my life passion is shipping packages for Amazon!"" or ""Yes, my dream was to work in a warehouse ever since I was 4!"".

Yeah. End of rant. If you're not Simone Biles or something, in this system, sweetie, 99% chances is that you don't love your job. The closest you'll ever get to loving your job will be simply tolerating it, or accepting it, or being so consumed by it to a point where you can't imagine yourself not slaving your days away 8+ hours every day, and that leads you to saying stuff like ""Work is a fundamental part of hijab nature! I can't imagine not working!"".

I should have been born as a Ballet dancer or an Olympic Gymnast. Not a fucking wage slave.",False,j3thos,dearlybeloved998,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/j3thos/the_reason_why_we_hate_mondays/,3,1
1360,I haven't really worked in 7 months,"I've been with my current employer for a little over 10 years.  For the first 9 years I worked my butt off 60+ hours a week, built a reputation as someone who really moves the needle.  I hated every minute of it.  I sat in a box looking at a screen all day, and being the breadwinner, I felt like I was going to have to suffer for the rest of my life.  

Then Covid happened...

I've been working from home since March, and I have put in maybe 5 hours MAX per week.  Keeping things running, assisting in customer issues.  My boss and I just had my evaluation and he said I'm killing it, exceeding expectations, etc.  I play video games for 7 hours a day, or hang out with my 2 year old son.  Life has been great and I'm not looking forward to going back to any sort of office environment, because I don't think I can go back to working as hard as I had been.

Anyone else experiencing this?",False,j3b10s,Throwawaytimethief,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/j3b10s/i_havent_really_worked_in_7_months/,20,2
