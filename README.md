The total dataset size on disk that was collected during this project was [X]GB. While it is possible to reproduce it using the steps below, we also provide a way to download raw data instead. The dataset is available at [TBD].

## Reproducing data collection

[WIP], e.g. 
 - To reproduce the collection of all submission IDs, please run notebook `XYZ`

# Reproducing the analysis
