9,Links to some anti-work theory.,"I know that for many people reading this sub most of this comes as common sense, and many of you may have read these texts (especially Blacks' Abolition of Work). However, I imagine there are people coming here who are trying to wrap their head around the idea of an anti-work position, but without regular exposure to these and similar ideas it can be hard to formulate a strong opinion and direction, even if you feel the alienation and desperation of work on a daily basis. Therefore, I am just gonna drop some texts below that helped me feel confident in forming an anti-work stance.*

As noted by the many links that get posted to this sub, there are countless, ordinary people out there striking back at their bosses and the workplace simply out of desperation and anger, and doing so of their own accord, rather than campaigning for any systemic changes (and they certainly are not sitting around reading theory like me). I am not interested in the reformation of any systems but with immediately changing my relationship to work, and in possibly helping others do the same. I think that these texts mostly fall within this line of thinking.

*While these are all from the Anarchist Library they are not specifically anarchist texts and are purposefully relevant to anybody reading them.
