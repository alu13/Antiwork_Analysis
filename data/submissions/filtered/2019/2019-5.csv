0,Does anyone else just feel like work is inconvenient?,for lack of a better phrase   i spend 40 hours a week doing things i dont care about i spend most of that time thinking about things i could be doing at homefrom cleaning to watching netflix to going to the gym in the middle of the day if i wasnt working i would have more energy and maybe actually think about finding a passionhobby but instead im so exhausted when i get home that i just veg out  yes it sounds like making excuses yes maybe i could change my mindsetbut im just so tired and i think thats what they want   in the meantime ive applied for several maybe less shitty jobs this week related to something i maybe care about,brq7em
1,What about an Anti-Work Union,i am still fleshing this out but what about an antiwork union that focuses on issues related to precarious work and the gigeconomy that rejects state intervention to create full employment it could have as its explicit goal the freeing of people from work as necessary to their survival something like what iww once was but with more explicit focus on abolishing wage labor  it could have as one of its tenants something likecapitalism is in a moving condradiction in that it presses to reduce labor employed to a minimum and yet posits waged labor as the only way for 99 of people to make a living  does anything like this exist it is a stupid idea how could it function,brhyrs
2,Attendance Is Mandatory (Rant),what the fuck just what the actual fuck i am just so annoyed right now the management team at my office wants to schedule a 4 hour gonna end up being maybe twice as fucking long training on the day off that persons get and as they claim attendance is mandatory thats such a fucking passive aggressive phrase   im just tired of this place right now im just hiding in the sick room because everything here is shit im trying to grade a 4 minute call and its taking 15 minutes because word keeps crashing because their computers are from the dark ages based on todays standards   im just tired of work and these dumbasses thinking that this shit gives their life worth or some fuckery because all it truly does is stress me out and i cant sleep at night or enjoy anything because im stuck here having my life sucked from me i just wanna go home man god damn,brdymy

6,retai/food service is first world hell.,remove this if it doesnt fit but i felt like you all would be kinder to my ranting than the rest of reddit  im about to quit my job since i have the safety net of a slightly better job in a field that doesnt make me want to blow my brains out so heres some things that made my job the piece of shit that it is  ampx200b   the phrase work theft ive been talked to twice since i started this job in this location less than a year ago both times were about me taking too long breaks the worst part of this was them not taking the blame my two bosses told me my coworkers didnt trust me and were coming to them constantly to complain about me taking a 20 minute break instead of a 15 minute break  to reduce shoplifting in the store we have to walk the floor and greet customers and fix up messy areas this walk should take 510 minutes now you know why i took long breaks our shrink walks never reduced theft except for greeting known shoplifters i was told that i wasnt dedicated enough to the job and they could tell i didnt take pride in my shrink walks     they were fucking right  pizza parties arent a replacement for more money and respect  my store manager is a creepy fuck and has literally been caught punching walls in the back room and makes all of our majority female employees uncomfortable ive personally complained to his boss but uh hes allowed to be a dick because he makes the company   store credit cards are a scam  specifically the cards from my store are dumb dont get them  also this is probably true for the majority of big box stores but employees who do all of the work selling the cards get little to no rewards at my store we get reach cards that get drawn randomly every month and one person get either a 25 gift card to the store or a shit piece of store merch my managers get bonuses and raises  now if you catch and can help lp prove than an employee is stealing product or  guess what you can get up to 350 as a reward cash not gift card   because of this ive been snitched on for shopping our merchandise  i was fucking looking at the color of the lipstick i wouldve bought it too if my discount was more than 10 at my old location we shopped during work all the time  not only do i have to be polite to everyone at work including employees and bosses i need to be overtly friendly i have coworkers that do this and its fucking unsettling and customers that i speak to as a human being appreciate the store much more than when i treat them as a thing to sell too fake friendliness is not something people like  ceos  ampx200b  i think thats all i really wanted to say fuck my job i cannot wait to say goodbye i just wish my coworkers didnt have to stay no one deserves to get paid fuck nothing and treated like shit 40 hours a week,bsb8dj

13,A more honest exchange,i have been really depressed about work lately but im starting to come around its been a struggle to give myself the credit i deserve i tend to lose motivation and let more routine organization and communication tasks slip by me but i am still pretty good at getting our main tasks done when there is urgency that calls for it i work as hard as anyone else its actually when things slow down that i can be lazy i have motivation issues that i need to work on likely related to a deeper depression which has nothing to do with work or maybe its add maybe laziness is just laziness i dont know  but sometimes i just wish that people knew and accepted my work performance for what it is because its this unceasing imagination of peoples judgments which really makes me anxious and depressed cant this somehow be a part of the negotiation of labor despite how often i slip up i know i am not going to get fired because i have skills and experience which are hard to find i would be difficult to replace  at the end of the day i know that my presence is a net positive for them losing me would make things more difficult why does it seem impossible to be open about my flaws to lay them on the table and say take it or leave it why should the burden be entirely on me to change for the better or else feel ashamed by my repeated failures to improve i do want to get better but i also want this guilt and shame out of my life i feel anxious for 8 hours a day at work and then guilty or ashamed for another 8 when i leave thats no way to live its an unfair exchange for my livelihood  for just the bare right to pay for an apartment some food and other necessities i just want to fucking be why does that have to come at the cost of so much mental or emotional strain  to me the ideal situation would just involve some simple but perhaps radical honesty about the exchange of my labor i would promise to put in my time and do my best to improve my performance but in addition to my wage i would want some basic understanding and acceptance of my flaws i would want to drop the faade i put up from day zero when i first sit down to interview and only list my strengths never my weaknesses i dont want to feel like an impostor anymore i dont want to feel like i have been trapped by the very perceptions of myself that i try to encourage i dont want to feel like i need to escape before anyone finds out who i really am i want my employers and my coworkers to say were at last glad that youre here to help because having you is better than not having you and thats good enough for us is that such a big ask am i being naive,bv0ylw

15,Hired on the Spot and then Fired Immediately,so as the post title said i went to an interview at a local branch of a company whos expanding their operation and was hired on the spot my work experience just prior to this was at a very successful company with a good reputation and i had glowing recommendations coming from my previous bosses i went into the interview knowing full well i was overqualified for the job as my last job was doing basically the exact same thing but i didnt expect to get hired on the spot      side note in my experience hiring on the spot is actually not a good sign it means the company might be more desperate than theyre willing to admit      but anyway i tell her more prior work info and start filling out the legal hiring forms but then the interviewer starts asking me weird or even possibly illegaltoask questions so other than yourself who requires you to be employed even at the time i knew this was a red flag so i know this interview which again was technically over as i was filling out hiring information is gonna get awkward real quick for the sake of my own clarificationsanity i somehow worked up the nerve to ask her a few questions as well so whats the next step from here interviewer lady says shell submit my paperwork to my new boss and he will contact me on wednesday about drug testing and a start date this was also a red flag to me why would my new boss need to see my resume and cover letter and prior experience is he somehow involved in the hiring process something about that just seemed real out of place to me but i thought maybe it was just some weird unorthodox hiring procedure   ampx200b  anyway the interview ends my paperwork is filled out and the interviewer tells me ill hear back from them on wednesday well wednesday comes around and guess fucking what they retracted their employment offer not gonna lie it was like a movie where i read the email like 3 times to actually comprehend it my brain starts going a million miles an hour trying to figure out what went wrong     failed background check nope never been arrested or in trouble not even a traffic ticket   bosses said something unbecoming of me no i worked with them a long time and they were also my friends definitely wasnt that   something wrong on my resume or cover letter nope double checked and it all looks good   did i say something wrong no dont think so i wouldnt say i aced the interview but it definitely didnt go badly     so then i start remembering the real minor details   ampx200b  interviewer was late to the interview despite it being a time she told me and that we knew ahead of time for 2 weeks security guard accidentally slipped that she was in a meeting she was in a meeting at the same time she was supposed to interview me on a time she set     employees seem to be coming in late as i was waiting for the interviewer to show up and not like 1 or 2 but like 20 kept filing in and going through security no idea why      when i first walked in i had to correct her on some things she misunderstood about my previous employment it seems like she did some research on my last job but some of the things she ass u me d were objectively wrong my last workplace manufactured things in a proprietary way and she just researched the industry standard way of doing things i literally specifically mentioned that on my resume as well so i dont know if where she went wrong there again looks like she was winging it      call me cocky but i think i was fired out of their own incompetence the being late to the interview and then not understanding the things i mentioned when contacting her earlier i dont know what else to call it i should have been an obvious hire for this company and i guess i was at first before whatever happened behind the scenes went down anyway im just kinda taken back but their lack of professionalism id love to hear what you guys think about this or if something similar has ever happened to you     also because they wasted a fuck ton of my time i dont mind dropping their name the company was msc industrial,buwxg1
16,Do you like being relied upon? Do you ser that as a benefit of work?,this is from an interview with sam harris adam grant says that what makes me people feel as if they matter at work or otherwise is feeling noticed cared for and relied on 3845  just thinking about how this is one of those benefits of work that i have a hard time finding elsewhere i know that when im not working i start feeling depressed and i think some part of that is the need to feel relied upon by others  when i think about being antiwork i cant seem to get over all these small intangible benefits beyond pay the sort of babyinthebathwater type benefits that i dont want to lose but cant seem to find elsewhere  i could be wrong but it does seem that there is some psychological benefit to being relied upon to being held accountable to complete tasks even if you dont wanna do them i dont know how to square that with my sheet desire to not work or my politic leanings towards ubi,bvemce

18,Answering Your Phone on a Day Off - Nope,ive never understood people that answer a workrelated phone call on a day off theyre not ringing up to shoot the breeze you are probably not obligated to answer that phone if youre in the emergency services on call thats cool  i also had a friend that was shocked that i let a call from work ring out while we were having an early morning coffee i said that its so early in the morning theyre probably ringing up to ask me to cover a shift fuck no its my day off ive planned to meet for coffee and then do fuck all because its my time   id occasionally answer my phone and say i was two towns over or out hiking or something sometimes i was my boss was suspicious that i was always doing something when they rang to ask me to cover pardon me for not wanting to spend every waking moment of my life behind that fucking counter,bt9x57
19,Anyone here work in social services or the mental health field?,i work with seniors who are low income have mental illnesses and other disabilities i would like to find meaning in this work but most of the time i feel like im a duct taper most people i work with are really isolated some have no friends or family at all so my interactions with that person might be important to them but i really dont feel like im making a difference even if someone tells me i helped them i feel nothing even though i do empathize and care   for me i think years of suicidal ideation are also taking their toll making me feel obligated to constantly be justifying my purpose to myself but i think it also has to do with expectation vs reality and pretty much omnipresent burnout ive done other types of jobs like especially pointless data entry and that was much worse but im getting weary of my constant jobrelated dark night of the soul im 34  i know most of us here want to limitdo away with paid employment but im interested in hearing from folks in my field how are you coping and do you think your job is sustainable for your own mental health do you feel like youre succeeding in helping people or improving their lives do you feel disconnected from the work,bukj2d

21,'i was henry sy's slave' by Danilova Molintas [long], i was henry sys slave  first published in i the investigative reporting magazine janmar 1995  a up1 undergrad tries to see if she has what it takes to be an sm salesgirl  i dropped out of college in the second semester of 1989 to joint manilas hordes of jobseekers i had a government grant in a good university but i was tired of trying to make ends meet with the measly p5002 a month i received from the state  i was 19 and felt deeply alienated from the rest of my middleclass classmates at the school of economics and the grumbling of my belly forced me to leave school to join the nameless faceless swarm of filipinos looking for a job  like many jobseekers with neither skills nor business contacts i scouted the classified ads of the manila bulletin then i beat the pavements on my way to an interview or a typing exam  i passed several exams and was able to bluff my way through countless interviews only to find out that my biggest disadvantage was my height i am fourth of an inch short of five feet this meant i was disqualified from relatively higherpaying jobs as a hotel receptionist or even as a secretary in a makati firm  i was desperate by december that year i finally came across the shoemart ad looking for 200 young girls from 18 to 24 years old good looking at least 52 with pleasing personality guaranteed minimum wage  what the heck i told myself so i gave it a shot  ampx200b  applying at shoemart began with an encounter with an arrogant security guard he first asked usaround 15 young women between 18 and 20 years old in pretty dresses heels and makeup all looking and smelling like flowers wilting in the noonday heatto line up in front of sm citys rear entrance  we were told to arrange ourselves according to height while the guard went around checking if each applicant had a complete set of requirements a biodata and four colored 1 x1 photos those of us who did were then marched into the store  i was amazed to find the premises dingy in stark contrast to the rest of shoemartor at least the part revealed to customers while waiting to be interviewed i chatted with the other applicants one of them asked us whether we were catholic i failed to understand the relevance of her question until i noticed that the others eyed her with envy when she said she was a member of the inglesia ni kristo ink3  later i was told that sm preferred ink members because the sect explicitly bans its members from joining unions many of the few temporary employees who were eventually regularized belonged to that favored religion and not a few desperate men and women were said to have converted to that faith to ease their entry into the job market  as in every exam or screening there were leaks one applicant whispered to me that there were only two questions to contend with why do you want to work and why do you want to work with shoemart  i thought that was easy but when it was my turn madam supervisor jolted me with a new question o tagaup ka pala bakit hindi mo na lang tapusin yung pagaaral mo youre from up so why dont you just finish your studies  i told her my father had died when i was in high school forcing me to support myself through college i said i was so impressed by shoemarts success that when i finished my studies i wanted to continue working with the company in a better position fat chance but i told her that in one nervous breath and was rewarded with a sympathetic smile  madam supervisor warned me she wasnt sure i would make it since the store was only hiring 200 or so temporary employees for the expected stampede of christmas shoppers and that there were at least 120 applicants in a single day but she asked me to return the next day at nine sharp for another screening  ampx200b  the following morning i was herded with 50 other applicants into a classroomofsorts we were asked to write two essays on why do you want to work and why do you want to work with shoemart argghh again i thought but obediently scribbled away  then the sales supervisor began a lecture he started with the tale of how the young henry sy had risen with the simple conviction that if he sold a pair of shoes at one peso to at least a million filipinos then he was on his way to becoming a millionaire that and determination were supposed to be the secrets of the sy empire  after the lecture composed of company trivia and the location of the various departments within the store we were given another exam  when we were through the supervisor arranged the test papers from the highest to the lowest score each applicant was asked to come to the front of the room and retriever his or her test paper those who had failed were asked to stand on the right side of the room dejection in their faces as they clutched their papers  i saw no need for such a humiliating procedure but it was not the last act of petty cruelty i witnessed as an sm girl  ampx200b  walang pangit sa shoemart there are no ugly people at shoemart were the first words of the personnel manager a cheerful chubby woman who was assigned to orient new employees  and when you use that sm uniform everyday on your way to work you can be proud of the fact na walang pangit sa shoemart she then revealed to us the secrets of being a beautiful sm girl starting with what she called personal hygiene  we were told to keep our uniforms clean and well pressed the boys were told to keep cleanshaven and to have their hair always cut above their ears the girls were supposed to keep their hair always neat we were also expected to wear makeup  and dont forget to change your underwear everyday girls and boys she said goodnaturedly  shoemart did not provide us with uniforms since most temporary employees were sacked after six months so we had to have our own uniforms sewn only a handfulthe most goodlooking and obedientwere eventually retained as regular employees i learned that because of this policy many sm girls became landmark girls then robinsons girls hopping from one department store to another every six months  while shoemart paid us minimum wages it cut costs by keeping only a few permanent employees who received maternity sick and vacation leave benefits  ampx200b  the sm girl is not only pretty she is also quite sexy employee uniforms are cut a little above the knee permanent employees wear bodyhugging navy blue dresses that button up at the front for temporary sm girls the attire is a navy blue pencilcut skirt and white cotton blouse all female employees are required to wear twoinch high opentoed openheeled sandals the effect of the entire getup can be quite fetching  but more than to charm the sm uniform was developed for a less benign purpose to deter employees from stealing our uniforms were not supposed to have pockets the opentoed shoes were meant to make it inconvenient for us to conceal money or goods in them we were not allowed to wear jewelry or carry handkerchiefs no slips or chemises were to be worn at work  if an sm girl stole some merchandise or cash she has no place to hide it except maybe in her underwear but even that was difficult because every time we entered or left the selling area we were thoroughly frisked  the management took other precautions an entire departmentthe customer relations servicewas tasked not only to catch shoplifters but to spy on other sm employees  even when we needed to go to the toiled we had to guard against theft first we had to make sure another employee took our placea very trying affair since there were just enough employees to fill each station then we had to ask for a pass from the supervisors whose main job i soon began to think was to remain unavailable the process was so exasperating most of us chose not to relieve ourselves  as counterchecker my job was really nothing more than that of a bagger while standing beside the cashier i was to find the rightsized bag for the goods sold to a customer but i was supposed to check that the number of items the cashier punched into the cash register corresponded to those that i would pack into the bag i was also supposed to ensure that the cashier would not steal money although how i was to do so i had no inkling  all these procedures were guaranteed to create an atmosphere of distrust among employees and i worried about how i could make friends in such an atmosphere  the last step on the way to becoming a fullfledged shoemart girl was the medical and dental exam  the dental exam was to ensure that toothaches would never be given as a reason for sudden absences from work said the dentist who examined me  the medical exam was rushed in a cubicle with only a curtain to shield me from a long line of girls awaiting their turn i was examined by an aging male doctor who felt for lumps not only around my breasts bu on my nipple too he was assisted by a woman but she was either too jaded or too ignorant to stop him from what i felt was a sexual assault i knew there was nothing i could do at that point except resolve never to get sick and put myself at that doctors mercy  ampx200b  my first day as an sm girl began with a struggle to put on all the regulation war paint even when i had won the skirmish with makeup brushes rouge and mascara i still worried that all that paint would melt on my wayby busto work  i was an opener on the first week on the job and that meant i had to be at my station by 9 am 30 minutes before the first shoppers invaded the store  at about 915 a husky female voice announced the singing of the national anthem and all sm employees stood at attention this was followed by the recitation of some credo the exact words i have since forgotten but with was a vow to serve each customer with a cheerful smile this entire morning rite we were told was part of a japanese method of management  after that it was check check stamp dump staple smile check check stamp dump staple smile check check check check dump staple smile  any other time of the year the job would have allowed me time to daydream but it was christmas the season of nightmares for sm girls by noon the store was mobbed by shoppers i speeded up to work spurred on by the sighs legshaking and and other impatient gestures of customers waiting in line  after a few hours i had abandoned any attempt to smile or even look at any customer i was stressed and my feetunused to standing for so long on twoinch heelsbegan to hurt  there are at least 100 sm employees in a shift and they all break for lunch at the same time causing long lines to be formed behind the bundy clock the lunch counter the water fountain  and the toilets every lunch break a hundred girls would be competing for six cubicles and the same number of faucets this stampede would happen every time a shift took a break so while the janitress never seemed to stop mopping the toilet floor it remained constantly muddy i thought the sign comfort room4 should be taken off the door  each time i went for lunch i had to have myself frisked before leaving the selling area locate my time card punch out at the bundy clock line up at the employees canteen eat brush my teeth and retouch my makeup by the time i was done it was time to return to my station  when i had gotten used to the lunch routineor when i brought a sandwich to eati managed to get a few minutes to rest at the cramped locker room where only regular employees had lockers some lucky girls were able to lie down on the few benches there for a catnap others just slumped on a bench from fatigue and dozed off uncaring about whether their skirts were in place  ampx200b  there are ways that the powerless get back at those who exploit them stealing was the first way when a customer chose not to buy a chocolate bar and left it at the counter some cashiers and countercheckers would conspire not only to eat it but to eat it on the job  small items like hair clips and bracelets could be artfully concealed in our underwear these little things were stolen i felt to break the monotony of a mindless job more than anything else  what really went on in the minds of the other workers i never found out we were forbidden to gossip with each other during work hours after work our thoughts were of soaking our tired feet in warm water so most of us chose to go straight home  i left shoemart after a month and a half with little regret while i earned the minimum wage much more than i would have received as a semiskilled worker at a smaller establishment i felt bled for every single centavo i was paid  at the start of 1990 a strike broke out at the sm north edsa department store with workers demanding higher wages and better benefits there was even a rumor that one of the managers would be confronted for the lie down or layoff policy he imposed on many temporary sm girls  that i had not been part of that strike is the only regret i have today about having deserted my post as an sm girl   ampx200b    1 university of the philippines  2500 philippine pesos probably around 39 usd in todays money accounting for inflation and historical exchange

22,"""Where do you want to be buried?""",my 60yearold dad was asked this question recently he responded at this rate youll be burying me at work  i know he made that comment jokingly but there is a sad truth to his statement that his professional life has unreasonably consumed his time and efforts  he worked for the same company since his mid20s since i was a kid i only remember him coming home from work sleeping on the couch after work and destressing by watching tv or whatnot before hitting the bed and the cycle repeated for years  he eventually climbed the corporate ladder but that translated to seeing him less often hed often work overtime and since he cannot drive in the evening eye problems he would sleep over at a family members house near his workplace he returns home to his family on average 2 days out of the workweek,bti0k9
23,Working for 40 years doesn't make you mature,humans see working and maturity as one in the same but just because youre willing to give up 40 years of your life doesnt make you mature   if youre not able to see the issues with our current system homelessness neets ect and you blindly support it then you are immature and in need of growing up not the people who refuse to support immoral systems    the fact that so many people apparently dont know what theyd do without their jobs is disgusting so many humans literally have no value whatsoever when it comes to their own time and thats just so sad if humans dont value their own time then how could they possibly value someone elses   this is why so many people get upset when people just want to live a comfortable lives without working everyday so many people value their own time so little that they actually cant fathom spending it how they choose so to them anyone who is must be lazy a leech a failure a loser ect   in reality we are just humans who value time and id argue that is a sign of a functioning mature brain,btxpzu

87,I'd like to live like my cat(s),the guys sleep in a shack my family built for storing firefood now they even got plankets in there they spend alot inside but lets pretend they dont even then its pretty good living conditions for a cat sleeping on soft warm fabric materials made by humans really thick stuff too they get milk and water from us but sometimes then enjoy drinking the rain water instead too the cats were wild before we took them in and they survived anyway plenty of stuff to eat and scavange around our small city as a cat   im jealous of my cats i go to work in the morning and they might just be outside doing whatever they want or sleeping hunting who knows i come from work stressed and keep looking at my clock on how much time i have left what chores i have to do plan ahead etc while these cats are totally fullfilled and make no plans there are content with being where they are and are truly at peace and live completely in the present they are pretty safe too if they get too sick some human can carry them to the hospital or they can either accept death and die happily not many other dangers around even if i left them they would probably survive sure they might not be laying about as much but they would become more active looking for food overall a better life than a human  my issue is i just can start living like a cat if i camped in the forest i might succedd but its hard to survive there and i would have to be undetected because people would come and throw me in jail i couldnt really grow stuff in the forest   ampx200b  i couldnt just walk on some empty friggin land that noone uses and build my small shack there thats illegal and i would be punished so all i can do is slave away and gather money then maybe with that money i can buy property and when i buy my property ill find out i cant just build anything on my own property that i bought no matter how small and simple it is i would need permits and all kinds of stuff that involves other people who are there to take your money so they can approve it a costly thing all of this you might save for awhile and buy that land which is pretty expensive these days but thats just the beginning   i would love to live like they did in the older days but i almost cant a cat can i cant its that simple deeply jealous of my cats but i still love them no less  they also wish i was home more and wonder where the hell their human dissappears for 9 hours each day   also my boss should pay me double hourly if its sunny out fuck them there is this 70 something woman living in the russian taiga hard enviorment but she survived all these years alot of years on her own to and this is a woman with a tumor living in one of the harshest places on earth it would be so simply for me to survive without a job i wouldnt mind working 10 hours a day if it was for my own benefit i mean if she can survive so could i much easier in my climate then hers   ampx200b  eh i better end this rant its getting out of hand sorry guys,btapnc

97,"We could still have ""tiers"" without starving the people at the bottom",i agree that if we give everyone everything they want that less people would work but i feel we could structure society in a way that entices people to help and rewards them fairly without leaving anyone behind no one here is suggesting that everyone should be given mansions teslas and gucci shoes most people here are suggesting that humans should have the right to some food some water and a shelter not a mansion not 5 star meals just cheap food and a cheap apartment or trailer   you can still have tiers in society without letting the people at the bottom have nothing you can allow everyone a piece of bread and still get people to work by offering them more than one piece you can offer people lots of things better cars better clothes better shelters the right to cut in lines faster internet tickets to things better food better restaurants ect   if the people at the bottom must have nothing in order for this system to survive then this system needs to be fixed if there are 10 people and 10 pieces of bread its fucked up not to give everyone a piece we live in a society that has as many as we want and we still let people starve theres no way around this and people arent going to stop pointing it out until something changes    i think part of the issue is deciding what a human deserves by default i know many feel its nothing but as a fellow member of our alien species and the only alien species were aware of in the universe i beg to fucking god damn differ,bvd3aj

106,"Hate having to work? Well, here's a solution: kill yourself",this may be a controversial post hear me out before you downvote it i just want to initiate a discussion not close the door on it  imagine the above headline on fox news or your local tabloid as they blare how america is threatened by people demanding an end to wage work only that statement isnt being blared across fox news its being promoted right here on this subreddit by many folks who sincerely advocate less work   i just want ask why people think it is appropriate on this subreddit for people to suggest they want to kill themselves as a solution to wage work why is such talk tolerated on this subbreddit when mods would not tolerate other abusive language do people really think killing yourself is rational solution to wage work  i understand that suicide is a social problem but is this the subreddit to address this either people are really suicidal and lack resources to cope in which case they need to seek professional help or they embrace terminating their life and should seek assistance where it is available either way it has nothing to do with this subreddit as it will not get rid of wage work  i dont know how it should be addressed i dont advocate any form of censorship at all under any circumstances  not even forms that are practiced on this subreddit but suggesting that killing yourself is the way to address wage work seems rather problematic to me i am also concerned about the effect it has on the morale of the subreddit  perhaps i am completely offbase on this if that turns out to be the case i can accept that,bs6jz6

109,How do you start a successful movement like /r/the_donald's initial formation?,this post will be all over the place just warning you this might turn out to be absolutely meaningless   ill be honest i was duped by donald trump in 2016 his rhetoric on the campaign trail made it look like he was going to be the candidate the 99 of us americans have been dreaming of for a long time but now i realize hes just another stooge for the elite in dc while some feel differently i personally dont feel like not having a  filter and criticizing the media from a partisan viewpoint is giving the middle finger to the establishment but the almost 1 million people on td seem to disagree   pursuing this subreddit ive noticed some common viewpoints that i believe would resonate with most americans for example no one i know likes getting up at 7am and wasting their life away at a bullshit job they just never seem to talk about it because its accepted as the way things are we need to end the stigma that not wanting to work makes you a societal leech we need to convince people that working is your only purpose in life again i feel like most americans would resonate with this rhetoric if the framing is correct nonpartisan im thinking that this is partially what made donald trump such an attractive candidate at the start and led to his subreddits popularity but this sub only has about 30k subscribers which is a drop in the bucket comparatively speaking how do we grow it,bu1ghv

115,Why do employers always try to make us work harder AND HARDER?,if we meet their expectationsgoals they will raise the stakes and require us to work twice as hard as before  then we do that and then they want us to work harder than even that    you give a company your 100 then they will want the next goal to be 200  why the fuck would i do that for a 15 raise  why cant i just keep working at the same pace why do we have these quarterly reports where they want me to keep working harder than i did last time,bto1co
116,I think I finally understand why companies prefer young employees,yes it could be because of the possibility of offering a lower salary or because old dogs cant learn new tricks but what i have realized only recently is that young people are naive they think they will make a difference they are genuinely interested in the company and are willing to work until late unprompted they think that their bosses are thinking about them and will recognize their effort  it took me 15 years to realize that youre just a tool just like a hammer or shovel if i lose one of my tools ill just get another one sure i have my favorite tools but as long as their self steem is fulfilled they will do their jobs just fine,bs10ql

136,Immigrants have an abstract value unrelated to their economic productivity or willingness to do shitty work.,i was at a pretty big state library and archive yesterday and saw that they had put together a big series of exhibits on immigration in virginia over time when i took the time to look at those exhibits literally every single sub section emphasized  to the exclusion of all else  the role played by immigrants in the economy it was entirely an exercise in justifying immigration in terms of the easily exploited labor power of people trying to build new lives for themselves   anyway i see this shit everywhere and its extremely common for modern democrats to frame immigration in these terms the things a person contributes to society are manifold and important to their friends family neighborhood and society irrespective of their productivity in the narrow frame of private interests imo demolishing the narrative that human movement is only legitimate when used to create wealth for others is one of the first things that needs to be deconstructed when attacking the edifice of modern labor   just a thought that occurred to me and i felt like this subreddit was the best place for it,bm9lig

175,Letter to my coworkers,to my coworkers and management  work is making my life miserable you dont have to make it even worse  i dont give a damn about productivity i dont care how many phones i test andor repair in an hour i dread the working day and i just want to go home or throw myself out of the window im about to snap at any second  i hate being at the office early even if theres nothing to do for an entire hour and then you put the blame on me if i slack off and i dont get on doing something useful fuck off will you this is not my house i dont care about this place i dont care about profits i dont care that the machine works i work tirelessly to do everything in half i work like a cat in that i will undoubtedly take longer breaks poop on company time and play as much as i can with clocking in and out for example only doing it after i begin to microwave food prepare my lunch and never going to the bathroom when im clocked out i only work at a good pace if i have my zionist boss watching me as a prison guard watches over hisher inmates and even then i mostly simulate doing anything or lie about my productivity rates  there are weeks where theres no work at all and others where we cant keep on flexibility you call it adaptation we have to learn to do other things so when theres nothing to do we can just sweep the floor organize our desks a thousand times and take on others jobs or we just have to become automata seeking only to produce more and more to the point of exhaustion  but why have you ever wondered about the why of it all ignorance truly is bliss thats the lesson im getting you are working hard putting the blame on others and complying to every order and even so guess what all of that is meaningless and only serves the purpose of making a disgusting man richer than he is the planet more polluted people becoming more stressed out thats your daily life fellow workers i dont get how you can live with that orwellian doublethink like when one of you tries to teach me ways to be more productive i just want him to fuck off and ask him are you seriously trying to make me work even harder for nothing but a shitty pay in this anxietyfilled environment for a man that supports an apartheid state but you wouldnt compute that you just go on with your lives like nothings going on gym this party that holidays netflix and bs i envy you i really do i also consume media and have hobbies but damned be me if i ever alienate myself like that they say people are anxious but what i constantly see is people that can miraculously detach themselves from any kind of structurallevel of questioning focus on the individual level and be filled with energy and motivation hell some of you are even friendly to the boss zen buddhists to the core  what strikes me the most about doublethink is that you management while being a worker like the rest of us still comply to every order and have no problem kicking your coworkers asses around and treating them badly to be in good terms with the boss bootlicker pragmatism you should encourage us to live slack off but instead you are totally fine being the front face of exploitation and anxiety i get it the boss is a piece of shit that can fire you at any moment you were just following orders and getting paid right how can you be happy with that  oh and this is the best part bosses and management are like bff referring to themselves as we and to the rest of us as them theres also a subtle condescending attitude where they jokingly call us ableist terms or things like dogs human trash bags of shit homophobic and racist comments passing by like jokes hatred toward muslim and black people i cant stand it even more knowing that the boss is a zionist you my coworkers go on with that congratulations however this is better than thinking you are friends with your boss at least i notice the distance  indifference ignorance lack of critical thinking ableism racism shitty attitudes heck i constantly get to receive advice and rebukes from a coworker in a condescending manner of course because people love those 5 minutes of power to vent off doing the same task as i am because im not doing it right hell no im not im trying to sabotage as much as i can while not putting my survival at risk cant you notice i skip testing stuff or i do it without paying attention i steal supplies accessories i slack off i browse reddit the news i try to recover the time and energy this asshole is stealing from me and i try to cheat society as much as i know how the same society that would let you rot in the streets you idiots i dont owe anyone of you anything but i still am not a piece of shit and i understand the stresses of work i never complain about your work and i treat you with patience and respect why cant you do the same your lack of solidarity amazes me you are quick to throw others under a bus whenever the opportunity arises most of you are quicker even trying to shift the blame to others if its not clear who fucked up in something egoists to the brink still i respect you im the stupid here i should just become an apathetic narcissist and focus on my own life that seems to be the key to happiness in this wrecked world    this is going to be my letter of resigning to my coworkers when im done with the bullshit,bq2xot

179,Interesting fact about the minimum wage since 1970,a few weeks back i created a bit of controversy by suggesting the minimum wage should be set at 45 not 725 as it is now or even 15 as some union activists are demanding a few folks thought this idea was outrageous so i have been doing some more research and guess what i discovered basically that is what took place in the stock market   my suggestion was that the minimum wage needed to go up by 35 times from 145 to make up for the depreciation of the dollar since 1970 guess whose price actually did go up  an astonishing by 34 times since 1970   the dow jones industrial average  ampx200b  change in the price of the dow jones industrial average since 1970 source macrotrendshttpsiredditvgsqrtmyzsy21png  thats right although people think it is absurd to suggest the minimum wage should rise to reflect the loss of purchasing power of the dollar almost no one seems to notice that the djia has risen almost exactly as much as it would have taken to offset the depreciation of the purchasing power of the dollar since 1970  wage slavery doesnt work for wage slaves thats why they call it slavery,bptx79

183,Corporate work is little different from farming commodity goods,ive come to regard the farming of goods that sell on commodities markets as absurd  it takes away your control over prices and forces you into the get big or get out mentality of agribussiness conmen  it leaves you relying on insurance and subsidies to weather bad price years not to mention the insecurity costs of herbicides pesticides and fertilizers that come with monocropping when you could instead be growing and selling a diverse range of produce and fruit to your regional buyers  so how is pursuing training and work experience in a specialty for improved corporate or even government for that matter employability any different  ive considering this as i look forward  to developing yet another tech or adding another degree to my cv in order to get work  the wages of employment are almost always just another form of commodity pricing  youre time and life are the commodity of course  the opportunity cost is what you could be doing instead to both enrich yourself and your community  unfortunately too few communities offer the structure and maturity to support this kind of life approach  access to workshops to land to raw materials or to experts and apprenticeships is a rare privilege when you look at the vast number of people in the world who inhabit disrupted and disfunctional communities  thats just the world weve inherited  i think about this and wonder if maybe i should just skip the crap and spend some years doing a trade like musical instrument repair which can reliably become an independent income  there are a number of trades that ive pursued but simply lack the money to turn into anything more than hobbies,bp8lkn

186,What I don't understand about the bootstraps argument,i was reading this httpswwwredditcomraskmencommentsbp3y9rmenwhochosetoadvancetheircareersatayoungaskmen thread earlier and one of the top comments was one of the most bootstrapy just world comments youll ever see and of course it was upvoted to the heavens and heaped with praise hell it even included a millenials are a just a bunch of lazy complainers for good measure  but theres something ive never understood about the ones who espouse the youre responsible for 100 of your life circumstances worldview  lets give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that everyone does have an equal opportunity and they just need to work harder lets also assume that everyone decides to follow their advice and work diligently towards making it to the top and for the sake of this hypothetical lets also assume that everyone has the same capacity for advancement and hard work  what happens then in this scenario theres simply no way for everyone to make it there isnt enough room at the top and someone still has to do the shit jobs at the bottom most people still arent going to get there and in this hypothetical it will pretty much come down to pure luck which basically just undermines the whole thing i understand theyre more about equality of opportunity than equality of outcome but if everyone is working equally hard then it would be ridiculous to claim that the ones who do make it to the top in this scenario deserved it over those who didnt,bpjekx

188,Let's become free,what grinds my gears about this subreddit is the attitudes of some of you guys instead of focusing on ways to become free and making real steps to do so you resort to blaming and complaining about how you hate your job how you hate debt slavery or about how poor you are  maybe its time to take a step out of the box society has made you put yourself in and see the very real opportunity in your difficulty  unwise financial decisions taking on unnecessary debt and generally becoming complacent with overconsumption has probably played a big role in getting you where you are today  true wealth is just as much about needing less as it is about having more  i know you have probably heard before that life is not fair and we can probably all agree that society and wage slavery is cancerous to the individual  but how do you break free well it starts with your own attitude and thinking  maybe you learned in school that working hard will make you successful well whether you work hard or not is irrelevant if what you are working on is irrelevant to your success work smart not hard  cut back on your spending sell shit you dont need stop eating junk and drinking beer stop trying to escape the reality of your situation with unnecessary consumption and learn to face it  pay your debts or file for bankruptcy dont pay unnecessary interest  learn how the system works and how to take advantage learn to become an investor and not a worker discipline yourself   find out how you want to approach your escape from the rat race maybe you can become an entrepreneur who makes money hisher own way maybe you can just go on unemployment or disability and make way with less or maybe you want to go completely off grid and hunt your own food whatever you choose i respect you   what i dont respect is people who are to weak and fearful to take real steps to freeing themselves and instead resort to blaming and complaining,bpoyo7
189,The company wants you to see your co-workers as a team while also forcing you to compete with them for hours,i dunno how this is for other wage slaves but my store uncontrovertably has more people on staff than it needs we have so many people that all the employees could not work full time without us being hugely overstaffed this means the employees who dont perform dont get hours and the ones who do do okay fine these guys are my enemy they want to take my livelihood and im going to beat them and be a better wageslave than them to take their hours i know exactly what theyre doing but like thats life in this hellworld of ours so whatever gotta do it to eat  but at the same time the company wants you to pal around with these guys be their friend show up with them to company picnics and events etc its really frustrating its emotional labor without any purpose like even more purposeless than the saccharine customerservice voice i genuinely dont understand,bpnf5t

Then I found this sub.,  im 31 the first major career type job i had was as a janitor for a state run facility i did 6 years of that the job included cleaning up bodily fluids cigarette butts and receptacles cleaning patient rooms stuff like that the profession i found was demeaning to me after some negative workplace relationships and leadership being subpar i left that job of 6 years i took 2 years off to focus on myself and hopefully learn some more skills when i was ready to go back into the workforce i told my mother my feelings about that kind of work but what i said basically went in one ear and out of the other several months down the line she asked me what my plans are i said i have no idea then she suggested janitorial work i started filling with rage at that     i cannot be more clear in my feelings for that type of job i hate it i hate it so much i hate cleaning up piss and shit for 12 dollars an hour i hate cleaning infectious rooms and areas with no hazard pay i hate getting up at 5am to commute in one of the worst counties to commute basically this type of job drains me mentally and physically and i am so serious when i say i would rather die than pick up another cigarette butt the whole thing about my profession is that it caters to people but guess what if people would clean up after themselves my job would be nonexistent    but i still do it im miserable but at least everyones toilets are clean     i thought i was the only one that felt like this everyone has the mentality that work is normal and expected of you to contribute to society i fail to see how my profession accomplishes this     saying all of this brings me to this point thank you rantiwork i thought i was the only one being overwhelmed by duty and expectations ive been lurking for a few days and i can honestly say you guys have helped me so much the fact that there are likeminded people who feel like work is draining and sometimes useless and allthetime unfair helps me to see other sides of the same story ive been in therapy because i thought something was wrong with me why cant i find a job i like why cant i get paid more for doing a somewhat important job why do people who sit behind desks all day make a lot more money than i do im the one breathing in chemicals all day im the one swinging a mop until my shoulders are busted i thought these questions were wrong and i was trying to figure out why i was the only one who was seeing this bullshit    sorry for rambling and also for formatting as im on mobile but all i can say is thank you to this sub you have helped me realize that i might not be so broken after all,bq6eh1
195,Thinking outside the box on wage labor and wages,i have been noticing that a very vocal minority of persons on rantiwork insists workers wages should never rise more than inflation one person even suggests it makes it more difficult to convince republicanleaning voters to support common sense reforms when i propose a minimum wage equal to the exchange value it had in 1970  gtyou  ever argue with a republican and youre making arguments for common  sense reforms like medicare for all and a minimum wage that tracks with  inflation and they counter with well where does it end   gt   gtthis stupid ass argument is why they say that shit people like you exist  if this is the sort of objections made to a modest increase in the minimum wage to 100000 per year how then do we answer the objection that we cant reduce hours of labor by half  to address climate change and inequality because such a reduction would cut workers wages and leave them in poverty   we seem fucked either way dont cut hours by half and climate change will cause a massive global catastrophe do cut hours and no one can live on 725 975 or even 15 an hour   something has to give  perhaps it should be the box we keep thinking inside of,bq791d

232,Taking a sabbatical,does anyone feel like they just need a break i mean obviously in a perfect world you would never have to work again but do you ever just let yourself fantasize about even a small break   im almost 30 and ive been working nonstop since i was 15 never more than a few days or a weekend between jobs i worked through high school to pay for my own transportation and then third shift for six years to pay my own way through college in the us by the way of course ive had a few weeks of vacation sprinkled here and there over the last 15 years but nothing serious my new job offers me one whole week of pto in the first year one week since the us has no guaranteed minimum amount of paid leave like most other industrialized countries this is what 15 years of work and a college degree will get me one fucking pittance of a week  i desperately need time away from everything i need two six hell maybe twelve months to heal the emotional scar tissue that has accumulated over the course of 15 years of mindless labor when i first started working  and for maybe five or ten years afterwards  my days of rejuvenated me the odd shift off here or there and weekends would allow me to rest recenter and go back at it again but over the last five years and three incredibly shitty jobs therein i can no longer center myself days off and weekends dont help a week of vacation every two years doesnt help therapy hasnt helped i do everything i used to do with my free time i sleep and engage in the things that interest me   nothing pulls me completely out of the well of despair i find myself in i can claw my way up a little with the 48 hours im given every week but i keep slipping further and further down oh well i guess i can dream,bphqvd
233,The System is Fucked,tldr after being thrust into a postemployment world the protagonist discovers that the system wasnt set up to help him but rather entrap him as he begins to rebel against it he discovers the only way to deal with a system thats designed to fuck himis to fuck it right back  earlier this year i was laid off from a 66k per year job i immediately filed for unemployment insurance for the first time in my life only to discover my states ui benefit maxes out at 500 per week for a maximum of six months   to add insult to injury i found out that my ui check would be reduced by 80 of any wages i earned in any given week   dont even get me started on how long it took to even begin receiving the benefit or the mandatory waiting week that added an additional seven days to an already drawnout process   anyway lets do some math   right now im earning the equivalent of 1250 an hour at 40 hours per week for doing nothing keeping in mind this is less than 40 of what i had been making when i was employed if i earned any more than 1565 an hour still less than half of what i had been making my ui benefit would be reduced to 0   so effectively at 1565 an hour i would really be earning 315 per hour after you deduct the 1250 an hour i get for doing nothing   this makes accepting a job for any less than 2530 an hour absolutely pointless hell i would have to make at least 1975 an hour just to be making more than minimum wage again when you subtract the 1250  so what has been my response first off i minimized my monthly expenses as much as i could this included no longer paying the 600 in credit card bills i was dealing with each month   i could make an entirely separate post about how i was throwing 7200 per year at about 30000 in credit card debt but because of high interest rates it was still going to take me about nine years to pay it all off at a total cost of over 65000literally almost an entire years salary not to mention despite 100 ontime payments on my credit report my credit score had been stuck at around 600 for several years so i couldnt even get a lowerinterest consolidation loanbelieve me i tried im honestly considering bankruptcy at this point id rather spend seven years with shit credit it was already shit anyway and not have to pay 600 per month than to continue working my ass off to throw over 10 of my pretax income at my debt for the next nine years  but i digress  eventually i was able to reduce my monthly expenses by about 40 but that still didnt bridge the gap between the income i had been making and the income im making now   so what did i do  i found alternative ie nonw2 sources of support for myself i wont go into further detail as i would hate to possibly admit to any possibly unethical or even worse possibly illegal behavior suffice it to say i figured out how to bridge the gap   whats crazy is that the system all but forced my hand in all of this i lost my good job through no fault of my own and expected there to be a support system unemployment insurance a system my employer had paid into on my behalf for years capable of getting me through what i expected to be a brief period of unemployment   but instead i found i could only draw about 40 of my previous salary in benefits and were i to take a job earning any more than about 49 of my previous salary i could draw a big fat zero   so i had to cut back on my expenses a process made easier by the machinations of yet another component of the system the debtindustrial complex whose excessive interest rates and brutal if opaque credit score formulations made it a nobrainer to simply default on my debts   then i had to figure out how to sneak money past the watchful eye of my states ui department all so i could maintain something vaguely close to the standard of living i had grown accustomed to or in capitalist propaganda terms earned prior to being laid off   and the funniest part of all the real irony in this whole situation is that the very mechanisms that were supposed to keep me in line ui fico scores have put me in a position to learn how to subvert the system   now i have three months of ui remaining and im doing everything in my power to ensure i never have to return to wage slavery or debt slavery again   oh and did i mention the free health insurance never again am i going to spend 25 on a doctors visit copay or 10 on a prescription or 20 on an overpriced specialist or hospital visit not when i can get all of that and more for free  and before anyone chides me for  taking advantage of the system ive been paying over 20 of my income in taxes for years and years damn right im going to take advantage of it   i fucking paid for it   thank you for coming to my ted talk,bpmnvj

242,Joe Rogan rant.,im a frequent listener of joe rogans podcast which i really like most of the time one thing he does that drives me nuts though is hell have another comedian on and theyll talk about how being a comedian is great and how they couldnt ever work a real job hell then go on to lecture about how anyone can do it they just have to try harder this comes across as condescending and niave to me for one no one wants to work a real job but some people didnt get lucky or dont want to take the shot to be the 1 in 1000 people that makes enough money as a comedian to have a comfortable life how many comedians do you think we can support if everyone decided to be a professional comedian who would make all of the food produce all of the goods repair our infrastructure and so on dont get me wrong i love joe rogans comedy but he doesnt account for how insanely lucky you have to be to end up like him hardwork is a factor of success but a much bigger factor is getting lucky,br6wyw

257,There's Hope,this is a rant ive had on my mind for a few weeks now as ive been lurking in this sub and i apologize if its semantics arent fully on point i havent spent a lot of time hashing this out im just kind of hoping you all can see what i mean this is not an attack on anything or anyone nor is there any anger or frustration behind it only the desire for us all to lead happier lives  i first want to say that i empathize with all of you i am antiwork in the sense that i dont believe in forced wage slavery and i think peoples avocations should be their vocations if they so choose i think the current quasicapitalist system is a biased sham however theres a lot of really really negative stuff in this feed its as if most of you are just waiting to retire or die being miserable for every second of your workday and spending every free moment dreading the next workday to reiterate i totally empathize and im not here to tell you that its all sunshine and rainbows in fact im here to tell you that a lot of aspects of your job or most jobs are kind of shit but you dont have to completely give in to that  i work a minimumwage job where i put in between ten and twentyfive hours a week as a pizza chef and occasionally an arcade game attendant and a second job where i drive for a notoriously shitty food delivery service both jobs have abysmal aspects to them that i dread however ive learned to find joy and purpose for both jobs getting people their food helping them out with games seeing peoples reactions when i fix something for them even just helping my coworkers with their tasks is rewarding is it rewarding because the company cares about me at all no im just a cog in their machine easily replaceable i dont believe in the current capitalist system and i dont believe in a minimum wage that isnt a living wage etc etc  howevrr my job is rewarding because i found a company that has a bottom line i can support delivering andor producing quality products for customers to me its a matter of personal vindication  i succeed at my job because ive decided i am providing for myself and providing a necessary srtvice and sometimes thats enough to excuse the pain it can be for you too if you choose the power of positive thinking and all that jazz you may not want to work at all and thats fine were all here wanting to make that happen but having a grudge against your job isnt gonna make your bad job disappear what can disappear is your negativity you have that power if you dont see a shaman or a therapist or a pastor or a friend or whatever   you only live once my friends stick to your ideals but do not let them cloud your skies too darkly we cant choose to opt out of the system but we can choose not to let the system affect or infect our bodies with negativity   thats all i hope you have a pleasant evening,bkfe4m

303,In a Weird Position and Could Use Some Input,every job ive ever had has made me suicidal my most recent job is so utterly repulsive to me that i actually made an attempt a couple of weeks ago think sales with lots of lying to people to manipulate their emotions i couldnt go through with it but told my fianc and ive been on drugs since and went to the er the whole deal not feeling much better   fianc makes about 130k i make 32k he has been telling me to quit my job and just let him support me when we first bought our house i actually did this while i worked on my freelance writing and self publishing career this was the most fulfilling work ive ever done in my life i genuinely enjoyed waking up every morning and getting to it in addition i also had time to keep my house spotless by taking care of all the indoor chores myself and make my fianc delicious meals three times a day from scratch   the problem was im not a natural business woman and my savings ran out i wasnt making enough to do it without becoming financially dependent on my fh this idea sickened me so much that i decided to get my current job i have pretty hefty student loans so the idea that my fianc should have to pay those for me made me sick my mother was very nagging about what i financial burden i was to her from the time i was born so this is something thats very deeply ingrained in my psyche   ive been applying to jobs every time one pops up that i think might be better than my current job but cant even get an interview whats worse is that my depression has gotten so bad that my creativity and drive to do anything outside work has completely vanished that was in fact what triggered my suicide attempt i sat in front of a screen for two hours straight trying to write this has never been a problem for me before i felt like the essence of what made me feel joy was lost and that was unbearable   i fantasize about being his house wife and working on my novels starting my podcast back up maybe even creating video essays like lindsay ellis contrapoints philosophy tube etc learning skills like graphic design and coding getting back into art etc   however heres the list of reasons why i am so hesitant  1 i would hate to be a burden on him   2 he might not always be able to make so much money if he loses his job were absolutely fucked he works for a very successful nonprofit doing it work which means he gets paid significantly higher than the average wage for people in his field   3 my resume would suffer from being unemployed   4 my friends and family would judge me like they did when i was freelancing i was always asked to babysit walk dogs run errands for them etc and when i refused due to my busy workload they shamed me and didnt believe that i was actually working   5 my drive and motivation are shot ill never shirk on my chores but the creative and self improvement things arent going to happen right away my fear is that it would take a long time or might never come back at all then i would literally just be depending on him  6 my fianc likes expensive things he drives a tesla even though we can afford to live on his income alone he would lose out on the opportunity to have more of those expensive things that he loves i know this seems petty but he just has a love of cool new technology so hes always investing in things like 3d printers drones etc i feel really bad denying him that   im so torn on the one hand i am miserable on the other my fianc is the best thing in my life and i dread making him miserable by becoming dependent on him and putting the stress of all our financial burden on him what can i do   i completely align with the antiwork philosophy but i hope that you will understand my conflict,bm70u0

313,This text I had,started a new job last night after being out of work for almost a year texted my friend about it his response  just started another job 510 hours after my other one im now working 14 hour days ok so hes not really like that so his intent wasnt to one up me or boast lolhowever unlike me he does worship money i dont wanna hear that shit about he needs it we have similar lifes he doesnt need it any more than i do he just needs money or else he doesnt feel adequate he hasnt said that to me but i can tell based on all of his possessions and his silence whenever i talk shit about this system we live in working 14 hour days probably makes him feel like hes grinding or hustling that makes me wanna blow my brains out ill never understand and by the way this isnt coming from a young 20 something im 31 as far as working hard been there done that money isnt everything he has a young baby time is so much more valuable than those extra 10 hours i cant look at baby pictures of my daughter without feeling sad for all the time i wasted and how blurry it feels,bjy84e

321,A story about an American and a Mexican. Thought r/antiwork would enjoy it!,an american investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked  inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna  the american complimented the mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them  ampx200b  the mexican replied only a little while the american then asked why didnt he stay out longer and catch more fish the mexican said he had enough to support his familys immediate needs the american then asked but what do you do with the rest of your time  ampx200b  the mexican fisherman said i sleep late fish a little play with my children take siestas with my wife maria stroll into the village each evening where i sip wine and play guitar with my amigos  i have a full and busy life the american scoffed i am a harvard mba and could help you you should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds buy a bigger boat with the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor eventually opening your own cannery you would control the product processing and distribution you would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to mexico city then la and eventually new york city where you will run your expanding enterprise  ampx200b  the mexican fisherman asked but how long will this all take  ampx200b  to which the american replied 15  20 years  ampx200b  but what then asked the mexican  ampx200b  the american laughed and said thats the best part  when the time is right you would announce an ipo and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich you would make millions  ampx200b  millions  then what  ampx200b  the american said then you would retire  move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late fish a little play with your kids take siestas with your wife stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos,bldfhw

327,Work=Serve=slavery. Some thoughts.,ive been thinking on and off about the nature of work these days specifically how you could probably change the notion of working into serving now serving to me seems that it wouldnt necessarily be a bad thing we should serve our community no one is an island i dont think anyone needs to work full time with our population levels but if you try to be a blacksmith and a doctor youll get a shitty blacksmith and a shitty doctor so specializing makes sense to me  ampx200b  some people will just never be good at serving some people that arent the best the most intelligent or able physicallymentally at serving might ironically have to take the little skill required jobs that lets them serve and assist like retail administration food service  ampx200b  the problem in our society as a culture today is that weve i think got this toxic culture of dog eat dog everyone has to work that leads to everyone being pissed off stressed and lashing out to selfaggrandize themselves and act entitled the moment they feel they can and their reputation wont suffer or it will and they dont care when it doesnt have to be this way the way we have the current system is the rich have much and poor have little and instead of serving we work we work under other people government systems faceless corporations to whom we sell out time and energy tldr esoterically i think were being fucked up so that the rich remain powerful and we are all beholden to our god the dollar  ampx200b  i believe if we had a system in which people if not lovingly then agreeably served their communities wed all be happier now heres the caveat and were weve gone wrong we dont say farm enough potatoes so that logically everyone wanting potatoes has them though on the odd week you might miss out because were running a little low for some reason though normally theres enough that some small amount do go to rot but thats the cycle of life now we have a system were by we have lots of potatoes but we also have so many vendors we have more then we need as a community we literally toss them in the bin rather then say give them away so those potatoes dont lose their monetary value because everyones selling potatos sell them to me cheaper we literally poison those potatoes to that people cant salvage them because people who get them for free wont pay for them this is just one scenario of how weve gone wrong  ampx200b  then lets go along and say weve farmed enough potatoes to feed the community we dont really want a horde of it going to waste so we dont farm to many we might branch out some if so inclined to other fruits and vegetable as per the communities need but if the community doesnt need them why do any more work we only serve really 5 hours a day but six days a week or so this would be a decent system  ampx200b  i feel i could write an essay but this is just one thought im sure all you guys on here probably have similar thinking oddly enough this is probably were some religions have things right religions are very very good schemes in teaching and enforcing societal values like valuing the things you have  ampx200b  tldr were prompted to be a wasteful consumerist society that worships the almighty dollar were forced to work churning out crap while being deceived into valuing and buying crap when we really need so very little and just better notions of what happy and meaningful lives are religions can be good for indoctrinating these sorts of value systems or really really not nobody really needs to work people should agreeably serve the community and get paid adequately for it if you have little or no way to serve you should see get paid a comfortable wage that lets you live in society,bkwse9
328,"Queried unpaid time, I'm sure I'm on someone's blacklist now.",queries some times i stayed back to handle customersthings got told unless im explicitly told to stay back i wont get paid fair i know this is a general thing  but we also get told not to leave customers half way and give good customer service i was told if i needed to leave wait and call staffmanagers someone has to cover me before i can leave  see if i did that i know ill wind up in the shit plus nobody answers at the end of the day and typically you might have one or two managers in  the argument was brought up that everyone else stays back 10 15 minutes i was querying lots of 30mins if they paid me theyd have to pay everyone else they should and that sounds like an admission of guilt to me do they think everyone else wouldnt like to get paid for staying back to go the extra mile and give that customer service but apparently everyone stays back and doesnt get paid but everyone bitches about it and that just customer service its not its free labour,bm033r

333,Work is a Prison Sentence,if you think about it work is essentially jail  most of us spend our day in a cube which honestly is going to be smaller than a jail cell and you are forced to do the same damn tasks over and over again this causing mind numbing boredom and exhaustion this forms the great majority of your week where driving to and from the cell takes up more of your time but of course that time is unpaid  i feel like i am in jail at work i dont have any freedoms i am forced to obey to do and answer to whatever tasks are placed on my  desk it is awful sure you can try to escape to a different prison a different company but at the end of the day 8 hours of prison is 8 hours of prison no matter where you go  yes you get to go home at the end of the day but with drained energy and a horrible fatigue from dealing with another day of bullshit the weekends are a chance to fuel up the battery so you can work yet another week they have to give you that time off to take care of the other tasks required of a job clean your clothes get some food fill the gas tank pay those bills  the system is designed without your interests in mind its designed to enslave you and drain you of all your energy the job will over the years drive you crazy it will rob you of your vital life energy and convert you to become a mindless numb miserable robot work is prison but they have it so twisted that those who want out of work are looked at as lazy losers our society congratulates people for finding a new job for getting promoted and shames those who are fired or quit the hamster wheel of corporate america   its a paid prison sentence dont let them convince you otherwise  the difference,blz6df
