4,Punching in and out now.,i work in a typical office environment and as of 2019 office employees are being required to punch in and out on a new time clock system i understand that many places already do this especially in factory or shift settings but i find it demeaning and unnecessary for office work i think its annoying and causes employees unnecessary stress for example it pressures people to do things like drive dangerously in traffic in order to be on time it erodes trust in the workplace and it is a far cry from the best measure of productivity it in fact in my opinion probably makes employees less productive because theyre now focused on fulfilling their time constraints feel less autonomous and therefore less happy it just boils down to treating employees like professionals my time shouldnt be watched like a hawk     im pretty upset by this  ,ahd3cz
5,Why do you work fulltime? Why not work as a barista for 2 days a week?,i did the calcs and i would earn 900 euro a month it would mean you have to live very minimal 1 room appartment no car etc but you would be absolutely free currently considering this as an alternative to retiring at 37 and thus working very hard now to earn enough money to reach that goal   why do you still work 5 days a week if you find a partner and live together it would even be 1800 euro a month thats more than enough for a minimal lifestyle or am i spoiled by my countries healthcare system ,agjfq2

8,My boss found my $40 of missing tip money and now wants it back.,hey guys i work at a pizzacoffee joint in a small gas station its hell on earth and the only reason i stay is because of the tips the other night while closing i lost 40 out of my apron i searched the entire store and figure it was gone for good this really really sucked considering im saving up for moving and and a big trip this summer and 40 to me is a lot of money i was so excited the next morning when i asked my coworker if they had saw it and she said yes and in turn asked my manager where it was she put it in a baggie inside of her desk i was the only one who worked the night before by the way and instead of asking me if i lost the 40 she just put it away   the bag had two twentys and like 025050 in change i didnt remember having the change but i figured if it was in the bag i mustve left it there too i took the whole thing this morning i wake up to multiple messages from my manager asking me where i put the change that was in the bag she said since i took the 050ish she wanted me to return the entire amount because she needed it for a deposit  i think shes pissed off because she wasnt planning on giving me my money in the first place what do i do should i return the money ,afvsdw

10,"Being a temp blows, and my current situation is why the work force pisses me off. (Long post)",hey there im typing this on mobile late evening apologies if there are typos or if i use weird phrases in this post its been that kind of day  so to start off i hope you are having a great daynight whether you are starting a shift in the middle of it or doing some overtime i wish the best possible outcome for you  i was fired from a retail job i held for two years happened a few months ago hated the place yet i met great people since then i applied for some positions recieved some call backs for some interviews but nothing stuck with no luck i found myself one day walking into a temp agency desperate for a job  this agency was pretty good pleasant people that assisted me well and they found me instant work at first in a foam factory great place actually i struggled a bit not gonna lie but i felt comfortable there  well unfortunately one day i receive a text from my agency not to return to said factory could be multiple reasons being a temp it can happen yet at the same time i just feel like they let me go because the night before i was doing really bad new product new way of handling it and it took me all night to figure out a strategy that worked for me i asked for help was told just keep at it then thought i figured out  what to do by the end  so time passes and im offered a position at another factory nice pay but long hours whatever ill take it im nervous though because ive heard about this place before and not in a good way it was established in my small city about 6 years ago and every time ive thought or heard about this place im repelled by it just not my cup of tea but who knows right might as well try  i hear nothing back about the interview for a week i call the agency again position was taken not sad about it so what else do they have well they suggest a few options that really dont sound appealing and the last suggestion is a training session at the same place guess ill take it  thanks for reading this far ill wrap up soon im at this factory currently and let me tell ya this place is so stupid disorganized with drama and supervisors picking favorites off the bat some machines are great and some are very not im usually in the cold warehouse section and i despise the cold could i move yeah but other machines are pure ass  now im a young guy that has the same mindset as this sub fuck work and how its set up fuck these hours and how long they are fuck these dicks who dont make it easy to be here fuck these breaks that dont even last twenty minutes just fuck it  so whats the point of this post i work at 6 in the morning its almost midnight and my hip area is bothering me to where i cant sleep ive taken some aid and tried stretching it out and its still bugging me its minor so nothing crazy i dont want to go in today reddit yesterday was already garbage my work already stated they need all available employees to go in and i said i would but im really tempted to not go  my family is counting on me to continue this job my girlfriend is counting on me i can afford to miss a day i just feel guilty as fuck i hate how the workforce is set up because when you feel ill in any way you are forced to go to get that paycheck its agony and just like you i would do anything to not be in this vicious cycle  alright end time my questions are 1 should i say fuck it and call in 2 should i ask the agency if there are other job opportunities 3 have you had an instance where something was bothering you enough to not work minor or major and how did you feel im going to attempt to sleep now so feel free to comment and ill do an edit later thanks for your time,af4zbw

15,A babysitter for adults,backstory 22 year old manager at a popular fast food restaurant in texas  tldr hard work is bullshit and im quitting my job  i dont truly have a problem with working i kinda like the idea of dedicating myself and working with a team i enjoy that lemming nonsense even if it is kind of stupid plus i like learning about my coworkers and employees most of them are great people but lack the ability to get any upward economic movement  thats kinda what i want to talk about the employees these guys and girls work twice as hard as me and get no where near the pay how is that fair my job is basically to make sure that dont screw up and to handle the angry consumers of our food so basically im a babysitter for these people and they definitely dont need me yet i get paid almost 15hr and they get paid 89 an hour  plus i have to fight my fellow managers to get my guys hours but they have the same problem all of their employees need more money and that means they need to work longer hours i mean these people have kids to feed and rent to pay how is it the companies place to get in their way because they want to save a percentage on labor costs  i mean i do work 5060 hours a week but most of that is spent on my phone plus i earned my position basically off the back of my social skills it had nothing to do with how hard i work   at the end of the day these people work hard are stuck in a cycle of completely depending on this job to survive and i just dont feel right about it how could i they deserve better then what they have  so im quitting my job going back to college and becoming a nurse at least then i can help someone even if its just a little bit,ai3jqu

29,Why does it have to be this way for me and for people like me?,unluckily im not dead  yet even though i much rather not be alive but its much more easier for me to cling onto reality and survive then it is for me to purchase a deadly weapon and inflict selfharm upon myself you can say if i really wanted to die i would do it and maybe youre right but i really dont want to live either i hope that makes sense  and look im not really looking for pity either i genuinely just want someone to maybe help explain or change my perspective not everything needs to be in concrete or in the actbecause the abstract is a good place for a thinker like me   maybe in the not so distant future some guy will read a post like this and realize theres somebody out there that understands what theyre going through  perhaps theres no rhyme and reason that im just a  series of unfortunate events etc  im  not good at anything really everything is a struggle even the most basic things everybody typically knows how to do thats why finding a job is humiliating because even if i get one i wont be good at it anyway  ampx200b  i dont have any desire to work  like most people but i cant tolerate it at all either im lazy i guess everything feels like too much effort for me everything feels like im going to fail so i just rather give up like hours in i start getting overwhelmed with dread or hopelessness that you know nothing matters i quit one of my jobs mostly because i was so lonely it felt suffocating just to be around others  every second on the clock too becomes suffocating and to top it off you know you arent even getting payed a living wage  is that really normal if it is then maybe i  need drugs to not have a breakdown  because in those hopeless moments i felt homelessness was better and i know homelessness isnt  a good thing but i just couldnt stand the humiliation  sticking with it or manning up in that situation would put a hamper on my health and i just dont know how i could keep my composure with that kind of pressure day in and day out  ampx200b  perhaps maybe if i was thrusted into homelessness i would think otherwise but its  more likely i would just sink into a more hopeless state than i already am and  to know this is really reality for the rest of your life brings me to the edge how my only realistic escape of it is suicide or death a lot of times i just get overwhelmed with boredom too and feel like theres nothing worth living for  ampx200b  and i get it work must be done nothing is free  life is better than its ever been blah blahblah but i find it awfully too difficult so maybe i shouldnt exist you know if i dont have any desire to really work hard or survive then whats the point why be alive you know i dont really understand why its so difficult to find a job either for certain jobs that are more prestige i understand but why are entry jobs so far and few between how am i not supposed to feel hopeless and just keep applying is that even a natural reaction anyways  to a constant or assumed rejection or is it just an artificial one   ampx200b  i hate happy people too and people in relationships largely because i envy them  i dont understand how people think life is worth living with a 95 maybe thats normal idk i feel like im just a defect you know that somethings wrong with me  compared to those people  doesnt seem like theres much of an uproar or maybe people just hide it or find ways of tolerating it but i cant im not like them i want to fight back against the system even if its completely utterly hopeless i just dont belong in this world i think the world is better off without me anyways i wish somebody or anything would kill me gracefully  save me the pain of existing ,ahhqqm

43,Boundaries,i wanted to share an incident that happened a few weeks ago i am a supervisor in a call center one day i was browsing on social media and tagged a fellow supervisor in a post by one of our former coworker who now works in a different call center  when sm found out he talked to me during work and it turned ugly i explained that it was just a joke he then went to explain how i was improving and now i was going downhill i honestly didnt understand his point since this was outside the workplace work performance should be measured while you are at work not by what you do on social media  i was really agitated because i exert a lot of effort in what i do i do things and take tasks even when no one asks me to in addition to being underpaid for my position calling me out on a stupid post with no derogatory comments towards my current company is pretty childish  i also think that he is overextending his authority to where it doesnt belong  sorry for the rant but i am upset by the way i was treated when there are other bigger issues to deal with,aimifk

45,Stigma in the wrong place,so recently ive noticed a tendency to blame individual workers for the struggles that they have finding or keeping a decent jobwhile at the same time hiring managers bosses and hr reps are by and large heartless unconcerned people who like documentation more than living breathing human beings     it really does seem like the stigma of failure or whatever is being put in the wrong place here from my own personal experience ive had employers give me more hours than i asked for employers who werent up front about what was required of me employers who havent paid me on time or at all employers who didnt hire me because i didnt have experience supposedly but then turned around and hired a 16 year old who cant handle the alcohol they sell employers who refuse to listen or take my needs into consideration when i tell them i cant make it on federal holidays because the bus isnt running employers who regularly send me emails inviting me to apply for a job but then arent available to take my call and never call me back     and somehow all of this is completely my fault okay then,aj1hxv

47,I've been working while sick for two weeks now and it's pissing me off,the fact that we live in a society where your livelihood is threatened when you take the time you need to rest when your sick is appalling to say the least its a fucked up cycle where you cant get better because you have to keep working even though youre sick   the best part is im then considered responsible by my coworkers for when they get sick even though that responsibility falls on our employers i cant imagine how many customers ive gotten sick unknowingly as well  im tired of this shit i want nothing more than for our workforce to band together and demand better treatment but all of my coworkers are bootlicking troglodytes its not just them a majority of americans are like this and it just makes me feel alienated from society ,afrvs2
48,"I finally quit my job, and I could t be more relieved.",first of all sorry for any formatting or grammar issues to come im on mobile and currently still at work for my last few hours   things have been building up for some time mostly with the store owner just being a real bitch and not treating any employees right shes been a stay at home mom forever and has no idea how to actually treat people like employees rather than kids usually this entails yelling at us for any mistake to be made or belittling us and making us feel worthless rather than using it as a learning opportunity originally her husband ran the store and put in 50 hours a week of unpaid labor to try to stay afloat unfortunately he had to fall back on a more corporate job making about 400k a year to build back from their debt so the plan was for his wife to come in since she technically is the other owner only things just got worse when she came on about 5 or 6 months ago   she began only coming in for a few hours a day to eventually being there less than a week what i would work in a day on top of that she would come in much later than she scheduled herself and leave early to pick up her kids from school so they wouldnt be home alone both of her kids were in high school and could very much take care of themselves most problems could very easily be traced back up to her and instead of owning up to it she turned it around and blamed it on us and belittled us and just treated us like kids   theres many many more good stories and just ridiculous things that she would do that made it seem more like a written out reality show rather than a failing business anyway everything accumulated up to the past week or so a customer had come in and made a large purchase that ended up being a fraudulent charge of course since i was in the store at the time it was my fault and thats what she would tell you that i was incompetent and untrustworthy in the store yet she continued to have me open and run the store on my own in reality i had practiced all security checks i was taught check to make sure the id matched the card and run the transaction which is what i did the kicker is that she was actually in the store watching the customer and noticed how suspicious he seemed but she still decided to leave early before any purchase was made she also berated me for how much she told me not to do transactions like that and to check more security things and be more suspicious which first of all is complete bs i was never taught anything more than checking id and second of all she wasnt in the store enough to even teach me anything like that like she even had any business experience in the first place   so today i decided to just hand in my 2 week notice since i was planning on going back to school soon anyway after handing it in and telling her why i guess she couldnt stand the idea that i would quit before she could fire me so she told me today would actually be my last day im not sure if that counts as quoting or being fired but either way im still happy to not have to come back tomorrow or ever again   the kicker is that she wants me to stay to finish my shift for then next few hours as you can tell im doing that by writing this and looking for some freelance work online   today i feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders and for the first time in a while i feel happy    theres many more stories i could tell of how ridiculous she was as an owner and a person usually racist tirades or trying to find ways to dig herself out of problems she created to try and not look like the cause of them in the first place but ill save those for later updates if you guys seem interested ,ajfxyg

51,Frustrated,apologies in advance for the length and the rant im just feel like ive reached my breaking point with capitalism having its foot firmly planted on my throat i dont even know where to start with how angry and depressed work has made me not just my current job but the idea of working 40 hours period just to be granted the privilege of barely scraping by and surviving while the rich get to live it up simply because they were lucky enough to be born into wealth or screwed enough people over to achieve it   i work for local government and have been for the last 6 years in various departments all of which suck the pay is already shit and then they take out 11 for a retirement we may not even see i have a chronic illness thats managable with meds but i have to work fulltime to receive healthcare coverage because i live in the ultra civilized and advanced country of america which i hate my health shouldnt be contingent on my fucking employment status the job itself is mindnumbingly dull i sit in a cubicle all day and do maybe 4 hours worth of work and the rest of the time i have to look busy because god forbid anyone work less than 40 hours a week even if theres no work to be done i have trouble sleeping mondaythursday but on weekends i sleep like a baby wonder why s and when its time for me to get up and face another 10 hour day including getting ready to go to this place i hate being and my commute i honestly find myself wishing id died in my sleep i despise waking up before the sun has even risen so that i can spend my day being miserable   i hate having to come here and pretend i dont loathe every second i hate spending more time doing someone elses inane busy work than i spend on myself i hate that i see my coworkers more than my family and friends i hate that when i get home i feel so physically and emotionally drained that i cant even work on my passion that i dont even have the energy to exercise and keep myself healthy all i want to do after a soulnumbing day in this cubicle is smoke a blunt eat unhealthy food because it feels like the only highlight of my day and pass out while watching some banal program on netflix or hulu i hate that americans have been so indoctrinated and brainwashed that they think this is an okay normal way to live i hate that my supervisor felt the need to put me on a disciplinary plan because i occassionally clock in at 801 instead of 800 on the fucking dot we literally had a meeting where we went over 20 occurrences i had and over half of them were me clocking in 14 minutes after 800 like i dont spend 9 fucking hours here doing the stupid bullshit you assign that i dont give a fuck about but its no problem if i clock in a minute or two early because who gives a fuck about my time as the employee right i hate having to pretend i give a fuck about trivial ass bullshit that im in no way invested in  i write shoot and edit filmsweb series i like doing narrative work i have no problem spending 812 hours on a set for nothing because i love doing it but lately anything filmrelated has felt like an extra chore i feel like i get no enjoyment out of it anymore i cant branch out and work for myself as a videographer because the things i would make money shooting weddings and events i hate so it would just be another form of prison i just want to shoot and edit my own stories i want to finish the novel im working on i want to focus on my health and have the energy to make nutritious meals and workout i want to better myself but i feel like im trapped in this neverending cycle of bitterness and depression ive tried therapy ive been on four different antidepressants im convinced that the problem isnt with me i dont think i have a chemical imbalance i think the system is just fucked and it drives me insane how when i talk about this to friends and family they just kind of have accepted that this is life even though theyre all just as tired and drained as i am where is the outrage   i cant stand how wages are stagnant but it costs more and more to live im living with my parents because i can barely cover my bills on what i make so that makes me feel great as a grown man a while ago my mom told me that when she and my dad initially got married they didnt plan on having any kids and then they changed their mind and ive found myself resenting them for that like why would you bring me into this world to be worked to death and unfulfilled i wish they wouldve just stuck to the original plan or at least just waited and only had my younger brother because im not built for this bullshit and im tired of everyone saying to look at the bright side or be more positive or your life is what you make it and all the rest of that lying motivation porn being more positive is nothing more than lying to yourself to get through a shitty existence and im incapable of doing that its like telling me to laugh at a movie that i dont find funny sure i can do it but it wont be genuine   im considering going to grad school but the thought of working fulltime on top of classes and having absolutely no time to myself feels so daunting plus i would go for counselingtherapy for more money and flexible hours but then i feel like id have to peddle all that be positive shit that never worked for me how can i counsel people using methods i dont believe actually work  tuesday night i played a favorite sad song of mine and cried for like half an hour i dont want to be alive anymore and im only 31 the only things that keep me from killing myself are my nephew and upcoming niece and the fact that i dont want to fail at that and then end up in an even worse position it just wears me down that im spending my youth toiling away instead of finding fulfillment this morning i woke up three hours before my alarm and couldnt get back to sleep because i knew this shit was looming five 8 hour days and its only 8 if youre lucky smh and two days to recuperate is dismal i feel like you have to choose between bettering yourself or decompressing and actually relaxing on your off time feels like there isnt enough time to do both so its either work all week and then grind more for your own personal goals when youre off and never really get any relaxation or relax and make no personal progress  even just working 6 hour days or only 34 days a week would be better than this i just need more of a fucking balance i dont see how worklife balance exists when we spend so much fucking time at work or doing workrelated things why must we all start at exactly 800 am why do we all have to be herded into this box where we have to get up at 530 in the morning and fight traffic to get to work by 800 i hate that those are the universal hours because we arent all the same its just really been grinding me down lately and i needed to vent somewhere i would be understood  if you read all of this thank you i realize im in a better position than some but it still sucks that work basically swallows all of us whole deep breath im done,ah11n7

59,A Question.,its me again hi everyone as i have talked about on here i have a job that i really cant stand basically a ton of our policies changed this year from a weaker benefits plan to less pto and now mandatory clocking inout and i cant stand my boss simply put just an all around bad supervisor is vindictive untrustworthy treats me like a secretary and everyone who works here is a boomer i make around 41k a year   i have an offer of employment elsewhere that is closer to home is offering me one work from home day a week and three days in the office so id have more time to do things i truly enjoy the salary is lower though at 37k   would you stay where youre at or take the less demanding job ,aj0si7
60,Mandatory Overtime,so im logging in out of my station i work in a call center and my supervisor starts talking about why im not doing an extra hour for the mandatory overtime i tell her i knew nothing about that and then she brings up this vague ass email that i did get and read that goes something like this  we are asking that all agents be present on january 21 2019 to facilitate an exercise that we are doing to aid in managing the call volumewe will be meeting with you to discuss same  no where in this fucking email does it state that we are required to do any overtime nor did anyone meet with me to tell me about it   i actually even got promoted to a supervisor from an agent about 23 weeks ago and im still working and getting paid like im an agent no one tells me or the rest of the agents shit   on saturday we had some training mandatory and i had work anyway so i was there but it was something i already knew so i skipped it to stay on the phone my manager then comes to me like thank you for being here and starts rubbing my back hes saying this shit like i could have stayed home   im just so fucking pissed now im not going back on the phone even though im stuck at work because my dad took my car to run some errands fuck them i hope all the calls drop ,aifzoi

62,Need some help sueing the company that just fired me (Canada specific),in short i posted some stuff complaining about the job on fb and insta head manager spoke to me i removed the one person i had from work on both profiles and locked them down  head manager comes in with hr tells me they have ways of monitoring my fb without anyone on my friends list im assuming someone with fb provided the info or they somehow hacked my fb anyone with computer knowledge know they then threatened me that i should watch what i post after getting fired and that i better not disparage the company  i never listed my place of work on fb i never named the company in my posts i believe i have the right to post what i want provided the company isnt named under freedom of speech right  do i have the right to sue im pretty sure this is a violation of my freedom of speech id get it if i posted what company it was but i didnt do they have the right to monitor my fb like that and what about threatening me with further posts implying theyre continuing to monitor me after firing me  if yall think i have a chance with this anyone know any good lawyers in calgary ,aiqtcx
63,"Mental health issues, partly from work.",i have a issue a big one i always had this antiwork attitude for some reason and it is literally killing me by now i got mental health issues from it or my antiwork stance comes from them i am not quite sure how this correlation works for me but lately i think a lot about killing myself and i started to selfharm after more than 5 or 6 years without doing it a lot of this anger i compensate it comes from my mum  my mum thinks i dont want to work but actually id be happy if i had a brain like everyone else being able to work and somehow be happy would be much simpler but i cant i was neet for almost 2 years and started working during this time i hardly ever was depressed or felt bad everyhing backfired when i started to work i dont do much outside of the weekend anymore and i hate it i used to have a lot of interests and activities before now i dont well i still have but dont have the time to do them i literally do nothing mondaythursday sometimes i go to a bar and drink until i cant stand anymore and forget that the weekend will end in 2 days and spend the next days rehearsing with my bands just to fall back to suicidal tendencies on mondays it has been getting much worse in the last weeks too before it was somewhat bearable but it takes on a whole new level now for example when i cut or burned myself in school i usually felt bad afterwards now i dont give a shit for a while think about doing it again and cry like a little baby for 2 minutes because i feel like a total failure and alone  what definitely does not help is the lack of support from my parents some quotes of my mum only people like you who dont wanna work are worthless sometimes i think it would be better if we did not have you you should be over that phase already we should have beaten you much more as a kid and my dad just does not gives a shit and shakes his head when he sees me i need help,agj7i2
64,Absolute hell hole: The realities of working a bullshit job,i feel as though im about to have a fullblown mental breakdown so i figure that writing everything down might be cathartic in a way im generally a very happy person bubbly lively and outgoing i studied marketing in university a decision i now regret because i believed that it would lead me into a creative career where i could use my brain and writing skills  flash forward to today im working in marketing in a foreign country which seems exotic and cool at first blush however this country is known for its very conservative boring work culture i was lucky enough to land this job when i first arrived here because they were seeking someone with an american background and highlevel english skills when i arrived for the interview i was shocked by how bland drab and beige the office setting was no decorations on the wall no meeting rooms just an openconcept office with floor to ceiling beigegrey however during the interview i was told how progressive and innovative the company was this company is a supposed leader in the technology and computer industry i figured that perhaps the company culture itself was a bit livelier than the beige surroundings  a year later i struggle to muster up the strength and motivation to wake up each morning and get ready for work i sometimes weep at the breakfast table absolutely dreading the 8 hours and 45 minutes of intense boredom which await me i literally count down the minutes until i can clock out in the evenings having to sit in silence for so many hours each day is torture i feel like a factory farm pig locked in a gestation crate the paradox is that my body and mind are completely exhausted after a long day of doing nothing i cant even summon the energy to work on side projects or anything creative once i get home   my colleagues are all very much into their jobs completely engrossed in their mundane daytoday tasks enthusiastically editing spreadsheets and typing away on clunky keyboards most people have spent their entire careers working for this company so theyve been brainwashed to believe that everything that happens here is normal every decision must be approved by uppermanagement even for insignificant things ie needing a new notebook from the supply cabinet maybe its the culture differences which cause the most strife but i have never worked in such a boring soulless environment   on top of this i am a migraine sufferer and since i spend hours staring into a screen my migraines have become increasingly worse and more frequent i also fear that the artificial fluorescent lighting does not help the matter either i have requested to work remotely a few days out of the week but the request was denied because i dont work in sales   perhaps the most miseryinducing aspect of the job is that overall attitude of most people who work here most are stuck up and only criticize and complain working in group projects is dreadful as you will be outright scolded and embarrassed for any slight error while praise and encouragement fall by the wayside you could do 99100 things correct but the one thing that is wrong is instantly noticed with the top managers copied in on the subsequent email  i absolutely despise my counterpart on my team she is so negative and pessimistic and makes every day an absolute hellish experience i have spoken with my boss about her attitude and he completely agreed stating that im not the only one who has told him about it unfortunately she will not be moved out of my department as she is a kissass and accrues exorbitant hours of overtime because she makes herself look busy   overall i cannot believe the constant hell i experience on a daytoday basis im sure most of you can relate to this  sorry for the long rant but honestly i feel a bit better by letting this out     ,agxwtu

66,Are families the main reason for people/workers/slaves to not think critically about their situation?,it seems to me that people do not refrain from their work neither physically of mentally due to the fact they need to provide for their families they simply cannot get out of the treadmill because they have to sustain their relatives   its possible to sum it up with the fact that they have no time to think properly no time to imagine a a different world than this one that they we live being watching the clock all the time having to adjust your daily life to fullfill the necessity of the place where you work company or employer makes a working person unable to have new experiences go to other places meet different people having deep conversations use the imagination learn new things between other things which would make one to reason about this situation sum it up with the fact that everyone around is doing it   sum it up with the fact that most of the people who work with you or people in general around you do not have anything against this entire situation due to the same factors as you  sum it up with the media and the common sense saying that the state in which your life is is your fault and that you must work more and study more to make your life and  your relativesfamily life better  sum it up with your desires of consumptionstatus which are being fed in you since you are a kid  being a antinatalist i clearly believe that all the pieces fit together like we are told to follow that same path grow up study have work have a family retire if it is possible die and let your children do the same as you either by your example or because the society in general forces it in their mind   after having children because you have done it so without thinking about the world which you are putting this child i am assuming it since it seems like most of the cases are like this sorry if i am offending someone with it you are gonna be a slave of it because you must work to provide and protect it   now there is no way out if luckilythere was any kind of criticism of our way of life and the system who rule us it should be shut down because one who has a family to provide should not have time to entertain such kind of thoughts such is this system which is gonna make a living for them and for you  ampx200b  ampx200b  ampx200b,ag9poc

78,Honestly guys what options are there to earn money outside the 9-5?,hi guys to be honest with you my life has been an utter mess the last few years or so  long story very short im in my early 20s  had a very senior well paid job that i was lucky to get given my age and after some years quit because despite the money and status beyond that fuck the imprisoning 95 im still young i dont wanna die here lets try get out of it   fast forward a few years basically tried to make passive income no success   always suffered with anxiety and depression and because of my now stronger than ever anguish start making music again which i did for years as a teen   really believed that i could make a life doing that no im not saying i ever thought i could attain commercial success but at least feel fulfilledpurposefultrue to who i am but to be honest music is hard and i wonder if i really am cut out of it or if this is just a woe is me type plea i look at other natural born musicians and dont feel my reasons are as natural or pure as theres to be honest with myself and after a year of music and writing and thinking about my craft literally 24 fucking hours a day im just concluding this today so its hard t swallow but it feels freeing as i was struggling with the music and pushing myself to do it to make it when it just felt off   so my question is what the fuck else can i do  oh and also i have a girl i love and that loves me too but because im so fucking unstable i cant promise here i would stay by her indefinitely and give her such commitment   so im basically aimless broke alone 25 years old where my friends are getting married and buying their first properties and my dad kicked me out the house because hes just not happy with my decisions appearance and tattoos ive started getting   im sorry to give my life story i just couldnt think of better people to share it with perhaps for some advice   i am glad i never took the safe road sure but i just have nothing or no aim to show thats hard ,agy6vn
79,"""She will be mised... She wouldn't want us to get behind in our work""",this happened many years ago but it still upsets me  it was my first real job after college for a well known company well call it cube farm inc  we often had to work mandatory overtime because their salespeople overpromised what could reasonably be done  furthermore our sister offices were unionized and their employees could not be forced to work ot  therefore if the other offices got behind in their work they would make us work their accouts because we had no protections in our southern state  yes we got time and a half but it gets tiresome doing 516 hours of mandatory ot every week because of managements poor planning  i didnt have children at the time and lived 5 minutes away and it was brutal for me i felt bad people with small children andor long commutes   one of the long time supervisors was brutally murdered on a sunday morning well call her jane jane was also pregnant and her boyfriend allegedly killed her but no one was ever charged in her death as far as i know  jane worked there for at least 10 years and had a large presence  people were understandably upset after the funeral arrangements were made public the director of the department gathered everyone together and said the following   jane was a valuable member of our team and she will be missed  unfortunately her family chose to schedule her funeral in the middle of the week  many supervisors  and i will be going to the funeral so the companys presence will be felt  so its not necessary for you all to go  jane would not have wanted us to get behind in our workbut if you must go please know that you will not be granted pto that you must make up your time from the funeral and if you do not complete your ot you will face consequences  she tried to seem sympathetic but she failed miserably  i couldnt believe how cold she was  i didnt go to the funeral because i didnt know jane that well  most of my department did go anyway so they had to make up about four hours of regular work in addition whatever ot we had that week   of course janes desk was quickly cleaned off and her job was posted the next week  ,ajc348

81,Politics and antiwork,the connection between wage labor and the state is so obvious one  would have to be blind to miss it and the sense among the working  class that wage labor is vital to their actual physical survival  translates into unquestioned support for the state there is in my  opinion no chance to abolish wage labor without directly confronting  the wage workers on these issues that is a tough mission no sane  communist wants to contemplate you cant persuade workers to abandon  the state by reasoned arguments you have to confront their attachment to wage slavery and the state headon like you would confront their racism  nativism and nisogyny ,afyq2h

83,Not working as someone about to finish school is impossible. Any ideas about any routes I can take to be happy?,hi rantiwork im a 17 year old sixth form student in the uk who is set to finish in june there was a point where i was convinced that i was going to go to university i got aab last year its not like im not capable but nothing stuck  i cant imagine dedicating myself and 30k of my future savings to a career that i dont even know ill enjoy and thatll dominate my life so the plan is to just get any old job once i finish and earn while i plan my next move thing is im not sure what my next move is going to be i need advice  seasonal work has piqued my interest as i cant stomach the idea of fulltime work with heavily regulated holidays ive been looking into things such as outdoor instruction eg ski instructor as it appeals to my interests and isnt an office job a more professional version of that that ive heard of is getting a contractbased job such as nursing and taking off with the money youve saved for a few months  my skills are all pretty much all creativity oriented language is my main strength and im very artistic but picking a job based on what you love isnt necessarily the route to go down even though it can make things easier i just want to end up in a place where i earn enough to achieve my goals such as travelling but in a way that doesnt drive me crazy and that doesnt suck away all my time  im sure ill think of something but id really appreciate any tips whats a good way of avoiding the corporate grind yet still living a good life what ways of earning can i pursue that fall in line with my antiwork mentality ill take any suggestions  deviating from the norm means doing the unorthodox i have ideas sure but its hard for me to make a decision im naive and an overthinker by nature and trying to avoid the status quo doesnt exactly have a handbook at least i have reddit  thanks in advance,ag88aj

99,"I’m 21 and have never been employed, I’m currently trying to get a job but I have mixed feelings and worries.",so ill give some background information thats relevant to the world of work i live in central scotland   ive always been kind of slow ever since i was young it took me longer to learn and catch up with things like english and maths when i was young i still hate maths im not sure if its anything to do with me being born premature or just that i fell asleep a lot in class when i was a young child i eventually got support throughout my early years but when i hit high school i was left on my own i mostly did ok but maths was still a struggle english was better i was decently academic however and passed all my subjects some of them with tops marks mainly cookery and art it hit hard when exams and grades started flying my way halfway through high school people were talking about gradeslevelsexams and i had no clue i still managed to pass my subjects but it took me longer to catch on   i never really knew what i wanted to do when i left school so i just went with the flow i continued art and design because it was my best subject in school that was the wrong choice i ended up dropping out halfway through because i didnt know where i was going career wise everyone else had future plans for further education and careers and i had no clue i dropped out in december 2015 and did nothing up until applying for a bakery course i thought id try bakery since i was good at cookery i made the same mistake at the start of 2017 i applied for universal credit and got accepted i was very scared and lacked knowledge when it came to trying to find and get work i was so used to living with my parents and depending on them that i didnt want to work i was scared and i didnt feel grown up enough yet fast forward to august i tried a business course because i felt like it was a sensible choice i could get some good knowledge out of that and get a decent career right wrong i left after two weeks of being there it was not for me at all   from then until now ive been on several programs to help with my anxiety and unreadiness for work my anxiety has dropped moderately but it still exists i am much more open to working now but i still have my fears what job really suits me will i actually be able to do it can i handle it will i be paid enough what if i keep failing just like i did with my college courses what if i never find work and i end up becoming homeless or too dependant on my parents i currently have a partner who works full time and is paid well id love to be able to move out but i still have my fears about work im 21 and ive never been employed i know people look down on me for it but i genuinely want to work now im just worried that i wont be able to do it   ,akrb6e

116,What makes you hate work? What were you doing before you came to this sub? How many of you have experienced unemployment?,ill be frank im probably older than a lot of you  i graduated ten years ago spent many years in grad school and getting paid minimum wage and burnt out before i could finish my degree i was in early childhood held in contempt even more than other teaching   i was steered into it when i was batshit crazy by a parent who panicked and alsowas and remains psychologically abusive   i am ashamed of my entire life the last time i felt like any self i had got a voice during my day to day life or felt equal with other people  and close  was high school   my college degree is useless the real sick joke is that in the years since i can see that even the side employable skills like excel were offered to business school students at my alma materthey sure as fuck werent in my major even though i was in the social sciences and took a stats class all since forgotten and my weak point   impretty dumb and i accept it i think of myself as somewhat thoughtful emotionally its not a virtue valued socially its not interesting and its not employable  coding is employable being really strong quantitatively is employable everywhere being able to grasp a mathematical concept knowing how to invest being able to turn bs intothats employable   i never had that acumen but im not particularly good at anything else   society and all of happiness is based off of living up to others designations of your worth it goes beyond capitalism but i am completely illsuited to capitalism especially now i am not physically hearty for a skilled trade i think jobs that require people to be off their feet for more than two hours are literally torture nurses might have to endure that but there is no reason someone working in retail shouldnt get a stool  even if its inevitable a lot of jobs will suck because the demand for certain skills change  it is too embarrassing to admit that about yourself    i hate that nothing i can do is valued enough even for me to be trained or kept around something i wonder if any of you experience im not just anti work because work sucks  im anti work because i dont belong anywhere in a capitalistic society   it wasnt for lack of effort but the effort came too late and its flawed   i hate the stench unemployment carries it is beyond humiliating being a contractor and having nothing but that on a resume  insulted by the same sorts of recruiters you enrich  when you are out of school in 2018 my temp experience is comparable to a criminal record if they were internships and i were 22 it might be different i have had recruiter after recruiter tell me im a piece of garbage after milking my resume for leads or wasting my time with interviews and then never calling back   even when i think hey this was real work for someoneeach time i look for work again and ill have to  i dont have a resume if your experience isnt valued your resume is a list of sins and failures a confession    i hatethe ageism i feel burning on me i have no time left my health is shit   it feels like a roadblock to getting a salesforce cert or studying to get into a bootcamp or an mba ha i am anxious and just cant do it i cant even begin  if i have get in what i worry about is failure   the only jobs i can get are worthless benefitless come with no security whatsoever even less than so many perm jobs and pay shit this year for the first time the simple effect of sitting in a frigid office and a shit chair left me with back shoulder and hand pain i spent all week with its frightening  i know what a privilege it is to sit   i hate the 95 830630 86 with a mandatory unpaid lunch  in america unless youre a programmer if you cant do that schedule and you havent earned the right to come in later youre a fucking lowlife and honestly even 10 can be rough depending on your commute   my boss tolerated me coming in at 1015 i stayed late she hated it and i get why it meant she didnt invest in me and even though she told me otherwise it made me easy to fire with the other four people let go from a team of ten she gave me nine months im still grateful but i know im back at square one im horrified at my own physical weakness   waking up being cognizant pushing through the mix of fatigue loneliness anxiety and unfocusedness that guiding this post to put on makeup drink coffee shit pee fifty times and sweatily jog to the subway and deal with any fun surprises with that  it is the worst part of working to me the fucking worst    i hate that my biological clock puts me to sleep at 1am wakes me up at 11am and makes the 96 schedule an actual physical torture if i say that out loud anywhere maybe eve here  youre told youre a weak lazy piece of shit with no character   i dont think i am but in a system where other people are told the workday starts at 9am and they can do thatof course i feel like one im made one    i hate the fucking indignity of the open office the paranoia everyone can watch you be slighted and you can watch how people that are valued are treated totally unable to relax to glower i felt myself being watched every time i got up to drink coffee and pee   i hate how much of work is social performance i realize constant grinding fatigue makes small talk and just retaining information so much harder   choosing to come in for the later shifts when given the option and even then inevitably being late  five minutes ten minutes fifteen minutes makes me seem like a criminal and makes me feel like one i get it  its important to be on time   the longer i stay in a job going to sleep in pain and waking up in more pain the harder it was that actually is humiliating  needless to say 90 of the misery is based off the sheer physical expectation attached to work in capitalism    and finally  i hate the loneliness of work   ,aem94t
117,"My Job Requires Unpaid Weekly ""Meetings""",for context i live in canada   anyway i started this job about 3 months ago full time 17h benefits not bad except now my supervisor is making mandatory unpaid meetings every thursday morning so now i have to be up an extra 30 minutes early for a shift that was already early to begin with so i can basically volunteer my time to listen to things that could easily be said in an email   recently i joked to my coworkers that i was going to put that on my resume under volunteered work and they all started saying how my generation im the youngest there had a bad work ethic and that i was just lazy does it make me lazy for not wanting to give up my recreational time to go to bed early so i can work for free i have a family friends things to do outside of work even if its one day a week why should i give all that up when im already at my workplace 40 hours a week in my opinion its only work if you get paid for it  i dont love or even like my job by any means its just what i could get for the time being and i dont plan on working there forever so im not going to say anything to my boss the business is fairly small so its not like upper management doesnt know and isnt okay about it i just wanted to see what other people thought about this   tldr my coworkers act pretty rude to me because i told them i wasnt happy about working for free,aeey1q
118,A Rant From a 22 Year Old,hey everyone im new to this sub but these are ideas ive agreed with for as long as i can remember i have actually thought about work and progress a lot since then and these are a few things ive come to the conclusion of so far im really open minded and open to discussion on any of them  ampx200b  summary true progression is not being achieved currently due to crab in a bucket mentality and lack of knowledge as to other options movements like what this subreddit promotes will help heal the people and make the world a much better place  ampx200b   we are not truly progressing as a society even with all of our hours we are putting in     contrary to what ive heard before having more children is not progression as a species living longer lives is not necessarily progression either what does it matter if you live for 70 years especially after 50 of those years spending 57 days for someone else by the time you have any amount of money saved up and can stop working your body is already one leg in the grave not to mention your mind      we essentially live until we get to the point that we lose our minds and then are subject to relentless marketing infomercials gambling alcohol more and more people are being born into this system and see absolutely none of the good stuff when its good but still have to experience all of the bad when its bad   ampx200b   people are usually bitter to you if you do not work and they do     i just came back home after being on the road for a couple of months ive been having car trouble and because of the holidays i havent been able to get my car in the shop for a while so im staying at my parents place on the floor my mother and father have an oddly strong work ethic considering how they are when they are off of work but for a bit of background ever since ive turned 16 theyve been hounding me to get a job so i could buy stuff even though i had just about everything i could ever need  they make a crazy amount of money yet growing up i remember they would always say how they couldnt buy stuff because we were living paycheck to paycheck my dad wakes up at 4 and then gets ready and after his commute he gets to work at 7 he usually comes home around 6 and then proceeds to get drunk         in this little anecdote which ive also had confirmed to me by asking my friends about their parents im trying to say how its obvious they are both unhappy and in need of some form of escape yet they think work is the only way forward if work really was good where would the yelling come from where would the alcoholism divorce rate and drug use rate including prescription come from   ampx200b   people expect work to be unpleasant     of course at some points work can be hard and uncomfortable this is the process of growth and it would be just as wrong to do something that didnt make you a little bit uncomfortable and at the end of the day work is still work but for some reason it really doesnt sit right with me to have a real person working a completely unproductive job its essentially a mental prison where you get to distract your mind from your shitty life in exchange to be able to go home after confinement to relax and stuff yourself to get some energy for the next day think of all of the time for art and social interaction and searching for meaning we could have if we just worked less its a lot harder to be impatient when you actually have an abundance of time and patience is something everybody could work on  ampx200b   for men especially and  increasingly for women a lot of people will think less of you if you work an unprestigious job      im really happy right now i have a beautiful girlfriend ive been on a roadtrip for a while and just working minimally for food and ive been getting a lot of time for all the things i love reading writing making friends yet on at least two occasions people have criticized my life decisions because they arent societally ideal no college no job no desire for success and dont get me wrong i respect the opinion of each of these people and have been looking to see how i can improve but i can tell these arent the happiest people its a common thing ive noticed people give you weird looks if you are ever walking around and smiling or laughing people go like why the fuck is that guy so happy its a polarizing thing but unhappy people tend to create more unhappy people in my experience because of that i have always tried my hardest to be as positive and kind as possible to everyone i meet and to not let any negative person drag me down people are deeply sad right now even if not obvious movements like these are going to be what hopefully starts the healing of our countries spirit  a final little note  ampx200b  this is probably not the coherent i didnt write this with any structure in mind so excuse the rambling bits but i hope the message rings clear work is increasingly becoming less and less of the answer as our work moves away from directly satisfying survival needs we find no great long term joy in being a grocery clerk bagger what we find joy in is making a deep connection teaching someone or being taught finding love having a family these are the things that really matter and we need to bring them back,ac0kdf

121,Being lied to by older generations,so i had a bit of a fight with my mother yesterday both of my parents are late baby boomersearly gen x and i wrote out why ive been angry for months to them essentially stating that ive been lied to having a college degree is necessary to get a good job and setting yourself apart that working hard and playing by the rules will reap rewards that staying loyal to a company will benefit me  ampx200b  but its all a lie or a scam at least sure you need an education to be proficient in certain fields but with the amount of debt you accrue will put you back years before you can save up invest or work on building yourself as degrees become more common it is harder to market yourself as different so it comes to networkingwhich i feel benefits people who are already rich or with social capital im not fond of networking either it is forced and fake from my experience and that doesnt even guarantee you anything staying loyal to a company doesnt mean much nowadays pay raises arent as high as they used to be wages are stagnant compared to the standard of living and you sometimes will be stuck with retailfast food jobs for college graduates thats not even considering jobs may force you to start part time and earn your way to full time or that even entrylevel jobs require years of experience in the field to even be considered  ampx200b  and their response to be hopeful and keep my head up that my life will turn around that my generation struggles with being patient and feeling we are owed something but things are worse and continue to get worse people my age are starting to get on their feet and be independent in their 30s while previous generations could start in their early 20s with less debt and a higher wage considering inflation i just feel stuck in my current situation because it will take several years before i can comfortably say i can live on my ownwhich i crave because i like being independent ,ad6ue3

126,Short text from Alan Watts,so this goes very deep into us it goes deep deep deep into a problem we have about guilt i wonder often if theres any relationship between guilt and gold  that the love of money is the root of evil its a very true saying because you see i was saying yesterday that the difference between having a job and having a vocation is that a job is some unpleasant work you do in order to make money with the sole purpose of making money and there are plenty of jobs because there is still a certain amount of dirty work that nobody wants to do and that therefore they will pay someone to do it there is essentially less and less of that that kind of work because of mechanization but if you do a job if you do a job with the sole purpose of making money you are absurd because if money becomes the goal and it does when you work that way you begin increasingly to confuse it with happiness  or with pleasure  yes one can take a whole handful of crisp dollar bills and practically water your mouth over them but this is a kind of person who is confused like a pavlov dog who salivates on the wrong bell it goes back you see to the ancient guilt that if you dont work you have no right to eat that if there are others in the world who dont have enough to eat you shouldnt enjoy your dinner even though you have no possible means of conveying the food to them and while it is true that we are all one human family and that every individual involves every other individual while it is true therefore we should do something about changing the situation alan watts,acilz6
127,I have a feeling this essay will be meaningful here in a way it won't anywhere else - on generational burnout and late capitalism: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work?utm_source=dynamic&amp;utm_campaign=bffbbuzzfeedreader&amp;ref=bffbbuzzfeedreader,anne helen peterson writes for buzzfeed and honestly the way she talked about millennials smacked hard of the snowflakes line people hear so often but she brings it home   the truth is  im an older millennial   im supposed to be senior in a career i never started one i graduated into the recession and a series of fearbased decisions means i am a perpetual tempif im lucky my psychological and physical health get worse i live in perpetual fear of being without health coverage i am poor enough to have state insurance this year i live in fear of tripping the wire   even in an essay like this i feel invisible i would kill to be 25 and making 50k a year and paralyzed by errands   i am from shitty minimumwage jobs where a snitty shitty recruiter a decade my junior pockets half of my wages and my benefits so an employer can cut me loose in six months  anyhoo  httpswwwbuzzfeednewscomarticleannehelenpetersenmillennialsburnoutgenerationdebtworkutmsourcedynamicamputmcampaignbffbbuzzfeedreaderamprefbffbbuzzfeedreader   i think it covers anxiety about work image and how those are linked very well i think about both constantly  the importance of working in american life just as part of a social narrative is something that has tormented me for a long time and she talks about it eloquently here too   some key paragraphs after she talks about social media and the exhortation to brand oneself    the more work we do the more efficient weve proven ourselves to be the worse our jobs become lower pay worse benefits less job security our efficiency hasnt bucked wage stagnation our steadfastness hasnt made us more valuable if anything our commitment to work no matter how exploitative has simply encouraged and facilitated our exploitation we put up with companies treating us poorly because we dont see another option we dont quit we internalize that were not striving hard enough and we get a second gig     one of the ways to think through the mechanics of millennial burnout is by looking closely at the various objects and industries our generation has supposedly killed weve killed diamonds because were getting married later or not at all and if or when we do its rare for one partner to have the financial stability to set aside the traditional two months salary for a diamond engagement ring were killing antiques opting instead for fast furniture  not because we hate our grandparents old items but because were chasing stable employment across the country and lugging old furniture and fragile china costs money that we dont have weve exchanged sitdown casual dining applebees tgi fridays for fast casual chipotle et al because if were gonna pay for something it should either be an experience worth waiting in line for cronuts worldfamous bbq momofuku or efficient as hell  even the trends millennials have popularized  like athleisure  speak to our selfoptimization yoga pants might look sloppy to your mom but theyre efficient you can transition seamlessly from an exercise class to a skype meeting to child pickup we use fresh direct and amazon because the time they save allows us to do more work  this is why the fundamental criticism of millennials  that were lazy and entitled  is so frustrating we hustle so hard that weve figured out how to avoid wasting time eating meals and are called entitled for asking for fair compensation and benefits like working remotely so we can live in affordable cities adequate health care or 401ks so we can theoretically stop working at some point before the day we die were called whiny for talking frankly about just how much we do work or how exhausted we are by it but because overworking for less money isnt always visible  because job hunting now means trawling linkedin because overtime now means replying to emails in bed  the extent of our labor is often ignored or degraded  its long but good   lol and still does not touch those of us whose capacity to labor is simply not valued ,adico2
128,Just read this AntiWork post and I have a few question regarding the comments and such,just found this post linked below and i decided to read all he comments to see what its all about i recently finished a macroeconomics course so naturally this topic relates closely to what i just finished studying  the point the op seems to be trying to make is that when  the buying power of a group of people increases by way of an increase in wages the buying power of those who did not receive the same increase percentagewise will actually decrease according to the macroeconomic standards this is because at xhr mr johnny appleseed can afford product a at d but if mr johnny appleseeds wages increase to yhr he could still afford product a at d with much more leftover  or at least thats how you think it would work see the producers of product a have workers too they have minimum wage workers who also had their wages raised to yhr and its not like product a is some super valuable and desirable product just because people can buy more of it doesnt necessarily mean that they will so the money to cover the cost of paying higher salaries has to come from somewhere and more often then not that money comes in the form of an increase in prices so product a is longer being sold at price d it is now sold at price f so now the people who were making xhr and could only afford so much of product a at price d are now making yhr and and afford about the same amount of product a as before when its sold at price f  meanwhile mrs jane doe over here who saw no change whatsoever to her salary of zhr now has to purchase product a at price f instead of d her buying power is now worth less than before because the price increased but the wages did not because the employer couldnt afford it they already have other minimum wage employees and those mandatory raises are nearly bankrupting the company they cant afford to give raises that match the inflation in prices so those who were making zhr now have less buying power altogether  apply this same process to the entire economy from grocery stores to to the housing market and thats basically how inflation works  all of that seems to be specifically what the op was trying to argue regardless of how eloquent he was or wasnt i do also see the side of those corporations whose ceos hoard moneys away like a squirrel with nuts they should be recirculating the money they make to increase the economys success in growing i 100 agree however we cannot force then to do so anymore than we can force our neighbors to spend their own savings just to boost the economy unfortunately if we want to see change we have to be the change ourselves  my question now is even though wage increases are good things is there a better way to bring about wage increases than forcing employers to pay them i ask this because in some cases employers have had to fire other employees just to keep doors open and some have even gone bankrupt already the place i work at is struggling already and i actually fear for my job at this point the large corporations who are hedge funded can handle all of this but small familyowned business are suffering hard because they cant employees enough people to maintain there businesses  thats all folks  rantiworkhttpswwwredditcomrantiworkcommentsae7ihhnycjustraisedtheminimumwageto15idostjqpgnfl1ampsh83fc4a6c,ae9dyi

133,Step one: do not ever allow any job to control your life.,hey folks longtime poster here i wanted to try and share a storyadvice with you all concerning the concept of jobs and the mental cage they attempt to put us in  ampx200b   approximately two years ago i broke out of the prison known as depression i battled it for about one year although it was caused by many things i can say without a doubt that the main culprit was jobs solely being seen as a tool constantly being disrespected my life outside of work better known as my real life not being taken seriously being threatened and talked down to getting injured from the job and once again not being taken seriously being surrounded by fakers and masks the list goes oni had put up with these things for so long that eventually i came to just view them as normal and the adult life  i had been caged   the job was all i thought about my life wasnt even mine anymore i was always worried about what my wannabe masters  the managerssupervisorsemployees thought of me doing absolutely ridiculous and degrading things just for the sake of trying to get them to think well of me in my worthless pursuit for their love i had totally lost myself   my passions gone   my joy gone  my happiness gone  my loves gone  my peace gone  my creativity gone  my ambitions gone  my life gone  my self gone  but my loyalty and dedication to these jobs stayed coincidence i dont believe so   the system is built to slowly make jobs all human beings think about who cares about all that other stuff in your life its not going to make your employer richer you are just a tool a pawn in the game  ampx200b  i noticed that no matter how kind i tried to be with the people at these jobs the end result was the still the same they didnt think any higher of me and they still repeated the same behavior at the end of the day  but like the fool i was i just blamed myself for that i would call myself a loser and that i should take the blame i mean the job was everything to me and the people there were the greatest ever if they still looked down on me then that means i must be a total failure  ampx200b   no  ampx200b  the exact day that i left that job i swear to you all that the light had finally started its fight against the darkness it amazes me to this day that that was all i needed to open my eyes a detachment i began realizing everything about how foolish i was i realized that those people were not my friends i realized that i was my own person i realized that i was free i realized what life really was and thankfully i began remembering everything about myself i reclaimed everything from my passions to my old friends to my hobbies to my favorite tv shows i got myself back   and now two years later its only gotten better i now know that jobs are simply a means of getting money that is it i dont invest any feelings passion or attachment of any sort into them if im there i do only what the job entails treat people with basic levels of respect and get out of there nothing more i keep my life defended from every job never allowing them to trespass into it honestly if im not clocked in my mind is completely void of all things related to a job i will never allow them to control me again  the reason being that my life is literally everything its all i have and theres no way that im going to let it be tainted because of a few greedy individuals who only care about how much work i can do for them at the end of the day  to all of you reading i encourage you to do the same reclaim your mind and your life stop calling days that youre not being used your days off these are just your days stop calling your nights of comfort in your home and space work nights and filling your mind with dread related to a job dont even give them that power over you and stop going to a job expecting to find your lifes purpose or second home i cant imagine someone ever finding those things in a place theyre only at for money    ampx200b  your life is yours  ampx200b,ac4w6r

137,In remembrance of /u/-red-ataraxia,many of us can relate  httpswwwredditcomrdepressioncomments3dvvepmiseryintermsof40hourworkweekhttpswwwredditcomrdepressioncomments3dvvepmiseryintermsof40hourworkweek  gtyou and me i think were the exact fucking same   i have an hour long commute i have to wake up at 5 am leave at 6 am and be in by 7 i leave at 3 pm and make it home at 4 i have to go to bed at 9 pm in order to wake up the next day not feeling like tired shit because the human body is a disgustingly inefficient thing   the instant i get home at 430 pm my mind goes into timer mode i start counting the hours the minutes sometimes even the seconds i have exactly four and a half hours to do things i want to do before i have to go back to the slog the next day i need to cram that time with as much of the things i want to do as possible   my weekends are the same i wake up and i start counting saturdays are less of a problem usually because i can wake up when i want and go to sleep whenever i want but its still there casting a shadow over everything i get one day one day out of seven where i dont feel stressed about waking up when i have to and sleeping when i have to and when saturday starts i have twelve or fourteen or sixteen hours before sunday when sunday starts i have until 9 pm until my weekend is over   when the fortyhour work week starts to get to you like it does to me you start feeling stifled for time and the paycheck you receive starts feeling worthless because its not like you can use that money to buy the time back   this is your life ending one hour one minute one second at a time for forty hours a week maybe even more   if anyone asks you out whether its your so or your friends your parents anyone even if your relationships with them are happy and healthy your brain cant help but make an automatic calculation how much of my time will this take how much will i have left until i have to go back to work and when even the slightest thing goes wrongif you forgot to get something at the store if theres traffic if someone makes a mistake and costs you more time you start to resent it you resent that delay and the people who caused that delay for wasting the precious free time you have and every hour every minute every second that slips away is time that you dont get to spend doing the things you want to do   things you used to enjoy no longer provide the same fulfillment because you cant stop that clock you cant stop counting the hours the minutes the seconds even if youre enjoying yourself even if youre having a blast and accomplishing a lot even if at the end of the day you feel like a champion who is closer to your dream that shadow is there telling you that you only have this many hours this many minutes this many seconds left until you go back like a guillotine slowly inching its way towards your neck and when youre having fun that realization causes you to get jerked back into the real world   hey fucker have a good time i hope you did because its another forty hours until you can even start to get it back now start lifting jackass your life doesnt become yours until we say it does   my job doesnt suck the work is nothing special if a little tiring but its not murdering me i work at a good company my co workers are good people my boss is a pretty understanding guy who always tries to be fair and helps out whenever he can my pay isnt anything stellar but its liveable and some people would envy having it 20 an hour   but i get the sense that id feel like this with the vast majority of work forty hour work weeks no matter what get tedious become meaningless burn me out the only way i can avoid it is to not work a day in my lifeto do a job that i love but how many people get jobs they love how many people get paid liveable wages enough to have a room and food doing what they love how many people even know what it is that they love to even pursue it in the first place   the fact that the starving artist is a running joke in americasomeone going hungry trying to do what they loveis the cruel reality and the fact that were okay with it and point and laugh with everyone else even fake laughter is the cruelest reality imaginable   you want to do what you love fuck you thats not how the real fucking world works shitheel now hop to it youve got forty hours of work to do and if you want to fucking eat you better fucking do it   im reminded of that movie in time starring justin timberlake its a movie about a dystopian future where money has no more meaning and people trade time a coffee might cost thirty seconds a cab fare might cost two minutes a high quality mountain bicycle might be four months a new sedan might be nine years   theres a watch everyone has embedded in their arm that tells them how much time they have and when the number reaches zero they die some people have hundreds of years of time some people live minute to minute   thats what i feel like that some people have the rest of their lives to look forward to with their 90 years of time and here i am scraping by with only a few hours on my clock every day before the clock hits zero and i die   and in america you cant talk to anyone about it nobody at all not really because even if some individual people might sympathize and wish they had less working hours alongside you society will think of you as a lazy piece of shit who just wants to mooch off of others all because youre not willing to surrender forty hours a week one hundred and sixty hours a month one thousand nine hundred and twenty hours a year for a paycheck and you have to convince yourself that you need this paycheck that you need this money in order to not get fucked in the ass by taxes and bills you try you try so hard to justify it you need this money you need to give up these forty hours to live this is necessary you try   but it doesnt work not really not until its too late   ive been trying to search for a job where i can work from a home office but for someone like me theres no options everything requires more schooling more experience and getting schooling or experience requires time and money i dont have and cant get and even then ive only been at this job for a few months i cant quit yet because i need to stay long enough for it to look good on my resume   i know drugs will make it worse alcohol will make it worse the most i can do is try to anesthetize myself with the activities that i used to like activities that used to give my life meaning and purpose i used to enjoy these things but now the most these things can give methese things i used to love and enjoyis a distraction a temporary illusion that im not miserable which wears off at 9 pm every day   theres a light at the end of the tunnel and i can only hope that its a train,ad7nic

144,The perspective of a teenager who's discovering the reality of jobs,a little bit of context im 18 finished high school in 2017 im currently a student and im not from the us im from argentina i come from a family where no one works 8 hours or more a day and everyone has at least a month of vacations my mom works at a school 5 hours a day with twomonths vacations she has like 10 free days besides sick days my dad would be the exception  because hes a trucker so when he travels he pretty much works all day but he also gets to spend months without working no one close works at a private company maybe because there arent many where i live they either work for the government or are independent and they dont experience much stress i used to go to school for 4 hours a day and had almost four months of vacation not to mention that there were plenty of missed days it was pretty cool and i loved to spend my time pursuing my hobbies and doing things i enjoyed   for most of my life i imagined work as something you did for 45 hours a day with at least one month of vacation but some time ago i was at university and looked at the it job offers out of curiosity because i luckily dont need a job for private companies and all of them were a 9 to 6 with one hour of lunch not only that but the vacation offered was only twoweeks long in most cases i investigated more on the internet about people working at such companies and some people mentioned working extra hours or being called about workrelated stuff when theyre at home i was shocked i discovered that this is pretty much the norm at most private companies in my country and now that im paying more attention to people mentioning jobs on reddit its almost always a 9 to 5 job and usually at companies i also keep hearing about it in movies and videos reading about in articles i thought how is this just considered the normal thing to do im starting to think this is even more common in the us maybe its because you have a lot of companies there and companies tend to have that type of schedule how rare are parttime jobs there   i feel like i discovered a part of the adult world i was unaware of before and its honestly sad how do people even find time to do all house chores hang out with friendsso go to the gym pursue a hobby etc maybe for young single people its doable but i cant imagine how people with kids find enough time   i guess a lot of people would call me naive or spoiled by complaining about this but i really cant imagine myself being at work from 9 to 6 unless youre extremely passionate about what you do it doesnt seem good i actually mentioned it to my parents and they agreed that its too much my mom even adviced me to avoid fulltime jobs i just hope i can find parttime jobs since i dont think not working is an option    i agree with the ideas presented in this subreddit it would better if we had an option not to work at all but i think that if most people could at least work less hours and in better environments it would much more bearable and there would be much less stress some people may be happy working and thats ok but i dont think its what were all meant to do some people may even like working 8 hours a day and its ok but i definitely dont think we should all do it everyone has different rhythms different tastes different needs and it doesnt make sense to try to force everyone into the same type of life ,acc7f2

160,Quick Rant,just discovered this sub a few days ago i work in marketing however im a one person marketing team at my office that sounds like something that would keep me very busy and 34s of the year it does however the industry im in is almost entirely dead in the winter so from november to march i come in from 800  530 and sit at a desk for 85 hours with a mandatory 1 hour lunch break my day to day work can be accomplished in roughly 12 hours on an average day maybe ill respond to 510 emails and take a few phone calls throughout the rest of the day but really im just sitting here pretending to look busy with reddit opened on one screen and my completed work open on another i could easily do about 90 of my work from home and at least be productive during the day but i am forced to sit here for 85 hours because thats how things have always been it truly bothers me and makes absolutely no sense to me that i cant just come in for 2 hours and get all my work done and go on about my day answering emails and phone calls when they come ,adxum4

164,The Gig Economy and Work,i feel particularly motivated today to write a piece on the socalled gig economy three words dont fall for it i am desperate to find some kind of work soon because i need to do big things like pay rent and utilities and put food on the table so i am part of the typical demographic that companies like ubereats grubhub postmates and others go after they make promises of 1618 dollars per hour which are just patently false they make claims about being able to work whenever you want on your schedule and time they tout one of the benefits as being selfemployed lets break this down a little bit further to discover the lies of respective marketing departments  1 selfemployment youre not actually selfemployed but youre an independent contractor you still want to carry some form of workers compensation so if you get injured youre taken care of in a real selfemployment situation you would be able to set the rates at which youre willing to work the gig economy sends you a job and there is no negotiating the rate at which youll be compensated it is a set rate at which you must take you risk having your contract terminated if you accept a job and then cancel later you also become the subject of gamification in which the company gives you meaningless donkey and carrot incentives which add up to scraps when compared to what the company has made at your expense 2 1618 dollars per hour factor in the cost of gasoline insurances commercial insurance and workmans comp wear and tear on your car and you might actually be earning less than minimum wage the 1618 dollar range they quote is predicated on having no business expenses clever bastard from hell marketers 3 work whenever you want no thats not necessarily true either you need to work when the demand is high for a service if you work when demand is low youre in a net loss situation  youre better off working a terrible minimum wage job than in the gig economy just dont do it ,acw346
