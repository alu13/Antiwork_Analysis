4,"My name is Nick Ford and I run a site called AbolishWork.com, AMA!","Hey everyone, I know this is on short notice but I saw that some of you have shared my content and thought it'd be good to connect with the (presumably) fine folks at this subreddit.

If you have any questions about me concerning work, what sort of pizza is the best or anything else feel free to comment below!

If I discover that this is too short of a notice for an AMA then I'll come back in a few weeks and try again in 2015. :)

AMA!

EDIT: Of course, now, of all times, AW.com has decided to mess up. It's safe to view as far as I know but give it time for things to be patched up!

FINAL EDIT: It's 3:33 AM and a little over 12 hours since I started this AMA. With 20 comments (a bunch of them being mine of course) but with such short notice I am fairly happy with how this went.

I'll be sure to come back in a few months and do another since you guys seemed to enjoy it. And next time I'll give a bit more notice! :)

Thanks for everyone's time!",False,2pa4n1,AbolishWork,http://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/2pa4n1/my_name_is_nick_ford_and_i_run_a_site_called/,21,23

6,Hey Nick,"How do you define ""work""? I have followed you on facebook and been trying to figure it out. I could easily strawman here and go on about Say's law and whatnot, but your definition is the most important thing to understand here.",False,2pa7rf,[deleted],http://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/2pa7rf/hey_nick/,0,1
