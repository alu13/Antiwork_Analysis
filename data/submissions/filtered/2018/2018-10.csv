1,I will never ever change,i came here totally by accident  someone linked this sub at r antinatalism and i was here  feels good to be here altough i haven't read much  i am usually a reader not a writer  anyway   i dont work  i am not rich  i am not poor  i am a minimalist with according to a psychiatrist   chronic depressed  i am depressed about what we humans must do to survive  what is it that we have to do  work  thats where my severe chronic depression comes from  the solution would be to take medications so the truth about life gets suppressed so i can be a wage slave again   no thank  i live on welfare benefits  since we are forced to live in a capitalistic and government controlled country  its important to know what the country can do for you and not the other way around   i will never work again  i will never ever change  so long  ,9kw23m
2,I'm starting my first job on Tuesday and the thought of it makes me want to curl up in to a ball and cry, prelude  i've been very lucky to have the privilege of being in the position of not having to work until now  being a student  my parents always told me that as long as i'm in school  which is a demon in and of itself  that i don't have to work  well  i've been off since july and start school back in january and i've finally found a job that i start on tuesday    main text  i hate the idea of working a job i don't want to do because i have to  do something   strapping up your boots and joining the rest of society  is the one of the cringiest statements i've ever heard  sure  nobody wants to work shitty jobs  yadda yadda yadda  but seeing the concept as fundamentally wrong and knowing that things such as ubi could change the fabric of society is heartbreaking   the system has felt rigged ever since i can remember  maybe seeking alternative schools of thought  reading about fundamentally superior societies and indulging in psychedelics have ruined me  i know i am awake  but at what cost   capitalist culture literally makes me feel suicidal ,9maj3p
3,Anybody else do stuff like this?,i'm vehemently antiwork and take separating it from my life very seriously  so one of the little things i do to emphasize that fact is  always  keeping job-related stuff in my back pocket so it's constantly kissing my ass    anybody else do stuff like that  ,9q8u2y
4,You'll also be rich one day! You just keep working hard!,   the wageslave  stuck in a low-prestige  dead-end mob he rates  - everything feels monotonous and repetition  - takes up foggy  forces self to repeat morning prove- due  waits in traffic  slack off at work  finished day to face the awaiting traffic  goes back home  does nothing  goes to sleep too late  since and repeat     worries about debt mortgage finances next paychque constantly  - doesn't have good relationships with workers  feels lice he has to face a personality for the job  - always stressed  tired  might abuse cold medicine    heals are mix between unhealthy singing and starving    right drink a lot of coffee  alcohol  or smokes    daydreams about leaving it all behind  or killing his boss   always thinks about the weekend  but never does any- thing different on them  ,9ok5tq
5,"Question for r/antiwork members: Do you try to become close friends with co-workers, or stay detached and not communicate with them outside of a job?",i'm predicting that the answers are going to be split pretty evenly  personally  i strongly disagree with the idea of being friends with co-workers  in this context  i define  friends  as people you regularly share personal details with  talk to on your own time  hang out with  etc  work environments are very toxic  so there's no way i want anything coming from there to find its way into my life  also  at this job i currently work at  i say almost nothing but see almost everything  and these things i constantly see strongly reinforce my anti-work ideals   like  if i had a dollar for every time i saw somebody shit talk their  work friend  as if they were total strangers  then i would quit that job   that's not to say it's utterly impossible to make a friend there  and if you do do that  then no disrespect to you  but  i do think it's very unlikely that you'll find true friends in such a nasty environment and that you'll be better off looking almost anywhere else      ,9s6qef
6,Should I self-employ(?) in a lower-cost country to work less? Help? (long...),free time is extremely important to me  therefore i want to work as little as possible to live a quality life  and i  despise  the idea of working a shitty job for someone else even if it pays a lot  so i guess i am  anti-work  all i want in life is to be left alone to enjoy my hobbies  not caring about spending on anything all that unnecessary  eating out  cable tv  car  fancy smartphone etc  really just a decent house  utilities internet  computer and food    amp x200b   my passions   main hobbies are programming  game dev  and 2d art animation  plenty of experience in both through pushing my free time to the max when i was younger  people keep insisting i  get a job  doing one of those  but i know for sure the game development and  software engineering  industries are both absolute shitshows in their own right  and while i know less about the industry side of art animation i can't imagine it being much better  good pay doesn't matter to me if i have to waste my life on it    amp x200b   as of right now  i am doing 2 things to make a bit of money  i earn a relatively small amount of money  for living  usa  per month off of commissions  and a patreon  combined they make me  800 per month  depends on how many commissions i do  so sometimes more  for drawing casually or commissions only 1-3 hours each day  sometimes  lt 1hr if i'm not feeling it  so  i'm hardly even working  but then again i only turned 18 just a few months ago  so i don't need to make enough to live on my own quite yet    amp x200b   as for the second  in addition to the above  i started selling the games i develop  i released my first  commercial  game on steam almost 5 months ago and i surprisingly  made almost  4 5k in sales so far  after only 7 months of development a few hours a day when i felt like it nowhere near full time  not much to live on  but consider the following    amp x200b   patreon comission drawing   800   12    9600  game development   750   12    9000   amp x200b   so   if things everything keeps going the way it is  continuing just making games and drawing stuff or whatever  i would make  around  18 6k per year  now  if i were to try and make a living with this in the usa  that would be complete and utter shit  but here's my idea  don't live in the usa  and i definitely don't mean anywhere in a 3rd world-y place no offense  like india  africa  china  middle east etc  but instead somewhere in europe    amp x200b   it looks like  bulgaria is a good candidate https www numbeo com cost-of-living compare cities jsp country1 united states amp country2 bulgaria amp city1 houston 2c tx amp city2 sofia  not a  10 day hellhole  but cheap enough and pretty decent if you have the right amount of money  could cost even less outside of sofia  i'm also currently quite a bit of money since i still live with my parents  so i'd have a significant boost at the beginning to make the move there  but  the real trick is that i will be making money as if i'm someone the usa  by selling to people living in the usa  who are willing to pay more for things than people in bulgaria  so what would be a shitty living there  becomes the equivalent of a middle-class or upper middle-class quality of life here  without having to work a traditional job    amp x200b    ----------------------------   amp x200b   however  i'm sure plenty of people have thought about something somewhat similar to this  is there a problem  because i have this really weird gut feeling that i'm missing something  extremely  major in my plan  provided i don't fuck up and lose my patrons or all my games are forevermore the worst flops in history  in any case  even a few k less than  18 000 could be a very comfy life in bulgaria  is this a viable idea  like something i can actually do provided i'm willing to make the sacrifice of  well  living in bulgaria  someone give me some advice ,9pgy2p
7,8 ideas for people who want to abolish work right now,i decided to expand one of my comments into a post  i hope people find it helpful   1  start your own movement to abolish wage slavery  as strange as this might seem  you don't need a hundreds of people to start a movement    2  pick a day  a monday morning  for instance  go with ten of your friends and block a busy intersection  you will block the intersection in order to prevent workers from getting to work that day to create surplus value    note  you will almost certainly piss everyone off   they are just trying to get to work and will be very angry you are standing in their way  you will almost certainly be arrested  delay your arrest as long as you can in order to tie up traffic as long as possible    3 no one will understand why you did this  explain it to them  it might help to bring leaflets explaining your action so that people have something to read while stuck in traffic    4  next week pick another intersection  rinse  repeat  continue until people figure out that wage slavery is as wrong as segregation was in the sixties  continue until people figure out that wage slavery is as wrong as apartheid was in the nineties  for some reason people don't think that it's immoral to threaten workers with starvation if they don't produce surplus value  you are going to change this    5  you don't need organizations  you don't need unions  you don't need self described revolutionaries  they will come as people join with your effort  don't ask these useless people for directions  if anyone had directions to give  they would already be in the streets with you    6  don't expect anyone to agree with you  don't expect support    7  do expect allies to condemn you and second guess you  you will be doing something they think can't be done  should not be attempted   8  you will be on your own  the only way anyone ever gets anything done    ps  good luck  ,9q7m43
8,"""experienced general laborers""",general labor is now apparently a skill  i keep seeing ads that are referring to this as something somebody needs a little bit of experience with and have a resume for  this shit is infuriating  the whole term general labor and the like used to mean to me that anybody could do it and that it required little skill  apparently that's a whole skill all in it's self now  it makes no sense  ,9n7uik

12,Genuinely interested about what's the philosophy behind the sub,what's the idea  what does the perfect world looks like for you guys    in my brief time here i generally saw posts about  live to work society  and about how empty  pointless and unfulfilling some jobs are  but that's an obvious thing and anybody you ask will aggree with you that 9-5 office job is a soul-killer  but isn't that your own choice  being unqualified unmotivated just lazy to not work the job that you like  or work for youself  today there are literally endless opportunities to make what you like to do into money-well  so what's the problem here ,9pgvui

16,"I'm not ""antiwork"" but I am autistic, and autistic people are treated horribly at work.",employers don't care about disability whatsoever  they just expect you to do the job or they will show you the door   i actually worked at a place for people with disabilities and was more autistic than most people   the bosses and many  but not all  co-workers didn't care about my difficulties and i was terminated ,9pq25t
17,Is there really such thing as a dream job?,i find myself wondering this often  my friend decided to suddenly pick up and relocate to the pacific northwest  and has been courting companies for a  dream job  yet the companies that she is most interested in do not accept her  and she finds herself working in the second or third choice   from what i have found  on the outside of a company  things can look very attractive  the personnel get along  it's a well oiled machine  problems are easily fixed and quickly  yet every time i have started to get under the rugs of new jobs  i find that there is always a bit between one department or another  and the level of dysfunction is much higher than appears from the outside   this made me think  what is a dream job  do they even exist  can they even exist  or would it be more fair to say that any job is a  dream job  because it gives you more experience and perspective on the world  ,9pkr3l

32,Is the decision to work personal or social?,i am brainstorming a think-piece on the implications of the decision to work or not work  it probably will not be written for a few months  usually the decision to work or not work is set in the context of personal choice responsibility  i want challenge this paradigm  my argument is that the decision to work is a irreducibly social decision  this decision has both an environmental and a social impact  the decision you make affects the climate of the planet and the economic situation of others  you cannot make a decision to work or not work as if it only concerns your personal situation   what do you think of this argument  telling me i am full of shit is encouraged   ,9sjn8s

34,accepting the necessity and coping with work and a something some of you might find useful.,so i've been on welfarefor about two years now and i just want to say that no matter whether or you have a job or not  work is a part of your daily life and it's just something you have to to accept  work is neccessary part of life  get over it  you have to work in your life  if even only a little a bit     amp x200b   if you think there is such a thing as life without work  you are mistaken  i can tell you from my experience of not being employed for two years that work is an integral aspect of daily life     amp x200b   even little things are work  getting up out of the bed is work  doing the dishes is work  cooking your food is work  cleaning your house is work  maintaining your bicycle car motorbike  is work  mowing the lawn is work  prepping the house for bushfire hurricane whatever is work  shaving in the morning is work  brushing your teeth is work  hell even going to the toilet to take a shit is work    amp x200b   work is natural  look at prehistoric man  having to hunt  craft shelter  make clothing and fire  or medieval peasants working in communities  or even just animals  often in a constant struggle just to survive by avoiding predators catching prey    amp x200b   no matter what you do work will always exist in your life  the elimination of a job won't in and of itself make you happy  what you need  is a reason to live  a reason why you get up out of bed  do the dishes  cook your food   shave and brush you teeth  taking pride in certain work like cleaning is alright but ultimately you need a reason to live  that's what makes the little amount of work you will have if you don't have a job seem like a breeze and will make you spend your freetime on what you truly care about if you do have a job   job or no job  the most important thing to have is a reason to live    amp x200b   that being said i get that a lot of you are more concerned about what you guys call wagetheft and believe in things like automisation being used to decrease the need for work and decreasing production of things be a worthy sacrifice for say a four day work week and i agree with all of that  if all it took was shops being open 9-5 four or three days a week to have a 3-4day working week that would be great  during my two years of being unemployed i did a factory job that was 40 hours a week  got paid 17 dollars an hour  australian  and it was a 7 am start  so i know what it's like to do those shitty jobs and i definitely think if the hours for them can be reduced or if they can even be fully automised that would be great  but my point is  that work in and of itself is a part of life that you just have to accept    amp x200b   that being said i'd like to share what my future plan is as it may prove useful to some of you  my current plan is to get a job as a security guard  just waiting for my application to finish up  and save up some money to buy a cheap block of land  then move onto that cheap block of land  we're talking about 10 000 dollars more or less  and commute from it  living on that block of land   you'd obviously want to build a bungalow or i guess you could buy a second hand caravan    then once you've saved up enough money buy the second block of land   not something to expensive 50-70k most  usd that would probably be something like 45-60k  then sell the first block of land and start building a permanent dwelling on it  i'm planning on building basically a tiny home but a bit bigger  sticking to simple construction principles and hiring tradies where necessary  also planning on getting a barn for about 5k to have a space for to store vehicles  tools  and just a general work room for projects and stuff     amp x200b   obviously the dwelling will cost money  i'd say about 40-60k  maybe 70k  and will take a long time to complete  but once it's done i'm planning on setting it up with solar electricity and water  tank water  only thing i will pay for is sewrage fee   might also keep connections to water grid too  basically an off the grid smaller than average simplistically built house with a barn   and connections to the grid just in case  anyway i hope this helps somebody  best of luck avoiding being stuck in the 40hours week ,9pl302
35,You can't be anti-work without being anti-capitalist,we could automate so much if the motive behind the market was social well-being rather than profit  the need to cut corners and increase profitability necessitates that workers are paid the minimum possible so that margins can increase  and automation further pushes the wages of workers down  under the capitalist system the very technology that would free us from the monotony of work is despised because it lowers the standard of living for the mass majority of people simply due to the consolidation of wealth and resources - a vast majority of the bullshit jobs are designed to support this system  and also tend to pay very well  as a consequence they're indoctrinated to support  advocate  and lobby for a system that is against the interests of the masses because it has provided for them a life of luxury as well as a freedom most do not have ,9py6gy

40,The Joy of Leaving a Job,i've never gotten an exhilarating high from taking a job  since graduating from university i've only been able to find employment in customer service or sales positions completely unrelated to my major  at one point i got excited  but that feeling usually dissipated after a few days  my disdain for work always makes itself known in my lateness  i'll get up with more than enough time to get ready but i'll sit on my bed thinking and savoring the final moments before i have to leave for work  savoring my moments of freedom  this usually results in me being late to my job  because i hate my job    i wasn't always late to work  when i worked in a restaurant in high school i had no problem being on time  same for college  but i was living at home and worked part time    full time work in customer service pretty much destroys my mental health  i've only been in call center or sales positions  i end up hating the work of dealing with other people  i spent all my time in school studying  doing research  writing papers and so forth  i naturally assumed that i would find a career doing similar work  i figured worst case scenario i'd get a job as someone doing market research for a company or doing statistical analyses of our sales processes  not what i'd truly want to do but something i could do and at least make 40 or 50 or 60k per year    instead i've found nothing of the sort  i'm in my late twenties and have never been able to find a job paying more than  15 per hour  currently making less than that  it drives me up the wall    none of my jobs have required skills that i did not possess by the time i was in 3rd or 4th grade  i wish i was joking  my parents put me through private schools and a private university and i feel their money has truly been wasted  at the very least  i wish i would've had at least one teacher or authority figure who would've impressed upon me that making money was the most important thing    it's fucked up  i feel like the boomer generation tried to fix this but failed  many of them had  great  jobs in terms of money  they made tons of money but still weren't happy  so they encouraged millenials to  follow your dreams  instead of worrying about making a living  for me that meant studying politics and society at an intense level and trying to find and understand solutions to improve the human condition  i often feel my studies could be utilized within a company  not just in the larger scheme of society or politics  but it seems like this is futile  everyone i know who followed their dreams has a shitty life  w exception of computer science ppl  everyone i know who focused on business or finance is now living comfortably  i hate this so much  i feel more than capable to do a higher wage higher skilled job but it's just not possible at this time    the result ends in demoralization  not only do i feel i won't get a good job  but i can't even focus or care about my shitty job  half of my income goes to rent  another third or more goes to bills  i'm left with like  200 a month to spend on non essentials  and at the end of the day i'm lucky  because i know if i fail i can move back in w my parents to get on my feet  i know many people don't have that luxury    but for me  i've had the pleasure 3 times in my life of leaving a job  twice i quit  once i was fired  i can honestly say that the days i've left my job have been the happiest in my life  better than graduation from high school or college  better than losing my virginity or falling in love  better than  with few exceptions  peak moments of an amazing concert  when i leave a job without another lined up i feel truly free and at peace  my world once again has potential  i can think about the future   sure i'll have to get another job  but i can actually think about it   i read earlier today on an r dataisbeautiful post that the average job seeker has to apply to between 150 and 250 jobs before finding one  this has largely been my experience  everyone says don't leave your job til you find something else  but where do you find the time to apply to so many jobs while you are working  i'm braindead after work  i am decently educated and spend my days in tech support telling people to unplug their routers or to press the settings button on their iphone  that's it  it's frustrating work  because most people have extreme difficulty finding the power cable for their router and the settings icon on their iphone  but relatively easy at the end of the day  what i would do for a job that requires more brainpower   later today i am calling in to work and i am going on a road trip to see a concert  i may get fired  but i cant go on like this ,9ricw8
41,Off-Grid Invitation,if anyone else has become disillusioned with living in the capitalist world  i'd like to invite you to the off-grid project that me and a few other redditors are planning  within a year we will establish an entirely self-sufficient and moneyless commune   the moral and ethical foundation of our commune are as follows   1  antinatalism  we believe that imposing existence opon something non-existent is immoral and contrary to the freedom that anarchists stand for   2  collective ownership of the means of production  private property is abolished but personal property remains   3  anarchism  absolutely no hierarchy  the only freedoms we don't tolerate are the freedoms to opress or dominate others   4  zero discrimination  no matter what background you are from  you are always welcome  regardless of your gender  ethnicity  nationality  sexual orientation etc  5  non-agression principle  do not harm anyone unless they harm you or another person   6  no cultism or religious fanaticism  personal beliefs are fine but do not impose them on others   7  causing minimal environmental damage and if possible try to adopt veganism   this one is not essential though   if you accept these 7 principles  you are more than welcome to join  our numbers are still small but with your support we have the potential to grow into the anarcho-communist society so many dream about   if you're interested  pm me for further details and discussion  if you do have further recommendations or objections to any of the 7 principles  i'd still be more than happy to discuss them ,9ktb6r
42,"Trying to answer ""What else would you do?""",usually  when i share my views that people shouldn't be working like they do  i'll get the question  if you didn't work all day  what else would you do      when people ask this  they think they're helping me out   most people assume that work itself isn't the problem  but that i  personally  am just mismatched to what i'm currently doing  if i said  i'd spend my days travelling  they'll tell me to research travel jobs  find one that i like  get the prerequisites needed in terms of education and experience  and then do it  if i said  i want to read more  it would be something steering me towards a book-related job  and  again  this usually comes from good intentions    here's something like what i'd say at first    gt i  haven't found the right job  because there is no right job  as i see it  the system itself  the one that requires work  is deranged  first you pick a task  then you make sure it's a task that will make a very rich person even richer  then  do that task for 40  hours a week  and accept that all other aspects of your existence will center around that task  in fact  you and your life will be dedicated to facilitating the task  not the other way around  if you choose not to  then you'll have no access to food  shelter and all social amenities  and supposedly this system is awesome because you  kind of slightly  have a choice of task       gt     gt so  let's put aside that tiny freedom of choice  it's  everything else  i'm opposed to  i don't want to talk about the task because  everything else  looms so huge for me  i want a society where  everything else  has changed  but for the time being i'm stuck in this one  why don't  you  want to change this as well   honest as it is  i've learned that answer comes across as pretty jarring  and kills the conversation   it's like they asked me  what's your favorite color  and i responded with  colors are a lie  burn the system    so i started to wonder if there was is some way to express myself while keeping the conversation going  actually answering their question  and having useful dialogue  i've made this much more generic than what i actually say nowadays  but this is the gist of it    gt when i'd come back to work from long vacations  i'd feel great  the vacations gave me a chance to experience something else  and to remember there's life beyond whatever i'd been focusing on  for the first few days back  those memories were powerful enough that i  knew  there was a world outside of work  i  knew  that if i walked out the door and never came back  there was still a world there  it wouldn't be fun or easy getting by in that world without my job  but at least i knew it existed  for those few days  i remembered that i had that choice  and have always had that choice      gt     gt armed with that choice so prominent in my head  i would work for those first few days and  know  i was doing the task at hand because i  chose  to  my actions were deliberate  i didn't  waste time  at work because i would remember it was my own time to begin with  that feeling of self-determination  of not just understanding but  knowing  on a visceral level that i am in control of my own life  that's what i want  all the time  the actual job is less important to me     gt     gt unfortunately  i can't get that feeling continuously in the way work is set up in most of society  again  it's not the  going on vacation  part that i crave  but the feeling of being refreshed regularly  most jobs  no matter what industry  are against giving you a continuous feeling of being refreshed  instead  they keep you focused on the task at hand  so much so that you forget there's anything else out there  so much so that you forget who  you  are outside of the job     rather than living like that  i pursue other hobbies  many for their own sake  but also because doing these things  for limited amounts of time  is enough to remind me that i exist outside work  that work is a task i choose to do and that if i let go of the task  i will still thrive  if i did any of those hobbies exclusively and turned it into conventional full-time work  it would defeat  possibly even pervert  the purpose     gt     gt i've spent the last decade trying to balance conventional  work  with that sense of refreshed  relaxed  purposeful  work  it means i clock in much fewer hours than is typical  but i spend that extra time on myself  giving me that relaxed focus and purpose  it hasn't been easy  but  to me  it has been worthwhile  this is what i spend my time 'extra' time doing  and there's nothing else i'd rather do   it's still totally honest  but keeps the conversation going  and it usually goes to something positive  ,9ltedn

62,Space for Right-Wing AntiWorkers?,so i just found this sub and i noticed that it has a heavy left-wing and anarchist bent  i do understand this  and i am at least pleased that people here recognize communist societies often created pointless jobs in order to have complete employment and as a reason to make sure everyone got paid    that being said  i think many of the problems of our modern society  with it's bullshit jobs  is more than mere  capitalism  or i guess another way to put it is that i don't think right wing thought and capitalism must necessarily be considered to be joined at the hip  in my opinion  capitalism is actually closer to communism than either of those philosophies are to a healthy state of being  a lot of things have brought me to this view over the years  one is the proto-fascist philosopher julius evola who once described capitalism and communism as placing primary emphasis on things  rather than on values  in other words i think the problem of work relates more to materialism specifically than it does capitalism in particular  though i think modern capitalism has many problems in and of itself  here's the quote in particular that impacted me     gt nothing is more evident than that modern capitalism is just as subversive as marxism  the materialistic view of life on which both systems are based is identical  both of their ideals are qualitatively identical  including the premises connected to a world the center of which is constituted of technology  science  production   productivity  and  consumption  and as long as we only talk about economic classes  profit  salaries  and production  and as long as we believe that real human progress is determined by a particular system of distribution of wealth and goods  and that  generally speaking  human progress is measured by the degree of wealth or indigence   then we are not even close to what is essential  even though new theories  beyond marxism and capitalism  might be formulated    julius evola  men among the ruins  p  166   i think the main reason i dislike work isn't that i dislike activity  it is that i feel i have only worked meaningless and pointless job  for example  i always enjoyed school thoroughly  even when it was tough  i always felt like i was working towards something meaningful  i enjoyed learning new things and increasing my knowledge base  for me  the main sense of frustration is going to private schools  going to a good college  and then graduating and being unable to get a job that pays more than  13-15 per hour while these jobs  which say the prefer people with bachelor's degrees  do not really require any work that couldn't be done by someone with a 4th grade education  i legitimately wish i was kidding when i said that  i've been stuck in call center jobs and sales jobs since graduating  and while i may have picked a dumb degree  i was reassured by all of my professors that i'd definitely be able to get a good job and so forth  and this has emphatically not happened  there's absolutely no job i've done since graduating college that i would not have been physically and intellectually capable to do after high school  or even before graduating high school tbh    it's infuriating  but at the same time i don't completely hate work  i think that if i was able to be in a better job more aligned with my interests that i could excel  at one time i worked as a museum tour guide and although the pay was awful  i actually really enjoyed the job itself  i don't think i would hate work if i had the correct job  and i think a lot of other people feel the same way  i have friends who don't hate their jobs  and i have others who are like me and want to quit  the main issue seems to be money  my friends who make good money really don't seem to mind their jobs and some  like those in programming or finance  seem to derive pleasure from it  many of them get long lunch breaks  the ability to work from home  etc  i think if i had a job like that  i wouldn't hate working every day during the week    i know this has become kind of a rant  i guess just curious what other people here think ,9pectq

64,"Just a random thought, but I just really wish money played a much smaller role in society...",i really do i honestly feel like most of our plights related to jobs would almost all disappear if money didn't play such a large role  i'll be honest  my ideal society is a world where every adult is given a house  food  and every other basic necessity of life  and they'll only need money to buy luxuries  money would be seen as something  extra  and imo i think that's the right way to go    i know this seems highly unlikely  but there's nothing wrong with a little wishful thinking  hopefully  one day things will be better  but in the meantime let's all just keep doing our thing and taking care of ourselves  both physically  and especially  mentally  ,9rj9a9
