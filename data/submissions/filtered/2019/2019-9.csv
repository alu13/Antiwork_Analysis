0,"Well, I think I’m ready to say fuck it", call center job though i am privileged to work from home as the last month with quotas that put your job performance in the hands of others depending on if they comply with scheduling workers comp appointments if i dont schedule x amount of people and work y cases i am penalized for lack of performance kicker is that you can work a significant amount of cases and schedule less that a half of them its dependent of if you can reach the patient if they are willing to schedule and a bunch of other factors like state laws not to mention the network loses connection so that interferes with performance its just shitty in regards to my job i feel like that guy from office space ive been working there as my first full time job for the last year and i feel like im just dead inside because of it i thought that it was the long commute wearing me down it is actually fact that the job is a boring day after fucking day same pile of shitty work so i think im just done its boring not intellectually stimulating at all i am stuck at a desk for 8hrs a day the security i have is a regular and decent paycheck and health insurance i am young smart and wellappearing human i feel that i am resourceful enough to make money in other ways my boyfriend advised i can always hop on his health insurance weve been together 6 years now and im pretty sure the only reason we arent engaged is due to that we have been getting out of debt for the last 2 years while also spending more than we should on little things here and there  anyway i believe my bills are minimal enough that i could make due until november all of my october bills are paid  i know i could call my creditors and let them know if i needed extension days for later in november for bills at the beginning of the month i live in a nice middleupper middle class area where being a nanny and grocery delivery service person is possible ive applied back w my old part time position as well due to that the work i had there was at least bearable though low wage idk standby ill let you folks know how it goes,d97c4v

7,Am I missing something in this Labour proposal for a 4 day work week? Throwing this out there.,crosspost in this forbes article a labour guy drops some interesting fine print in the labour party proposal for a 4 day work week businesses are expected to increase productivity of labor first   as the article puts it  gtthe implementation of mcdonnells plan will depend on companies successfully automating processes and improving worker productivity  in other words the labour party is promising that after workers have been rendered redundant by improvements in the productivity of labor the party will allow a modest reduction of hours to four days   but no promise appears forthcoming on converting the increased productivity of the last 90 years into free time  do i have this right  read this is what uk business owners think of a fourday workweek httpswwwforbescomsitesbarnabylashbrooke20190927thisiswhatukbusinessownersthinkoffourdayworkweeks,da1vzm
8,The process of calling in sick at my workplace,you need to go to the doctor the first day of being sick to get a sickness certificate so if you are so sick that you cant leave the house its an unexcused absence at the doctors office you have to wait 2 hours till you can see a doctor and while youre waiting youre catching all the germs from other sick people in the waiting room that also want their sickness certificate sometimes i think if youre healthy enough to go through that ordeal you might as well show up to work and make everyone sick out of spite because ive been at my workplace for less than three months all sick days are unpaid   i am thankful that healthcare is free in my country but because going to the doctor is free all the boss scumbags are paranoid that someone might take a sick day without being sick,d9if06
9,"Friday, day 5/5 , slow business and Bored",sitting here at my corporate sales job  watching my boss play on his phone while i take the most bullshit calls in existence just no motivation dont give a fuck about this shit anymore  if i didnt have bills i would be bouncing so fast   freest country in the world my ass,da1nuh
10,I had to leave work 2 hours early because my chest was starting to hurt badly,when i told my boss all he said was are you here tomorrow  i said yes  and then he said let us know well ahead of time if you wont be able to make it dont go bailing out 2 hours before your shift starts  i know employers and companies dont care about your health or wellbeing but he didnt have to make it so obvious lmao what a great work culture weve created where health problems are just an inconvenience i dont get it i havent had to leave early until now and ive always given notice way ahead of time for any shifts i wont be able to cover  just ranting laying on my bed now and hoping that this pain goes away on its own because i cant afford to go to the hospital,dal3lu
11,Thought I'd finally found good work,but that really doesnt exist anymore huh been at a new job for roughly 3 months it paid well for what it was and i felt like i was getting paid fairly enough for what i was doing and i was actually satisfied about it which i thought was surprising  of course management changes just ruined all of that for me they cut my wages but claimed i would get roughly the same amount due to tips i definitely did not new manager got mad at me for not coming in this friday when i said beforehand i was never available on fridays and even emailed her when the shift came up she never answered me they ended up cutting my days too now i barely work whenever i try to talk to the manager i just get brushed off i think its time to take my leave,dagibo

13,My boss thinks it's normal and expected to work +12 hours a day and I'm pissed,i am an hourly teacher and i have already told my boss if she schedules me to teach it needs to be only two shifts a day not the whole because its too fucking tiring and im not a morning person so basically everyday i work from 130pm to 9pm and now she wants me to cover for another coworker in the mornings too  when i told her when am i gonna sleep and rest she laughed and said i teach everyday from 7 am till 9pm why cant you im so fucking pissed if i had another job lined up i wouldnt even bother going back,d8p0w4
14,Can I Convince HR to Just Freaking Lay Me Off?,i honestly dont see how anyone unless they are just a social mega star could thrive in the rotten work situation that im in   i am in a small agency and our it department is just me and two other guys  the it director and the network admin  two years ago they changed my job role and expected me to just know this network shit when my background is data analytics and software support  the admin began my new boss and this guy went to town uses his new found powers against me  he would get pissed if i asked him for help on what felt like a very simple thing to him and take it out on me by writing me up if i made one small mistake  even worse  i now have to submit an hour by hour log report showing that i am constantly busy  problem is the role has 90 downtime and they are like thats not our problem figure out on your own how to contribute  im a very shy person so getting out among the people and forging my own path is terrifying  i feel i only have one card to play  convince hr that my job isnt needed and lay me off  the anxiety over not having a clear job role plus working under this asshole boss has me constantly having panic attacks at work and calling in sick more and more  the advice to just get another job doesnt cut it  ive tried for years to switch jobs  its hard as hell to beat competition on a job interview these days,d8wo6f
15,I am becoming increasingly depressed,last time i held a long term job 1 year i felt what most everyone did i was afraid of starting somewhere new and disappointed that id lose my free time and i wasnt exactly happy but my displeasure plateaued after about three weeks however 90 days into this new job and i feel as if im slipping deeper and deeper every single day and i cant stop it every night becomes a little bit more excruciating and every morning i have to ask myself why im still bothering to wake up   im honestly not sure what to do im at a loss unfortunately i need to leave the state asap for numerous personal reasons as well as a strong dislike for it in general so i need at least another four months of steady income to make it to the marker where i can leave finally while there is a definite end goal february of 2020 im becoming increasingly concerned that im not going to make it there the ultimate idea is to hop to alaska for a year or two then finally leave the country but alaska needs to be the first step and im at the earliest of steps with barely anything in my savings im not sure i can endure another five months of this if the downward trend keeps going  i suppose this is just a rantvent post but this community is the one that dragged me from the right to the left and i feel like you all understand very well,d8ggy0
16,having a tough day. wrote this up on company time.,slices    the world is filled with beautiful things why am i here at work  there are books to read food to eat places to explore why am i here at work  there are people that need help i need help work doesnt help why am i here  why  to get money money i like nice food and cool things but i am chained to it i cant escape it  cant i just care for my plants read about cool things and be with my wife and daughter  i want to study about plants about fungi about weather about computers about statistics  i want to ride my bicycle and learn and cook and help  and yet i am here working working for a machine that will spit me out when i am no longer considered useful  working in order to enjoy a small amount of time away from work  working in the hope that one day i wont need to work that i can pursue my interests solely under time constraints and not financial ones  when will that day come will it ever come when will i be finished exchanging my life for money  this exchange is leeching strength from my body mind and soul when will it end  im a coward because five days a week i wake up and willingly trade away another slice of my life,d8n989

18,I have hope, i have hope in the young generation my generation that they will get fed up and do something about it or maybe do nothing about it  the bullshit education systems  bankers  politicians  housing crisis  minimum wages that can barely support one child you get the point they dont really have much to lose  if they can barely make ends meet do you really think they will care that much about modern conveniences like being able to stream 4k video i hope they will be able to see the vastness of the planet earth and its natural resources that can be harnessed to meet the needs of everyone in their lifetime   when will enough ever be enough  isnt it time that humanity sat back and enjoyed the fruits of their labor   does the world truly need more engineers  the major reason there was  a lot of progress in technology during the world wars is that before that  most people were happy with having a roof over their head  food to eat and lots of free time and new technology wouldnt affect their day to day lives    if the young decided not to do the grunt work of society it would simply collapse without firing a single bullet  there is no other way see hong kong protests police would refuse to fight people seeking their freedom from bullshit laws etc,d99hnn
19,The need to get a job both infuriates me and terrifies me.,maybe this post will be too venty if so it can be deleted   i recently dropped out of college after a few talks with my dad and he told me it would be better if i came home and that college wasnt doing any good for me im incredibly grateful that my dad is so kind but on the day i came back he told me about a job prospect he heard about i just brushed it off at the time but internally i felt terrified and almost shut down ive had 3 jobs before all of which were in fast food so obviously they were awful but thats given me a lasting impression and has made me absolutely terrified of any sort of job i tell him that i feel this way and he just doesnt get it he tells me that he found having a job at my age was liberating that it gave him purpose i tell him i feel the opposite way and he tries to argue with me trying to convince me i somehow dont know what im feeling i think hes doing his best but its like theres a barrier that prevents him from considering that i have a different opinion i feel trapped and scared because i have to get a job in order to achieve my dreams but i dont want to     i guess theres no real end message with this post just me getting my thoughts out there,d9aowh

39,What's the deal,i feel like i made a personal revelation about how the united states works  for a place like north korea their slave owner decided to own everything in the country and separate themselves so they can keep control  but for the united states they found that a distasteful way of owning people  the better way is to setup lots of financial traps for people to fall into  leave them uneducated then offer them a lifelong salvery debt agreement to pay for their education  the united states strategy by comparison is almost more devious because they get their own citizens to root for the enslavement of each other to push the rest of people off the cliff of stability so their is more room for themselves  we think we are suppose to be mean and financially cutthroat just to survive  we are being molded into mean little slaves that knock the legs out from under each other until finally we gladly accept our place as a lesser race to the people in chargethe banks and the rich,dbc0ct

44,I'll never forget an experience I had about 5 or 6 years ago,i was with a good friend of mine at the time and some of his friends they were all in university talking about their experience in university and how it might relate to real world workforce experience   back then i was a student too but a struggling one i was to university on and off again lacking any real motivation to see many of my classes to their conclusion my mind was awash with uncertainty that graduating and getting the opportunity to get a cushy career might not be the end all fulfilling experience that i was expected to believe  in the conversation one of the guys said this  if you think school is bad just wait until youre actually start working  everyone there seemed to dishearteningly nod their heads in agreement inferring yes that does suck but no one in the group even for a moment questioned how absurd it was to spend the huge investment of time money and effort to graduate college or university only to set yourself up with a position thats even more miserable than the one you left   the conversation quickly moved elsewhere while i sat in thought for a few moments longer realizing my fears had more validity than i thought  were all so used to the idea of the 95 work week slaving away your whole life at an incredibly dull and unrewarding job for a modest sum of money that we never question it were all so ready to unquestionably believe that this paradigm forced into us is the only meaningful and honest way to life a rewarding life  i know compared to some of the posts on here this one sounds pretty mundane but even this small experience of mine has had a big impact on my life since then ive tried to distance myself as much as i possibly can from that kind of thinking while focusing much more on understanding who i truly am and the parts of myself and my life that genuinely fulfill me even if im still a million miles away from the person i would like to be i finally feel like i know who i am and what i want out of life,d8so3e

58,I worked in the Oilfield the past few years it was a nightmare.,right after i graduated high school my dad got me a job in the oilfield i didnt know what i wanted to be when i grew up and during my high school career and my parents always implied that me going to college is a long shot since they couldnt afford it at the time so i never focused on my grades   summer of 2016 my dad got me a job as an oilfield truck driver for some company i never wanna see again 40 hours a week 24 hour call including weekends working with with people who smoked cigarettes every 15 minutes id come home smelling like cigarettes oil covered in cement dust it was the worst i hurt my back my tooth chipped because of the bad diet i had on the road burnt my arm and my left side of my torso with acid and cut the skin of my jaw open with a grinder when i was helping a welder and all this was for 1350 to 1450 an hour to top it off the although these people were nice but the constant bullying because i was soft and mild racism made it even more miserable i was not happy and was basically going insane just force laughing at jokes and pretending to listen to conversations since i couldnt ignore these people and only to go home to do it all over again  i quit that job only to go to another oil field job as a pulling unit hand this summer of 2019 16 an hour guaranteed weekends and no 24 hour call but it was way worse my first week i had heat exhaustion my body was sore and my hand joints were crippled the whole summer i had to share a motel room with my coworker bcuz we had to work 3 12 hours away from home we averaged 5060hours a weekone time we got 42 hours in 3 days  dont even get a proper lunch break and when we were done i still had to eat dinner with them and head back to the motel the weekend was never long enough to recover i had to see these people every minute of the day and i hated it  after my first year in the oilfield i decided to go to college in 2017 but even with the money i made that one year and a summer of 2018 i couldnt afford my third semester of 2018 the summer job i had this year was supposed put me back in school but after all that i was still several thousands of dollars off  i figured out that it didnt matter how hard i worked in that amount of time it wasnt enough to pay for school i cant stress enough how miserable i was and how many times ive cried this summer and the past couple years i worked with the other company seeing my savings disappear and having every check go towards to instate tuition i just didnt want to live anymore at least the way that i did then  my parents ended up owning an embroidery and weve been living in a nice area a little outside of town for about a year now they saw and understand my misery as well as my dad working in pipeline and oilfield for almost 15 years but theyre still pressuring me make something of myself currently ive been unemployed for about a month looking for a job since i couldnt go back to school but other than the debt i still hold i never felt so relieved im gonna try to look for work but im definitely getting a part time job or an easy low paying job capitalism just isnt worth killing myself for an education or anything at least the way that i had to do it   i understand ive made my mistakes during high school but seeing the uncertainty of my future along with not knowing what i wanted to be i didnt have any incentive to thrive knowing well that i was taking advanced classes and couldve been top ten percent i wanna study something i like but the suffering it took just to get there and as well as it not being enough to pay for my tuition or even my to support myself id rather take this time to act at a slower pace  ps sorry if this was long but i just wanted to be heard i hope you guys understand ,d9svis
59,“But what would you do all day?”,whenever you say you hate working and wouldnt if you didnt have to it never fails someone says this i find it incredibly sad that they couldnt possibly fill up their own time and need a boss to give them tasks   i ran into this when i was 15 and in school they called my parents and me into a meeting because i seemed depressed and obviously hated being in school my grades were fine i just obviously hated every moment being there and was always angry they wanted to get down to the reason why i explained there was no one reason and nothing they could do to help me i just hated school and that was that then my principal asked what id do all day if i didnt go to school are you fucking kidding me,dbfalo

63,Boss told us to work even harder 'for the sake of the company'. I am so FED UP.,i thought id share with you here my work story because youd understand  about a year ago i accepted job that was offered to me in a startup looked quite great at the beginning great people the boss seemed nice and it was really close to where i lived  it is turning to hell i love my coworkers and theyve became good friends and they are the only reason motivating me to go to work every morning   the boss is an absolute nightmare to work with he seems friendly but hes horrible in the workplace everything a boss shouldnt do work related hed do it slowly i started getting more and more stressed because of it  recently the startup is going through some big financial problems our salary is late almost every month yey the stress for the bills last week he told us in a general meeting that he doesnt know when this months salary will be paid we knew already dude its been going on for months and that he was asking us to work even harder to try and close some deals  hell no i havent been sleeping correctly for months and the last two weeks were a nightmare because i am trying to support my family financially so i am not doing additionnal hours not paid because were a startup everyone knows we all love to work extra i am already working the strict minimum so i can still enjoy evenings workstressfree  honestly i am on the verge of taking all of this to the court i can but i dont want to do it as it means i am taking away my coworkers salary for months   i booked a holiday in december and that helps me so much during the day just thinking about it  i just want for the company to close because that means im sure im gonna get my salary from the government for few months without even being obliged to work i live in france its normal to get this  sorry for the rant it needed to be out and i know youd understand me,db0cll

71,I actually thought my manager gave a shit,i have a pretty good relationship with my manager i go to lunch with him and a few others once a week and i thought he seemed semiinterested in my life but now i feel like he just sees me as another expendable wage slave  im essentially a one man department it and i recently had a medical issue which prevents me from driving for up to 6 months and as such will probably need to work some remote days i let my manager know about this yesterday and his first question wasnt anything like how are you feeling now or is there anything i can do to help out but simply how soon do you think you can drive to work again are you sure it will be that long his only questions were about how soon i could get back into the office and if there was some way i could convince the dmv to let me drive asap mind you more than half my work can be done from home  i felt so taken aback by it it was an awkward thing to confess to my boss and for his focus to so immediately be on my physical attendance at work felt weird the whole experience just made me reflect on other managers ive had and how i feel like none of them would have given much of a shit if i fell off a cliff or something i dunno im going to be allowed some remote work days temporarily so maybe i shouldnt complain but the whole thing just left a weird taste in my mouth,d8pcf6
72,First week at a new job and i’m already going cray,long post  im a frontend web developer with almost four years of working experience and a bachelors degree in computer science a week ago i joined a company which seemed like a good option for professional growth and a source of a pretty good income i was really enjoying my first days working there because the office is really nice has a shower massage chair lots of other cool stuff i was provided with a very powerful pc and two wide screens when i asked if they have any wired headphones they dont need that i could use to connect to my pc i only have wireless headphones that i use with my phone a guy came up to my desk a couple hours later and just gave me a box with brand new sennheiser headphones i wasnt expecting anything like this at all was ready to buy some headphones for work with my own money and thought id be lucky if they would find some old headphones they dont need that i could use i think its worth to mention that i live in russia and i guess all this stuff is pretty standard for europeans and americans but ive never worked in such good conditions before  this post is mostly oriented on people who work with something it related and can understand what im talking about ive encountered some problems during my first days here and id like to know should i blame myself for these issues and be responsible for them or its the companys fault  a little info about the company its basically a dating website which was created in 2008 had some success in the beginning but wasnt really successful overall still they have pretty large user base which is paying for being promoted in some way expecting any attention to their personas the site looks like it was never updated and it objectively sucks by all standards but the company still gets a decent income generated on this site so it continues to exist realizing that the main site really sucks they have created different startups side projects which would help them create additional income on a modern market  the main reason im telling that the company is pretty old is because many people have been working there since the beginning and i guess they are really comfortable doing the same things while getting paid  so the problems i encountered 1 the project i had to develop had a design made in adobe illustrator which was pretty strange since almost all designers use sketch nowadays or at least a photoshop ive only seen icons that were made in illustrator and in such situations i just converted them to svg and had no problems with using the icon in a project  but here i was given a huge file made in illustrator that contained designs for the whole project  ive tried several options for working with this type of file like avocode figma which make it really easy for the developer to get all the static files css rules and everything else a developer might need i have tried many options like adobe xd avocode figma zeplin but they all had some serious issues with working with my design file from crashes to wrong colors that made them unusable for the current project of course it took relatively big amount of time testing each option trying to configure it for editing ai files and looking for possible reasons of some errors i encountered while using these tools  after that i realize that the manager dont really care that ive never worked with a site design which was made entirely in illustrator and i had to do the task as fast as i can because managers only looked on the amount of tasks i made and the amount of time i spent to do them  and in my case i spent a lot of time simply trying to figure out the most comfortable way of working with ai mockup as a web developer then i decided to ask my manager about installing illustrator on my pc he gave me a slack username of an employee who is dealing with this i immediately wrote to him and asked to install illustrator asap since i cant work without illustrator on my pc he was online and i thougth itd be  rude to write many times  then i called him and waited for a pretty long time he didnt answer then i asked about the location of his office desk but he wasnt there on the next day the first thing i did is i went to his desk and finally found him i told him that i cant start working because i need adobe illustrator installed my manager is noticeably not happy about the whole situation and i need to start working as soon as possible he asked my about the managers opinion and does he think that i really need illustrator i tell him that we discussed it many times and hes perfectly fine with this did anyone come up to me for help that morning no one they started installing the program only at about 56 pm turned out that guy didnt believe me about the manager being okay with me using illustrator but still he decided to contact him directly to confirm that i really need this program and by the way we are not allowed to use cracked software so the only way i could get this program was only through contacting him because he activated the product only then i finally get illustrator installed i dont know how many hours exactly passed but i think i was waiting him and doing nothing for about 8 hours  2 second problem came up when it turned out that no one in the whole development department uses visual studio code the most popular and objectively great program which is lightning fast and is absolutely free i think that most devs use it everyone in my department was using phpstorm  i was really surprised because i was almost sure that the majority of developers uses vscode i have nothing against phpstorm its a very powerful tool but its old slow and costs some money it wasnt a problem for me because i didnt really care what other people use here i only wanted to use the tool ive been using 15 or more years and i have lots of different plugins key combos that help me write code fast and easy all developers sync their code with the remote server usually after every save command i easily found a plugin by microsoft that was able to do lots of stuff it was a plugin specifically made for remote development   after the installation i try to set the synchronization between me and the server i was given basic server info username password and personal folder but even using all the info i was given i couldnt connect to the server and the error log was pretty vague it was hard to tell if its something wrong with my client or the project serveri was trying to do everything by myself reading all the documentation but then i thought that im a frontend developer i can write some backend code or do some easy serverrelated text but its out of the scope of my professionbut then i remembered that we have a lead technician who has been working here for a long time and he knows everything about our server and it would take 1020 minutes of his time or maybe less to estable connection and synchronization on my vscode  i ask him to come up to my desk and guess what i hear when he comes to me whats that on your screen vscode remember  there are no good products that have no price also who made this thing microsoft hahaha what a piece of shit no one here uses this crap and then he walks away  im destroyed by his ignorance he really said that all open source is crap and thats a fact and his unprofessional behavior it was the first time we met he knows im a new guy here and i dont really care whats his opinion about vscode i love it ive been using it for almost couple years and its the most popular tool for writing code way more popular than phpstorm i think thats a good enough reason not to say these things theyre rude and really stupid he believes that all open source projects are crap simply because nothing good can be free  im still stuck trying to connect to the server but now i also understand that this guy probably considers my favorite code editor as pure crap and most probably he wont spend his time helping me to configure this awful piece of crap  anyway hes still the only lead technician and hes the most competent serverwise i try to forget this crazy incident and ask him for help again  i dont remember the specific questions i asked but he gave me the minimum info through slack  only after i asked him to help me crazy amount of times he finally sits by my computer and tries to make a connection he configured the connection and synchronization and spent about 15 minutes of it  on the next day the manager asks me to talk with him in a conference room  we go there and he says that im trying to blame everyone but myself when its me who is actually accountable for all the troubles i experienced he says that the lead technician is a great guy and he doubts that he declined to help me he really didnt decline but his motivation was extremely low then he says that im the only special cornflakes with an editor nobody here uses and its completely my duty to configurable the connection to the server and tech lead only has to give me the most basic server info and nothing else he doesnt owe me shit and he can decline any requests that are connected with my shitty editor i must express gratitude for his help then i say that its a bit strange that the tech lead refuses to help with the configuration simply because for him it would be very easy and will take up to 20 minutes i spent about two days configuring everything by myself not realising what half of the stuff i do does as i do not support servers and know noting about them i say that maybe it would be a good idea to ask the tech lead to configure server settings when someone new joins the team it would be easy for the both sides the manager tells me that im wrong and the tech lead shouldnt waste his time configuring some crazy editors they know nothing about and the developer is completely responsible for all configuration technicians have all the rights to ignore me  im pretty amazed by this because it seems to me that its very clear and logical to ask a tech lead to set the configuration and spend 1520 minutes rather than say that nobody owes you shit and in the end i spend days doing serverrelated things  he says that im the only reason that i didnt complete any tasks yet im the only one to blame and he doesnt care what kind of troubles i have he is only interested in two things  how fast can i generate income for the company and how much income i generate at all  it feels to me that one of us is insane and i dont know who it is maybe im really not getting the point and i should shut up and deal with my shit by myself not interrupting everyone maybe its normal to come up to the new employee and tell him that his favorite editor sucks and its so shitty that nobody else is using it here i have no desire to learn how to configure this crap  i think that the company should allow and be absolutely fine with the fact that everyone has his own preferences favorite editors and these choices should be respected a technical lead swearing at me for using the most popular editor is a complete fail and reveals many facts about the company he should read the documentation for the chosen drug also i believe that the manager have to think and count all the factors of the reality not simply saying that you still didnt generate any money for us and this means that you suck  the manager is also obsessed with deadlines and when telling me the deadline for my latest task he also casually informed me that the office works 247  in the end i ended up spending extra 56 hours at work and left the office at 1 am  and of course these extra hours i were working are completely unpaid and not listed anywhere  and they dont even consider paying me for these hours im sure that if id ask about the money they owe me for these 6 hours they would be very surprised that i even dare to ask about this and im sure i wouldnt receive anything  what should i do listen to the manager and be a good slave  or i should run from this hell  im sorry for such a long postrant  and again im from russia so excuse me if something is hard to understand,d8xoln
73,Had a job interview today,today i had a job interview for a production manager position at a medium size company i was first contacted by a headhunter that got me the interview with the company looking to hire a new person   i did my due diligence researched the company their products clients etc practiced my speech ironed my shirt and pants cut my hair polish my shoes i go there and everything seems normal nothing unusual i meet the hr person and the person i would be reporting to he asks me the typical recycled and rehearsed boring questions and i answer them promptly everything is going well until the do you have any questions for us part i asked how much time is spent on the floor and how much time is spent in the office on an average day to which the person replies 8 hrs on the floor 2 hrs in the office to which i reply so your average day here is a 10 hour shift right the person replies with a yes and saturdays are not unusual too so i professionally say well this type of position sure demands a lot of overtime which i believe is compensated accordingly right and the person replies with a no you earn a yearly salary so there is no overtime compensation   so instead of me getting a better deal compared to my current job i was actually getting probably something like 60 hours a week which at the end would be way less per hour   i stressed that if they wanted to continue the hiring process i would need a written contract stating that overtime will be compensated accordingly i shook their hands and left  this is the type of thing that makes me lose faith in work good luck to whoever takes the job and gets exploited and their soul sucked out of them,d993yu

86,I literally never want to go to work.,ive never woken up and thought wow its such a nice day i cant wait to go to work i think thats a problem considering work is what we spend most of our lives doing  i dont get how everyone can just put up with it without questioning it or wanting to die my stister goes to work at 6 in the morning and comes back at 6 in the evening how does she not want to blow her brains out thats not life  something inside of me dies whenever i go to work i havent even been there for like a month yet just the thought of work still bothers me i dont know what im going to do or how my life is gonna be but i refuse to spend my life doing something i dont enjoy for money i might die and its possible that i will but thats not going to be my life   like alan watts said its better to have a short life full of things you like doing than to have a long life spent in a miserable way,d94bqq
87,Thinking of quitting after 3 weeks in new job,rneet  thinking of quitting after 3 weeks in job had the worst day ever  ualexasissy  well its not even 3 full weeks yet  let me preface by saying i do have plenty of experience in retail jobs like this and im not looking to go back to being neet until ive worked for a good 6 months and saved several thousand dollars up  so today i was 2 minutes late to work literally 2 minutes due to abnormal traffic and my boss made an issue about it had an angry look on her face etc strike 1  then i dont actually know what my boss did all day because from where i was standing i did basically everything every task serving all customers etc  the part time girl arrived in the afternoon in a bad mood and was basically rude to me the whole time i had to recieve a delivery and they interrupted me about 10x to do other tasks for them they seemed to spend the afternoon chatting and whispering  i literally did not stop all day i was doing tasks or serving every second of the day non stop  come end of day it was 5 to and the part timer was fiddling on the computer so i said its time to close the whole close down process takes forever as they have a million redundant processes and systems and i had to write so many notes because you need to write a note if you sneeze in this store got out at 20 past me being 2 minutes late is unacceptable but leaving 20 minutes late is fine  i missed the 520 bus and had to wait 45 minutes for the next one while the part timer has a car so isnt as big an issue leaving later  like i can haul myself into work just fine but i just felt so disrespected today not happy at all this is just a retail job at tge end of the day it pays the same as other retail jobs ive done which are nowhere near as stressful  also keep in mind im on the good old 90 day trial which means they can end my employment on 2 weeks notice at any time now because its not long until xmas i doubt they would so that but i feel far from guarenteed in my position  maybe im overreacting but i just dont think all of this is worth it im not happy at all,d8jeit

99,So I talked to a life coach...,i had a free hourlong consult with a life coach last night and thought id share the main takeaway she gave me about my frustrating job situation i have been talking about going solo as a consultant with what i do but for other life reasons am committed to my current job for at least another year expensive benefits and guaranteed income i need for a time   her advice to me was that i needed to understand that my job isnt negative situations are neutral and its what we think about them and how we react to them that is positive or negative so her suggestion was to work on rewiring my thought patterns so that my feelings about my job were more neutral than negative and then devote that emotional energy id be saving on building my own business and solidifying my skills so i could do the healthy thing and eventually break free of this cycle  this is not a new concept to me and is rooted in cognitive behavioral theory i have gone through periods where i have actively tried to find gratitude for my job and focus on the positives just to make my time more bearable it always lasts a week or two until my company does yet another asinine or offensive thing and then all the negativity comes crashing back in she says she knows the tools to help me make that a lasting change but honestly at her going rate i just cant afford to take a chance on whether that is true or not and also it doesnt feel right for me to pretend the emperor is fully dressed when he has no clothes nothing changes for the better if everyone numbs themselves to reality but otoh nothing really ever changes in corporate america so maybe thats just a nonstarter  so if anyone has any suggestions about how to more pleasantly bide your time somewhere or build a side gig that you want to turn into your only gig id love to hear them book recommendations especially i gotta get off the hamster wheel of mediocrity that is corporate life,d8mjbx

118,Applied for disability the other day,so the long and the short of it is i was in the workforce for about 10 years during that time i managed to develop an issue with drink severe anxiety and major depression i kept telling myself to man up and keep pushing on despite the abusive shitty work environment and i kept going back to due to golden handcuffsgood pay free benefits i kept telling myself i was the problem and i just needed to get better constantly pushing while society and everything around me kept pushing the idea of harder faster better stronger  when i moved out of my parents house i used to be able to talk to anyone had hundreds of aquaintances many friends many ambitions the whole lot by the time i realized i had developed all these problems i had lost all the friends i made by my own doing thanks to putting work and advancement first and this idea i had in my mind about being better thanks largely in part to my parents and upbringing   a few years ago i decided to move back to my parents but by that point i was completely far gone i was struggling with total sobriety replaced alcohol with weed the anti depressants i was taking in my opinion made me worse and overall completely lost my control over life i sold my condo my cars and just about everything i had and was still left over with about 20k in debt at this point the stress was crushing my parents and brother kept telling me the only way to get better is to get a job and i was coming completely undone because i had been ran so ragged trying to make it and get better   thats when i had a total mental break i was smoking weed daily at that point cut my anti depressant cold turkey and out of the blue one day i started believing and doing some crazy shit without getting into too much detail i ended up arrested for felony trespassing because i went into someones truck thinking it was my own after being released from jail i had a couple of nice stays in the mental hospital which only made things worse and thats when i got diagnosed as bipolar   it wasnt until this point that my parents realized i needed help and were finally willing to somewhat let me back in nowadays im almost 30 on probation to get the felony off my record back on anti depressants and now have a mood stabilizer added to the mix i have no more emotion other than the occasional anger no more ambition to do anything no more willingness to find a partner and after lurking reddit and seeing the state of the working world its clear things are only getting worse  my family and my psychiatrist are convinced im bipolar and the only treatment is these meds after my history theres no way in hell i think id be able to find another conventional career and i have no where else to go so im claiming bankruptcy for the 20k im already on medicaid and now hopefully i will be granted disability i dont have the power to stand up for myself anymore and ive completely been backed into a corner   nowadays life aint so bad ive got a roof bed and food i play video games drink coffee  enjoy my last vicecigarettes and ride my motorcycle daily as my therapy i still have dark thoughts most days and what i see online mostly just reinforces them but i get by i stay sober2years now and dont fear any of the stuff i used to that gave me anxiety bad credit dont care cant afford a house on a single income anyway dont care about cars anymore like i used to health insurance dont care hoping to get cancer by 40 work history and how good i look on paper i blew that up with any digging into my medical history i will never get a job partner had plenty of those never panned out wont get one with my current status and the one goodbad thing the meds do is kill my sex drive   so i guess the point of this post is this if you feel you need to keep pushing deep down you cant stand life the way youre living it dont do what i did and damage yourself beyond repair get out while you can if you can and dont ignore your inner voice had i done that i dont think i would be where i am today they sell you this idea that something is wrong with you and you are imbalanced when in reality if there truly is an imbalance its because of the way we are living not because there is something physicallymentally wrong with us also be careful who you talk to and what you say in my desperation i tried to look to doctors and police for help and that only sunk me deeper both spiritually and financially be careful who you trust   also i felt like putting these thoughts out there just for someone else to see as i spend most days in solitude and i am not in a position to speak to my family without them jamming their opinions and advice down my throat right now i am just doing what i need to in order to have my basic needs met because thats all i can do   i know ill never be who i used to be thanks to the wonderful experiences i had and theres tons more i could go on about but im hoping someone out there can read this and it will be a catalyst for some self preserving action dont let your the mold they want you to fill destroy you like it did me thanks for reading,dbksea
119,Employers ask about references to make sure you remain a slave,sorry for my poor english im french one of my friends lives in the us and  basically he told me that when youre looking for a job your future employer usually asks for 23 references from past employment i was shocked is it the gestapo what if your manager hated you i guess you guys need to be very submissive to make sure that you get good references in case you want to quit what a joke of a system past employers can say whatever the hell they want   we dont have that requirement in the french system employers dont ask any references they just ask for a copy of your diplomas to make sure that youre qualified although were still wage slaves with a high unemployment rate at least we can tell our employers to go f themselves when we quit thats what i did 3 years ago it was so funny i also locked up my manager in her office at lunch time and threw the keys in the garbage bin she was so abusive with her staff she got what she deserved she tried to involve the police they couldnt care less since there was no physical damages lol  my current employer doesnt know about it and will never know,dbj4y9

126,The Caste System,what do yall think about the caste system  the idea is most wellknown from its indian variation but it is attested to in the following sources   hinduism mentioned above  iran zoroastrian myths about jamid the avesta and it is an idea attributed to some sasanian kings  plato  medieval arabjewish philosophy alfarabi avicenna and maimonides but particularly alfarabi and maimonides  islam see hierarchy and egalitarianism in islamic thought by louise marlow  traditionalism particularly evola but gunon schuon and coomaraswamy all paid lipservice to it  it seems pretty universal one striking thing about medieval mythology particularly its european variant is the consistency of ideas across cultures for example the french the english and the irish all possess similar themes when it comes to their knightly or aristocratic mythologies  good resources on indian caste system dras in ancient india by ram sharan sharma and caste and religion in ancient india by jayantanuja bandyopadhyaya  it seems like there was a natural tension between those predisposed to and capable of nothing more than productive labor often called dras and the ruling class characterized by chivalry on the one hand the warrior or ascetic knowledge the priest or sometimes both combined  our modern labor system is tellingly not the product of any one individual or group of people engineering it it seems like the world at large simply lazily allowed the situation to progress this far without anyone trying to exercise any agency to stop it if you think about it a large group of people letting whatever happens happen is actually the very definition of chaos  i guess my question is how do we reinstate the caste system a system characterized by such a hierarchical dimension and subsequent confinement of individuals to their natures and roles is what alfarabi called the virtuous city see antony blacks the history of islamic political thought  without controlling the masses by arbitrarily allowing people to accumulate wealth and start businesses especially people who are not qualified for leadership or commerce ie the vaiya without controlling women separate topic but somewhat related by letting who myatt called the magian and homo hubris or who some people call normies completely dominate the cultural sphere and its accompanying confused philosophy by allowing democracy to exist as a form of government by relegating all questions to indeterminacy via postmodernism all we do is allow chaos to rule  certain people have certain natures and temperaments other people have certain exaltations and still others have deficiencies these realities cannot be erased as their variancy is natural and therefore part of nature to ignore them is to abolish what is natural and to usher in what is unnatural not everyone is an employee anddra by nature but our society forcefits people into that role  religion should inform public life people should not drink or have extramarital sex but secularism and scientism undermine the ability of religion to control people the very fact that people vocally disagree about so many cultural and social issues already means that someone somewhere is wrong people are not unified in their beliefs and aims there is therefore conflict  how do we once again institute these traditional laws into society in a practical and forceful manner  how do we arrest the creeping tide of time and prevent impersonal slavery wanton lust shallow philosophy pseudo spirituality characterized perforce by western buddhism abject lust  and general ignorance from wreaking havoc on the world  corrupt regimes in africa commit genocide and starve people young men in america voluntarily shoot strangers and casual acquaintances and then themselves women as a political and cultural monolith have more power than ever before and contraception normalized extramarital sex dating hookups instagram and so on and the push for abortion only seek to enforce this men are now more variegated more atheistic humanistic skeptical and intellectually lazy than ever before people crave wealth or they crave power or they crave fame and subject to rulership by their desires the whole of society is then ruled by people ruled by impersonal forces this manifests as an impersonal sense of slavery subjecting everyone unnecessarily to its nondiscriminative tide  how do we stop this  armed rebellion  quitting work en masse  rhetoric  thinking through history i am reminded that there are very few cases of things changing for the better without forceful and sudden revolution in fact history is very bloody the world at the moment incomplete cannot be without conflict therefore the apparent lack of conflict in certain sectors of the world is just that an appearance  wasnt the usa founded on a revolution when has anything ever changed for the better without forceful and sudden revolution  or is there another way  i feel that rhetoric will only be judoed by the collective ego of most people changing the status quo is difficult without changing the status quo  let me know your thoughts  i know and care very little about any kind of political philosophy from the time of the renaissance or the enlightenment my concern is mainly reinstating the caste system from the first principles put forth by thinkers like alfarabi and maimonides and secondarily plato i do recognize that the entire system was encapsulated and manifested within the summary epic the mahbhrata and subsequently elucidated in the puras

135,Has the veil been lifted? Or am I just paranoid?,after working in retail it seems like ive seen the behind the scenes whats behind the curtain and how workers feel i almost feel like everyone i see in any store is faking their enthusiasm which is horrible to think about and is why companies ask people to act cheery but if its not real then it breaks the illusion i dont like thinking that people are acting just for my sake i see youtube videos on the homepage about people going and doing crazy stuff and in concept it sounds fun but from a workers point of view it sounds really annoying but theyre probably thinking this dude is making a big deal out of this i know there are people out there who really do enjoy their jobs but regular stuff especially retail and probably the food industry just seems to suck as a whole   its not like i think people need to be genuinely happy at work quite the opposite they should be able to show their real emotions,d6m02w

143,forcing fake happiness on employees (especially in non client/customer oriented jobs),why cant employers be normal be realistic why dont they understand that most people wont love their jobs that most people work in these jobs to pay bills why cant they accept that   why do they have to force you to be fake happy all the damn time why do i have to pretend that yes i love to be treated like shit by customers or that yes i love to slave away in whatever jobs   they must know we are all lying through our teeth during interviews or during work is this about if we can convince them with this fake happiness then we will also convince clients and customers but what about jobs that dont require direct contact with clientscustomers not even on the phone   even though i can see why one reason for forcing fake happiness on employees could work in a customer client oriented job there are other jobs that are not like that and therefore this forced happiness is nonsense,d5y78s

151,This past year I realized I'm just a cog in the machine.,hi yall im glad i found this subreddit  up until this year i didnt mind working a 40 hour work week i was grateful to have a job in my field mental health im also in school studying to be a counselor its been my dream to help people  then i hit the fieldwork portion i knew it was going to be hard this past spring i had practicum first i had to find a site that even did evenings and weekends in my search i realized that most places werent catered to the full time working adult   no sorry we dont do evenings and weekends   i am one of the few people in my cohort who still works and who works full time i was surprised to learn how many of peers were able to get by on part time work or not working at all   they relied on family or are married so have a spouse to financially depend on i have no family in the state and am not married so i pay rent and other expenses on my own admittedly i became jealous of my peers who discussed not working and being able to dedicate their time to fieldwork i got surprised looks when i disclosed i was still working full time on top of fieldwork i feel i am in the minority   so began the long days go work an 8 hour day starting at 7 am 9 if you include my break get off work go to my site and do that until 78 at night  mix in classes and homework and i soon began to feel myself breaking down  i enjoyed my professor who taught my practicum course but at the end she gave me feedback about how i seemed not to take much risk and was tired due to working still   its not like i have a choice i have been told well take out some loans to live on i already have so much in student loan debt why would i want to take out more loans i refuse plus i need health insurance and my company has the best health insurance ive ever had plans from the health care marketplace are basically unusable with high deductibles my current health insurance doesnt even have a deductible   i made it through practicum 100 hours of fieldwork now im in the middle of internship 600 fieldwork hours i need by next may to graduate  before i started internship i talked to my job about flexing my schedule so i wouldnt be so overwhelmed i was worried about my mental health working 5060 weeks with only one day off a week   i was denied told by a supervisor they couldnt change my schedule because of what my job entails i then began to look for other jobs more accommodating but nothing came out of it i even applied internally within the company and got rejected from every position its not that im a bad work quite the opposite ive kept the program together when my coworker at the time went out on medical leave for 3 months i was the only staff person there my company even refused to hire a temp to help me   imagine being with 10 clients 5 hours a day i couldnt take breaks because i have no one to relieve me and i was expected to be there  but i did it so imagine my feeling of betrayal being told that after all ive done they couldnt work with my schedule and its not exclusively a company thing as i know a couple of other people in my company who are also in masters programs doing internships and who were allowed a flexed schedule  i was pissed  so i knew i had no choice but to work 50 weeks getting off of work to go to my internship and then going in on saturdays not getting off until 8 pm or later so in a blink of an eye heres sunday i feel like i didnt even have time to relax or if i start to its sunday night then i do it all over again  then i think about the fact its unpaid its hard to find a paid internship for a counselor and the fact im sinking all these hours to not be paid bothers me i enjoy my internship and my clients but after a 13 hour day i feel like i need something to make up for it the money doesnt go to me but my supervisor  but it really hit me in june that im just a worker  in june i was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis   fuck me right  this changed a lot as soon as i told my job about what was happening i felt how i was viewed changed  i live in america so we have the american disability act there are rights that should protect me from being let go based on my condition  stress management is really pushed in having multiple sclerosis too much stress could cause a flare up with this in mind i decided to bring up the flexed scheduling again because i thought it may be taken more seriously in american physical health always seems to matter more than mental health unfortunately  but i got told i may have to find a new position instead   after all my work and dedication it didnt matter its not like i cant do any parts of my job i did before im fortunate enough to not have symptoms  thats when i knew  i was just a worker  i could be replaced  i got my fmla paperwork underway to protect myself in case i needed time off for my health   in the midst of this i was told that client care comes first and that the company is the one paying for my health insurance ltwhich is paying for my treatmentgt pretty much i still needed to be at work no matter what  i cried for days knowing this is my new reality fear of discrimination from future employers knowing that i am a slave to work because i need health insurance to pay for my treatment so i can prevent my ms from becoming worse  people in the ms subreddit talk about being fatigued and struggling to work but doing so to have that health insurance so they can keep going what a fucked society we live in  so here i am trucking along with my 14 hour days with my chronic illness  i wish i was as lucky as my peers who dont have to work if i even had one extra day off that would do wonders  i know the internship part is temporary i have until may next year but the ms is not thats something thats going to impact my job security the rest of my life  i eventually do want my own private practice to be my own boss and set my own schedule sounds amazing the only con is the health insurance  butt after this job i dont plan on disclosing my ms unless my condition deteriorates i dont want that risk i realize companies dont care they want you fit young and healthy i realize now the struggle of people with chronic illness in the workforce its bullshit   until i have my own business im just a cog in the machine,d7v3sa

233,"This has been the best time of my life, and I don't want it to end.",all my life i have always had so much to do and so many places to be i was an extreme overachiever in high school and graduated as valedictorian but i still used to fake sick two or three times a month because i felt like i just couldnt take another day i graduated from a top college with a 38 gpa i got a scholarship and financial aid and faced zero debt but i still broke down crying from anxiety at least once a week every paper i had to write and every test i had to study for was torture i just kept thinking that if i just pushed past that hump it would end but it never seemed to end even summer vacation was ruined because not doing anything with my summers would look bad on my resume or grad school application  i panicked in my final semester because i was sure it would be impossible for me to get a job nevertheless i managed to snag a cushy wellpaying office job right out of school we had a fully stocked office fridge they brought in panera on monday mornings we had pizza parties and theme weeks and played video games during lunch i was almost never required to stay past normal hours the office was a five minute commute that didnt even require me to take the freeway it was supposed to be over that was supposed to be the goal but it never ends instead i went in five days a week for two years staring at a screen pouring my prime hours of my prime years into shit i could not care less about i would sit in front of my computer for hours procrastinating constantly looking over my shoulder hoping nobody would notice i wasnt working wracked with guilt i made all my deadlines but i constantly felt like a fraud because so much more of my effort went into just getting through the day i took up smoking just to get out of the building i went into the lounge and cried into the throw pillows the hours between leaving the office and bedtime everything i did was eclipsed by the knowledge that i had to do it all over again the next day  so i played it smart i lived with my parents put away almost all of my income and amassed a nest egg that most of my friends could only dream of i was a millennial with a net worth that was supposed to be it the goal the end but every day felt like walking through honey or tar even though i was making money i was also wasting money i was spending a lot on food because i was too tired to cook and i felt like i would go crazy if i didnt get out of the office at lunch i was spending on a gym membership because i was too tired to go hiking regularly i was spending money on vacations because i needed escape and my whole hometown felt like a prison it never ends  after three years i knew i couldnt do it any more i had saved money and there was no point if i didnt use it to escape so i moved to a rural area and took my dream job at a nonprofit taking care of rescue animals it was lowpaying but the area was much more affordable and i was doing what i wanted to do despite the low pay i lived frugally enough to save a modest amount without even touching my prior savings for a while it was great then the bureaucrats struck with budget cutting shortstaffing and a widening range of duties we were being asked to do more every day without any increase in pay we were treated by management with a disrespect that bordered on disdain the animals suffered we suffered eventually a little over two years after i started i threw in the towel that was two months ago  i decided to take a real break although i have been making small moves toward becoming a freelancer i have largely been taking it easy i have been spending time with my pets reading in my hammock gardening playing the guitar doing art going hiking cooking baking housework minor repairs that i have been meaning to do for ages and doing all manner of other things that require little money or even leaving my neighborhood i eat fresh baked bread every morning with herbs i grew myself i finally cleared out my garage so i can use it as an art space i dont feel the need to run off to japan or germany or any of the other places i used to vacation because i needed to be as far away as possible from my job for a few weeks i am probably the happiest i have ever been in my life at least since i was a little kid  but the future keeps pressing on me i have enough savings that i could pull this life off for a while  a year at least probably a good amount more if i really keep my expenses low my rent here is super reasonable and even if i am in the middle of nowhere i dont feel the need to escape as much as i used to what used to be the prison i retired to to cry in between stretches of wage slavery is now my little modest corner of heaven but i keep worrying about how long it can go on im haunted by the thought of eventually running out of money and having to go back to the rat race ive been looking into wwoofing homesteading joining a commune of some kind i am not afraid of hard work and i would be willing to work much harder even than i have in the past if i were not so alienated from my labor and the beneficiaries of it after years of living like sisyphus always trying to pretend the boulder wont come rolling back down on me i finally know what i want out of life i am finally learning that there is nothing wrong with it and nothing to be ashamed of now i just have to pursue it i cant let up i cant chicken out i cant ever go back there is no way i can go back now that i know what im missing,d62wyf

267,I've only worked one day at my new job and I'm already miserable (vent/seeking advice),i was fired from my last job at a jewelry store about 3 months ago the week of my birthday for being too awkward and i was honestly quite devastated as i really liked working there i thought id get really depressed and suicidal after a couple of weeks of job huntingunemployment like i usually do but these past few months have turned out to be some of the best in my life ive been learning about homesteading and gardening and making plans with my boyfriend to get a small house and large plot of land so that we can eventually live off the land weve managed to grow cucumbers green onions potatoes garlic and even an eggplant on our apartments like porch and that filled me with a different kind of joy and hope like maybe i could really get this going and spend the rest of my life gardening for a living i was the happiest ive ever been in my life i think  i finally managed to find a job which i was somewhat excited about because we could finally start saving money for a home my first day was yesterday and even though it went smoothly and i like my coworkers i cant help but feel nauseated at what im doing im working for a business founded by a certain uncle sam and i hate myself for it i cried for the first time in a long time yesterday night and today i feel like i cant bring myself to even get out of bed its like several years of progress with my depression were reversed in an instant   i suppose what i want to know is if anyone has any tips for staying positivenot horribly depressed while working so that my boyfriend and i can actually achieve something that we want in life,d393sd

286,Work Sets You Free,how many people do you think would agree with that statement without knowing its origin i imagine a lot  its no coincidence to me though that this phrase was the mantra presented at the entrance of nazi concentration camps while what we go through day to day are in no way on the same level as the horrors faced in those camps i think the connection is pretty evident  slaves toiling away for their masters in a desperate bid for survival all while arbeit macht frei hangs over their head   just like in our society where we are expected to dedicate our lives to labor and careers we live in a culture that clearly believes in that phrase with leaders and masters who would pretentiously spout it every time one of their slaves complain  i dont know what to completely make of it but its  always been ironic to me that this phrase was at the entrance of many concentration camps and it is one that many people would buy into its a sick allegory come to life,d1v7mj

316,"Today I met the person who replaced me, and I encouraged her to quit",im an it major i worked two years in this company until last july with a special kind of contract mixing school and work they paid me minimum wage although i already had it school diplomas so it was very advantageous for them  when my contact got close to its end they told me they were very happy with my work and they wanted to hire me again they asked how much i wanted and i asked for 40k which is the really lowend wage given my level of education they said they were going to think about it and one day i heard them on the phone with my school asking for a new person to hire instead of me they didnt warn me before  so i dont work for them anymore and currently enjoy my free time for the first time of my life months later a few days ago i received a mail from the girl who replaced me and we met today around a drink to discuss her work conditions  apparently my employer said that things were not good with me because i left work too soon every day despite the fact he was supposedly very happy with me i always stood my ground and respected the hour rate specified in the agreement we both signed ie 35 hours per week after all they never went beyond the salary rate specified in the agreement we both signed  minimum wage why should i have gone above and beyond that for free   so this poor girl was very desperate she is working unpaid overtime every day and regularly works 50 hoursweek for 1261month she said that she didnt dare asking them to work less i said dont ask just leave when you have done your 7 hours its legal  and if its really urgent they are able to pay you i was paid 900 for a project which earned 12k to my company and for a small javascript work which kept me occupied for 12 hours they billed 1000 to the client thats insane  they play the friendly card with her so she feels guilty leaving early i told her it was clearly manipulation  on the top of it she barely does any itrelated work so she isnt learning anything like shes supposed to and she has a workrelated project to show to the school to validate her diploma so i strongly encouraged her to quit and she was receptive i hope shell have the guts to do so,d4bo37

318,"We do the work, the business gets the reward",so the hotel i work the front desk at was sold out last night weddings hockey concerts and an anime convention had most hotels in the area sold out most of the guest services reps at my hotel are working well over the number of hours theyre scheduled for trying to handle the logistics of juggling everything my boss told us before he left at noon 3 hours before checkin that if we finish the night with 93 occupancy we get a reward  by the end of the night were at 100 occupancy all rooms are sold all the guests and their groups are set aside in their own blocks and were making bank off of alcohol sales after working 3 hours alone for the first time since i started this job i ask one of the people serving food at the wedding when well see our reward for not only selling out but also goodbye above and beyond and functioning properly without any managers or supervisors on site their response oh the gm just gets a boost to the marketing budget for the next month  so we all work our asses off making sure everything is running smoothly and in return we get the possibility to do it all again if that marketing money leads us to sell out again my response to the wedding server was goddamn fucking capitalism to which they responded thats just the start of societys problems at least theres some class consciousness in my workplace  when i talked with my boomer dad on the phone after work and told him about this and how it was total bs that we dont see proper return for our work he said maybe if you keep selling out and working hard youll get a pay raise in the future gotta love the innocent view of capitalism boomers have   anyway thats the end of my rant if anyone wants to know how to make work as easy as possible on hotel staff ask down below,d47rni

329,Don't expect loyalty from your staff,today a senior staff at work walked over to me and told me that he had heard about my resignation   he then asked me about the reason and assumed that i got a new offer i told him no and explained that i needed a break to prepare for my studies and grad school application bla bla bla i feel so pathetic to have to come up with excuses when the reality is that the job is a deadend position and i feel burnt out from the workload so much so that i would rather save my mental health by resigning before i land a new position  he commented put it simply you just dont want to work here anymore maybe there is a cultural barrier between us majority of the people i work with are foreigners but i was very annoyed by his comment its as if he wanted to embarrass me by pointing out the fact even after i tried to be polite and professional in my last month at work   what do you expect you think i would slave away for 10 more years here given that low amount of pay and a lack of health insurance you gotta be kidding me of course he would perceive things differently because he recently got promoted and he got all the nice stuff  i am fucking done with this job and could not wait for the day when i walk out i thought i would regret this decision but a week after giving my notice i still think that i made the right choice that is a really good feeling,d38vwh
330,From Full Time to Part Time for Sanity’s Sake,today i voluntarily cut my full time job to part time because i have been dreading going to the point of making myself physically sick every morning im a medical assistant for a private doctor and my hours monday through friday are 86 i have a decently long break that could allow me to get errands done in but find myself too tired and taking naps instead the job itself isnt exhausting its the length of my day that is combined with a micromanaging bossbut we wont go there   now im going to do mf 26pm shifts with a few extra morning hours on mon amp fris to be there during the busiest hours its possibly temporary contingent on the doctors staffing needs and if he finds someone who wants to take the position full time but i feel a weight lifted   i know its not plausible right now for me to not have some sort of work to pay bills but being part time gives me some freedom to explore other options for me my husband and i talked about me doing several part time jobs i already have a side job working at a church so this isnt too out there for me to keep me from going crazy the way i do with jobs after the first few months of starting i just get worn out on the monotony and its not like i have benefits now working full time so nothing will change there   thanks for letting me get this all out there you guys i didnt realize how many others feel as trapped as i do with the slave wage system in place until i started lurking here a few weeks ago   if anyone has elected themselves to do several part time jobs vs a traditional schedule please tell me about your experience with it id love to hear,d3afpf

357,I think I'm going to get fired for crying at work. Boss said it looks like I'm on opiates.,first ive done opiates in my life only when i was overseas getting surgery as they are intended ive never once abused opiates let alone take them and enter a workplace     i told him id bring in a drug test that moment or that we could go to the police station and take a drug test because i am not doing opiates what happened is i was crying in the stock room for a moment when no one else was there and he said on the camera it looked like i was nodding off in reality i was crying about a friend who passed     he asked me which coworkers ive been hanging with outside work and i didnt want to tell him at first because i felt it would be invading the privacy of those other coworkers maybe he has suspicions that they do opiates but i cracked and told them all their names because i felt i was being fired if i didnt he told me im being evasive and avoiding the truth and that i look like im on opiates right now i look just like i looked every other day working there i told him the truth is i cried for a few minutes in the vault  and that i asked my superior if i could go to my car and make a phone call our pockets are sown shut for a moment as my 10 minute break and she said it was okay these are my apparent transgressions he sent me home and said the last 15 minutes of our conversation are really not looking good for you     im supposed to come back thursday but i was scheduled today tomorrow and wednesday i think theyre just gonna ask for my company shirts back and fire me damn sucks making 14 dollars an hour and being treated like such shit when your superiors do this shit and pull up in new g wagons but hey thats life right,d1y3rz

362,"I know it’s not an end-all solution, but I highly recommend you guys learn a service trade.",no not learn a trade as in become a machinist or welder or some shit working overtime every day in a shithole warehouse i mean a service where you work on your own terms and your labor is what youre paid for   my uncle hangs drapes for a living and sometimes brings me along and pays me for it hes been doing it since 1975 and although hes pretty damn broke now hes had a few addictions two grown children a wife a big house general spending  from what ive seen its good money   the only thing keeping me sane right now is that he said i can take over once he retires in a few years hes like 66 now sometimes he has to deal with bullshit like his contracts the middleman between the designer and installerhim who go to the house and measure windows and order the blindsdrapes not answering his phone calls etc  but the work he does do is high paying for the amount of hours hes putting in  from what ive gathered his rates are a 75 flat fee and 15 per blinddrape 5 to remove an old blinddrape  so there was a day where we worked about 7 hours in a nursing home a relatively long day for him and did 17 blinds  i went ahead of him and removed the old blinds and he put the new ones up now that i do the math he must have made 415 that day    now i will say it is inconsistent work for him at least as he seems to spend no time putting flyers in peoples doors which i would do but i can totally imagine this being a tolerable way to make a living  for me unless god forbid it doesnt happen i mean  sometimes he works two hours and makes over 100   i wish you all luck in whatever way you make a living and hope its not the hell that most people endure,d1zqmd

367,A constant struggle,i am a 26 male currently living with my father i have multiple anxiety disorders ocd social anxiety anyways i dropped out of college because it was a little bit too sociopathic for me to handle so i started working at dominos as a driver because those capitalist pigs force you to suffer one way or the other recently i quit dominos because of multiple reasons one i get no benefits no lunch breaks no car insurance health insurance vacation days fucking nothing we were also severely understaffed which lead to me often having to hand people 2 hour old food which was humiliating and demoralizing   the manager was also a childish egomaniac just some examples i was discussing my schedule with him one day and he says in the midst of the conversation ultimately i decide when and how much you work per week or telling me to fuck off when i made a lighthearted joke he is also delusional to attempt to solve the understaffed store problem he offered fucking 40 dollar gift cards to people as a reward for getting people to join the store they also had to be working for 3 months straight and they could not be previous employees i simply told him this would not work and that the owners of the store should just pay their employees more and offer benefits instead of paying the bare minimum to attract more people to come work with us he then goes to list off cowardly right wing talking points as to why we should not be getting paid more such as if everyone got paid more everything would be more expensive and people should just work harder  he was also lazy i would often come in to help open the store this included prepping the food which took a long time as i was also a driver and had to take deliveries i worked at this store before and all the other prior managers either did the prep on their own or we did it together this guy was different he would just sit in the office on his phone not helping at all while i had to do all of it of course i could not finish it all most of the time and had to spend an extra hour or two after my shift was over to finish all of it the temperature in the store was pretty much at a constant 8590 degree temperature which only added to the emotional tension there was also little things like this  httpswwwredditcomraboringdystopiacomments9chmwhpleasedonotfeedtheemployeeshttpswwwredditcomraboringdystopiacomments9chmwhpleasedonotfeedtheemployees  which is in every store it only added to the dehumanizing nature of this corporate shit hole   so i quit and now i am enjoying freedom temporarily but i just feel like all of this is just a constant struggle for me i just cant fit in and accept the status quo i just fucking cant there is a part of me that refuses to let capitalist pigs imprison my existence and it makes surviving in this world all the more difficult i do things to help me though like meditating for and hour to 90 minutes every day tripping on high doses of lsd and mushrooms lucid dreaming audio books with walks in nature classic wow hanging out with my hippie friend etc i have a lot that i am interested in that makes me feel fulfilled but a millionairebillionaire cant profit off of it so im unable to devote my time to these things obviously i am going to have to do something eventually but i dont know what yet i am good with computers maybe ill learn to program or edit videos or something idk lol   anyways sorry for the long post i just feel like i need some external validation from my fellow leftists thank you for reading ,d2s3cr

I can’t believe I forgot how it felt.,last month when i was in the city a friend of mine who i hadnt seen in months talked me into trying one of those new electric scooter and it was neat real neat i realize that the pressure from school work and societal expectations drained me of almost all joy im an english tutor and for quite some time my life was just work food alcohola lot and sleep in my free time id occasionally play some pc games or watch a show but thats not enough i havent been living ive been in unlife stuck in a catch22 of wanting to become better buy not having the time and resources to do so in this decade that has passed there is so much i would have liked to do im nearly 30 now and ive been utterly miserable my entire life a ride on an electric scooter of all things made me remember what fun is just for a small moment dont let work become your whole life unless you really want it to fight it ive never been in love with someone or have had a healthy group of friends i am almost completely alone people arent meant to live like this take care of yourself,d1s6ca

388,Why are so many people content with the 40 hour work week?,i just found this subreddit and im so happy to have come across a place that shares my feelings about work since graduating high school ive worked minimum wage jobs because i had no interest in spending any more time in school even with a degree i would still end up being somewhere i dont want to be for 40hrs a week so whats the point just to make more money theres no guarantee even if i do go back to school   ive left multiple jobs because i couldnt handle the full time schedule of 58s five eight hour days i live at home and my parents expect me to either work or be in school full time and either way i suffer along with not having enough free time when im working i also cant get over the feeling of my life vanishing in front of me as i work my ass off its like im trapped with no option but to tread water and try not to drown in my own thoughts  whats even more baffling is it seems like everyone is completely fine with how things are almost no one is proposing a shorter work week or even talking about the value of time outside work everyone i know criticizes me for my issues with the standard work week  its like capitalism has created a society that believes work comes above all else in the end whats the point,d1zx3f

394,About to lose a job offer because previous employers aren’t responding to reference requests...,im not even trying to gain personal references here all they need are standard references to confirm what ive been doing for the past three years after dropping out of uni all ive done is shortterm work so trying to gain references from the university itself along with the employers i had afterwards is proving to be very difficult   its honestly ridiculous and the first time ive been asked to do this usually they just want one academicemployment reference and a personal one   i requested a proof of student status from the university which was meant to arrive via email within 5 working days its been well over a week now ive now requested it via post   i called hr for one of retailers i worked for three different stores over the past 3 years but was unable to request a generic reference for 2 out of the 3 times due to not knowing the previous employee numbers  previous boss for another employer no longer works at the company anymore and ive been unsuccessful in contacting hr to gain a reference   the only reference ive been able to gain so far is for another retailer that has an automated online system which generates a generic reference once you provide your name and national insurance number didnt even need an employee number   i dont even think i want this fucking job anymore its for a stupid lowpaying apprenticeship which probably isnt even worth all this stress i rejected an offer for a higher paying retail job for this i wouldve been working there for the past two weeks had i accepted and i really need the money  i thought the apprenticeship would be a good opportunity to do some academic work again whilst earning money and would look great on my personal statement when i go back to university in the future its in business administration which sounds about as stimulating as watching paint dryplus i hate office work and how stagnant it can feelbut it involves liaising with hospital workers occupational therapists and nurses which i guess loosely relates to my future plans to work in healthcare   im broke af and have debts to pay so i applied for a couple retailers last week two i previously worked for and have have managed to secure an interview for both again both of which pay much more than the apprenticeship   i know the apprenticeship is a decent opportunity but fuck im tired of struggling i need money for an adhd assessment after which id like to have driving lessons again pay off my debts raise my first year tuition fee for uni save for a future holiday etc im kinda tired of retail but the department stores ive applied for do pay more and id have the option to do overtime to make more money in a shorter amount of time   they ideally want me to start the apprenticeship on 16th but i highly doubt im gonna gain any more references than what i have right now they wont take me on unless they gain all my employment history from the past three years so looks like that offers down the drain  sorry for the rant guys just needed to blow some steam,d1a9k7

396,Stupid manager,ive talked about my manager to my parents and they say shes a bad manager she criticises me but it seems more like an attack on me personally a month ago i had to tell her 4 times that i was going on holiday before she changed my shifts cause she kept forgetting she puts me on at night on my own to close up the shop and its my first job and ive been there a month im worried that some man could attack or rape me cause im a young woman and id be alone and vulnerable also i could fall and become unconscious and no one would be able to help because they wouldnt know and customers wouldnt be able to get into the store to help cause theres a lock on the door and im worried about someone robbing the place or trying to get in when were closed because customers have got into the shop twice when weve been closed im not allowed a friend or family member in the store to keep me company and help me feel safe cause they have rules against it she could easily put me on during the day or on days when theres two people on but she gives the shit shifts to the new trainees shes also got my coworkers to soy on me which i think creates a very bad environment and i know i cant trust them i only like two of the people i work with and one of them is leaving soon  then today my manager was telling me to pack out the fridge and she gave me the heavy stuff to do when i told her a few weeks ago i find it difficult to lift ive been at work 3 nights in a row and today i had an 8 hour shift on my feet nearly the whole time she asked what my plans for the weekend are and i was thinking you actual bitch you took up my weekend with work im too exhausted to even do anything on sunday and my whole saturday was taken up by work i really hate my manager and i cant wait to get another job,d13axz

398,[RANT/PSA] A message to managers...,i know you have goals and our performance determines your reputation in the eyes of your bosscorporate   that doesnt mean you have to be on their side  if you scratch our back we will scratch yours its really that simple were both stuck here working our miserable insignificant lives away so that we can afford to live why not make it easier for the both of us  i was manager for a small computer repair business for about 3 years i treated my employees like one of the guys and they did the same for me i got their back when they made a mistake they get mine when i have performance goals for them it was simple easy and we understood that we are all human and all want to go home i just dont understand manager culture,d0mw9u

418,R&amp;D paranoia, i work in tech rampd yesterday was the first day at a new project as my old one was over two coworkers have warned me about the bullshit factor in this one the first meeting was awkward as fuck the project is a 3 year one and our job tech wise is to integrate the work of our partners and generally to manage them the project is running for 6 months now and the first review is coming       so the project manager want us to do a demo for the review he also said that our demo has to be the best because we are the coordinator and continued probably the director himself will do the demo so it has to be good since i was the new guy i raised my arm and i asked since we are the integrators we have to wait for our partners to finish and it is too soon also our work and demo is gonna be combining the work of our partners so how exactly can we differentiate from them  actually if we did a demo it is like completing 50 of the project and its the fucking first 6 months out of  3 years   ampx200b  so the project manager had the brilliant idea to not wait for the actual project components from the partners but ask from them some previous iterations of their work that are suboptimal for our project and initial design in order to integrate them and make a demo and for some components that there are no previous iterations we would just go and buy off the shelf components that are similar and integrate them so we are gonna make something that is not even close to the goals of the project just to showcase something  this is literally a whole new project which has to be done in 2 months of course its gonna be a sloppy prototype that just has to survive the demo but i see no point at all at any of this   managers are terrorizing everyone here about the reviews but my experience from the reviews is totally different if you talk sense to the reviewers they are cool in my second review i was told off for revealing some vulnerabilities of my designs every design has them however the reviewers were happy to discuss them and that didnt even hurt our rating why so much bullshiting isnt everyone sick of themselves,czi2bi

421,Moving from the biggest nightmare of a job to one that feels fulfilling and allows me to maintain my mental as well as financial health.,i dont really have anyone else to talk to about this but thought this sub might find it interesting  ill start with the helljob for the last few months since i graduated college ive been working a job that i can only describe as absolutely horrendous ive always been willing to go in and put in the grind and deal with the dehumanization that is inherent in that but this was something else   it was at a medical lab where samples go for processing and the entire thing was draining firstly it was third shift it wouldnt be so bad i always want to get things done more at night and it fit what my sleep schedule already was except for the fact that the overtime was unacceptable mandatory and insane i was told when i was being hired that there might be some overtime like 1 or 2 hours every few days thats a joke 70 hour weeks were common and there were 16 hour shifts where because of my commute it was impossible to get more than 4ish hours of sleep even if i had good sleeping habits already its fucked up but add in the fact that its a night shift and it becomes untenable for anyone everyone working there suffered immensely because of this and that was just expected in addition to being made to feel lazy if they had to leave early or anything imagine feeling lazy while working this  because of the aforementioned commute i told them that i would leave at a certain time every day still several hours after my shift was supposed to end and my immediate bosses who were also basically just cogs and had no say but were thankfully friendly allowed me to the next day after enjoying one shift that was only 11 hours i was told i had to come in two hours early to offset my leaving early having no other options i basically had to say yes so every single day was a 13 hour day with 2 hours total in commute and that was monday through friday with half of saturdays being the same i dont like to complain or pull the do you know how hard it isnt card but imagine working almost 80 hours on overnights in a week  and i thought this was bad until i got my first full paycheck they told me before i was hired at least 10 times that i was going to be making a specific amount of money per hour with overtime being time and a half because it was on a nightshift there was differential and so when i received my job offer it was represented as a base pay in combination with a percent i figured because they had been nice to me and i thought they wouldnt be as blatantly greedy and awful as they were that the total amount after the differential would be what i was supposed to be making turns out no i was making a full dollar less than they claimed i would be asking around pretty much everyone was lied to and paid between 50 cents and a dollar less per hour than they claimed wed be making this from a medical lab where i processed 100 samples an hour spilling god damn blood and urine on myself constantly each netting them hundreds of dollars for the company while we were making 15 or so an hour or about 15 cents per sample  when i realized that i started looking for other jobs more seriously as much as id love to be able to not work or work very minimally as our society would easily be able to maintain at this point i had to then i got lucky my friend had an opening at her job  ive already rambled quite a bit so ill be brief but its like night and day for the last two weeks ive felt respected and important doing work that is demonstrably useful for people im making more per hour and only working 35 hours a week on top of that so much of the job has downtime where im not only permitted but encouraged to work on my own projects or read books or do whatever id like while maintaining my other responsibilities i feel like this is a dream that will be yanked out from under me because this is the kind of job i didnt think could exist under the lecherous system we have now but the kind of job that should exist for everyone with maybe even less than 35 hours but i digress its been such a breath of fresh air to be able to work a fulfilling job that allows me to survive but also makes me so angry that this is such a rarity and that the vast majority of people are shoved into these deadend cruel job where they are being fully exploited by greedy bosses and corporations  tldr went from the worst job i could imagine to the kind of job that should be more commonplace in the world but is instead an extreme rarity,cza41i

452,This thing happened at a job I had years ago and it made me so angry...,i had my first and last office job pushing paper when i was about 20 it was as horrible as you would expect long hours crippling workloads catty coworkers inept management nonsensical policies   i had been managing fairly well for about 5 months i was past my training phase sort of i asked my manager to explain how to do a certain task a second time and she absolutely lost it saying i couldnt just keep asking her how to do stuff and essentially to get my shit together never asked again  anyway the big boss called me into his office via email and i nervously went im very sensitive and felt my palms sweating and mouth drying even as i stood up from my desk i went in and sat down and was treated to a lecture about my productivity how it had decreased in the past month and how i needed to pick it back up he wasnt sympathetic at all very condescending and angry i was honestly baffled as they had posted the productivity levels publically and i was 2nd out of 5 i was too anxious to say anything other than okay but got angry about it after i had time to think  my numbers were double those of the two super catty middle aged teenagers that had been there for years before me but i was the only one reprimanded because my numbers had decreased from what they were they decreased because i got comfortable i had been working at an unsustainable pace and slowed down so i wouldnt get super sick   i did end up having a nervous break down by the end of the year and quit without notice   i used to think there was something wrong with me that i had never grown updeveloped properly to be able to handle a normal job like this im only just starting to realize its the culture thats sick not me   ampnbsp  fun final story about idiotic policies three months into working here management banned the use of headphones with music while working even if you only had one headphone in so you could easily be talked to but dont worry you were permitted to listen to the radio out of the horrendous crackly speakers on your 20 year old speaker phone queue 20 cubicles listening to christmas music on blast out of the worlds shittiest speakers i wanted to die probably also affected my productivity,cze8l7

460,We have no idea how much power we have,i had an exchange with a redditor in the rantiwork subreddit who felt any attempt to impose a reduction of hours on the capitalists and the state would backfire causing greater economic damage to the workers than the capitalists the redditor summarized their thinking this way  gtany withdrawl of labor significant enough to cripple profits would seem to my admittedly amateur eye to almost by definition hurt wages its like the regressive tax thing that day of lost wages means much more to the worker than it does to the capitailist and the capitialist is getting some return by saving on labor costs and meanwhile workers still need to be purchasing necessities so just like with ubi capitialists profit there too  the workers when they cease work for a day lose a days wage while the capitalists see a reduction in their labor costs at the same time the workers still have to eat and must purchase necessities on which the capitalists profit   since the workers must eat in any case and since the capitalists will make a profit on the commodities they buy what excuse do we have to oppose a nonwage income like ubi   gtanyway it feels obvious to me although i guess it is not that it would be much easier for workers  to withhold labor via a strike or via a reduction of work hours if workers had some income that wasnt derived from wages the goal of shortening the work week does not appear to be at odds with a basic income in fact they seem complementary  personally i think the answer is obvious it rests on the fact that the working class produces perhaps ten times as much value as it consumes by reducing its labor by one day the impact of this reduction is felt ten times more by the capitalists than the workers   to understand what this means you have to realize that a withdrawal of one days labor a week   not even a complete strike a partial work stoppage  amounts to a fall of gdp equal to that last seen during the great depression a 20 collapse in economic output   no capitalist economy can withstand the loss of one days labor by a committed determined working class it is their nightmare scenario it requires no army no parties no protests it just requires people who hate work and want to abolish it   it is also the direct path to communism,czmlqy

482,My job is a pit of stress that’s holding me back and going nowhere but I can’t work up the motivation to quit. [Long Vent],i work in the parts department of a car dealership i got the job because i was one of the few lucky people who had family connections to the manager and i was in the right place at the right time previous guy had been slacking off real bad and let everything go to shit i had volunteered at annual inventories with the company for years so they knew i was good at the work and i needed a job it all lined up beautifully i always wanted an inventory job because i have a knack for organization and thats what i was told i would be doing  checking the shelves running reports to make sure everything is in order arranging the occasional retail display my manager has been a family friend for years so we all saw him as a good guy and very trustworthy it looked like it was going to work out great and it did and i was very happy with it for a few months  ive been here over a year now though and everything has changed so quickly it fucking sucks everything has gone downhill rapidly and i want to blow my brains out coming in here every day and smelling the same fucking brainmelting concoction of gasoline motor oil tire rubber and stale coffee seeing the same dull gray stained cement floors with trash all over them because my coworkers are too lazy to take the 5 steps to the trash bins for their toothpicks and candy wrappers having to handle the same damn oil and coolantslathered parts all day long and get it in my hair and on my clothes that i cant afford to replace because im stupid short and khakis in a 6 petite dont seem to fucking exist for under 70 a pair having to grin and bear it through the same dull monotonous smalltalk conversations and worst of all i have nothing to show for it i believe that its unfair and completely evil that people are forced to work like drones doing unnatural artificial tasks for decades on end in order to earn the right and the means to exist like everyone else on this sub believes  but i have been raised being constantly beat over the head with the philosophy that if i have to work im going to do the best damn job that i can because even if it sucks and you hate it and dont agree with work as a societal construct you have to live with it whether you like it or not and biting the bullet and busting your ass is how you move up and make it in life but thats not true and i learned it the hard way i have been busting my ass since day 1 and if anything i have been demoted   like previously mentioned i was told that i was going to be working inventory and i did for the first few months i helped out with other jobs occasionally but i was told a new guy would be hired to take care of warranty which is like a subdepartment of parts is seen as the absolute pits of every parts and service store and is what i was helping the most with because there was no one else back here to do it the guy gets hired though and hes instead been designated a position as our shipperreceiver nicks assistant lost puppy he is barnone the most pathetic human being i have ever personally met in my entire life but i could go on an on about that and ill just tell you that my nickname for him is virgin chihuahua because he looks like a fucking human chihuahua with his giant buggy eyes little scrawny body and anxious energy that he constantly radiates like a chernobyl reactor and he may as well have virgin tattooed on his forehead in big bold letters and neon glowinthedark ink because he is in his mid20s but still has the brain of a 13 year old boy he is extremely lazy and wanders around tapping away at his phone or making extremely awkward and forced banter with everyone else when he isnt following nick around and holding his dick for him because nicks been here 30 years and rarely needs any real help and he used to flirt with me until i chewed his ass out to my manager after he made a comment regarding me and my boyfriends sex life that made me want to peel all of my skin off he takes credit for everything me and the only other person in this department worth anything more than dog shit both break our backs to do because no one else wants to and he is always whining that he deserves a raise my manager fucking babies him to the point where i wonder if something is going on like bribery or underthetable favors or if my manager has really just stopped caring that much either way chihuahua had 2 days of basic warranty training then fucked off to never set foot back here again unless he wants to commandeer my phone charger or demand i share my weekend plans in excruciating detail so all of it has been dumped on me and it is fucking impossible to keep up with   we get massive amounts of shit in every day and a lot of it is physically massive but the warranty room is a glorified broom closet about the size of your average guest bedroom so i have to go after nick and chihuahua with a cattle prod to get them to use the forklift and help bring the stuff out to the storage container on the other side of our huge and very poorlydesigned parking lot and the thing is a giant convection oven all day long because i live in the south and it is sitting in direct sun on hot pavement they dont do it half the time though even though it takes 5 to 10 minutes at most to set everything up on a pallet and drive it over and they always come up with excuses that my manager waves off so i resolved to taking the stuff out myself in multiple trips with shopping carts i cant leave this stuff lying around because it either sits in my way in the warranty room or gets in everyone elses way sitting out in the narrow hallway however i recently actually almost passed out from heat stroke trying to get things out there because there was so much that day i came back inside through my managers office red as a fire truck and panting like a dog and what did he do did he get me some water or ask me to sit down and rest before going back out with someone else to help did he scold nick and chihuahua for slacking off and making excuses no he scolded me like a child for coming in looking like that and established a fucking curfew for when i am allowed out in the storage container i can only go out there for two hours in the mornings which makes for only two days out of the week since i usually work afternoon shifts due to a medical condition that interferes with my sleep i wish i could post a picture of my view right now from my desk  so much has built up that you can barely walk through the hallway and i can only roll my chair about half a foot in either direction before hitting a box  and i only get paid 10 an hour for all of this shit glassdoor says i should be making 15  last month i sat down with my manager and tried to discuss all my concerns regarding my workload and chihuahua and everything else that has been bothering me this past year the company gets even more into brainwashing you than others and orientation composed of watching over 20 videos each 10 minutes long of the hr director touting how much they value hard work and if you have a concern bring it up to your manager and we will make it right and all the typical corporate rahrah circlejerking type shit so i foolishly trusted the system and hoped that my manager would understand and make things right like i had been promised would be the case when i started he listened to me intently as i spoke but what he said in response really hurt me on a personal level paraphrased he said youre too much of a perfectionist you work too hard you act like im a slave driver no one is putting this pressure on you but yourself   i gave up my perfectionism long ago i just want to do my job and earn my money without spending every second of it wanting to tear my hair out i come in here and as soon as i enter the building i feel so hopeless with each day im quicker to anger quicker to crying quicker to wondering if i should go lay down on the train tracks to get away from it i want to quit but people are always telling me that i have it so good and that im so lucky to have this job to the point where ive become petrified at the idea of turning in that resignation letter what if i cant find someplace that is as accommodating of my medical condition what if the people at a new job are somehow even worse than chihuahua what if the schedule they give me is drastically different and prevents me from being able to see my boyfriend every weekend like i can now what if i quit and cant find a new job at all and i have to humiliate myself crawling back to this pit every time i go through this motions of weighing the pros and cons i feel like such a sissy for finding the job so difficult and stressful because there are people who would likely kill to have what i have but im still so miserable and i dont know what to do  i could just use some support and some encouragement i need to hear that im not crazy and ungrateful for being miserable here and that i need to quit i just need to quit and find something else but im so scared to take that leap i need someone to push me  thanks for reading and sorry for the wall of text,czm025

490,"How are we supposed to change the world when a small group is ""leading"" the others...",when the number of people and the reliability of them are becoming less and less money is a neutral resource being controlled by the 1 for their own selfish endeavors while simultaneously having to give just enough of what people need so that they can survive all to repeat the process of having to do others work just to get the scraps of your boss or leader or owner  im not saying that money needs to go entirely but we need to fix the system in a way that is for the majority fair and isnt putting people in a system that is based on power levels through money but through equality and better communication i want to see a world where my descendants can all work together and do what they want with out having to worry about whether or not they are accepted enough or able to be apart of society because of there lack of funds or because they dont have a job instead of being an independent culture being driven by the unseen voices and following what is deemed as right we need to unite and be one but how do we do that psychedelics are one big answer to the puzzle since they open us up in ways that others cant but with the laws and control over them and the fact that many people can have a hard time with the experience or are busy with jobs and trying to survive we need other ways of improving as a whole and not helping to make the 1 better off while they make us suck on their toes for the sweet nectar of life through money and material possessions to keep us occupied and distracted waiting to go to work the next day i wont be another cog in a system that wants me to perform in a better and better way without letting me the time and resources to be able to improve   sorry if its a little confusing and long but if you see this please ask questions spread the message and join me in the revolution to improve the future  seriously though help i cant see a fulfilling life if all im doing is worrying about money in some way or another and i hope you agree with me  i also see money as a lifeline but the lifeline has been altered in way that makes me a pawn for a king that doesnt care about me without the lifeline i feel as if i am dead already  i got a lot to get out yet no one to get it out to so i put it here in hopes that others will follow somehow  thank you,d07oso
491,Hunters/Gatherers had a higher quality of life than the Modern World,what they did on a day to day basis would never be considered work it was something they had to do and benefited them directly and it was a matter of life and death they didnt complain about the hours and if they got the job done early they were finished for they day or more than that stress was created by the difficulty of the job not the politics around it   contrast that to the modern job most of the time it only benefits the owner it doesnt have to be done it doesnt matter if you get your work done within 5 minutes or 5 hours you still have to stay for the entire shift most of stress is the generated by the people around you not the job itself  does anyone else agree where did it all go wrong,d075z4
492,"The definitive solution to fucking end work forever. Listen please, this is SERIOUS shit.",wanting the end of work is a noble cause since working causes a lot of pain distress suffering and humiliation  if we really want to solve this problem we need to look at the root of its cause surprisingly the evil is not capitalism billionaires or corrupted governments even though they are also part of the issue   the real evil has always been in front of our eyes and it is human nature  humans beings are needy creatures by default we feel hunger naturally while satisfying this urge requires our effort we have to strive in order to survive   the fact that we feel hunger and others neccesitties every day is to me overwhelming its the way we are   what can we do for me the solution is stop reproducing   reproduction is the cause of all human problems  think about it we were all brought into existence without our consent we are force to deal with a situation we didnt agree to have in the first place   we do not break any moral rule by not reproducing however we can cause a lot of unnecessary suffering by having babies creating necessities that didnt need to exist in the first place   sadly i have no the solution to end work during our lifetimes but this is the solution to end work in less than 100 years   forever  thoughts,d07ee7
