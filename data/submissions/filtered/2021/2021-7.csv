1,Thought this fits here,   the trees are strong  my lord  their roots go deep            lip them all down  4 saying is we're trying  but it s not really that easy    hours overcome a day  hauling down trees with nothing but fucking ropes  with nothing but maggoty and mould bread to eat  i thought  maybe  since you're meant to be  so fucking wise  you could come up with some kind actual solution  there are trees here with roots like 50 metre long  those ones are bordering impossible to pull down by hand  you're supposed  to be managing this project but you've given us no time frame  no-extra equipment  no budget to even come up with something oursenvexena men  expect everything to just happen  frankly   think baron bet on the wrong horse  you think just cause you're like a semi-god you're somehow automatically qualified to supervise a forestry project but  obviously you have no fucking clue what you're doing    did my wert  in faractry management at mipewnnd tarhnical sehanlandl what aren    ,ouxnp0
2,Human societies NEED workers in one capacity or the other to sustain themselves.,i know this will be controversial in this sub  but i honestly am posting in good faith  i want to preface this by saying that i completely understand that capitalism has fucked our society  seemingly beyond repair  private institutions in pursuit of profit control all of our lives  most jobs are meaningless tasks done by average people under the threat of homelessness  meant to keep the system running  15-20 individuals run the world  i know  it's fucked  i still think some people need to hear this  anyway i'm an industrial technician  in the course of my work  i travel around to all types of manufacturing plants  railyards  ports  municipal works  farms  etc  all the areas of society that are completely invisible unless you're looking for them  in the years i've been doing this  i've made a couple realizations that in my view don't really mesh with the whole  antiwork  philosophy  i'd like to hear what you guys think    amp x200b   for industrial or even simple agrarian human society to maintain a level of comfort and egalitarian distribution of resources  workers are needed   especially with the number of people we have on the planet right now  machinery needs to be designed  built  operated and maintained or there's no way we feed  clothe  and house all 7 billion of us  an international supply chain of some type needs to be designed  managed  and staffed  medical professions need to exist  mental health professionals need to exist  infrastructure for all this needs to be built   waste needs to be disposed of properly  people need to closely monitor and regulate our impact on the environment  educated and experienced people need to train the next generation to do these jobs     amp x200b   when humanity industrialized we crossed the rubicon  there's no going back  reverting to some kind of hunter-gatherer  back-to-the-land  type deal would doom literal billions of human souls to a life of suffering and death  this is why i don't like the    gt hehe i was meant to prance along the beach  not work my stinky job  posts  everyone has a role to play in the survival of their species  this is how humans have worked since forever  big or small  you need to contribute  even in a completely utopian society  i guess what i'm trying to say is that i think that an absolutist view of  no more work  just isn't viable in any situation  i would gladly go do a task every day if i knew for an absolute fact that i was making a positive contribution to humankind  those jobs literally don't exist though  hell  even doctors are under the thumb of insurance companies  so  that's all i have to say   tl dr  it's too late to go back on agriculture and industrialization  there is a staggering amount of work that needs to go into the smooth operation of a human society  even a completely fair and egalitarian one  people need to be motivated to do this work and pass the knowledge down to the next generation  that being said  the way society is set up currently is totally fucked and imo it's time for guillotines ,ouwvgt

22,If the work you do does not benefit into capitalism or you can’t fit in then conservatives want you dead or in jail,in the end from analysis you can see all they want is for people who can t fit into capitalism to  not exist  or  disappear    some people have asked them what they think about governments lifting restrictions on certain land areas where they can live without being moved or harassed constantly by the police and their answer to that is still  no  even if its cheaper   the ideology espoused by the gop and conservatives around the world advocate for the death of anybody who cannot conform to capitalism  even if they are disabled in some cases   they want to kill  they are just too afraid to say it because if they did then everybody would see them for who they are   the gop form of conservatism atleast  found both in the u s a and around the world is an ideology of genocide   the honest ones i ve questioned about their beliefs try to justify the deaths that occur as  a process of the natural order and survival of the fittest where the strong rule  just as the nazi party did   if you want the expose the beliefs of any yourself i would say try asking them a question that involves some form of compromise to let people survive at the bare minimum like  why not allow homeless people an area of land they can legally live on then for the time being  or  what about outcasts or people who cannot fit into the system no matter what   they mostly try to justify that with a statement of  bees and other animals in nature killing off those who cannot fit in  in my experience    you will see just exactly what their answer is to just any question about making sure people who can t fit into capitalism are allowed some way to live on their own means ,ov6wls

50,Just got told that my work doesn’t pay you in “10min increments” so if you get held back a couple of minutes you’re not getting paid.,it s a basic shitty retail job  i asked the manager what to do if i get held back 5  10  even 15 minutes past my clock out time if it s busy or the other shift doesn t show up  they just said to write down my normal clock out time because they don t pay in 10minute increments  sorry what  sounds like wage theft to me  in the months i ve been working there this is the first instance of pure fuckery at an otherwise pleasant job    i even asked a more senior co-worker about what they do if they get held back and they say they have to check with the manager if it s ok to clock out the time they stayed back and if it s not on then  that s just tough luck    i don t care how much of a non team player it makes me look the moment it hits my clock out time  regardless of how busy it is  i m out of there idgaf anymore  i can tell some co-workers resent me for it especially if i leave in the middle of a rush but if i ever get confronted by management about it i ll just remind them that i don t get paid in those  10 minute increments  so i m not staying back    to add  i hate clock off systems where you have to manually input your clock off time  every second spent on the floor is work and if you run into a customer on the way to the clock off computer that still counts as work  even if it takes you only a minute to answer their questions  after typing this all out i m just now realising how this workplace is the exact same retail hellhole as any other retail job i ve had  it s comforting to have come to this realisation after a few months of feeling like maybe this company isn t as bad as every other exploitative company  since when i leave i won t feel any remorse or have secodn thoughts    tldr  manager said if you get held back after your shift you re not getting paid because they don t pay in 10min increments  had a moment of realisation while typing that this job isn t special and i won t feel bad for leaving ,ovb3up

69,I think people mistakenly write this subreddit off as a bunch of lazy millennials who just want the government to give them more stimulus checks,it isn't that r antiwork is actually anti work  but anti modern slavery    our society has collapsed into slave like system because of our government    the government  via their decisions  policies and regulations have destroyed our nation  i will tell you how they did it and how we can take back our nation back from the banking cabal    it started in 1913 with the creation of the federal reserve  a bunch of banks duped woodrow wilson into giving them power over the dollar which was backed by gold  then the government via fdr made holding gold illegal and devalued the dollar by raising the price of gold to  35 an ounce  there should have been a second revolutionary war when this happened but americans were too complacent with their consumption and lifestyle they were creating for themselves  the saying goes like this   hard times create strong men  strong men create good times  good times create weak men and weak men create hard times  we are currently in the hard times phase   so instead of doing the most american thing and starting another war  americans just let the corrupt government take their liberties away by first controlling the money    then came bretton woods  the world decided to give the us unrestrained power by making the dollar the world reserve currency because it was backed by gold  the problem is that you can't have a strong economy and world reserve status  because the other countries like china will devalue their currency and manufacturing will leave the country of a high valued currency for a weaker one  causing cheaply produced goods that then ship back home to be sold at the same price  thus making a lot of more money than if it had been produced in us dollars  why would you pay ten dollars to produce an item to sell it for fifteen dollars when you can make it for two dollars in china and earn thirteen dollars in profit when sold in the us  so that is why we basically have no quality jobs today and everything is service  we have people that sell chairs  transport chairs  but no one makes chairs    fast forward to 1971  inflation hasn't really gotten out of control because even though the federal reserve was printing money  they were still restrained by the gold standard  you can print paper money but you can't print gold and a certain amount of dollars represented one ounce of gold  simple laws of supply and demand  if there is a lot of supply  there is less demand  so prices fall  if there is a lot of demand but low supply  prices rise  this is why gold costs more than silver  because it is rarer than silver even though silver has more uses than gold    so in august of 71  nixon decides to  temporary  suspend the convertibility of dollars  trash  into gold   this is allowed the federal reserve to print money without restraint causing the great stagflation of the 70s  everything we buy with our money since then has gotten more expensive every year because they won't stop inflating the dollar  if more dollars exist  then people can buy more stuff  sellers see the increase in sales  so they raise prices  that is why a house went from  9000 in 1971to  300000 in 2021  because they have printed a lot of money  now we are seeing inflation like crazy because trump and biden have printed more than half of the dollars ever created in the last year  and we haven't even seen biden's inflation yet  the current price increases are caused by trump    now compound the fact that the government has made it impossible to start a business with little money because of all the regulations they have made  a new small business can't compete with a behemoth that has existed for decades  the government is responsible for creating monopolies  i suggest you watch john stossel's youtube channel  he covers this type of corruption in depth  but the other problem is the money printing and something called the cantillon effect  when the fed creates money  they gave it to the rich the banks  the rich then having bought everything there is to own  spend the money in startups like uber  amazon and lyft  they basically fund these companies and allow them to operate at a loss for a while why they destroy local business by offering prices they can't compete with  once they have destroyed the small businesses and their competition is wiped out  they can raise prices  this is caused by our government  they choose winners and losers via the rules they have created    now you can't start a business because the cost of starting up is like 250k  you can't open a retail store because of the cost and because you can't outsource your production to china like the corporations can  you have to compete with chinese prices but have can't produce chinese currency  so you raise your prices and have zero sales  forcing you to take a job at a starbucks  like everyone else  and since everyone else has to work in the service economy  they all commute to work  now you are losing 3 hours a day in traffic    you spend all your time working  preparing  and commuting and have no time to farm your own food or cook  instead of being self-sufficient like our ancestors  we rely on the supermarket and restaurants for our survival  you don't have a choice  you live in an apartment with no time    the us dollar is about to collapse  it will go into hyperinflation when biden's money printing begins to appear in the cpi  how do you protect yourself and at the same take on the banking cabal that is causing this misery   gold and silver  the us dollar index falls when gold rises  when gold falls the us dollar rises  in order for us to gain our freedom again  we basically need our currency to get wiped out  the world governments would then reject the dollar as the world reserve currency  learning from their mistake and how the us has weaponized the dollar for political gain  they will never give another country world reserve currency again  instead they will return to the gold standard  some stupid countries will make their own crypto currencies  but no one is going to trade with them because who the hell would give gold or silver for virtual money   the global economy will return to the way it was before the modern era  people transacting in gold and silver  at that point who would ship their manufacturing from the us to china  it would cost the same to produce in both countries  except in china you are dealing with their regulations and shipping it over here  so no one would keep their operations over there if they don't have to    join r wallstreetsilver  buy gold  topple the value of the usd and we will have a chance of owning property one day  stay complacent  and things will continue the way they are ,ovbw22

84,Work saved my life,for the record  i am against being a modern day slave  but i think some of you have it way wrong  i just wanted to share my story to try to have some people understand my point of view    i never graduated high school  i still don't have a diploma or equivalent  i had gotten my chick at the time pregnant while on 11th grade  i was 17  everybody's reaction of course was   time to get to work      i dropped out of school and started working construction in california  i had a baby on the way and didn't want to let my parents nor my future wife down so i did what i had to do  little did i know at the time it would lead to my downfall  and then an extreme uprising       i see some people here complaining about working 8 hours and then doing a 2 hour commute  lol    it was normal for me to work 12 hours and drive 4 hours home every single day for months  i slept for 2 - 4 hours every single day for weeks and weeks  i hate to sound like boot-strappers but i laugh at an 8 hour work day  the commute times in southern california are horrendous to say the least  i would do it though because i was making great money at the time  20 bucks an hour plus overtime at 80  hours a week motivated me alot     i started to recognize that what i was doing was actually detrimental to my life  especially when my fiance at the time left me  in that moment i realized i had let work ruin what was most important to me  my family   i won't go into to much depth because i could write a novel about it  but my life went into a downward spiral from there  i had nothing  hardly ever saw my kids and the ex was getting me hard for child support and alimony  which forced me into living in a literal shack  you want to talk about slavery  how about the government literal forcing you to pay 2k a month to your ex spouse  even when my income dropped significantly during covid  i was facing jail time because i literally couldn't afford it  the courts answer to this was basically  tough shit  go to work    i was stuck in a paradox of life that had forced me to work perpetually    the less i saw my kids the more child support i had to pay which resulted in me working more and seeing my kids even less etc etc etc    thank god for ramon cup of noodles  thank you maruchan  i will forever support that company     so i did what i had to do  i was 26 and in this predicament of life that only america would put me in  i was on the brink of homelessness even tho i made 35 bucks an hour  at that time the way i saw it  i had two decisions  give up everything and kill myself to end it all or put my head down  stop feeling sorry for myself  and get it together    i still have the piece of paper where i deduced my life to those solutions    the only motivating factors for me were simply my two kids  so i came up with a game plan  the first rule was to stop coming up with excuses for anything and to start taking accountability for everything  so i did  anytime i felt sorry for myself or was upset about something i would try to change it in my own way  sick of my employer  look for a new job  not saving money  reduce my bills to zero    i had literally sent out 100 or more resumes to different companies before i found one that was halfway decent  i moved out of my  1500-a-month shack and lived in my truck for the next year to save money  which i did  i eventually saved enough to buy a travel trailer that i lived in for the next 4 years  i still have it    it was during this time i had started to literally see my work pay off  i was actually saving money from the sacrifices i was making  i was able to save 100k in 4 years which i used to move to arizona and buy a 150k house  my payment over a 30 year loan was 325 bucks a month  during my time in arizona  all those 12 hour days payed off because i ended up moving up the ranks in my company making a decent salary  i had child support and my house payment plus utilities on a 80k salary  i was able to save more money and over the next few years i would pay my house off early and buy another house which i rented out    this is where america happened in a good way     i would eventually start paying off my rental house  and collecting the full rent amount straight to my savings account  while also still working for a construction company  while also doing door dash and uber eats  i worked my ass off but only because i could start to see a plan coming together    i could write a novel about this next part but i would basically keep doing what i was doing and buy a cheap house  fix it up  rent it out  pay it off  that was the formula which led to me making 3k a week in passive income on top of my employment  i would eventually quit my job altogether and live off of the rent payments  which would lead me to opening my own business  a boba shop  then two  then three      i tell you this because if you are willing to make the sacrifice in the short term  hard work pays off in the long term  don't let people trap you into work  i promise you  i could lose everything today and work a minimum wage job and get it all back again before i turn 45  it's because i can create solutions and not excuses  the fact of the matter is  this is how capitalism works  you either play the game or become a game piece  you can't feel sorry for yourself  you can't have excuses  you need to find a path and make it work  use what little money you have and make it work for you  do things you don't want to do temporarily to take advantage of the sacrifices you made permanently  the sad reality of it is  this game won't change    i'm against slave working  but at the end of the day  work saved my life  many many 12-15 hour shifts in the hot desert sun  always keeping my hand raised  taking all opportunities that came my way and a little ambition changed my life for the better  i work probably 4 hours a week total now and make about 250k a year  i spend my time meeting new people  traveling  making knives  playing video games and most importantly i do it all with my kids  making up for lost time ya know    i hope you can see some value in this post and i hope i don't get downvoted to oblivion  live your best life everyone  and if you made it this far i thank you for the time ,ovblyh

86,Pay difference,before my state raised the minimum wage  it was 7 50 and hour  i was paid 7 50 an hour to be trusted with someone s child for after school and then 8 hours a day during the summer  one summer was quite honestly the worst working experience i have had to this day  it got to the point where my dad was encouraging me to quit  i eventually did quit due to management  disagreements  next summer rolls around and i hear from my coworkers  that didn t quit during the summer  they were offered 9 dollars an hour to come back  so not only was management so shitty that you couldn t get adequate staffing but  you could ve been paying us 9 dollars an hour this entire time ,ov9z85

158,What is your anti-work story?,i thought it would be nice to share each other's anti-work sentiment   i had to take a mental health day today or i might have gotten a legit break down  i'm currently 22 turning 23 and for the last couple of months i've come to realize what anti-work really means to me  i've been working since i was 18 in retail for four years in college  i've had to deal with the karens of the world  i didn't really mind it too much  going to school  doing my work study  doing internships  going to my retail job  for some reason  this day to day sentiment didn't hit me like a truck   but then i got my first  full time adult job   i slowly came to realize what this entailed  waking up early  going to work  being too tired to do anything after work and just doing the bare minimum of eating and cleaning and upkeep   then doing it again the next day  then the next day  then the next day  and then its finally saturday and you have some time to yourself right  wrong  now you gotta go grocery shopping  now you gotta do chores  you gotta take care of the kids  if you have kids  take care of your parents  etc and so fourth   and then you do it again on sunday  and then you get the dreaded going back to work on monday feelings and now it's monday and you do it all over again dealing with all the things you need to deal with at work   for the next 50 years of your life   that literally terrified me  i don't wanna live like this for the next 50 years of my life  and i don't know how people before me were able to do this for the entirety of their lives and retire in their 60s   i ask around the people in my life and they say to just suck it up and this is how life is  and if that's the case i don't want this shit   and then if you want to get out of the rat race  not wanting to work for someone else because they'll ultimately fuck you over somehow someway  you have the option to make a businesss of your own  and that has its own pros and cons but at the end of the day you're still working  you're still working towards that end goal  whatever it may be  and i'm tired of it  i'm only 22 and i'm tired of it   i can't go to the dotor or dentist because i'm working my 9-5  and most doctors and dentists are open at that time  so if i need my annual checkup i have to take pto  have to do all my grocery shopping after work where everybody else also has to do it at that time as well  my parents are aging and they're not able to move around as much as they want to  and i can't help them out cause i'm at work  and my younger 18 year old sister can't help out because she's moderately intellectually disabled  so ultimately i have to take care of her and my parents   i apologize if this sounds like a rant or vent  this is why i took that mental health day    i wish i can be born as a cat in my next life ,ouk6hy

166,A Concern,so  to preface  i support the  20 minimum wage  but there's something i'd ask you all to consider as well    so  i work at a nonprofit  i won't say which one  but it's in the field of caring for people with developmental disabilities  and they rely very heavily on government funding  we do a lot of great work there  but the amount of funding the government gives them isn't enough  and trying to raise the minimum wage is likely to cut jobs in the maintenance or business departments   you can't cut dsps and teachers because you need to maintain a certain ratio of participants to staff  that is  of course  unless we also rally for these places to receive more funding and resources to better support the people they care for  i probably sound like a shill  but i mean it  this place can be esoteric and inefficient at times  and i'm not always pleased with the business side of the organization  but i do believe in helping the people my workplace cares for    so  in summary   - 20 dollar minimum wage is a hell yeah -also consider helping get more government funding for these important programs,ouaggx

227,Are we more self aware or are we wired differently?,do you think being anti work or on the anti work spectrum takes a certain self awareness    in the past i ve often talked about and or asked people how they felt working the typical 9-5 corp america type job  it seems like 99 9  percent of the time they would look at me like i was crazy haha i have one close friend that gets it   for example  i worked  at this giant insurance company that has offices worldwide for a little over two years  the  culture  there is the typical corporate work the worker to the bone  although there were many things that irked me about my experience there  way too many to go into now  one of the worst for me personally was forced ot on almost a daily basis  there was a lot of work and not enough workers  typical  even though  the ceo of said company gets in the ballpark of  17 million us dollars in compensation a year while they often hired workers right out of college for 35k a year which does not go far in the los angeles area    the intriguing thing for me was that people did not really seem to mind the forced ot and not knowing how long they would have to work that day  workers would start between 7-8 am and not leave until 8pm or later  they would also want people to come in on saturdays too   i would often ask coworkers how they felt about this  i would hear things like that s life  they were getting that bread  some seemed to have no life and just liked being in the office  while many didn t seem to care about or were completely unaware about how they were being exploited  i had one guy warn me and tell me to run asap and that they would work you to death  he quit not long after that convo  good for him  my other coworkers would often seem happy to do it because they were  on that grind  and getting that  bread  others i had a feeling were trying to suck up to management or paint themselves as a team player in order to move up the ladder and get that promotion and become a cog in the machine  this place was a revolving door and people often left for the above mentioned reasons  so maybe there are more anti workers out there  but a lot of people did stay and are still there years later   this has been one of my many job experiences that i m still trying to understand and process i guess what i m getting at is do you think we are a little more self aware than others or just wired differently  sorry for the long rant haha  i m glad it s friday ,oulw15

248,The coming Great Reset is directly analogous to Marx's immiseration thesis,https www weforum org great-reset   the notion that  you will own nothing and be happy  has a direct antecedent in marx  who anticipates this as the final world structure before global communist revolution- in particular  he acknowledges this to be the case in an early work of 1845   the german ideology    gt  for it to become an  intolerable  power  i e  a power against which men make a revolution  it must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity  propertyless  and produced  at the same time  the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture  both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power  a high degree of its development   the rationale for the reset is simple  offset the climate crisis onto the shoulders of the proletariat  thereby justifying their immiseration  which would occur anyway - it is the nature of capitalism to strip property from the proletariat  whilst leaving the bourgeoisie unscathed   this process will be presided over  ironically  by the bourgeois  left  whom marx constantly scathed for justifying the perpetual existence of capitalism through their rhetoric  the conservatives fear of  eat bug  live in pod  are wholly justified  but his solutions will be ineffective - the struggle against it will by necessity have to be converted into a global struggle of the proletariat ,ou75cf

experiment to be completed  or else you are not really considering what is written below    amp x200b    so if that is the case for you  and you didn't follow the instructions below    amp x200b   please don't waste our time and effort with your reply about something  that you could have posted as a subject on its own elsewhere    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   1 imagine that you do something   instructions 1  feel free to imagine  following the steps and instructions below from beginning until the end    amp x200b   clarifications   follow the instructions from beginning until the end  and don't waste my time and effort    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   2 you do this something that you imagine in two different ways from its beginning until its end  instructions 2  you can come back to me with two stories  each with a beginning and and end  about something done in two different ways from its beginning until its end    amp x200b   clarifications   two stories that start and end  don't waste my time and effort  and follow the instructions from beginning until the end   where the instruction don't limit you  there you are free to imagine    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   3 first you do it with money from its beginning until its end   instructions 3 trade is happening in the first story with money    amp x200b   clarifications   this means that  either you do something for another  and another gives the agreed amount of money to you   or another does something for you  and you give another the agreed amount of money to another and the agreed amount of money   is the amount of money you and another agreed in order to trade    amp x200b   example   why the below is provided as an example  in case it offends you  you will find out in number 4    amp x200b   e g  prostitution is legal in the place where this example takes place  and you or another give money to the other other one in exchange for sex    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   4 secondly you do it without money from its beginning until its end   instructions 4 trade is happening in the second story without money    amp x200b   clarifications   this mean that  you do this for another and another does that for you  this and that is whatever it is for the specific occasion and instance  and money isn't involved between the two of you  in the second story    amp x200b   also this means that the stories you can come back to me are one story with trade and money  and the other story also with trade but without money so follow the instructions  and don't waste my time and effort    amp x200b   example   and now time has come to find out why prostitution was discussed in number 4  with the following example    amp x200b   e g  you and another have sex  and money isn't involved in this example   you and another freely chose to have sex with one another  and freely chose not to use money   why this example is used in number 5  you will find out in number 6    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   5  for the second way when you do it without money  you have to spend less time and effort to do it  from its beginning until its end   instructions 5 in the first story when you do it with money  you have to spend more time and effort to do it  from its beginning until its end   amp x200b   example   time to find out the difference between 4  and 5  with the following example   e g  you have sex with another  another is your partner in life  and after sex   having heard that that money's means   store of value  medium of exchange  unit of account   you decide to give to another  who is your partner in life  after you had sex with one another money   so as to show the value of another to you  for the exchange that took place  with a real unit of account    amp x200b   what do you think another would do  especially if you were a man and another was a woman and you gave to a woman who was your partner in life  money after having sex with her  in order to thank her for having sex with you    amp x200b   still unconvinced  ok  let's move one    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   6  i wonder would you say you are using your money wisely    amp x200b   clarifications   follow the instructions from beginning until the end  and don't waste my time and effort    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   7  because if you would  wait a minute before you start replying  and listen to me    amp x200b   in both stories that you can come back to me  you are trading with another    amp x200b   in one of the stories  you have to spend more time and effort  to do what you freely imagined you do with another  plus you have to also use money on top of having to spend more time and effort to do it  unlike the way you do it in the other story    amp x200b   in the other story  you have to spend less time and effort  to do what you freely imagined you do with another  and as you also have to not use money in the second story  you don't have to spend time and effort to use money  unlike the way you do it in one of the stories    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   8  so it seems to me that the other story  and not one of the stories  is what you would be looking for if it seems sensible to you to spend less time and effort  and not get caught up in one of those stories you know the ones i'm talking about  no  if not  i am talking about one of the stories where you have to spend endless time and effort even for the simplest of things    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b    hey  i don't understand the above  what's the summary  one may ask   money reduces the time and effort people have to spend to trade with one another    amp x200b   clarifications for the  i still don't understand  one   when one is wasting one's money  it is up to that one to find this out in the end for oneself    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   2  when the way one uses money increases the time and effort one has to spend to do what one wants to do  one is wasting either one's money  or another one's money  or the rest one's money    amp x200b   clarifications for the  i don't understand  and i am offended  one    amp x200b   when one is wasting another one's money  another one doesn't want to waste another one's time and effort  and tries to avoid trading with one  and trades with another one    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   3  and in the end  how all have to remember the above  is    amp x200b   when some are wasting the rest of our money  it is up to the rest of us to show to some that we don't want some to be wasting our time and effort with their endless nonsense stories about what money does  because    amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   clarifications for everyone    amp x200b   money reduces the time and effort people have to spend to trade with one another   or people are wasting each other's time and effort spending their money    and then they have the nerve to call what they are doing trading with one another   amp x200b    amp x200b    amp x200b   up to now  some people don't know how to not waste one another's time and effort  it seems to me    amp x200b   and they add money on top of that  as if that would make their case better    amp x200b     how about they put some time and effort thinking now  so that they don't end up wasting our time and effort  because money reduces the time and effort people have to spend to trade with one another ,outa51

276,Fly on the wall in a Japanese domestic company,torture of the day  a meeting with the managers   they call me and my american college in individually and ask why we are taking so long getting coffee  because apparently anything other than standing mutely in front of the machine  grabbing the cup  and then sprinting back to your desk  is unacceptable   apparently  heaps of people are asking them questions such as  what are they talking about  standing over there    first point- how the fuck do those randoms know who manages us  why do they care  why do they feel the need to snitch like fucking plague rat bastards  and as managers  they feel like they have to answer the randoms and tell them exactly what we are saying  and it s embarrassing for them not to know   standing and talking next to the coffee machine means your hands aren t moving on a keyboard  which means you aren t doing work  if you stand and talk for over five minutes  it means you don t have enough work to do  it means you re too free   if you are talking about work during that time  don t stand  instead talk at your desk  where the whole team sits in perpetual silence  listens to everything  and all eyes swivel your way if you so much stand up to go to the toilet  every movement is monitored   if you have problems with work or if you are talking about work  you shouldn t talk about it with each other  you should talk about it with your superiors or in a place where your superiors can hear you    also  during the morning meetings  we expect you to clap along with everyone when an order is completed  otherwise we think you aren t excited about the order    if this damn place wasn t supporting my visa  i d be out of there so fast  as it is  i m basically tuning into a high functioning alcoholic in an attempt to cope with this insanity   i am attached to being in japan  but i m beginning to question it as job hunting isn t going anywhere  it s very difficult to even think about making a choice to go back to my home country  i love exploring here and love the nature  all the stuff i didn t care for back home  i have an attachment to japan that i never had to anything or anywhere before  but work is grinding me into the dust every single day   and the kicker  this company is very highly rated on japanese workplace review sites online as a  progressive  workplace   kill me now ,otv7ie
277,Some good news for me,so i've been applying to fire departments in the region since i got all my certifications done recently  the problem is that it's an insanely competitive career and so you have a ton of people trying out for a very limited number of open positions  i'm talking 2-3 slots at a time with anywhere from 300-800 applicants  i digress though  since i'm seeking employment elsewhere while applying to as many departments as i can   i landed a job at a party supply business right around the corner  literally within 3 minutes of where i live  i could skateboard bike walk to work and not even break a sweat  i've been looking for jobs similar to what i've had in the past  which is mostly driving and delivery  so this is par for the course  they make about  500k a month in season  and i'd be paid  16 an hour starting    the interview was typical   we're looking for the outgoing type  you really gotta treat this job like your life depends on it  this isn't just a 9-5  this is a  full-time  gig  the lady really drove home the fact that i'd have to be available at all hours of the day since rental equipment would need to be delivered and retrieved at any time  what got me was that she told me that sometimes i'd be delivering 4-5 hours away from home  and i might need to stay in a hotel from time to time  after telling her that i have a 6 month old baby  she also told me that they're looking for about 25 drivers for the season since they laid off most of them last year  i told her that i'd really need about  18 an hour for something so demanding but that was quickly ignored   so i took the job  did the pee test  and i start tomorrow  this lady even had the nerve to call me at 8pm tonight to remind me of the time that i'd need to be there  i immediately think to myself  this is the kind of place that's gonna hound me off the clock   so they're expecting me at 10am tomorrow    what they don't know is that i called a good friend of mine shortly after that lady called me  to catch up with him  and he offered me  19 an hour to work with under him instead  he said he goes fishing on his lunch break  we can talk bluegrass and country music since we're both musicians  i can finally look forward to working since i'll have a friend with me   i immediately took the position  i can now afford to keep paying for an overpriced apartment  i'm still struggling  but this is literally the best news i've had in a long  long while    i didn't tell this company that they're gonna need to find someone else  they can go suck an egg ,otptg8
278,I'm so done.,so i'm typing this from my night job  which i recently was recalled to after 16 months of covid related layoff  my hours here are 10pm-6am  i've been mulling over in my head for the last half hour emailing in sick to my day job  which i started about 2 months ago  it's a corporate environment  and as you would expect we started off working from home- only to be called to start reporting to the office 3 weeks ago by an overzealous branch manager  we had initially been told to expect to come back after labour day  and that is still the companies  goal  so i've been working 2 full time jobs for 3 weeks  why  well because my night job told me i might not be full time when i was recalled  only to start scheduling me full time that very week  i can't drop to part time- they have been clear if we don't like the terms of our recalled positions  we are welcome to take a hike    i was mentally phrasing out an email in my mind to tell the honest truth- after 3 days of split-shift training for the day job  classes from 9-12  then 530-930pm  i'm utterly exhausted even more so then would be expected working 2 jobs  i can't drive safely  i can barely keep my eyes open  and my spine feels like a bent and rusty piece of rebar  and it struck me that my day boss simply won't care  sure  there's a good chance i'll get the day off- probably told to cash in a vacation day rather then a sick  but regardless  it will forever become a black mark for  the management  to hold against me     that doesn't show great work ethic   he's not a team player    the company i work for by day can come off as near-fanatical sometimes with all the slogans and  initiatives  we are expected to know and pretend to care about  to say nothing of the borderline worship of random bureaucratic figures within the company itself  my record there in the short time i have worked for them is not stellar- i was told off for leaving an hour early one day  and was late last week  overslept an hour while trying to nap between jobs  it would probably be an overreaction to claim my boss has something out for me  but she's the type of person to focus heavily on this type of thing and expect work to be our top priority    to switch topics a bit  i've had 9 jobs since i was laid off due to covid in march 2020  each of them sucked in their own unique and painful way  but the grass is always greener and so i kept moving along  i came out of last year with a pile of debt  a car in need of major repairs  and just this total lack of motivation  working 2 jobs is just barely going to let me pay off those debts in the next month  but i want out now  i want to quit both  just drive all day for doordash  which is work i actually don't mind- if not for the fatal flaw that short of working 12  hours a day  it simply does not pay enough to live on- sometimes  not enough to break even on gas    this is a whole twisted up rant but i just need to get it off my chest  i feel like my family and friends are  rightly tired of hearing me complain about my work- but i just need something to give here  i'm going to email my manager now and tell them i'm having the day off tomorrow  and when i wake up in the late afternoon  try and figure out which job to quit as a first step towards a marginally healthier work life balance  if any of you read this whole thing  i really appreciate you taking the time ,otslgp
279,This Simone Biles situation just shows how obsessed we are as a people with work.,i dont care how prestigious the position is  at the end of the day being an olympian is just being like a really really well paid employee of the month  her job is to be a gymnast   considering that her mental health challenges were causing her to feel disorientated in the air she had a risk of getting a life-changing injury if she landed on her neck or did some damage to her spine  why is she expected to sacrifice not only her mental health but also the only body she will ever have  that could get permanently damaged for a job   she has already won gold medals for the us  she's literally reached the peak of being an athlete and got to the highest position you can get  what more do the pathetic cheerleaders of capitalism want  are we supposed to just work no matter what even after we've become the best of the best   it's so ridiculous  the way the average man  who is really a victim of this scheme  so violently believes in and tries to force others into capitalist thinking is beyond belief ,otggxf

287,Frustrated with the pay scale,so when i was in my early 20s i was lucky to get 10-11 a hour being a cna or working at a hospital  i decided to get a career so i took insurance classes and got my license  it was a way to better myself without paying for a bunch of classes to earn a degree that could possibly not pay more than it cost me to pay off a student loan  but i have been in the insurance business for 5 years  i don't really want to be in sales anymore but all the service positions are 12 a hour at best  i tried to negotiate with a company but they would not budge  it's very frustrating companies don't pay more for experience and skills anymore ,otaxa7

315,Social debt - an Alternative to universal basic income,government is inherently wasteful  but private corporations are inherently greedy and inefficient from the perspective of the customer  they're efficient for the capital owner   what if everybody had a bank account that started in debt from birth and every government service you use dips into that account  so if you get medical care your debt goes minus  so rather than give everybody money and try to find a way of paying for it  we put you into debt by  20 000 a year and you pay 60 -80  tax on any amount above that to pay back your debt to society   rather than paying back banks  you're paying back society and everybody has enough to survive   apparently taxes for the wealthiest were huge in the 1960s  like 90  but i'm sure they worked their way around it  or as they did in recent times change law to lower the tax rate through lobbying   rather than owing private interests like banks we can owe society and that should be more equitable form of debt because other people are helping you survive   student loans are the most similar but if everybody received money in the form of debt  then prices will go up like the price of education went up as academic institutions realised the government was a blank check   if i could get a life funding mortgage of 30 years for  250 000 i could survive for 23 years with my bills  as long as i don't have to pay a bit off every month i could have free time for years at a time   i could study  research  write  draw  create  innovate at my own pace  and receive a higher salary later in life if people offered me this credit   would you lend your money and invest in a person's economy economic output of their life  ,otchvx

327,Vacation days that were already approved REMOVED because of their mistake.,i just started at this company last september  they gave me a form with benefits etc  part of it was pto summary which outlined how much i would get and when  i get 4 batches my first year and then after this year i'll start getting all of it at once in january   so every 3 months since september i've been getting pto  i am taking 4 days right after labor day to go on vacation out of state  which is already all planned and booked  apparently  according to my boss  they  accidentally  gave me too much pto in my first few batches  so he went in and removed 2 of my 4 days that were already approved and said not only that but i will not get a final batch in september like i was supposed to    i can  only  schedule vacation if the system says i have it  so everything i scheduled was with time it said i had  not only that but i told him i was pissed because now i have no time for the rest of the year apparently when i was under the impression i would be getting more days in september    i spoke with hr and they are auditing my time and discussing what to do about it  is this my fault  am i wrong to be absolutely seething with rage that this dude just straight up canceled two of my days that were already approved  also  i generally use my days simply because i know i'm about to get more  but now i'm not i guess  if i was promised pto in september shouldn't they give it to me regardless of if they screwed up and gave me more time than they meant to earlier in the year ,otng2d

364,The Missing Parts of Capitalism,here's what i've been thinking right  i'm curious what any of y'all think about this  the 3 major parts of a capitalist economy is land  labor and capital  i believe to have a comfortable economic life  you need to have a balance of all 3  the typical problem is when someone has only labor to offer  but no land or capital  the purpose of capital is for an individual to own assets that make money for the owner while they are not actively working  this is basically passive income  labor is self explanatory as we all know what that means  last one is land  land i think is one of the most important because  land gives the opportunity to survive without the support of larger society  lose your job  that's fine  tend to your land  grow food  maybe have some farm animals  so basically if you lose the ability of labor or capital  you can still support yourself  the reason why for alot of us nowadays that are struggling financially and hating labor is because it's all we got  the general public does not own land  it's rented or leased  or mortgaged  the general public does not own capital  so we are completely dependant on labor  which is dangerous  now the issue i feel is for people to gain access to land and capital  i feel like if an individual got access to those missing parts of capitalism  that has the potential to help solve quite alot of issues  what do you think ,ot99gn

Also, the concept of independence is a scam.",firstly  i know that many people do not have a good relationship with their family and staying at home would be detrimental to their mental health  i'm definitely not looking down on those people  these are just my reflections  also  my family are definitely not rich   i am 24 and lived alone for a short time whilst at uni  when i graduated i came back home and i now live with my mum and sister  my internship is coming to an end this week and i'm applying for other jobs but i'm not having a meltdown  and that's simply because i live at home  this benefits my mum in that i contribute to the rent and bills and buy food and stuff for my sister when i can  this benefits me because i don't have to do this stuff if i can't  she actually encourages me to take a break from work  and i know that doing that won't mean i go hungry and end up on the streets   we're all familiar with the idea that once you're 18 you fuck off out of the house and see your parents once every however  i grew up in the uk where this is the common mindset but i'm a poc and when i explain that i enjoy living at home to my white friends they're like    and these are people who are happy living with their families  have good homes and everything they could want but still want to move out to a smaller shittier house and shackle themselves to having constant full-time work in order to survive because of 'independence'  i've lived alone  i've lived with strangers and i've lived with casual friends and living with my family by far beats any of these other arrangements  i save money  i'm around people that love and support me  live in a relatively big house and have my own space    and yet i feel guilty for living at home  i'm not a mooch  cook  clean  financially contribute and yet there seems to be this underlying judgement when i tell people i live at home because i want to and not because i can't afford to move out ,oth4er

373,Need help with argument for min wage raise,this is a genuine post  and i'm busy battling contrarians on a separate social platform   their response to my  there is no labor shortage  there is a minimum wage shortage  is the following   looking for good solid counterpoints        person https nextdoor com profile 7384099 is mention   a   if people are not taking these above min wage jobs  what good does a national min wage do   examples  - walmart just announced free college - walmart paying  15 for fulfilling e-commerce orders - mcdonalds is raising salaries - chic filet has always paid far above minimum wage - chipotle is raising food prices to accommodate increased salaries - ice cream scoopers starting pay is  11 hr - also happening  national fast food chains automating restaurants  less jobs  - retail has almost completely automated the self checkout  less jobs  - online ordering is growing for these same retailers but do they need the same staff levels to support the predicted ordering volume   probably not    person https nextdoor com profile 7384099 is mention   b   all evidence to the contrary you want to say there is no shortage  talk to any recruiter or hiring manager  they are dying for qualified candidates to fill positions  never in my life have i seen restaurants offering a signing bonus to come to work  looks at the facts  if you realized how many entry-level jobs have been eliminated by artificial minimum wages  you d have a different opinion on that subject  simply mandating a higher minimum does not make an employee more valuable to the business  just more costly  if the value isn t there you cannot expect a business to sustainably pay more  the math is real  not ideological  if raising the minimum wage was a good idea why not make it  50 hour   1   person https nextdoor com profile 7384099 is mention   a   look at job listings on linkedin  check how many  applied  to each job  the numbers are lowest i have ever seen  it s bizarre   person https nextdoor com profile 7384099 is mention   b   wages have been rising for a few years now for the simple and obvious fact of supply and demand  employers are offering more because qualified candidates are scarce  no surprise    person https nextdoor com profile 7384099 is mention   a   i agree but it s just weird because we are witnessing an unprecedented increase in benefits and wages for the largest employers all which have occurred in less than 12 months so weird and wild that a person would still be talking about the negative political talking point all while consumers are literally paying for the wage increases of low skilled labor via price increases   example  chipotle  also  what created the  supply and demand  issues of low skilled labor all of a sudden  didn t seem to be a problem 4th qtr of 2019 ,otgbpq

376,My situation is great but still sucks,i work in upper management  i make 6 figures  i have a flexible schedule and a lot of autonomy   i made a decision a few months back to stop working  just to see if anyone noticed   i come into work  go to my office  and watch youtube videos all day  i attend meetings but i have stopped offing solutions  so far no one seems to care   i did this because of the way the lower-paid employees are treated  we have people here that are working 7 days a week because the pay we give them is so bad they have to do to get by  it is outrageous    the owner of the company has a  cheap  audi he drives to work so people don't see his  real cars  that it would take our average working 10 years to afford     he is building a new summer house close to the office that has a 4000sq first floor    these people that work for him are meaningless and i am thinking about putting my job on the line to let the world know  i doubt it will change anything but i feel like it would make me feel better   when i am not watching youtube i spend my time talking to our  working  class  i ask them what they would do with their time if they had 3 million dollars  one lady said she would garden all day  i asked her why she was working here and not doing season gardening work  she quit a few days ago to learn how to run her own landscaping company  a win for me  i told her that she should send the owner a sympathy card for his loss of a great employee  i hope she does     amp x200b   i'm making suggestions to people that when they estimate how long it will take to complete a task they should double that time because the owner doesn't need any more money    i want to expose this bullshit for what it is  unfettered greed  but i might have too much fear to do it    amp x200b   throwaway,otc52s
377,Finally,i'm working for a company getting paid minimum wage  breaking my back 10 hours a day  sometimes more because the boss always gives more tasks when the day is done  we have little to no staff for these big jobs we're doing so it always has to be done fast because god forbid we have to work another day at the same site and deny the boss of his sweet sweet money that would otherwise be on another jobsite    i get up usually 2 hours before i leave so i can relax  have breakfast and just scroll thru reddit or whatever  this is my relaxing time of the day  because when i come home i'm usually to tired to do anything but sleep  then the cycle repeats again    i handed it my resignation  also on the letter was about my paid holiday leave which the boss probably skipped right over because he never brought it up to me   the only thing he asked was if i was still working for the 1 month i had left   luckily i'm nearly out of this job and let me tell you  this is the happiest i've felt in a very long time  the massive boost it gives me to know that i'll finally delete their numbers  never get those texts an hour before i'm about to go to sleep telling me that i'll be working in the morning  is the greatest feeling a man can have ,otq8n2
378,I'm so scared for my mom,my mom's been working at this university as an it professional for about 2-3 years  she's constantly doing great things for it  going above and beyond  she gets paid about 35k a year  theyve dangled this promotion and raise over her head for 2 years  and the other week  they talked to her about a new promotion  she hasn't even gotten her first one    she's 47  at any other university  she'd be making 3-4 times the amount she's making there  she has such a good resume and amount of experience  it would blow so many others out of the water  she was a cisadmin not too long ago  she has no money for retirement  i'm so scared for her  our family is trying to tell her that if she doesn't get the first promotion by december to just leave  i get the loves her coworkers and how well they treat her on a personal level  but if she isn't getting paid well enough to live really comfortably  there isn't a good point   she thankfully is treated well in other aspects  such as being allowed to take time off whenever  they're very family oriented in that way  she could just say  oh my nephew's in town  or  my daughter is sick  and they'd tell her to go home on pto   i just want her to be paid nice for fucks sake  i dont want to see her working at 80  i'm sorry if my wording is bad  i just woke up  i'm scared i'll end up in the same spot with my dream job ,otymmh

394,Rejected the best offer I’ve ever gotten because the manager is a massive bigot who hates his employees,posting this here cause it s my only social media not linked to my name    i was recently contacted unprompted by a recruiter on linkedin regarding an assistant site manager position at a rental car company at my nearby airport  she interviewed me over the phone the next day and things seemed okay  so i agreed to interview with the site manager under whom i d be working  he called me the next day  we spoke for about half an hour  mostly chatting to see if we could get along  seemed like a cool enough guy  agreed to an interview the next day  knowing i was under-qualified but still eager to practice  i thought nothing at the time about that quick interview turnover    the in person interview the next day was where things took a turn  i showed up for the interview and the first thing i noticed was the striking difference in demographics between the employees and the managers  an entirely white management team presiding over a nearly entirely nonwhite staff isn t the end of the world  but it was the first red flag of  many  during the interview  the manager spent little time asking me questions  or even letting me talk  instead he complained throughout the interview about   - his muslim employees - his latino employees - democrats  and particularly the president - unemployment benefits rather than assessing my qualifications  he seemed to want to ensure that i could jive with his hostile attitude towards his employees  to remain civil  i pretended  he spent about thirty minutes complaining about his muslim employees  prayer needs  saying he refuses to let them pray at work unless it s during a standard lunch or 15-minute break  multiple times he insinuated that they were lying about even needing to pray  and insisted they were instead  lazing around in the meditation room when they should be working  he also mentioned that most of the team is latino  following that immediately with  i understand cultural differences can be a real thing  but we have a serious laziness problem here  nobody wants to do anything  he unsurprisingly had an employee barge into his office and quit  during the interview  because he had shouted at said employee right in front of me for a minor mistake when i first arrived    later on in the interview  he asked me about my political affiliation and religious beliefs  i know that is unacceptable  but my brain shut down and i engaged semi-honestly with his questions  evidently i gave the right answers because he offered me a job that night  despite having said he had more interviews scheduled for the next day  at a salary higher than i ve ever been paid  at first i was over the moon  but then i dwelt on it for a few days  as i initially saw it  my choices were to either accept the job and try to make working conditions better for the people under him or reject it and let them continue to be abused  i was super torn  but eventually decided i couldn t stomach working under someone so hateful  i replied all to the group email i d received with the offer letter  this included his manager  the hr director for the state  and the corporate recruiter who d first contacted me  here is what i said  names redacted for obvious reasons   hey  everyone   i m sorry to do this  but it seems i m going to have to respectfully decline the offer  thank you for choosing me for the role  i believe i would have done an excellent job  but for a number of reasons it feels like a less-than-perfect fit   asshole  it struck me as unprofessional that you spent such a chunk of our interview complaining about the prayer needs of your muslim employees  everything you had to say about your team told me you see yourself as a boss of inferiors rather than as a leader of a team  which is a management style i can neither emulate nor work under  i sincerely wish you luck in finding the right candidate   best wishes   5th times the charm   about five minutes later  i received a reply from the recruiter who d first contacted me  she asked if i had a few minutes that afternoon to speak with her  i said yes  she called shortly thereafter  on the phone  she pressed for as much information as i could give her about what the manager had said during the interview  she wanted to know every word to the best of my recollection  when we d finished speaking  she asked if i d be willing to consider working for the company under another manager  or if i could relocate to one of their other sites  i said yes  and now i m waiting on a response  i don t know if he will be fired  or even disciplined  i suppose only time will tell    i m not sure why i m posting this  i don t want a pat on the back  i m not even sure if i did the right thing  part of me feels like i d have done better by accepting the job  documenting his behavior  and  then  reporting him to hr  nonetheless  i am where i am with it now  there s no changing the past  i ll keep this post updated  please let me know if you think there s something else i should have done  or could still do  i ve been wrestling with this all week and see no end in sight ,otkx7u

400,We need to make a change,i just read the mythology of work which is pinned on the sub and nothing has ever resonated with me like this has  if you haven t read it please do  that said i don t want to live in a world like this and don t think anyone else should have to either  the world is one big fugazi and there is unimaginable suffering on a global scale for the 99  people are more separated than ever and that will only continue to get worse  status  religion  instilled beliefs etc  it s undeniable that all of us has felt like meaningless cogs in the machine given we are here  the 1  have had their time will watch the world burn  we need to take control of our lives  stop dedicating them to others goals and ambitions for the sake of profit and at the cost of your happiness  otherwise what s the point  i m not advocating for any system here as they all have someone on the top with progress to be made   so long as we live in profit progress driven world there will always be unhappiness  oppression of everyone out of the norm  homelessness  insufferable stress  only those who seek power and wealth above all else will always be at the top    the fact that the only option we ve been given to survive is to work with no escape option other than death or retirement strikes unimaginable fear and anger in me  we also have no option on changing the system in any meaningful way like we are hoping for  this should make your blood boil   so what do we do  stop consuming  stop giving the banks money  a mass exodus   given that conglomerates are above the government i don t see them doing anything in our favour ever  there has to be something we can do  something more than fucking memes and rants about our shitty jobs and capitalism or telling each other to find different prospects  this sub was entrancing at first  i was subconsciously putting off the idea the my misery was because i would spend most of my time at a meaningless job and most of my free time studying to better myself at work believing i was finally doing something with my life  this sub made me realize that and that there is more to life out there  yet many here are adamant on defending a 40 hour work week or advocating a shorter work week and not the abolishment of meaningless and exploitative work  why  work is not necessary for survival and i don t care how hard you ve worked to get where you are  this idea of fuck you  i got mine is disgusting  our lives have been stolen and we have continue to be fed the big lie with no control over our lives and seem to be fine with it  we are disposable and work has divided us  the government isn t going to do anything to help us  the opposite in-fact  our choices don t matter and the game is rigged,otkz34

406,Need advice. An old boss keeps texting me.,so i worked for a startup for a few years in college  i will not name him or the company obviously    i thought he was a cool guy at first but then i realized he was a dick  he treats his employees like trash too  the day i quit  he immediately offered 1 000 a month for my successor on social media  during covid  he would kinda pressure me into working long after till 11 at night with no pay  i only did it because i still believed in the company  looking back  this was stupid  i sacrificed weekends to be on zoom with him  it's stupid  but this was the first time i worked for a startup and in my hearts  i hope i was jumping on the next facebook    he puts his workers through incredibly unrealistic expectations and unfortunately  i have been the receiving end of being scolded and it happened a few times  i am admittedly sensitive to being yelled at  and i almost cried  he was the type that i felt scared to be around    i quit on a whim with a one-day notice in october last year  i couldn't take it anymore  i was really depressed and attempted suicide in august  my family still doesn't know that happened  he threatened to come to my house that morning and i thought about calling the cops  he  unfortunately  knows where i live    so  he has texted sporadically over the last year  i will not lie  every time i see a text from him  i kinda freak out  he has texted twice the past week or two and it makes me so uncomfortable knowing that his business has probably been struggling  i and another friend  who owns a startup himself  that worked with him have speculated this  i can feel the hidden agenda    i have been nice to him every time he has texted me  when he texts it often feels out of the blue  i have decided to stop engaging with him from now on but my worst fear is that he comes to my house and has been known to make surprise appearances  i could be making a deal out of nothing but i don't want to be harassed  do you think i'm making the right move by not engaging him   it is because of this experience  that i came to realize just how bullshit corporate culture is ,osvfmd

417,You could give me $10million today and I'd still be miserable.,there comes a point when your situational depression turns into  just  depression  there comes a point when workplace anxiety becomes  just  anxiety  whenever you become saturated in negative emotions the cause of those emotions doesn't even need to be present anymore  your mind becomes so molded by a sour disposition that it just stays there no matter what good things may come your way   here i find myself making a very decent middle class living at a mid-level job working as an electrical designer after years of shit work and shit pay  i thought i made it  i thought my hard work paid off  but i think back to my happiest times in my life a few years ago and i was making half the salary i make now  but back then i had time to explore my interests  once 5 00pm hit and i left my office it felt like my day was really just starting   now i get paid more  but my responsibilities have gone far past what i believe any healthy human being could handle  if it weren't for a steady supply of alcohol and cannabis i don't know how i'd get through each day   i understand that only i am responsible for my well-being  but the older and more experienced i get i start to realize that the problems wrecking society aren't based in politics or a system of economics  they're based on a toxic culture of people who think a subservient attitude will somehow pay off  i see this in the poor and the rich  young and old  educated and non-educated  and until something fundamentally changes in the way we think  it doesn't matter how big the wealth divide is  or who you vote for  or how much money you make  you will never accomplish enough   i truly believe you could give me  10million right now and it wouldn't make me any happier  at least not right away  i have been too molded by selling my soul for a few bucks and it has started to shape every thought i have ,ot1atz
418,Decided to quit my job after only a week of working there,this is a lot but here me out  i recently graduated college and i got a job working at a movie theater  regal cinemas  the commute is about 45 minutes to an hour on public transportation and i get paid minimum wage  most of what i'm doing is usher work which involves cleaning the theaters  taking out the trash  and cleaning the bathrooms    the first day on the job the manager who hired me told us he's switching to another theater  why  didn't say  but that raised a huge red flag for me  what kind of manager just up and leaves the theater after hiring seven new employees  the other people said that  he was always planning on leaving before you got hired  but i don't believe that shit    my coworkers were pretty chill for the most part  however  we would often get into contests of  who has it worse  whenever we mention how unhappy we were at the job  it stunned me how it's apparently cool to brag about working two jobs the exhaustion because one job isn't enough to sustain you  what kind of world is it the norm to brag about working excessive hours for minimum pay  apparently this one  one of my coworkers chastised me for accepting to go home early when they over-scheduled me   the managers and supervisors were either unremarkable or downright scummy  my shift leader tried to make me take my meal break  an hour into my shift  when i told him that it was too early  he gives me an attitude and makes me stand at the ticket booth  and i mean stand  for the rest of my shift before sending me home early  if he doesn't do that  he constantly follows me around and waits until i don't look busy to send me off on some stupid busywork errand like sweeping the leaves outside the theater in the middle of summer   my real passion has always been writing  it's stupid  and you can all laugh at me  but i thought i could at least write after work   nope  the job made me super exhausted due to the irregular hours and schedule  i never had consistent days off and my weekends were constantly booked  needless to say  i became super depressed almost immediately    i began to resent almost everyone there  my managers  my supervisors  even some of my coworkers for defending the management for giving us pointless and stupid busywork  i contemplated hurting myself because i felt so out of control with my life  i couldn't write because i was too drained  i started looking at this sub because i couldn't stand everyone's complacent attitudes    on wednesday i'm going in with my letter of resignation  my job clothes  and my name tag and telling them i quit  i only worked here a week and i never plan to work in a soul-sucking hellhole like this again  people told me to find another job before i quit but i can't stand another day  i fucking hate regal and i hope they go out of business  if that means i'll be unemployed for another month or two i don't care  maybe my mental health will recover after being treated like a disposable dishrag  if i'm disposable  i guess they don't need me anymore      tl dr  my movie theater job sucked the soul out of me and i'm quitting  i hate the commute  the pay  and the schedule  i hope that company goes out of business along with amc ,ot2hsl

422,Tale of the four eternal brothers and the creation of money,in a time before time there existed four brothers who later became all the humans though not in equal proportion   the first brother said  what we all must do is relax and have an easy time   the second brother said  no  we all should make good things for our use   the third brother said  no  we all should rule and subdue all whom we can   the fourth brother said  no  we should all study and learn how things really are   they kept fighting about whose plan was superior and they all had good arguments   when their father came to know about their quarrel  he called the brother to him who liked to study   the father said   i've called you because your mind is set to learning  so you will listen to me without interrupting   the fourth brother  whose name was scholar  replied   i knew that i was the best   the father said   i repent already  look you're not the best  but you are the best one for me to talk with  so keep quiet and listen   scholar said   okay    here's what you will do  the father said   you will tell your brothers about my will    the third brother who wants to rule  tell him that his name is courageous king  his duty will be to subdue and rule over his two younger brothers and give them protection from wild beasts and each other in return    and the second brother who wants to create  tell him that his name is inspired entrepreneur  his duty will be to give work to his younger brother and give his choicest inventions to king  who will share them with you    and the youngest brother who wants to rest  tell him his name is faithful servant  his duty will be to do all the work his elder brothers give him without questioning or complaining   scholar said   but they won't listen to me   father said   they will  i'm with you   scholar said   what's my full name   father said   i'll tell you later   so scholar went and told the plan to his brothers  they all refused him outright  but with cunning language he told them how this plan will work in their favor  servant fell asleep during this explanation  so scholar managed to convince only entrepreneur and king   then entrepreneur said to king   our youngest brother is too lazy i don't know how we could ever convince him   king said   should i scare him into submission   scholar said   no need for that  you just give the power to entrepreneur to create money out of nothing   king and entrepreneur both asked together   what's money   scholar said   you just write on paper a numeric value and with my magic i will make the servant slave to it   they were shocked   you can do that  with just a piece of paper   so the scholar gave them a brief lecture on the economy   you will both have to keep pretending that money has value and servant will fall for it  he's delusional anyway  but the real value will be in all the things that the servant will produce under the guidance of entrepreneur and under the protection of king  if servant gets as much numeric value as there are commodities then there will be a shortage of commodities for the three of us so just make sure to keep servant always longing for more money using it as a perpetual carrot on a stick  but never fall for the delusion yourself or you'll both become like him   then they woke up the youngest brother and told him   look our father has given us a magical thing called money which contains all the good that we were all looking for  but we all need to work for it as it is very rare ,osjqar

429,"Manager keeps being unprofessional in communicating with me, we took it to HR",i work part-time and my daily schedule is from 9am to 1pm every day  i had my vaccine on monday and until the end of that week i was still suffering the side effects  my boss and boss's boss know about this  i agreed i skip tuesday and wednesday and compensate for them on thursday and friday   the days i work 8 hours  i need me to come to the office  but the days i work for 4 hours   i work from home    so on thursday  i woke up and i couldn't make it because of the side effects  i genuinely could not move  so i texted him half an hour before my shift starts that i can't make it and i will work from home today  monday i will compensate these hours   he replied with a long ass message saying that this is a business and we need to respect our duties and know our rights etc  he said that it was against the policy and the policy says at least 1 hours before the shift starts  he then followed it by saying that i am being irresponsible for telling him i won't make it half an hour before the shift starts  and he said to show more responsibility next time   had he stopped at telling me that it's against the company's policy to report not being able to make it 30 minutes before the shift starts  and politely asked me to pay attention next time or be more careful with this  i could've nodded in confirmation and moved on   but this guy gave me a speech on how great the company is  and how i am an irresponsible person  and honestly  that was  at least for me  unnecessary   so  we talked about this for the next few hours  and decided to take it to hr  it turned out into a heating argument on him being careless with what he says and me having standards on how business communication should take place  on the next monday  we had the meeting    amp x200b   they said that it was my fault for sending a late notice  and i need to pay more attention in the future  but i'm excused because i had the vaccine and things happen unexpectedly so they gave a pass   as for him  he shouldn't have used the words that he used while issuing a warning feedback  they understand he has a lot of work to do and responsibility and that can weigh down on the person and make them say things they're not supposed to  so he's also excused   moving forward  they asked me to put everything to writing and plan accordingly  and for him   they agreed with me that saying  you're irresponsible  be more responsible next time  whether literally or implicitly  is uncalled for   they asked him to be concise and straightforward when talking to me  to not use adjectives or put qualifications whatsoever on anything that i do  there was no need to put an adjective on the act  whether irresponsible  childish  disappointing whatever  no need to describe it  you mention it to illustrate then you talk on what to do next  which we absolutely did   they said to be more professional and neutral while talking with me   they said that other employees it might be okay to take such words and people are different and have different thresholds  in this case  it was offensive to me and that's enough   it's just ridiculous how this guy talks to me and the rest of the team    in my short 4 years office experience no one has ever spoken to me like that and i don't and i won't tolerate anyone speaking to me like that  i'm here to work  not to holler names and adjectives at people like it's high school   a job is a place to conduct professional work  therefore communication must be straightforward  honest and short to save everyone's time and energy  you talk about the job and the job only  no need to make anything you do  good or bad  personal like in the above case  you're not here to feel better about yourself or feel bad neither  you're not here to judge people on what they do or  to state facts  you're not here to put other people in place or whatever  you're here to work  any stress event must be eradicated   whether the employee is doing a shitty or a good job  there are official protocols to follow on how to deal with them  and calling them irresponsible is not one of them   fun fact  a colleague described him as a dog who barks and never bites because of how  emotional  he gets and how offensive his speech is  i saw him in the office the other day  he asked a colleague to send a request to someone else  so the colleague pulled up teams and started typing the request  rookie mistake  the manager was like   you need to do it through email  everything must be done through emails  and he went on for at least a freaking minute  that'd have honestly made me mad   send it in an email  would have sufficed ,ot7baf

473,Would you work if you were paid by percentage of profit?,it would automatically raise pay based on how much the company makes  so inflation wouldn't be a problem  and many other work benefits would come out of this  for example  walmart makes  129billion a year  if they set aside 40  to put back into the company  or their pocket  and money was split evenly  every employee would make  51 600 year   this is before tax and not accounting for temps or part time workers  and assumes everyone makes the same  seems like a good idea to me ,ot5sg7

475,A question on legality (and kind of a rant),i ll start by saying i live in a right-to-work state  so i used to work for a very successful  large  and high volume veterinary clinic that was owned by a family  i started in the kennel at a generous  11 hr  pretty high starting pay for the job in my area  and after about 7 months i was offered to train as a veterinary technician  so going from walking dogs and scooping poop to assisting in surgery  managing hospital cases  handling controlled drugs etc  i was not offered a raise when i completed the training time  but since i had only been there less than a year i didn t think too much about it   years go by and i excelled at the job by quite a bit  to toot my own horn a tad   most of the doctors by this point came to rely on me heavily every shift  i became slightly irked at my lack of a raise through the entire time  one day i decided i was going to reach out to the owner and ask for a raise  i was told i needed to wait for our next reviews  i was fairly irritated at this point as i had 5 years of fantastic reviews  but didn t push it too hard  after a series of events that had me working 16  hours a day for 9 days in a row for a few weeks i decided to push the subject again  it was obvious the owner was irritated at this  but given the circumstances  we had become severely understaffed suddenly  and the fact my technician manager and every other doctor  including the owners son and daughter  backed me up he yielded and i was bumped up to  15 hr  roughly 2 months later i was 4 hours late to a shift due to driving my wife  at the time  to a psychiatric facility after a suicide attempt  everyone was super understanding and nice  2 weeks later i get my paycheck and it s substantially lower than expected and i realized i was paid minimum wage with no warning or anything  i emailed the owner after days of failing to get him on the phone asking why and he responded  while cc ing every doctor and manager at the practice  that my tardiness and  lack of focus  was the reason for my pay cut for that pay period  every single person included in that email disagreed with him  after a few conversations with him i told him i would not be continuing my employment there after my already established schedule  to which he responded  too late ur already fired  i was pissed at his lack of appreciation for me busting my ass for 5 years for him at the time  but as time has gone by i find myself more and more pissed at the sudden  no warning pay cut as a punishment and that i was conditioned so well to not even question the legality of the move   was that even legal    i now work remotely in a job i barely ever even talk to my manager and thinking back on what all happened at the clinic just puts a sour taste in my mouth for most employment options where i have to deal with power horny owners who get a kick out of flexing their superiority against the hired peons     ooph  i ve never talked about the situation before because i truly loved the field and everyone i worked closely with there so it s been a painful subject  felt good to get that out ,ot6ioa

499,I work for a certain chain of ‘charitable’ thrift stores.,     i am a cashier soon to be promoted to assistant manager  ive only worked here for less than three months and booooy oh boy  theres a lot to unpack here       to get things started on my first day with the store office somewhat to myself  i decided to learn the surroundings of the spot  you know  where all the important papers are supposed to go  what order to file the docs in  all that stuff  just so i know for the future if there is one to be had         i found this packet that was filed separately from some other docs all by itself  most docs that im not allowed to read have that clearly stated at the very top and that was not there so i figured hey why not skim through        it was exit interviews from every employee that quit our store in the whole year of 2020  you may think   hm there cant be a lot of them right  its just one store  wrong  i counted 19 of them  all but one of them had the exact same reasons for leaving  they might as well have been exact duplicates of each other         - store manager is obnoxiously rude and intentionally pressured me into quitting by harassing me constantly and sabotaging my work         - store manager cursed and screamed at me over me simply doing my job the way she had previously told me to do it        - store manager made fun of me to other employees and insulted me directly about my disability        all these and more of similar kind  i mean shit ive only worked there a short time and ive already witnessed very similar situations on several occasions  there are four regular customers who all refer to her as  the witch         she even tried it with me but i never stand for it  when she starts her barrage of insults i just cut her off mid sentence and explain why i was doing whatever it was that got her frustrated          for instance i called for a cash drop over the radio specifically to her  she never showed up  i was busy with customers so it ended up being an hour and a half before i decided fuck it  the cash has to go into the safe and im not waiting all day to do it  and i went back to the office and did so myself while she was fuming about me leaving the sales floor for a measly 36 seconds  yes i timed it im very anal about time           what the fuck is wrong wi-  she began to say before i cut in with  cash goes in the safe  youve made me wait long enough  she just did her trademark   grunt growl thing she does cuz she knows shes barking up the wrong tree with me           not to mention she has directly referred to me as slow  stupid  and useless to my face and told another employee that i act like a serial killer when im just plain quiet by nature   there were 24 customer complaint records from 2020 as well  she is also refusing to hire on the now missing help that we need  dividing up the work and hours from the now gone employees to all the other staff  none of us except her have had one week of normally scheduled hours with no overtime since the day i started  our cashiers are doing 47 hours a week while doing the stocker work  janitor work and store boss  own side work on top of the cashier stuff too   in summary  d is a spiteful and rude old crone that needs to choose between no longer treating her employees like slaves or just hanging up her whip and retiring so that maybe we can calm the fires shes set alight in peace  sorry ive ranted this long  i have more stories and probably more to come ,ot7bn1

524,"Any Methods for an ""Easy Exit""?",hi everyone   ever since i started working  saddest day of my life  i live for only one thing  early retirement  it is my dream  probably literally a dream as it is nearly impossible to happen  i set the bar at 40 which means that when i'm 40 that's it no more work no matter how easy or casual it is  i'm 25 now  i've been thinking of ways that could provide additional gain and let you retire early and so far none of them is valid  here are the ways i come up with    inheritance   you most probably know whether your parents or grand-parents are wealthy or not by now and if they are not  then this is not applicable  so  pure luck    lotto   pure luck    sports betting   pure luck    gambling   pure luck     start your own company   start your own business  develop an app or a mobile game  or anything  and once it's a hit  sell your company for millions of dollars and retire  it is capitalism at its finest until you become a hit  many sleepless nights and perhaps losing your morals  and becoming a hit from billions of apps requires even more luck than above    live on welfare   not valid if you are from a failed third-world country where even upper middle class barely survives  could be a seriously valid option if i was european    organizing for anti-work movement and becoming successful   work abolished for all  it is so impossible that i can't even dream or imagine it    ai revolution so no need for human labour   if this happens  basic income will probably be so low that everyone will fight for open rare human positions so not a solution and nearly impossible to happen    work really hard to save enough money   your boss can retire thanks to you and you can continue your slavery    onlyfans   this is geniunely valid  in fact  it is the most sensible option  if i start now  25  and do it for 15 years  it is possible to earn and save serious money  sadly  i am a male and with a fat body so no chance for me  who are attracted to these qualities are minority so not enough saving  and again  everyone joins of nowadays so fierce competition with millions like apps    suicide   for all the ways i come up with  this is the only one that retire me at 40  perhaps i should aim to have enough courage at 40 instead of saving money    f  up world   with global warming  or anything else  you name it  the world is so shit that everyone's goal will become to find enough water and to survive  no more work  this is the second most realistic option  see below for the most realistic one  but not sure if i prefer this to work  i could  ask me on a bad day    reality   work under someone until you are 70 and then die   so that's it  no way out  this could be a shitty post and if you consider it to be  i apologise from everyone  but i seriously can't think of a way to be out from work ,orwv6q

542,Existential crisis,i'm 25 years old  finishing a social sciences degree of 6 years  with some knowledge of programming languages  double citizenship  and i don't know what to do with my life  time is over  time to start wage-slaving  time to enter toxic office spaces and waste my days producing wealth for some rich asshole so i can get enough to luckily live somewhat comfortably  it doesn't feel worth it  my life has no meaning  i'm alone  scared  anxious  depressed  afraid of people and commitment  i don't have an official diagnosis but i suspect being on the autism spectrum  i don't know how i would be able to face life  to cope with adulthood now that i don't have any chances to hold back the job search anymore  this is it  and nothing has prepared me to face such a bleak existence  people don't understand this when i try to talk to them  they usually think i'm just a failure  a worker bee who should be crushed and molded by the system  or that i'm lazy  or that i'm immature   i just don't know how to cope with this  i have lived abroad for a year  and the experience at work was depressing  i still remember it and cringe  i can't socialize properly  i doubt my abilities constantly  i don't think i have any special skills or knowledge that would be useful to anybody  i just don't know where to start   the worst part is that i'm extremely conscious about the world  about our ridiculous fetishistic system  about the overconsumption paired with not having simple necessities met  about having to give 60  of my salary to some leech to have four walls around me while i sleep  about 8 hour workdays  constant competition  unemployment  when our technology level has progressed so much  i feel so alienated  so little  not as a human  but as a robot  a ghost  a joke  we have lost all relation to nature  to each other  every person is so superficial  so drawn by money  status  academic success  prestige  i just can't do it anymore  man  i think of suicide daily  when i go to sleep i pray to god never to wake up again  it may sound so stupid  so capricious  but i can't cope  i can't sustain this life  and there's no fucking alternative  no purpose  no will and not even any determination to go against the current  i'm defeated  destroyed  all my creativity faded away  i remember writing stories  drawing  playing with toys as a kid  and being so happy with so little  being fascinated about the universe  life on earth  history  structures  machines  and yet all of that means nothing when you see what an absurd existence this has become  how humanity managed to make  coping with life  a common phrase  and how my own will to live is being zapped away  never to come back  ultimately  i'm depressed about ending up like this  such a pathetic loser  unable to cope  unable to work on his dreams  because i have none left  i have no ideas  no talents  nothing else  i'm dead  i should have killed myself when i had the time  now i don't know if i could even do that  a corpse walking  faking it  pushing through useless assignments and tasks until i eventually die by my own hand   things are hard  man  there's something rotten about our existence  about these times  something i can't describe well  a sort of death of utopias  of dreams  that leaves us with resentment and depression   thanks for reading my pessimistic rant  i have nothing else to pour here but my honest assessment of things ,osagdm

546,Forcing employees to work 112 hours a week is inhumane and needs to be stopped.,backstory   i work at one of the largest steel mills in the us located in pennsylvania  we work 21 turns or 7 days a week  365 days a year  because production must go on  our employers are allowed to  force  us to work overtime to fill open turns due to call offs or understaffing   this was fine when we were slow and they allowed open turns to go unfilled  however  they upped the workload and now are requiring all turns to be filled  we are massively understaffed  in a department of 14 guys  we had 40 overtimes  this meant not all turns were even able to filled even with forcing  they suddenly started forcing us from home so we even lost our days off    this means that they are able to force you to work 16 hour days  7 days a week  that is equivalent to 112 hours of a 168 hour week   obviously  this is dangerous  people are forced to get lessened sleep and i alone  living about 45 minutes away  am able to get 4 hours of sleep after eating  showering  and saying hello and goodbye to your loved ones  that in itself is the worst part  i've went days without seeing my wife  it is hard on an individual   there is no governmental or state laws and regulations against this  i'm writing this to make people aware  everyone is seeking a cause nowadays  and this is as good of one as any   thanks for coming to my ted talk ,oshl5n

587,"Yeah, that'll make everything better (not)",my workplace has kept staff onsite through the pandemic citing  operation needs  last fall they laid off about 100 of us  the largest layoff we've ever seen  they keep saying  there is no guarantee that there will not be additional staff layoffs  they gave the higher-ups massive pay raises immediately after the layoffs  and now they want to celebrate our hard work over the past year with  lunch  a shitty cafeteria lunch that we have to eat during our lunch break while staying at the worksite so we can listen to people getting paid 10 times what we do spout a load of bs and pat themselves on the back  the company president gets a housing stipend worth at least twice the salary of anyone who had been laid off last fall  guess who got a increase to their housing stipend ,osb32p

590,"Those of you that do work, how do you stay motivated?",not sure if this is technically the right sub for this  but i'm posting here because i know many of you share the same feelings about the  9 to 5  as i do    i went to college to get away from labor intensive jobs  got a stem degree in a field that interests me and that i would even say i have passion towards  and now work a full time job in the field i graduated in  sounds like i'm successful right  unfortunately i'm pretty miserable  i went on a 3 day work trip last week out of state  doing extremely labor intensive work in the sun for long days  albeit still somewhat science based  and besides that  i just hate the 40 hour work week  especially with overtime  the money is not a driving force for me other than being necessary to eat and keep a roof over my head  yet again it seems as though i'm just being used as a pawn while the people in management make significantly more for significantly less work  i make none of my own decisions involving the work i do  nor the schedule i have  i'm exhausted at home and have no energy to do the things i actually care about    tl dr it's taken so much time  money and work just to get to this point  and yet i hate my job  one that many people i went to college with are currently struggling to obtain  so i'm asking those of you that hate the 9 to 5 as much as i do  how do you maintain a healthy enough mindset to do the best work you can  while being happy enough to want to continue doing it ,os56n0

596,"Ape, Together Strong. How I've setup my upward spiral, my advice and plans for a more hopeful future.",   i am still currently poor  but i believe i've reached the beginning of my upward spiral  below i will go over all of the things i ve learned and the steps i ve taken to feel that i ve finally reached my upward spiral and ideally you ll be able to take away a fraction of the hope for the future i currently feel  it s a long read  but i promise every word will be invaluable to you and well worth the time   the first thing you'll need is a  partner in crime  a homie or significant other who will stick by you through thick and thin  someone you can trust with your life and truly meld brains with  we formulate our thoughts through conversation  you may think you've thought hard about something until you begin to talk to someone else about it and realize there are some holes  the other person might show you the holes with their questions or you might find the holes as you talk about your ideas  the other person may even have the answers or exact perspectives you need to crystalize your thoughts and ideas into concrete plans   this accounts for the reason i m taking the time to write this out and post it for you all to read and criticize   the other reason for needing a  partner in crime  is that things are just expensive and it's easier to make rent with 2 people in a 2 bedroom apartment than it is for 1 person to make rent in a 1 bedroom apartment  or better yet 3-4 people in a 2 bedroom  this leads into the next point   get your monthly expenses as low as humanly possible  cancel your subscriptions like gym memberships  streaming services  amazon prime  and buy used cash cars to avoid  250 car payments   hell  until 3 months ago i didn't even have a phone plan and was just using messaging apps  cut your entertainment funds  stop buying games  movies  going out to bars  and things like that  you can afford the occasional thing here or there  but really keep an eye on this one if you're like me and like to play tons of games and have fun in general  find ways to enjoy yourself as cheaply as possible    once you've done this you'll start to realize that most of your money is going into your belly  at this point take note of what your most expensive eating habits are  if you eat out a lot like i do then try to eat out less  go to less expensive places  order the cheaper options  or cook from home whenever you can  if you eat a lot of snacks or drink sodas  start cutting back until you can go without them completely  if you've got some fat to  spend  then you can even try skipping meals  so long as your energy levels stay manageable and your mood doesn't suffer a hit   when i haven't eaten enough i'm incredibly irritable and my thoughts about the future and myself become purely negative  that s how you end up falling off the wagon and going back to bad habits due to a lack of care and energy to stay on track   vices are the next thing to go  to be completely honest i had an awful dependency on smoking weed  to the point where i was smoking 2-3 bowls every 2 hours when i wasn't at work  i was spending  100 every two weeks on weed and all it was doing was killing my motivations and ruining my mood  i thought it was the only thing keeping me going  when in fact it was the only thing holding me back  so  figure out your vices be it weed  alcohol  cigarettes  which i also smoked on the hour  etc  and start cutting back until you can go without them completely  i m still vaping nicotine  but that s much less life ruining than the other vices and has less health related issues     cutting your vices is hard work and you can only do it if you replace them with other healthier habits  to stop smoking weed i had to start exercising every day to get the endorphins and good feelings that weed was artificially supplying  it's truly only been about 20 days since i decided to make this change and i feel like a completely different person  i feel unstoppable  i attribute this completely to exercising every day  it's not even about losing weight or becoming stronger which hasn't happened for me yet and i don't care if it does  it's all about sustainability and being able to do it every day  research shows your iq begins to slowly deteriorate after the age of 24  i'm almost 29  and the only way to prevent that is exercise   ok  so now you've got your ducks in a row  your cost of living is as cheap as possible  your mental and physical health is better than it's ever been  you have a support system in your partner  and you can begin to plan your ascension    for me this meant looking at my potential and the potential of those around me  giving up on childish goals and dreams that simply aren't in the cards at this time and looking at the real opportunities presenting themselves before me   let's face it  we're still poor despite everything we ve done so far   and i'm too old to start a 4-10 year college career  so going back to college is currently out of the question  besides  we know that doing that doesn't even guarantee a well paying job and it definitely guarantees excessive amounts of debt which you may carry until you die  but  what we can do is look at the skills and abilities we've acquired so far  as well as the skills and abilities of the friends and family we've managed to surround ourselves with    this is where the magic happens   apes  together  strong  this is also where my advice becomes a bit more specific to my situation  but you can apply this same concept to your own situation    after looking at myself and my partner friends family i realized we had a unique opportunity to attempt to open a restaurant  to illustrate this i'll give you a quick breakdown of all the parties involved    me  6 years of restaurant experience doing prep work  line-cook  cashier  and more recently 3 years of experience as a graphic designer at a sign shop doing logos  making menus for restaurants etc    my partner  3 years of barista experience  2 years restaurant experience as a cook  countless hours of experience home cooking and a knack for making recipes  coming up with ideas to cut food costs  and a passion for waste free business models   best friend 1  the same 6 years of restaurant experience as i have  prep  line-cook  cashier  in addition to food truck event planning  bartending  and a quick wit with outside the box thinking and charisma to spare   best friend 2  same restaurant experience as me  in addition to sushi chef  rock solid work ethic and the ability to work long hours  late nights  bleeds charisma and has a personal gravity that attracts loyal friends    best friend 3  also same restaurant experience as above  diamond solid work ethic and the ability to work insanely long hours  asks the tough questions and the ones you didn't know you needed to answer   friend 1  tons of shift lead experience at many high volume restaurants  heavenly customer service  and an absolute pleasure to be around and work with  a magnetically friendly person with positivity to spare  a morale boon to any company   partner s friend 1  studying to become an engineer  but currently working at a smoothie health food place with my partner  great work ethic and a go get em attitude ready to take on responsibilities  currently handles food orders  inventory  and shift lead at her job  getting paid peanuts   my mom  currently working at the sign shop i used to work at  i m currently jobless  as a csr  making little money  doing the work of two people  master home cook  overflowing with compassion  adamantium   fast healing work ethic  an absolute shining example of human potential   friend business owner  the owner of the restaurant that all of the above  best friends  and myself previously worked for  about 6 years prior  he had to close the place due to slimy investors breaching their contract and a two faced business partner  he s currently working on his passion project of making a video game and has been for the past 5 years  he still owns the name  its recipes  and has made the offer to let us use them  invaluable advice as the previous owner about  legalese   business lingo  tactics and mistakes to avoid  only asking for a small slice of revenue    best friend 4  an absolute genius  had a privileged upbringing compared to our other friends and had the opportunity to go to college for computer science  currently making the big bucks  100k  at a tech company doing data basing  lives a modest life with plenty of money to invest in his best friend s business   best friend 5  the brother of best friend 4  also an absolute genius who had the opportunity to go to college to become an engineer  also making the same big bucks doing structural analysis  in the same situation as his brother in having plenty of money to invest in his best friend s business    friend of best friends 4  amp  5  also a genius computer science major who just got a job at a big name tech company working on augmented reality  assumedly making similar figures to bfs 4  amp  5 with money to spare  thinking about the future attempting to get to a point where he feels comfortable having children  potential future investor as the business begins to expand    partner s dad s step dad  haven t reached out to them yet  but they re the one who helped her dad purchase the rights to his ac company  he owns hotels and is known as a fairly charitable figure to family  potential future investor as the business grows    partner s dad  knows construction and is great at wheeling and dealing  he could help cut costs of remodeling and building the interior of the restaurant    partner s sibling  went to college for interior design  believes in accessibility for the physically and mentally impaired  could assist in creating a restaurant space that is both inviting and accommodating for all   friend 2  working towards becoming a plumber  his father is a plumber  invaluable when it comes to maintenance and repairs   partner s friend 2  also works at the smoothie health food place  currently working to become a paralegal  in business you gotta have someone who knows the laws and can keep you from getting burned alive by legal mistakes and bad contracts  they might not have enough knowledge to help now  but they could become a real boon in the future   little did i know because i was too caught up in my vices  my childish dreams  and spiraling depression that i was surrounded by opportunity and a fountain of potential split between  myself  my partner  my friends  and my family  all of this planning and insight has only taken the past 3 days since i got my life back on track  but it was built on the back of 10  years of suffering and brutal learning experiences carried out by myself and others that have given us the perspective and wisdom to now know what the right choices are instead of the wrong ones  one step at a time progress is possible   our goal is to open a restaurant similar to an employee owned company  where every employee is making a small percentage of the overall revenue  incentivizing them to work hard and be happy with their job knowing that all of the work they put in is coming straight back into their pockets instead of their dick head owner drinking a  500 bottle of scotch  sitting in their  1 200 jacuzzi  in the 2 acre backyard of their  1m mansion  maybe then we ll all be able to drink our  1 pbr in our  12 kiddy pool  in the 800sq ft backyard of our 150-300k house  knowing that we earned it and actually contributed value to our society and improved the quality of many peoples lives instead of just lying to ourselves like so many other business owners do about the  value  they are contributing   thank you for coming to my ted talk  stay strong and be the change you want to see in the world  we can do this damn thing together  ape  together  strong   tldr  scroll back to the

599,I want to quit my job,i know that it is not a very interesting title to this  but here's why   about two weeks ago  i went to a staffing agency to look for a job   specifically  i went there in response to a clerical position they said they had open   after dealing with the bs that comes with temp agencies  i was told that the position that they had available paid a whopping  12 an hour   it was downtown and  i could get there by bus   i would be breaking down  read  reorganizing  leases from the local housing authority  a k a  the housing choice vouchers  known as section 8  and they needed someone   well  i needed a job mainly because i have back rent to pay  as well as other bills that are coming due   i was due there the next day   if this was the end of the story  i wouldn't be writing this   i didn't realize that it would be the start  not the end  of my problems   the first morning that i was there  i couldn't get in   the reason   it required a fucking badge to get in the door   i eventually ended up getting someone who worked there to let me in   it also required said badge to get on the elevator   you know  the one the staffing agency didn't bother to tell me about   i bring it up to the person i was supposed to report to  and the next thing out of her mouth was   no one gets in the first time   if i didn't have bills to pay  i would have turned back around  quit  and given the staffing agency an earful about said job   at any rate  the job itself is easy   the problem is everything else  including gossiping bitches who have nothing better to do than to talk smack about the  clients  of the housing authority   i am so desperate to leave  but i am not willing to be homeless to do so   quitting this job would leave me time to interview for jobs that actually pay   in my case  i am preparing to go into tech as a software qa engineer  but i can't do it while taking these low paying  good-for-nothing temp jobs that hate you the moment i take a day off to interview  or do anything for that matter   also i am not a day person  as in  i don't like having to go in at 7-8 in the morning just so i can have a job that takes away time i could be using  doing literally anything else other than wage slave for pay that doesn't even come close to the cost of living  even in so-called  affordable  areas of the united states   with all that said  should i quit my job and risk homelessness  or should i stick it out for now and pay the bills   any and all advice is appreciated   thanks     also i am calling in today  because fuck my job ,orx6we

602,Recent Reminder of Why I Hate Work,over the last three years i ve been successfully self-employed and have been able to make ends meet  afford small trips  etc  just generally live an okay life    on june 28th of this year i accepted a position at a company thanks to a referral from a friend which turned out to a  be a bait and switch and b  remind me just why i became self employed to begin with  this job was also in cst  i live in est  and all schedules were set in cst  meaning i working 3 30pm to midnight while the cst people worked 2 30pm to 11pm    a  it was  16 50 an hour - not bad for a work from home position  that s some good extra money on top of my current self-employment  the bait and switch was that after training and 90 days  you get moved to a  pay per experience  pay model which is a base pay of  3 25 per call  with small metric bonuses that can make that  3 25 bump up to  8 00 per call  they didn t tel is that until our second week of training  still   8 00 per phone call isn t bad  right  my first day out of classroom training and onto on-the-phone training i took 14 calls in 8 hours  14 x  3 25    45 50  45 50  8 would be  5 69 hr on the experience pay model  what the fuck    for b  the company has horrid turnover rates for employees - part of that is that they track metrics  for the bonuses i mentioned above  through software  my first day on the phone i didn t make a specific offer but to only 15  of the people i spoke with - the offer rate is supposed to be 85  or higher  no biggie i thought  i m still in training  i m just now learning how to navigate the tools and i ll incorporate the offer in future calls once i have this down  boy was i wrong  the next day i had an email from the operations manager grilling me about job expectations  that day i went on the phones and tracked my metrics by hand  making sure i was doing everything right  i took another 16 calls  made the offer to 10 of them - that s 62  great  improvement  right right  i clocked in the next day to find my offer rate was calculated at only 36  by their system    that morning i had woken up at 4am with severe anxiety about my shift which didn t start until 3pm  that evening i quit because my mental health is more important than extra money  and more important that some vanity metrics to make the  team  look good    yeah  i ll make less money now  but it s put things into perspective and reminded me that jobs are trash heaps and i d rather make less doing what i enjoy while being happy  do what makes you happy ,orrs13

679,I know it's all bullshit and I'll never change my mind,i had a phase where i wanted to just go on welfare  because it seemed like the closest thing to universal basic income   universal basic income should be a human right  anything extra could be afforded through a job   that would make most people want to work  since most people want to do more in life than just sit at home and chill  apparently    but it would also eliminate the threat of homelessness and starvation   all i got when i made posts about the idea outside of this subreddit is a bunch of people calling me a leech and telling me to go off myself  people calling me worthless and all type of shit   i'm now going to graduate soon and then i will have to get an apprenticeship  i plan to just work in a warehouse all my life  because that seems like a job with simple tasks compared to the other bullshit jobs we have in my country   deep down i know it's all bullshit  and i know basic needs should be provided by the government  i know all that deep down  and i also won't change my mind about this   i just don't talk about it outside of this subreddit anymore   because even if i don't bring up the welfare or ubi topic  people will always find a way to call you worthless or leech or parasite  and they will also tell you to go off yourself  and that shit will start to fuck with your mental health   so i just don't talk about it much anymore   i'll just complete my last year of school after the summer break and then i'm glad when i get an autistic-friendly job in a warehouse   deep down i don't give a shit about school or work  but i'm just going to pretend i care because if i don't life will become a living nightmare   deep down i know it's all bullshit  deep down i haven't changed my mind  fuck the  contribute to society  bullshit   these right wing  anti welfare fucks don't work because they love everyone around them so much  they work because they want money   the only thing they want to contribute to is their own fucking bank account   they only use the  contribute to society  bullshit to make themself feel superior and to fulfill their hero-complex   it's all bullshit and i fully see through it and i'll never change my mind ,or1p37

683,The reason why we don't want to go back to work is because we got used to a job not taking over our lives,and we decided we like it this way  the only way i would ever get another job again is if i was allowed to only work part time at one place  and maybe get another part time job somewhere else  if i wanted to   so why don't i just work full time then  well  now days  a full time job basically means that an employer owns your mind  body and soul  you are at their beck and call 24 7  they don't care if you already requested that day off because kathy called in sick  so you better get your ass down there pronto   of course  employers don't want to hire part time employees because we're not  flexible  enough to their liking  flexible   allowing asshole employer to bend you over backwards  literally   it's not that we don't want to work  okay  maybe that's partly it  we just don't want to work by these rules anymore  change them and you'll see more applications flowing through ,oqynn0

715,End work once and for all, don't stop chasing your dreams  because dreams do come true   it's time to tell the whole world  with knowledge of everything has to do with energy  to become a master race  the biggest leap humanity could ever achieve   why string theory is both a dream and a nightmare   string theory is perhaps the most controversial big idea in all of science today  on the one hand  it s a mathematically compelling framework that offers the potential to unify the standard model with general relativity  providing a quantum description of gravity and providing deep insights into how we conceive of the entire universe  on the other hand  its predictions are all over the map  untestable in practice  and require an enormous set of assumptions that are unsupported by an iota of scientific evidence   quantum immortality   how to prove the multiverse exists  in the most violent way possible   quantum mechanics says objective reality doesn't exist  that instead all we see are probabilities collapsing into one particular configuration  and all other possible realities might just exist together in a quantum multiverse  here's the experiment that could help you to test that very idea  the twin notions of quantum suicide and immortality were first proposed by hans moravec in 1987 and independently a year later by bruno marchal  but the most work on the idea has been done by mit's max tegmark  the most common version of this experiment goes like this   place the experimenter in a chamber with a life-terminating device  such as a high-powered rifle pointed at her head  every ten seconds  the spin value of photons will be measured  depending on the result   and there's a 50 50 chance of either measurement   the device will either fire and kill the experimenter or make an  all clear  noise that tells the experimenter she is safe   what we've done here is tie the survival of the experimenter to a quantum state  meaning she now exists in a superposition of being both alive and dead  there's a 50  chance she survived the initial round  and she has the same chance for every subsequent repetition of the experiment  no matter how many times she repeats the experiment  half the time  she survives    of course  her overall survival chances are way less than 50  the version of her that died in the initial experiment doesn't have a 50  chance of coming back to life in the next experiment  but each living version of the experimenter retains that chance at survival  even if the overall chance of survival keeps falling to 25  then 12 5  then 6 25  and so on  let's say that in one universe  an experimenter eventually emerges having survived 50 such tests in a row   something she has less than a one in quadrillion chance of surviving  which is way more than is needed to meet the 5-sigma level of certainty needed for an official discovery    our only hope is technology that would be so far ahead of our own that it would seem like magic or divine power to the generations of yesterday but our current avenue of thought and philosophy would lead us to label it as  highly advanced technology    i've taken this very seriously  and i'm ready to take this ,orecf0

733,Value and Toxic Work Culture (longish post),i can't speak for other countries but in the us  the lack of discussion about value and people taking the time to actively define what they value enables toxic work cultures   when cultures  and people  do not prioritize really honing in on what they value  that responsibility will get exported to the first person that wants to gain from it  i see this everywhere with how value is only conflated with money and productivity  which has been bastardized to mean the rate of which a person makes money or something that can be sold for money   when we let companies define value  jp morgan feels justified in spouting bullshit about how it should be expected that graduates work 72 hour weeks for 3 years in order to get to a point where they produce  value  for the company  all in the promise of being able to make more money for themselves and the company  if that's your jam  have fun    why do i think this is important  some people just know what they value  at 18  they know they don't care about a six figure job  or an expensive house  or what other people consider a productive use of their time  i didn't and a lot of people don't  it usually isn't until some company grinds their fucking soul into dust that they start re-evaluating their life in the crater where their happiness and well-being used to sit  and all the while  they feel like they can't say no  it's important because companies encourage cultures where they tell young it looks bad if they use their vacation  ask about benefits  or discuss pay   because of the pandemic  we're seeing it now where an entire class of people were able to see one of two things  some were able to stay home collecting unemployment and had the first chance to see the actual value of having time for things other than pre-and-post work life maintenance  the others were sadly shown  in completely unambiguous terms  that the culture we allow enables companies and the government to treat a person's economic as more important than a person's health  financial security  or mental well-being while saying they're essential  being essential means that a company must take what you value into consideration   and until we do this  especially for young people about to enter into workforce  companies will abuse people becaues there will always be a fresh supply of people to abuse  people will go to college and get degrees because they're interested in the subject and not realize those industries have cultures that conflict with or outright discourage what they value  they then feel stuck between bearing a hell of their choosing or coming to terms with being tens-to-hundreds of thousands of dollar in debt for a culture they hate   this shit is preventable  these companies would either go bankrupt or be forced to change if only the people who solely valued money and titles applied to work there  we definitely need things like worker's rights legislation and pro-active regulation but  as individuals  we also need to define what we value to the extent that we know what we consider a personal right in the event that legislation never comes ,oqxu5d

782,"Yeah, Retail Still Hasn’t Learned From 2020...",   hey  antiworkers  long-time lurker  first-time poster and i really need to get this rant off my chest before i end up googling how many ways to commit suicide with a box cutter      despite the wage slave fuckery going on in this country merica  right now  i got a  part-time  job just under 40 hours  at a generic grocery store chain  my partner is disabled and needs help paying for dental and i need seed money for my micro-business  so yeah  those are my reasons for nibbling on the 9-5 shit sandwich      the bullshit i need to vent about    amp x200b      drug testing and background checks -  it s astonishing that even with retail s stupid high turnover rate  they still expect all their potential employees to be as clean as mr  rogers  like  fuck  i m not joining the secret service  i m applying to stack boxes for  10 50 hr  if the people who do pass the drug and background check quit within a week anyway  why waste the time and money doing them in the first place            fuck all for training - orientation was a joke  10  of it was more paperwork  another 10  was stupid computer quizzes  a worrying 75  of it was dedicated to videos on sexual harassment with paid actors  and the last 5  of it was how we should be worshiping the customer because they spend money in our store  none of it was about how to actually do the job they hired me for   the only real  training  involved me shadowing another new guy for two days before throwing me to the wolves           terrible scheduling -the only thing worse than the two days worth of training i got was the  scheduling  my orientation day was 9 00am-1 30pm and my first workday was 4 00 am-12 30 pm the next day and for the rest of the week  whelp  fuck my normal sleep cycle  right  no one asked if i d need a day or two to adjust or if i wanted to start a little later in the week            i was dead on my feet for the first few days while my body adjusted to my new senior citizen bed time  oh  did i mention my commute is a 4 mile bike ride to and from work  all i could do after getting home from work was collapse in a sweaty heap in front of my box fan  i m still catching up on sleep from the sudden change         ultra-entitled customers - customers aren t usually that bad  but that just means that the few entitled ones i do get are more difficult than usual  i ve had two customers ask that i drop what i m doing  go back into the stock room  and bring out fresher products  then they act miffed because the ones in the back don t look any better  i m lucky if they ll even wait around at all for me to wrestle the 25-50 lb box out of the cramped stock room               the company has zero self-awareness - this point isn t unique to where i work  but i still have to vent  the pay is shit  but you wouldn t believe it if you saw the fuck-ton of corporate propaganda littering the break room  they absolutely believe that we should be grateful to lick the crumbs  from their asshole because of their healthcare plan and employee stock program you can work to own stock shares  basically            it s like they don t think their employees can do basic math and realize that they d still be living in abject poverty for years  and the rest of society would still be paying for the companies   stinginess i m still going to need to visit food banks   personally  kind of hard to get hyped about a healthcare plan when the financial and physical stress from the job itself will increase my odds of needing to go to a doctor   turnover is so bad that there s no point in remembering anyone s name  management has their heads up their asses and would rather focus on writing people up over petty things than address the issues      as a newbie  all of this tells me that there s no point in working for your company long-term if you re just going to end up overworked and underpaid  picking up the slack from an endless parade of newbies       amp x200b      co-workers talk like battered housewives -

801,I almost killed a man at work and today I was told to get over it.,i promise you this is not a click bait title  i work as a train driver  and have done for a few years now  the company is very well known   the company is awful and rampant with sexual harassment and corruption  but that's not the story    a few weeks ago  a man jumped in front of my train  i don't know whether the intent was to hurt himself or what  but i managed to stop the train in time and he survived   there is a whooooole load of procedure to follow after something like this happens  this includes a welfare check on the driver of the train  now  in this company the rules and procedures are there but purely for appearances to show they're giving a duty of care to their staff  in reality  these are not followed and it's about getting staff back to work as quickly as possible    i was really shaken after the incident  i know the guy survived  but it was a big shock and a big fright  service was suspended  all electric in the area was switched off and loads of staff had to survey the track to make sure everything was okay   i went into the office and was told my next train i was due to pick up was running a bit late now  they still expected me to continue like nothing had happened  i asked to please speak to someone and the managers were reluctant to give me the support that is supposed to be immediately offered after an incident like this    eventually  i ground them down into giving me the support  i then went home and my manager told me they would refer me to occupational health for counselling   so i was contacted by a oh doctor who asked me how i was doing  i told them that i had been feeling low and my sleeping had been out of whack and i've getting myself better by exercising regularly and taking care of myself  the doctor told me that taking time off for work was unnecessary for this event and asked whether i should even do this job given that i was shaken by this incident  i said that these things don't happen often and they're not really supposed to be a part of my role  they're just something that  can  happen   the doctor then said that i should not have been shaken by this incident and that i need to develop a  hardened resilience  to things like this  i once again explained that this was not part of my job role  that i am not expected to have to deal with life and death situations on the regular  they're just an unfortunate thing that can happen and that's why there are procedures in place in the event that they do happen    the doctor said that was not reasonable and that i needed to develop a thickened skin  they then went on to say that i would not be offered counselling or any therapy due to this incident and that i need to get used to this    i feel myself trying to justify and explain myself here but it really isn't part of my job to deal with suicide attempts  they're extremely rare and people often go 30   40 years in this job never having experienced anything like this  i'm just unlucky  i now know that if anything like this happens again  i cannot allow myself to feel any way about it because i'll lose my job  i was already told that if i cannot handle people trying to kill themselves i shouldn't be in this job ,oq7u4q

830,A troubling thought (premonition?) of how the wage shortage is going to play out,with most discussions on and off the internet you tend to see two sides to the issue  those that call it a worker labor shortage and those that say its a wage shortage    but there's also a undercurrent of  this is just because of covid  and i think thats going to end up being the takeaway when this issue desseminates  especially if it ends up not going in the workers favor which it likely wont for most   and when its discussed  it wont be  acceptable  to say it was about people not being paid enough  itll be because covid was scary  and we need to stop imposing socialism on people who were just scared to leave their homes    its not too dissimilar to what happened with sanders  where still people pretend there wasnt a massive media shitshow aimed against him or that somebody like clyburn effectively controlling nearly half the vote in south carolina isnt a bad thing  and that these things cant unjustly influence how a voter votes  no  its just because he wasnt popular    sanders had a lot of issues he could  and should have  fixed to do better than he did  just as theres truth to the idea that covid is a big factor in why people arent working  but to deny the other aspects out of ideological spite is just gross    but its most likely what will happen  mark my words  go on r politics in a few months to a year  and look at what interpretations of this are acceptable  it wont be the one that aligns with progressive  nevermind leftist  views ,oqq6t3

833,When not at work,i have worked since leaving school at 16 i am now 30 with kids  i learnt a trade but was always made redundant by construction firms and got sick of the stress  i started warehouse work and never really been out of a job in 14 years unless by choice when i lived with parents  the last year i've sort of woke up and had enough of the whole idea of spending hours of my life working for just enough to sustain my life  i've had 5 jobs in past 4 month i spend about 3 weeks there trying to be optimistic but my brain soon  gets fed up and has no interest in being there i go on sick and then hand in my notice and move onto the next job  i find though when not in work i'm worrying about bills and what needs paying and we're the money is coming from  so i'm pretty much stuck in a cycle  work and have no time or not enough time to enjoy what little rewards my wage gives or don't work and do nothing as i can't afiord it  it makes my heart drop thinking that having 2 days off a week for the rest of my life is it ,oq5m67

835,Yeah... I'm stressed.,23m  living in the great  free usa     i've been living off of and slowly draining my college funds  living in a tiny studio apartment with a roommate  i haven't had a job since october because i can't keep up with the grind  and not to mention covid's a thing  i can't deal with the lack of appreciation  for whatever reason  i feel that living in a state of constant anxiety over dwindling funds and looming eviction is a better option than working an unfulfilling job to further a company's profits only to receive a sliver of the worth of my labor   i can probably make it another couple of months with what i have left in savings  i have no idea what i'm going to do after my funds dry up  i'm at a loss  why can't i just force myself to work  even part time  to keep myself afloat  at least for the time being until i can figure out what to do next  i'm making my life so difficult for myself  i can not explain this extreme opposition i have to reentering the job market  it's kinda bumming me out  i think part of it is being afraid that what i do doesn't matter  no matter how much effort i put in  it doesn't matter  it's extremely emotionally taxing to work a job that you hate  yet you put in your all  and get hardly anything out of it relative to what you put in  it burns you  you don't see the point of it anymore   i don't think i'm lazy  maybe i am  i don't know  i just feel confined  it feels wrong to do anything that i like that's not conventionally productive because i'm not being  a productive member of society  in the typical sense so i sit alone at home with crippling depression and anxiety  with that considered  i don't do a whole lot with my time but i would like to do more  i like to tinker with shit and fix things  it's what i do with the free time that i've had  if i'm not busy drowning in myself  i could be using the time to better my mental health  and i have  and do put in effort  but it's hard to keep up with the demands of a healthy psyche when i'm buried in constant stress over financial necessities  professional mental help is on the agenda   i can't help but feel that it's entirely my fault  i do take responsibility for the position i've put myself in but i'm so pissed off with the system that we've allowed to come into existence  we're expected to be a cog in the machine of infinite capital gain  yet we are unseen  these companies would be nothing without their workers and i can't bring myself to work for a hierarchy that is incapable of acknowledging this fact  but i suppose they don't need to acknowledge this fact because of  idk  wage slavery  fuck  i love this country   am i just an entitled piece of shit who thinks the world owes me everything  possibly  but i don't see it that way  i just want to be able to survive with the basic necessities to stay alive  food  water  shelter  etc  while i can figure my shit out  we should not be forced into the labor market if only to take care of our natural autonomous human needs   i genuinely don't know what to do  i have no ambition  why am i being punished for that  why am i being punished because i'm in a kind of existential paralysis that i can't seem to navigate  how do i get past this anger  i've dug myself into a mental hole and i don't know how to climb out  i'm so sick of being angry  am i in the wrong  am i delusional  what is it that i'm missing   do i need to give in  do i need to say  yeah  this is the world we live in  i just need to suck it up and shut up  keep your head down  eyes down  forget everything you know  forget your morals  forget who you are  how  i seem to be incapable of seeing conformity to the capital machine as an option  what other option do i have  i don't see an out  i feel so trapped  i'm scared  i'm scared for myself and for all of us who are struggling    i can't forget the things that i've learned about this system we live in  i can't forget the exploitation  i can't forget the lives of people who are working themselves to death and giving up their livelihood just to support themselves and their families  i can't forget the millions of people who go bankrupt just by keeping themselves alive only to receive crippling medical debt  i can't forget the millions of dollars worth of unsold food and materials being destroyed to create false scarcity when there are millions living in poverty and living paycheck to paycheck who could easily benefit from these trashed items  i can't forget the fact that there are over half a million homeless people when there are forty times as many empty houses than homeless in this nation  i can't forget the ultra wealthy hording hundreds of billions in wealth  laughing  while the common person struggles to live a happy  fulfilling  stress free life  i can't forget this increasing class divide  and i can't forgive   we're killing this planet  the only home we have  the home of an unfathomable number of diverse living beings  all for infinite gain in a world of finite resources  capitalism only focuses on short term gain while willfully ignoring long term consequences  i don't want to be apart of that  most have been so conditioned into a hyper individualistic view that we've lost our sense of community  we've forgotten that we are a collective being  we've forgotten how to tap into the life force that we all share  we've made it near impossible to find individual and collective happiness  for what   i'm sad that more people aren't as pissed off that we're allowing this to continue  though i think i see a shift happening  especially in my generation  we need to keep the momentum  however  this could just be conformation bias on my part  i'm tired of complaining and being angry  i want to change this society for the better  for all of us  i just don't know how to do that  i need to relinquish control and come to terms with the fact that i can't  not as an individual  we are way overdue for a radical shift  i just hope it happens within our lifetime  i hope we can come together to end this unnecessary suffering    i'm sorry for ranting but i can't keep these feelings contained  it's killing me  i can't talk about these issues with the people in my life because they see people in need as less than and see people who are on government assistance as lazy leeches on society  idk   let me know what your thoughts are  am i lazy dog shit for holding these views  or am i part of a larger common group than i imagine  i'm genuinely curious  if anyone has been or is in a similar

849,The lies they tell you,so this is just venting  this is kind of overly personal and has more to do with people's sociopathic tendencies when it comes to work  this isn't about rhetoric or tactics  just something i remember  there's this black hole of empathy when it comes to jobs  not just from your managers but from your peers  family  and really just everyone  i'm not sure what causes it  maybe that's just how humans react to what they see as necessary evils    when i was a teenager i was scared to work  i've always had extreme anxiety about situations i can't imagine  something as simple as moving the tv to another room would see me in bed for a week  and i didn't even like tv  i've since learned to deal  but that anxiety still mixes with negativity and will just fuck me up  it's probably not anything i'll ever be able to articulate  but as a teen i had this idea about work that i was assured was made up non-sense  i thought no job would want me if i couldn't pull massive amounts of overtime    i learned that from my dad's job  of course that's not an entirely compete thought  i knew places like dollar general and mcdonalds ran on part time work  but i also knew those wouldn't ever be good enough for anything  i wasn't the type to attract a bread winner  the government would never help a single young man pay his bills  i was on my own    i can not tell you how many separate people i tried to express this anxiety to  my parents told me i was making stuff up and i should accept i didn't know what i was talking about  my friends talked about their grocery store jobs where they made minimal wage 20 hours a week  my siblings  who married bread winners  told me i didn't have anything to worry about    i've flailed for years trying to find a  good fit  i've worked dozens of jobs  each one absolutely miserable  my entire adult life has been a blurr of pain and exhaustion  and finally  after paying my own fucking money to get certified and pulling on the only connection i ever managed to get  i got a production control job at a metal stamping company  it was easy  i was on my ass all day  and they worked a bit of overtime but only about 8 extra hours a month  i could handle that  for the litteral first time in my entire life  i was making money at a job that didn't send me home in pain    well  i got fired  and here i am  looking for another forklift job  hopefully production control  but it's this funny thing  every single company around me wants you to work about 60-70 hours a week    i've never really gotten over the fact that i predicted a massive issue in my life at like 13 and everyone gaslit me over it  so do i go work at mcdonalds or any of the other dozens of fast food joints for no benefits and a random ass patchwork schedule  or do i work at any of the dozens of production warehouse jobs where i'll hopefully be able to sit for the majority of the time but work 6-7 days a week  10 hours a day    i genuinely don't see the point ,oqbbnz

886,"My job can't find anyone to work, and still harasses and nitpicks the people who still show up everyday. (long read)",i work in a manufacturing setting  specifically for food  which means yes  i did work through the entire pandemic because we were deemed  essential   we work 10 5 hours shifts 5-6 days a week i hit 40 hours before thursday is even over  at this point all of the people who are still working in my department are pretty much veterans  we've all been here for at least a few years  most of us all come in everyday  we are never late  we always get our jobs done to the best of our abilities  i myself have not been late a single time in over 2 years  and almost never miss days    we have gotten to the point where we are all so familiar and experienced the the production process that we almost never have significant downtime or ever cause food production to halt  this means the entire time we are there 99 99  of the time product is consistently being produced without a single major problem  but since the production side of the factory can't find any employees who want to work in a 104 degree kitchen 10 5 hours a day  if you think frito-lay is a lone in this struggle  welcome to every major factory in america  they can't produce as much product as past years  so they seem to take it out on us  even though we've all been here religiously the entire pandemic    despite how efficient we've all become all they ever want to do is drag us to the same meeting over and over again  about how our breaks are too long  how we are on our phones too much  how a  higher up  saw us in a group talking towards the end of the shift  how we are here to do a job  and get paid  and not goof off  despite the fact we are doing our jobs  almost as perfectly as we can  we've gotten our system down so we'll it's what allows us to have any leisure at all  we operate and maintain automated machinery  if you have the setup and settings dialed in correctly you could go an entire day or more without a single issue  and since we've all been here so long  we've gotten good at it  we've essentially eliminated major downtime in our department  so what they see is a bunch of people doing nothing  when the reality is  we've worked to get production to the consistency it is now  and we come in to maintain that level of quality so we can have the lowest stress day possible    so they see us on our phones  or maybe taking a slightly extended break  considering we are only given one measly 30 minute break for a 10 5 hour shift  it never feels like enough  almost no one in the entire company follows this policy because it's bullshit    we are all burnt out  drained  tired of the bullshit from the higher ups  even our direct supervisors and managers are just messengers at this point who are tired of it too  they are taking their reduced profits due to lack of workers on all of us  and it's driving everyone insane  and further making people want to leave  they are creating their own problem themselves  not  government handouts  turns out no one wants to be a slave for an asshole company    anyways  i told my boss  i want a  2 50 hr raise or i'm quitting immediately   they basically have no power right now  and i'm fortunate i'm in a position only one other person does  if they don't give it to me  then i'm having some self respect and leaving  i'm tired of working 60  hours a week for a company that doesn't give a fuck about all the things we've done to get it running as smooth as it does  but sure they notice when your piss break was 30 seconds too long ,oqf1o4

894,Work system review and how we CAN change it for US ALL,i think  to analyse  we need to go back to the start  fair basic trade  where you got to trade items of personal value for things of others personal value  this obviously worked i'd say currency became a global form of value  but obviously  it's universally valued  not personally valued  so this creates a sense of worthlessness to itself  hence why it's so easy to get rid of  hence why it's easier to binge with money than personal items  i'm putting money on governments knowing this  now  this slowly became a problem because people just threw money everywhere  most rich people see money as super valuable or super worthless  they are one in the same dependant on circumstance  hence it being a system that creates many issues  when the value of money is purely dependant on demand  such as stocks are  they become volatile  money creates it's own system within it's system  either you invest and maybe make millions or go poor  so even their stocks are gambling which still feeds the corporations and they wanna call it a  free market  hold up  what  you have to have money in order to make money back in stocks meaning the poor and rich becomes more devised within it's own system  besides this corruption  there's tons more  a great example is when the great reddit gamestop market crash occurred and one of the reddit boards made gamestop rise and crash just because of some big corpo fucks wanted to take a hold of it  and then some apps had the audacity to stop people doing what they where completely allowed to do  which is highly illegal  right under our fucking noses  it's a complete fucking joke  and i'm sick of hearing this free market bullshit    besides that  work has become  just a part of life  which i personally think is the most disgusting way to  progress  as a society  because guess what  we aren't developing as a society  we're developing as a government  just like japan needs more people for their ageing workforce  their government creates apps for them to date and have sex  so they can endlessly fuel the bottomless pit of human flesh they need for their growing pyramid scheme  it's gonna be the same for everyone else too  hell  i'd say the meme-ish analogy of the pyramid scheme of society is wrong too  it's not  from bottom to top  military  society  government  elites  it's actually  society  military  government  elites  the more insane part is  you have one life to enjoy  and you're being paid barely enough to live and as low as possible for literally wasting your life  this is disgusting  and half the time it doesn't even fucking show for itself  and n0body does anything against this  personally  i'd arrange a worldwide strike  not set by some fucking union  do it yourself  do it fast  and do it with crushing force  just like a bad relationship  which is what we have with work  all of us  set boundaries that will not be broken  and pay as we demand or nothing  because i can guarantee  the corps will shit themselves the seconds it happens and will be on their fucking knees  we would have to become one strong unit  whether it be harbouring the homeless and helpless folk or not  i would fucking do it  horde items and manage the resources equally  what you trade is what you keep as valued and you would need for 2 weeks of survival max 1 week minimum  if we never do we it they will never change   i personally  will be spraying my local town with huge anti-work signs which hopefully should boost everyone's morale here  i keep my promises and i will deliver  however  why doesn't everyone else fucking do it here too  just write abolish work or anti work anywhere except houses  cars and windows  that's a dick move  i will be uploading my pics on here personally  have a good day everyone and stay strong  we can change this shit  bring on october 15th ,oqj567

914,My employer was screwing me out of overtime pay so I reported it and got it back and then some. Figured you all might like this story.,this company  i'll call a contacted my school during my last semester  they were looking for the best student the school had and that just happened to be me  it was at a community college and i had some university experience so i was killing it there  4 0 gpa   a wanted me to do an internship which was fine but it wasn't an internship at all  it was just unpaid work  i had to teach myself things  that was annoying and lasted a month  at the time  i really needed a job so i took it  after the internship  i thought they would hire me but apparently they didn't trust me enough yet so they switched me to an independent contractor  this is problematic because it means i have to pay more in taxes and i have to pretty much lie on my tax return because i don't own a business  that lasted 4 months  i needed the money so i kept my mouth shut   after 4 months  they hired me as a regular employee even though my job duties didn't change from intern  to independent contractor  to employee  meaning i should have been an employee the whole time   i thought i was in the clear  the pay was decent for my area so i figured i'd let it all slide  sweep it under the rug  but then about 4 months later  they decided they didn't like the it administrator so they wanted me to start learning his job  the problem is they wanted me to stay 2 hours over each day and have him train me but i had to clock out and into another company they owned that was in the same building that i'll call b  so i was clocking into to b but still working for a so they could avoid paying me overtime  of course  that's not how it works  i can't create 2 companies and work an employee 80 between both of them and not have to pay them overtime  it's even worst because i wasn't working for b at all  if this happens to you  it's called joint employment   i wasn't hurting for money too much at this time  so i said   fuck it  i'm not going to say anything and let it build up and then slam them with a complaint down the line  maybe if they were nice i would have been nice back but my boss is rude and manages via intimidation and fear  so of course  she has to pay the asshole tax   in the end  it didn't work out exactly as i'd hope but it wasn't too bad either  i told a coworker and she got scared that i was going to mention her name when i complained  no idea why she'd think that  i'd never drag her into it but whatever  so they found out about it from her and within 3 weeks my desk was moved making my job more difficult  my overtime hours were stopped  one of my breaks was taken away  and then given back the next day after she talked with her lawyer lol  i furloughed for 90 days during which someone else got hired to replace my position and finally then i got a letter saying my position was eliminated altogether even though it wasn't  they claimed i was furloughed and the position was eliminated because of economic hardship due to covid-19 but they had hired another person about a month before i was furloughed  hired my replacement during my furlough  and had their leaky roof fixed which cost about 2 million according to my friend who still works there  probably not accurate though  i'm not buying their reasoning and hopefully a judge won't either   after i got the letter  i submitted a complaint to the department of labor  they investigated the whole company and looked into all the employees  turns out  they were screwing over a lot of their employees  about 15 people got between 300 and 600 dollars  i was rewarded about 2000 plus another 2000 for punitive damages  they flushed 1300 down the drain training me  it has already cost them but they aren't out of the woods yet   i've also submitted two complaints to the irs for when they misclassified me  they haven't made a judgement on that yet but they said it does appear to be the case that i was misclassified   and finally  i submitted a claim for retaliation  i wasn't expecting them to do that but once i noticed they were  i started documenting everything i could  my boss making me move my desk near hers was the dumbest decision she could have made  she thought i didn't know what was going on but hr told it and i'm friends with it so he told me  i started documenting everything and while pretending i didn't know anything  i probably could have said something which was what i had originally planned but i have a lot of anxiety   i'll update you guys on the irs ruling and the retaliation complaint as soon as i hear something   what's sad is that i gave these people my all and they just screwed me every chance they got  i worked there for 18 months  i missed 1 hour of work because my phone died in the middle of the night  i was really good at my job  my fellow coworkers liked me  you couldn't have asked for a better employee but they went out of their way to take advantage of me   i just don't get it  like  bitch  i'm on your team  i'm busting my ass to make you richer and instead of being nice and delighted you  fuck me over  what the fuck is wrong with you   this isn't the first time they've been caught doing something like this  a few years ago  they got caught  by imports customs for claiming some goods they were shipping was only 10 000 dollars when it was worth 100 000 dollars to avoid paying so much tax on it  they were fined over 911 000 dollars   250 000 in lawyer fees  i know this because i personally saw it in the database thanks to it ,opgouu

936,Workaholism vs Food Addiction vs Alcoholism,food addiction is one of the hardest addictions to overcome because we are forced to eat every day  food exposure is a gateway to food addiction  many dont develop eating disorders  especially those who understand nutrition  but many do  alcoholism is less common than food addition  you are never forced to drink alcohol  your vectors of exposure are less  and you can quit 'cold turkey' with fewer consequences  once the withdrawal is over you you never need to drink again       now contrast workaholism  many dont become addicted to work  especially those who understand economics  but some do  and like food addiction most of us cannot go 'cold turkey' if your relationship with work become obsessive and unhealthy  and most of us are forced to work from a very early age       when treating addiction we must ask 'what need does the addiction fulfill for the addict  what void are they filling in their lives ' and when we examine workaholism from this perspective i think we can easily see why its so common for people to work themselves to death  work unpaid overtime  show up early and leave late  dedicate their whole lives to work  they're filling a void in their lives  ironically this void is often caused by 40 hour work-weeks  just like food addiction is often caused by being forced to eat every day to live       to combat workaholism we need to show workaholics that they can fulfill their needs for social interaction and validation outside of the office  we need to show them that working is actually stopping them from achieving their true personal goals       making capitalists richer shouldnt be the sole focus of your life  it does nothing to fulfill you spiritually or emotionally  it does virtually nothing to enrich your community or family  those area healthy and productive things to dedicate your life to  things which give back  not a job which sucks your life out and then throws you to the curb       what can we do to combat workaholism and show people that its really a drain not a fulfillment of their lives ,operwr

961,Some thoughts about how most employment is set up in this day and age,i just had a few thoughts about how we currently have  most  employment set up in this current day and age and thought i would share them    first of all  it occured to me that companies looking at the prices of food and rent and other necessities and then paying employees just enough so that they can basically never leave and have to work however many hours of their life to afford these necessities seems like a form of monopoly on the employees    the employee s time and labor is all taken up by one company  many times making it impossible to move up one s career or to quit    and in that sense it is not only a monopoly but also a form of regulated slavery  now maybe slavery is not the correct term to use  but regardless this is a severe power imbalance and likely a violation of human rights   and secondly  didn t this form of employemnt arise during the industrial revolution  a time when slavery was still a thing or at least only starting to become illegal    so  this type of employment  is likely based on slavery    idk  what do you think ,opqd6k

964,Finally quit my cushy Wall Street job,   hey r antiwork  i recently quit my cushy finance job to start working for myself my own startup   if you're on the fence about quitting your 9-5  you may find my decision-making framework helpful   here's a breakdown detailing   1  details about my previous job 2  my thought process in deciding to quit  let's get into it    amp x200b     about the job    financial analyst and globally recognized bank   rotational program feeding avp  associate vice president  positions    80k total comp   70k base pay w 10k signing relocation bonus   incredible  comprehensive benefits   first job out of college   amp x200b     factors in decision to quit  1  passions 2  skillset 3  support 4  financials   amp x200b    passions   i went to school for hotel administration - essentially a business degree through the lens of hospitality  i didn't know what i wanted to do  but i knew i wanted to serve others   as i progressed through college  banking consulting grew wildly popular with my peers   i was in the top of my class  excelling in finance  accounting  and real estate classes   banks were trendy  they were socially accepted  they paid well and had great benefits  i was able to convince myself that financial analysis was something i enjoyed   it's not   i've spoken with representatives of various other disciplines within finance  it's not just the team i was on - no matter how hard i tried  i could not get excited about corporate finance  it just wasn't for me   meanwhile  i found myself thinking about my startup whenever i had the time  i thought about it in the shower  i thought about it before going to sleep at night  i started zoning out of meetings at work to think about it   i started sneaking in work at my startup whenever i got the chance  people from around the world were reaching out to me  asking me when i was going to launch   the more i thought about it  the more it became clear that corporate finance was not the place for me    amp x200b    skillset   when i examined the skills i consider to be my  superpowers  - the ones i am exceptionally good at  the ones that set me apart from others - they didn't align with corporate finance   these skills include     writing   creativity   visual art design   empathy  i realized that if i spent the next 5 years of my life creating financial projections  i would become exceedingly good at creating financial projections while becoming less good at other things   i didn't want to lose my superpowers  that prospect terrified me   instead  i wanted to do something that would allow me to leverage my superpowers to the greatest extent possible  doing so would allow me to create the most value   and in my case  my superpowers did not align with the job i was in    amp x200b    support   coming from a background of excessive overachievement  i deeply wanted the support of my parents in order to feel good about this decision  i know how hard they worked to put me into a great school  and i recognized that they felt my finance job was successful and secure   when i told them about my desire to quit my job in favor of working for myself  they were concerned   as parents  they wanted me to be safe and to have a successful future  but they also wanted me to be able to reach my full potential   when i explained that my skills were being underutilized  that i felt stifled  they understood that my job was not the best fit for me   after i explained my thought process and my plans  they even offered to let me stay with them while i figured things out   this was huge    amp x200b    financials   no matter how much you want to leave a job  you can't do so if you can't afford to live without your income   i have around  30k total right now  most of it is invested in stocks and crypto  but it's liquid enough to take out if needed   but by leaving my job within a year from starting  i would need to return the  10k signing relocation bonus i received   this would leave me with  20k   budgeting    157 mo for my student loan payment   36 mo for various subscriptions   57 mo for other expenses   300 mo for food   900 mo for rent  this would leave me with  1450 mo of expenses  or  17 400 yr   i wanted to give myself 1 full year to see if i could make it on my own  if i drained my bank account  i would still be left with  2 600   it would be cutting it close  but i was resolved to make the investment in myself  to give myself and my startup a chance   when my parents came in with the absolutely gift of letting me stay with them rent-free  it strengthened my resolve to take the leap    amp x200b     thanks for reading   if you liked this post  follow me on  twitter https twitter com aprilynnea   if you want to hear a more complete rundown of what went into this decision  and a little motivation for you if you're on the fence about quitting your own job  you can check out my  youtube video https www youtube com watch v -ayejbg0zec ,opmlk7

968,"Staffing agencies are all but illegal, and must be banned immediately",my last job in college was through a staffing agency  they promised me the moon and more for where i was hired  saying the opportunities were endless and the skills i'd get would last a lifetime  basically they were selling me an engineering internship  when all i got was a soul-sucking data entry job with a desk right in front of my manager's  i left after 2 months   staffing agencies exist to work with businesses to screw over their employees  less pay  no benefits  and never any room to grow because the business you're hired at will never officially hire you as an employee  and will lie through their teeth to make you think otherwise  staffing agencies are not unions  they will not protect you because you are easily replaceable for all the awful jobs they have  their existence should be completely illegal as they prevent non-aware employees from getting the benefits they need   just thought i'd write this out for anybody who's not knowledgeable about the business model of staffing agencies  if one of them contacts you  which i promise you they will  run ,opkr7i

1029,Concerning infiltration and/or sowing discord,so i have been following this thread with great interest for the last 2-3 months or so  i unfortunately discovered it no sooner  and i must say that i regularly come across replies that seem to have very little in common with a worldview that criticizes and objects the capitalist system and the work that is enforced on the people in it  the primacy of work in general   quite the opposite in fact these comments can be described as classical technocratic liberalism  it seems to me that whenever a discussion about economic or cultural issues is brought forth  there are people bringing the usual capitalist arguments    free exchange of materials and information is necessary  economic and technological rationalisation must occur at every level at society  work is a universal concept  every element of science and culture  even personal contemplation  must have a use  i e  be invested in industry or finance  all things have to be economically oriented and state funds are wasteful and therefore evil    additionally there is this individualist moralism  like when someone expresses the desire to work less or not work at all  they are called parasites  lazy weaklings etc    i cant help but feel that no person actually supporting the antiwork worldview would argue like this  let alone scold someone for laziness  so i think this community is likely one of the most hated and feared by the capitalist system  because it allows for association and freedom of conscience without being made feel guilty for one's opinions  that alone is probably such an affront to the capitalist minded people  but i think the system tries to infiltrate this community  divide et impera    anyways i hope you may be able to grasp what i was trying to say  i am not a native english speaker,op4vs0

1069,Restructuring the global economy,i'm not going to give an in-depth analysis of this as i am in no means qualified--more of a scrambled train of thought  how hard would it be to restructure the main driver of the economy   how often have you thought about how interesting people are individually  yet collectively  we suck  i just feel as if it's basically the way capitalism is set up--which drives competitive survival-of-the-fittest mentality to our systems in pushing towards growth at all costs  if society's goal is to drive cooperation and prosperity away from the harsh realities of nature  why does our economic system drive an even harsher and untrue version of this  i think the way we perceive territories  nations  etc  is a macro-scale example of this and it doesn't really collectively help humanity  we are forced into competition  and inevitably  conflicts and war with each other over imaginary boundaries  these things are archaic  the structures that support our world have not changed drastically enough despite technology becoming exponentially complex and driving a different reality  like if you really look at us  our systems are super immature compared to how far we are with technology  it's like letting a toddler drive a car  if we arent lifting everyone up and benefiting from our progress  we are creating more problems than we are solving   then when you look at our economic system on a more micro-scale things are so inefficient  unsustainable  and cruel to so many  i feel like we are a bad developer of a buggy video game--constantly pushing cosmetic updates and further breaking the game without taking a pause and fixing some of the code  how different is the newest iphone vs one from like 5 years ago  does it really collectively benefit society to have a new iteration every year  how much waste is produced because of this  couldn't we just focus more on creating longer-lasting products instead of things engineered to fail with no repairs  rampant consumerism has to be stopped if we want the world to be sustainable  in turn though  this can be applied to our relationship with work  does mcdonald's really need to be open 24 hours a day  do most services and businesses even need to be open 8 hours a day  there's so much waste in terms of manhours  restaurants could probably effectively run the same being open for 2 hour windows during different times of the day  with different people working shifts during each window  that computer store down the road could probably be open a couple hours a day  and it would likely drive higher traffic during that time  so many if these jobs could be automated out as well  what is preventing this though  businesses afraid to lose customers to competition  additionally  it's not realistic for all jobs to reduce total hours  like medical workers however  shouldn't these jobs be the ones that we have more workers for  we could have a bunch of nurses and doctors working reduced hours  we could have way more teachers  we need the education system to focus on making us complete cooperative people and being able to find inner peace instead of driving towards perfectionism  instead  it's mindless conditioning for the work environment sent out to the wolves to survive  how much trauma do people carry with them because of the school system  just passing trauma onto each person  and then we expect these people to be the ones leading us into a better future  or the ones that go to private schools and don't go through our collective experience are supposed to make things better for us   i dont know  i could go on forever with this stuff  maybe it's naive maybe not truly analytical enough  but i think that's kind of the problem numbers and pushing growth without making sure we have our shit together first ,oop2bo

1141,"""Money Doesn't Buy You Happiness""",just like most things liberals claim  it makes sense at face value but the moment one looks deeper it becomes evident they are lying for their own benefit    amp x200b   yes  money doesn't buy happiness  happiness is an emotion caused by a culmination of circumstances  however  those situations are brought about by a variety of material actions  and under capitalism everything is a commodity so in order to do something basic like move into a house or drive your car  you have to spend money  this makes any freedom of action constrained by the amount of money one has to spend on it     amp x200b   let's say all we want in life is a car  a house  a good job  and a family  well the first 2 require money  a good job is exceedingly rare to obtain  and a family require the first 3 in order for the situation to be stable enough to grow  once again we are back to the simple fact  you gotta spend money to make money and if you don't have any fucking money    amp x200b   so there is no happiness without the money to develop it  but who has all the money and thus all the happiness  we know the answer to this question  but i have a different question to ask y'all  can anyone possibly deserve all the happiness in the entire world  do the ultra rich  the bourgeoisie  deserve all the happiness in this life or do we disagree    amp x200b   well  let's look at the other side to determine the opposite  let's look at us  do we deserve to be miserable for the extent of our lives no matter what we do  what did we do to deserve this  think about the worst thing you've ever done to pair it up against that of the rich  well  we know the rich are basically all pedophiles  and likely murderers  and yes those are 2 very bad things  but what if you did both of those things  there is 1  sin  they will always top our worst on  their selfish hoarding of all the resources  money  and thus control over class happiness and misery has sentenced us all to the misery we all face  which lead us to making every bad decision we've made     amp x200b   take an abusive father  he became abusive when he drank  he drank from alienation and the associated depression  alienation is an effect capitalism has on society  and who benefits from capitalism and thus acts to reinforce it  the bourgeoisie     amp x200b   one more example  a suicidal kid is bullied from kids whose parents mistreat them  they do so to project both the stress of work and the lack of control they experience from their daily lives which suck because they're poor  stuck in a dead-end job  and the bills are piling up  but of course they are  that's the name of the game     amp x200b   they alone are responsible for what we experience on a daily because they hold all of the power to change aspects of the world and thus change our experiences  they chose for us to be this miserable  because that's the trade off for them to be infinitely happy  capitalism simply steals things from the majority for a few people and with the commoditization of almost everything  the rich control almost everything      amp x200b   capitalism is an economic system  but if it weren't for the actions of the rich  of those who benefit  of those who alone stand to benefit from the maintainence of the status quo  there would be no resistance every time our class  the high majority of the human population  has tried to abolish capitalism and thus we would not be miserable right now  we would be getting our needs met     amp x200b   so the next time some liberal shill says to you  money doesn't buy happiness  remember people they worship and follow the every word of  are responsible for all of our pain ,ooi3dn

1265,The Social Blackout: Post-Modern Effects of Industrial Pillage and Reap Tactics,apicture can speak a thousand words  but it s unfortunate that there are many more words that a picture cannot touch because of the nature of chaos   as i have written in some of my other articles  i have naturally tried to bring up some of the most hidden aspects of this chaos  but i know that there is no ultimate explanation because our world is based upon individual experience with individual perceptibility   so i would say it is incredibly rough to live in an impoverished community in a third world country  but what i think we all feel is that another level of pain ensues when we step into a world of vast amounts of money where buildings reach for the sky while at the very bottom some of us sleep  the contrast of this type of reality if we could call it this it utter insanity if you are not a narcissist  but still many people are not and still go about their day as if this doesn t matter   i am not necessarily blaming people for this because our history has been pummeled over and over with the idea that the individual cannot make a critical difference  sure maybe a select few were able to create big changes but these people were so smart we often think to ourselves  how could they have been able to climb up the social ladder if they were not so smart people think to themselves  but the thing that moved them to really change the world was not smartness  but pain  the pain of what could come if something were left unsaid   it was not really smartness or intelligence that drew them to understanding a bigger vocabulary and learning how to use certain remarks to deafen the pain  but it was the desire to free the people from what they saw was coming  for if you saw a hurt bird in the middle of the road  barely able to to get across  you would want to do all you could to try to get this bird out of harms way as soon as possible  this is because on a very deep level  we feel the pain of life  of others  of nature itself     rethinking possibility by reseting perception  many of us think that maybe if we just do the right thing  life will get better and our future will be more pleasant for those to come  but this isn t necessarily true  throughout history we have been told over and over by the governing system to do the right thing  don t steal  don t hurt anyone  be kind and treat others fairly  but look at our world today   nobility can only take us so far and so far the noble class system is still in effect teaching us that it still continues to be ineffective  that is why we need to consider the consequences of our long-term actions  not just our short-term  for the reality is  long-term consequences will eventually bring us into a very uncomfortable situation if we refuse to consider that we will eventually meet a given circumstance head on based on our short-term choices  but the thing people don t realize is that when you meet those circumstances from taking the shortcut in life  you will feel long-term choices that benefit yourself and everyone are so far out of your reach  there is no point in trying to reach for them   and so when we take the lives of most homeless people living in deplorable metropolitan conditions  you see at an early age most often that they were given circumstances that were systematically cross-pollinated from the upper echelons of authority  the way parents act is the way they are treated from its social leaders and officials  and so if we find any measure of abuse and self-harm  it is often because the system is predatory and consumed by a winners take all approach  why live if the system will try to put you down even if you try to advocate for equality for all   this is where most people break even if they see someone advocating for a better world  a better future  but when these numbers begin to build up  most people already know that the power of the masses becomes greater than that of a city or big business  but the reason why these rallies don t formate is because not enough people have the long-term vision of the pain that is to come if we repeat the same old games that the nobles give us to play with     we don t fear pain  we fear death of identity  oftentimes you have seen throughout history certain individuals risk their lives in order to promote a greater cause non-violently  some have died but in recent years these deaths have significantly decreased  but how true is this if we measure death by the psychological elements of a person s being  many say death happens when your heart stops beating and there is no sign of life in a human being  but what if this type of death isn t actually what causes a death of a society  for not even the bubonic plague wasn t able to wipe out society in medieval europe   in what way can we measure a societies life if not by its ability to be kind and do well unto others  so even though the plague hit europe and then america after columbus sailed  the measure of life was still quite grim as we can note religion playing a tremendous role in the unequal distribution of necessary resources to those who actually needed it  but moving forward past the renaissance and the enlightenment eras  science began to put an end to predatory religiosity  but at the same time ushered in a new religion that nobody could then question less they lose funding  and this was the new institution of logical materialism   so in relationship to death  when people lose funding and society begins to payout people who are in favor of the new religion  people begin to think they will soon experience the pain that follows the demise or death of their being  and through this new religion  we have been told over and over that were are material beings that are merely evolved monkeys from a random event in space that we call the big bang  so if we die  it will probably be the end of us and sure other people could be born  but not i because the old religion and the new religion say reincarnation does not exist  so it makes sense people think that this life and what happens to them is of epic importance for them to be as happy and comfortable as possible   as so after millenniums of people believing over and over this is their only life  what do you expect of a person who is born again to think but that they should take extreme caution at everything they do and not risk losing everything you have to favor some diverse movement     the strategy that almost always wins  in conclusion of this story  which is very interesting to put it as a story  because in that word there is a backdrop of mystical folklore that suggests the plot could be more interchangeable than we often think  but anyways  i digress  we can see what is happening now that there have never been so many advertisments for the new religion to convert people to the rung of compatriots of capital athesim  the multifcated multinational monopolies are playing their game with their tophat aristocrat they gave to us on that same boardgame thinking that buying property was the way to make money  and that other boardgame life was another brilliant plan to make us think our career is what gives us life  which in other words  was money  for who was it at the end of that game that won  the person with a bigger family but less money  or a person no matter a family or not that was able to be lucky enough to get the right job and land on the right spaces   and i don t know if you ever played chutes and ladders but what is it about that game that makes you climb and fall  it is chance but in the real world we say it s skill  and there is some truth here but when we compare needed skill in the world today to what skills big companies are actually using is a complete outrage  the desperation for creativity  kindness  and respect has never been so needed in the job market  and this is exactly because the big players know how to keep the scrambling to get by  pillage and reap   just destory any incentive in life that the public should know about that relates to human solidarity and compassion  blast them with advertisements that have no bearing on helping people who are dying or in pain from various addictions to abuses  blast them with sales strategies that marginalize profits for those who leveraged an idea to maximize shareholder returns  feed them the worst food possible  make their jobs competitive and hard to keep  and lastly give them professional grade education that teaches them there is very little that is wrong with society  narcissism  and exploitation     the end  i didn t say it earlier but the word is perception  our perception of making a living  of the entire system itself  of using creativity  honesty  and courage  all combatted together makes a very unusual situation that i might not always call pleasant  but the percentage of positive outcome increases for everyone especially the sender who demonstrates that despite overwhelming odds  you can still be a light in this world  you can still get up after falling and offer hope to another that may be the reason to live another day  but the truth is you may go through some chutes that bring you down and just like in the board game  you could end up at the very beginning living in this world  and that isn t an easy position for anybody  but it s these people that create insane interference patterns within the gridlock of  success and privlage  why do you think leaders of recent are often criminalized let alone assassinated for this work   so no matter the stand you take  there are always options to feedback this world with another choice  a choice that is not based on the same profitable patterns  but a choice based on a united world  these are the words i leave you with and will say that the castles of billionaries will be coming down in the foreseeable future  but it requires people like you and i to try to the extent where death will come upon us and try to get us to turn around  but even in the advent to make a living this way death will come with many more voices of paranoia and perhaps even real life trouble because you become a much greater threat if you use your free time to free the people   i want to wish everyone a sense that things will get better and change is already on it s way  don t be scared and embrace death when it comes  don t be scared when the bills come in the mail  when family and friends say you are mentally insane  or that you will be hopeless if you reach rock bottom  to all of the above  listen not but to the inner voice of not reason  not logic  but of the stars  that is truly your allspark ,onmgau

1291,"If someone brags about working 7 days a week, tell them about the 1988 London railway crash",my grandfather passed on a love of engineering to me and while i can t afford to get into the career  i eat up all these shows and books about it  i ve come across more than my fair share of terrible accidents caused by overwork  but this one is fresh in my mind and i think more people need to know about it    in 1988 a crowded passenger train heading from basingstoke to london came to an unexpected stop due to the driver seeing the signal box change from green  go  to red  danger  after stopping the train he got out to call the signal operations via the box  no cell phones  and was told the red signal was a mistake and to hold on while they figured it out    now  the signals  behind  the stopped train should have switched to alert any incoming trains of the danger  but they didn t  another crowded passenger train collided with the first  causing the second to derail and cross onto the next train  traffic going the other direction  a  third  passenger train  this one empty  then hit the derailed train  and this almost became a 4 train pileup but the last train saw the wreck in time and pulled his train to a stop to alert others of the crash    out of the 519 people involved  35 died and 484 were injured    after an investigation it was found the signal box didn t switch over as the worker who had done a wiring job on the box before hadn t properly disconnected the old wiring which meant it gave false signals as it was still able to make a connection     however  it was then discovered the worker who had done the wiring job had done so while working  volunteer  overtime  quotes due to the fact management was pressuring the techs to get this done and had just assumed they had enough people to do the job in safe shifts  they didn t  resulting in him having worked  13 consecutive 7 day weeks  the company had no wait to record the hours and it was  supposed  to be managements jon to ensure no one was working an unsafe amount of hours  meanwhile all techs were working these ridiculous hours  as well as being undertrained and understaffed   now to be fair there were other factors going on that lead to this  trains weren t getting the budgeting they once did  the safety reworks for the signal boxes was delayed  etc etc  but it was basically concluded if the tech hadn t been worked nearly to death he would have done the work correctly and the signal wouldn t have shorted out to cause the first train to stop    this is one of many   many  examples of how overworking caused multiple deaths because the workers the company took advantage of were in charge of safety checks and balances  so the next time someone brags about being overworked  i beg you to make sure they aren t in charge of something like this  and then tell them to pull their head out of their ass because even if they aren t in charge of that sort of thing they are going to drop dead ,oo3by6

Freelancing or asking for a raise?, the situation    i currently work for one of the most growing startups companies in germany    they have very hard to reach goals defined for the upcoming years and the atmosphere is very demanding    i lead a small tech team there and build a platform and defined processes for more than 2 years    our company grows not only organic but also through mergers and acquisitions  it is a very complex business - please take that as a fact    the last months   over the last 8 month  my team was completely poached by other companies  the last one last week  we work with the google cloud platform  which is currently very in demand    unfortunately  we were not able to find replacements - because  it's not a priority  and our hr department has a very high fluctuation   i have a very great relationship with all my  ex- team members and they told me the reasons why they left    most of the time it's financial reasons  our company just doesn't pay well enough  some members were able to get  50  on top at their new company    but money is no big issue for the company we currently have more than 10 consultants which expensive day rates on my project alone    another reason is treatment and career development  you must be a shark to get what you deserve    for me this is okay  i can deal with that  i don't like it but i am extroverted enough to fight back    i think i created a small island of  calm  in my team but you can feel the frustration of all the surrounding colleagues and our stakeholders can be real jerks    amp x200b    option a   i think for the past year of opening my own small consultancy and would like to shift my career    since the whole situation bothers me and this is my goal anyway sooner or later    can i go to my manager and tell them i would like to take the next step in my career and you could be my first client   he does not really have a choice in my mind  a lot of the processes were build by me and i am the lead architect of the whole platform    the consultants are good on the technical side but i think i would be very hard to replace    especially because of the already impossible deadlines on the horizon    my contacts in the company and my relatively rare skill set    i would also not ask for an unusual fee  i know what the other consultants cost and would demand similar fees  around 1000  per day   or can i ask for more  how do you think are my chances  i fear my manager would see this as blacklisting  although he told me if i know anybody freelancer or not that can help i shall tell him     amp x200b    option b   the alternative would be to go to my manager and ask for a significant pay rise and promotion from team-lead to departmental-manager  besides budget decisions i am doing that job anyway    my salary would need to rise at least 50  to be market competitive     already got 30  raise in january - still earn less than some of my ex-team members now at their new jobs - for a simpler role same city   i would then rebuild the team with at least 6 new persons from scratch based on my wishes and would be able to create a sustainable and happy culture  at least in my department    another problem here  my manager lied a lot in the past  could very well be that hiring takes months and that i need to look for underpaid new colleagues    although he admitted today  it should have been a priority but he was just so busy that he couldn't focus on hiring    amp x200b    conclusion   option b also sounds exciting and definitely has potential but would cost me a lot more energy and will result in less money than i could earn as a freelancer  if i get the job  on the other hand  the promotion and the salary increase would get me a better job in the future at hopefully a cooler company   what would you do a or b   or   b and if refused a   thank you very much ,onhun1

1400,Opinion: Capitalism has created systemic misopedia in humankind, ''misopedia''  is defined as  ''a hatred of children  especially one's own''   i'm convinced that the overwhelming majority of human beings hate children in some way  shape  or form and this hatred is very normalized  you can say the most disparaging things about kids and no one except kids themselves will be offended by such statements  not that their feelings matter    to most people  it is generally accepted that it is both natural and completely justified to hate children    i strongly disagree that hating children is either ''natural'' or ''justified''  not only do i think that misopedia has become systemic  normalized  and institutionalized by our society  i think it is manufactured by capitalism   yes  people have been annoyed by children long before capitalism was created but i don't think it was ever as bad as it is until the industrial revolution happened  which rapidly cranked up the misopedia from a 1 to a 12     amp x200b   as i see it  capitalism actively and intentionally deprives parents of the time and resources needed to form complete bonds with their children or raising said children efficiently  furthermore  capitalist work values have permeated the souls of the working class so that all of human civilization has become hazardously centered around work and capitalist work values become the everyday values of humankind    because children can't adapt to this system as easily as adults do and since their natural behaviors are diametrically opposed to the capitalist work ethics of order and obedience  children become seen by the masses as little more than expensive and annoying burdens who distract their parents and people in general from focusing of their careers  which under capitalism is the focal point of your existence    amp x200b    this https www youtube com watch v wcfi49pmdjw  is a clip from the 1967 film  creative person  fred rogers  where the late  great fred rogers explains another serious problem with this issue    i think this is directly connected to everything i have already said    because capitalism has made us increasingly intolerant of children  we try to get them out of the house as soon as possible and whenever possible by becoming fixated on what they will be like when they are all grown up and less ''annoying'' as a result of their ''maturity''  as mr  rogers said  we are focused on what children will be  instead of what they are and our entire system of child-rearing is based on the child's future career and their performance as a good employee or consumer     every time i got in trouble with my mother  she always asked me ''do you think your behavior would be acceptable at your job'' and ''would you talk back to your boss ''    i remember when i was very little and my brother and i would hide in the clothing racks at clothing stores when we were out shopping with our mother  she would always slap us across the face because we were ''embarrassing her'' and to be fair we were  it's only natural for kids to want to have fun like that but everyone is annoyed by it because it disrupts the daily social order   my mother's approach to my brother and i's behavior was and is  in no way  unique  it's alarmingly common    good kids are quiet  obedient and they stay put with their hands to themselves  they should always be obedient but they are allowed to make more noise as they get older  not too much noise though    between parents and school  children are raised from day one to be obedient workers and obedient consumers  the natural behavior of children is inappropriate and not tolerated in our society     amp x200b    amp x200b   there's so much i have to say on this topic but i can't for the love of god organize it properly and thoroughly  if any of that jumbled mess of text made sense  all i'm saying is that capitalism really does hurt our view of children and maintaining that view will only further the divides in the working class  if you want to keep kids safe  strong  and healthy you should listen to them  work with them and be against capitalism ,omzync

1447,"If you're taking part in Capitalism, you're just as responsible as the people who defend it for it's existence",it's so weird to me that of all places this idea upsets people  i guess because the truth hurts  if you take part in systems of servitude  like capitalism  then you are to blame for them existing in the first place  i realize self sacrifice is hard  but if you're not willing to do whats right then you are part of whats wrong with this world and why we're stuck in a outdated economic structure   you have to actually stop taking part in a thing for a thing to stop  if you're not willing to do that  then you have to accept that you are responsible for perpetuating the thing you claim to be against    do what's right  or accept that you're part of what's wrong ,olxjct

1467,"So, I was unceremoniously fired today...",today was unknowingly the last day of my third week with a quick-service chiropractic company  i got a phone call from hr after i got home from work  informing me that i was being terminated  i was stunned  when i asked why i was being terminated  i was told  you just don't seem like the right fit for the team  i was shocked at their reason  i asked for a more specific answer and there was none to be given  nothing related to my performance  only that i wasn't a good fit  i was given no warning  no reason to believe that my performance wasn't meeting expectations  i've been practicing massage since 2018  and worked at a high traffic  high status resort making great seasonal pay before i relocated to virginia  i believe that i was discriminatorily fired either for talking about my pay with another healthcare professional on staff  or due to me being a male in a female dominated clinic    when i was hired  this company did not have their ducks in a row  they seemed great from the outside  but the inside was completely rotten  the hr professional  who also happened to be best friends with the coo prior to her role as hr  dragged her feet or just straight up failed on every single onboarding item required  dropped the ball for two weeks on processing my background check  which is spotless btw  and just had a general sense of incompetence  i didn't receive an employee handbook for three days  and was chastised on my first day of employment for something i was completely unaware of   the whole staff was on their phones during downtime  and it seemed like an innocent activity until i was pretty strictly informed otherwise  in this employee handbook  it is stated that it's an immediately punishable offense of termination for discussing pay  recently  virginia passed a law which made it illegal for employers to terminate based on discussion of pay  but as we all know  this is covered by the  right to work  bullshit legislation    as for the crime of wage-speak  on my first day  i asked the other professional what they were making an hour  this is something that is not considered taboo in our profession  massage therapy  due to private practices and varying rates depending on the provider  found out she came in lower than i did  even though i had to give up my health insurance for the higher rate of pay i was making  the next day  the clinic director was furious and completely rude towards myself and the other therapist  i believe the other therapist complained because she had been requesting a pay raise for a quite a while  as she had been the only one on staff  when the team requires a staff of two chiropractors and two massage therapists   she was essentially pulling double duty  quickly reaching burnout  i feel that i was either hired as an interim  until they could get another female massage therapist onboard  as the one i replaced was also a female  lo and behold  this past tuesday  another female therapist was interviewed and shadowed myself and the original therapist  under the guise that the original therapist was leaving the company    either i was fired for talking about wages  or i was fired because of my genitals  and neither can be prosecuted due to my probationary status with a company that has no backbone    sorry for the long rant  these companies are full of shit  where's the guillotines  i'm ready ,olua9e

1540,The time I quit a job after a day and a half,the title says it all    this is a story about how i quit a shitty job after a day and a half  to preface  my current career is one where i get required time off each year  during that time   i can choose what i want to do  coast on savings  pick up a temp job  etc  so i decided i would pick up a job at mcdonald's to make a little extra cash  big mistake  first off  i applied for a manager position because i had been a shift manager for 3 years at another store  well i got to the interview way across town and it was a group interview with like 15 ppl  it was for regular crew  i didn't say anything cuz i thought well this is only short term anyway   got the job  i show up for my first day  everything goes just fine  i am asked if i would like to work tomorrow morning  i say yes  i come back the next morning and get into an argument with another employee because this douche thinks it's okay to cuss out customers  management did not back me up when i confronted him on it  as the day goes on  i start thinking  holy fuck  why am i here right now  i go on my lunch  i come back  i get put on front counter  if you have never worked at a fast food joint  you should know  when you are on front counter the expectation is to  stand there  stand there at your register and be immediately ready for when a customer walks through the door  and in your downtime make sure the lobby is clean  so that's what's i did  like i said  i was a manager for 3 years so i know what the expected duties are   then comes the ugly bitch manager  2pm hits and then evening manager comes in  and lemme tell ya  this woman took the cake for being wierd lookin  it was like all of her facial features were scrunched down to the center of her face and had all this extra skin around anyway    so she gets there  sees me standing there  tells me to go clean the lobby already done  i tell her it's already done  she then orders me to go assist drive thru  i look over  there are five people in drive thru  if i go  help  i'd only be getting in the way  i point that out   she then shouts  well go do something   it's at this point  something in me just snaps  i say  no  i quit  i throw my hat on the counter and walk out right there  as i cross the lobby to leave  i point at her and say  i'll be back on monday to pick up my check   and that was that   i have worked at alot of different businesses but never have i been so appalled by a managers shittu behaviour   this is a reminder that you do not have to put up with being ordered around by a taskmaster   take stock in yourself ,ol1ujf
1541,How do I ask a new employer for a later start date?,yesterday morning i had a phone interview with the california unemployment department to see if i qualify for benefits  they asked me why i left my old job and my reason was because they were not following covid guidelines  i documented it and have evidence on text that my boss didn't do anything about it  the interviewer from edd seemed like she agreed with me and seemed to be taking my side  it was a very short interview  probably the shortest unemployment interview i've ever had  she told me that she was going to call my previous employer directly after the conversation and a decision would be made in 24 hours  well i have no clue if i am qualified yet as the online edd portal is not showing anything yet  i'm assuming they will probably send me something in the mail within the next 10 business days    i also accepted a job yesterday in the afternoon but i have not filled out any paperwork yet so i'm not technically part of the company yet  if i qualify for unemployment benefits that means i will get payment retroactively starting the end of april of this year when i stopped working for the previous employer  if i qualify i sure as fucking hell don't want to go to work because the unemployment benefits is more than what i would get working there even if i was working full-time  i am a certified massage therapist and it's just a day spa that i got accepted at   i'm going to be moving out of state next month so the job is only to save a little bit of money until then but i have money in my bank account  enough that i really don't even need to take the job  i probably honestly wouldn't make much more than  1 000 between now and when i move  i already have a job lined up once i get to the other state    so how should i ask this employer for a later start date  i'm supposed to start next tuesday but i want to wait to find out what the decision is on unemployment  if i don't qualify then i will go to work  should i call her and tell her i have some family issues i need to finish up and that i can start in 2 weeks  should i just decline the job offer  what bothers me is that i was trying to get  20 an hour but the manager went down to  19  so honestly i kind of don't really want to work there for anything less than  20 an hour  which is still not enough for a massage therapist  after taxes  19 an hour turns into  17 an hour  and that is only when i have a massage otherwise it is minimum wage if i'm not booked  i know how these spas are i know i'm not going to be booked solid   sorry for the novel  i just needed to give some background info ,ol6hwe

1731,Gave my bosses what they asked for - not what they wanted,since about october of last year  my company implemented a much more robust activity-tracking software to the computers of everyone below supervisor pay-grade  you know  the generic office folks  the plebeians  such as myself  this software tracks which websites and applications you use at any given time  and the main function explicitly was to keep track of idle time  the software would count up every second you weren't typing or moving your mouse and report it to your supervisor by rating you from 1 to 10 on how active you were  10 being the highest   i always thought the idea of tracking idle time was ridiculous as the company was already tracking how many processes you completed in a given day  so i paid no mind to the additional software and worked as i always had   naturally  this led to me having conversations with my supervisors about my idle time  generally  my idle time was quite high  which was something i already knew - but now it had become  problematic  during these conversations  i repeatedly suggested that the ultimate goal of this new activity-tracking was to increase productivity  not activity  the company just wanted to make sure office workers were completing more processes in a given day  my supervisors agreed this was the case  so i asked if there was an issue with my level of productivity  and the response was  no - you just need to lower your idle time   easy enough   i have since resorted to weighing down one of my keyboard keys when i'm not actively working  which is enough to fool our activity-tracking software into thinking that i'm active  my activity score shot up drastically into the high 9s whereas it sat around 3 or 4 previously  for the last few months  everything has been just dandy in my supervisors' eyes  and i have not increased my productivity at all   well yesterday  i was provided with my mid-year review  among the concerns listed for my overall performance  there were several mentions of my productivity being poor  approximately for the last 9 months  since last october - sound familiar  this was quite surprising  as during every single interim meeting i've had with my supervisors  they have not once mentioned anything about my productivity  the conversation has solely been centered around my activity - which had increased drastically and was now consistently high   i have a meeting later today to go over my mid-year review with my supervisors  i plan on telling them they had 9 months to tell me to improve my productivity  and since they didn't - not even once  - everything must actually be just fine  we'll just see how that goes  i guess  but if they had just mentioned they actually wanted higher productivity  they would have received it  you get what you ask for ,oktrsr

1759,Genuine question from a fellow anti-worker,i'll start by saying i have yet to see a post on this sub that i disagree with and that a certain demographic of people  not only boomers but they do make up a larger portion  have the absolute bullshit opinion of   'work 9-5  5 days a week  8 weeks of holiday a year  retire at  insert age no one wants to fucking be '   what i am looking for is proof that these people in the 70's and 80's had it better work and pay-wise  i see a lot of anecdotal things on here which i don't doubt to be true for a second  but where can i look to see more information about all this   i'm looking for cold hard data that cannot be denied or disputed  inflation rates from 1970 to present  minimum wage  cost of rent mortgages  basically everything down to the cost of a fucking mars bar   the reason i ask is  when i voice my opinion of not wanting to work full time  35-40 hours  at just about any job and come home to house flatshare and a meagre life outside of this  people will say to me 'that's just work  what do you expect ' or something along those lines   i essentially want to be able to give information to people that isn't 'well look at what this person on the internet wrote about the their dad in the 70's'   so the real concise question  where can i find numerical data that shows that we  our current generation  are being fucked over financially   sorry for the wall of text and thanks for reading ,oko0cv
1760,Just need to vent about this BS interview that happened and the result,first time posting here and just joined the sub and have a very young account so if this gets removed whatever  maybe i will come back later to bitch about this absolute bullshit  also i am going to curse a lot so maybe this is nsfw but i would think most people aren't scrolling a sub wanting to end work while at work  going to be vague about the position i was applying to and the people i interviewed with for privacy's sake  don't think my friend is on reddit but just in case  but they are department heads and c level people so i'm a bit nervous because i am a human  i also have pretty bad anxiety and have to take meds just to get through the day without having a panic attack  not trying to give a life story but this sets up the bullshitery  sorry for the long read i'll put a tldr at the end   a friend of mine put in a good word for me at his company in a department he has nothing to do with  so it's not like he could force me through but i really appreciate him doing what he could despite his shitty company rejecting me  i went in for the interview  arrived early dressed in a suit and tie as one does  i was called in quickly and sat down with one person who was not technically interviewing me but was definitely interviewing me    she tells me about the job because it is different from the one i applied for  she had suggested this job to my friend to give to me  and then they switched it to something else after i had applied  allegedly they had been having trouble finding someone and i'm guessing my story is probably why  they disqualify people for the dumbest shit  so already i am coming in less prepared than i would like to be because i had no idea what the actual job responsibilities were until just then  i could only assume they would be similar to the job i actually applied for   talk with her for a bit and have a pleasant conversation that is mostly casual  then the person i was really interviewing came in  she goes more in depth about the position  we talk about my background and she asks a few  can you tell me about a time you did x  type questions related to the nature of the position  and those are the only questions she asks really  i feel that i answered all of them very adequately if not better than that  really thought i was doing well  though i was a bit nervous all the same because as i said i have anxiety and also am a fucking human    last question is a  fun  one  what do you like to do for fun  i said cooking and we both go back and forth about how we have to have exact ingredient measurements and how our moms always just say  throw in some paprika  and we have to ask how much  laughing the whole time  and i don't feel so nervous anymore at this point and feel like i have made a good impression  and why ask that stupid fucking question otherwise  though i know it is a common one  it is usually asked early on  i can't remember having it be the final question  if they had asked this first it probably would have taken the edge off a bit  at the end it seems pointless   i know just because the interviewer is amiable doesn't mean i got the job  but i felt i had done very well and that the interviewer and i got along well which is also important imo  i think the receptionist even said something like  bye see you later  as i was leaving so i was like maybe the first person interviewing me told her i did really well or something  but maybe i misheard or it was just something she says  ok this is in the bag i thought  i have been rejected from dozens of jobs just like everyone else and i could generally tell it wasn't going to happen by the time i am leaving  this is the first time i felt that i did extremely well and didn't get the job   next day comes and right after i send a thank you email to the first person my friend texts me and says hey sorry man they are going to go with someone else but they wanted to offer some  constructive criticism  here is all they said  i seemed very nervous and i yawned a few times  which sometimes happens when i'm nervous because i talk fast and sometimes get out of breath  which causes me to yawn sometimes  and i am interviewing with a very high level employee  so yea  nervous  also i have been out of a job for a while  3 things i literally cannot control or change  that isn't constructive criticism  it's the exact opposite    you just told me i didn't get the job because of things i cannot change and i have never felt so defeated in my life  like fuck you for disqualifying me for being human  i left a part time hospital job in march of last year because of covid and my parents and myself having underlying conditions and focused on finishing up my master's in the field the job was in  oh yea forgot to add that at the beginning  i have a fucking master's and this is an entry level job  and they don't even have the decency to email or call me themselves  they relay all of this through my friend like fucking cowards  fuck employers and all the hoops they want you to jump through when they barely fucking respect the applicants   i can't fucking win  you can't have this job because you haven't had a job in a while because of a fucking pandemic and you were bettering yourself by finishing up your advanced degree  even my friend's good word wasn't enough for them to overlook some extremely minor shit  don't fucking ask me that bullshit cutesy question at the end if you have already decided not to hire me based on extremely minor shit and not my qualifications  fuck you for wasting my time i hope whoever you do hire is a toxic piece of shit and brings the whole department down  though i am probably coming off a bit toxic right now it's because i am fucking angry  i have never had any coworkers complain about me and generally make a lot of friends at work  fuck you fuck you fuck you  fuck   tldr  friend helped get me an interview in a different department of the company they had allegedly been having trouble filling  i feel the interview has gone well and all signs point to this imo  not 100  but i feel like with a long time and trusted employee reference i have a great shot  friend texts me i didn't get it but they gave  constructive  criticism by saying i seemed nervous  i have anxiety that i take meds for just to function  and that i yawned a few times  literally an involuntary and natural function  also i have been between jobs for too long during a fucking pandemic where 100s of thousands have been unemployed  and i was getting my fucking master's in the field the job was in during that time  fuck everyone at that place other than my friend and fuck employers in general  fuck ,okbky3

1764,A supervisor thankful for this subreddit community,i joined this subreddit fairly recently  it articulates a lot of my thoughts on capitalism more generally  but especially the way i have been feeling about my own job for the past couple of years    in my  small  organization  within a larger institution  i am the highest paid employee below my boss  who is a millionaire  i am responsible for hiring and supervising employees  among many other duties  now  i am not even remotely rich  and sometimes i wonder if i even qualify as  middle class  given the fact that the promotions i ve received are not reflective of the amount of work hours that i do at all  and the fact that i live in a tiny condo that i can t pay off any time soon  the bank will continue to own the roof over my head for decades    i do supervise a group of employees  and there are many things about this subreddit that make me angry about my own position  i try to advocate for our employees constantly  my boss forces me to make our employees work extra hours and weekends regularly  without the extra pay  even when i argue that they should get a bonus for their extra time or attempt to fight for them to get compensation time off  he denies it  often  he says it s fine  and then he changes his mind very last minute  and it s always me that has to deliver the bad news to them that they won t actually get the promised time off pay that they deserve  when i fight for promotions for them  i have to argue with him down to the penny  he never thinks they are worth the raises that i argue for  as a rich man  he does not comprehend the cost of living for people who aren t rich  he thinks we are all  very well paid    before you tell me that i should go to hr and report him  i would like to point out that my boss cannot be fired  and he is one of the most valuable assets to the entire organization  this is not a battle that i can win  and if i tried  i would be fired myself  and perhaps even sued    i myself have not received a raise in 3 years but am actively fighting for the promotion of our employees to keep up with the rising inflation rate    this subreddit has been an important source of comfort to me and has made me so much more aware of the toxic environment i work in  i am regularly expected to respond to emails until late at night and to work on weekends  i have no energy for friends and family in my limited free time  i have no power to help our employees  i am regularly asked to put my job before my health  the reason why i m posting this is because i want people to know that  very often  your supervisor is just as helpless as you  they may be actively advocating for your well-being but getting denied by their own supervisor  within the last year  i have been standing for what i believe in much more than usual  but i am reaching a point where i feel completely disillusioned  often  i feel that i d rather just give up and work at a lower paying job that is less intellectually stimulating  but that gives me less power  because sometimes  even when we are in a powerful position  the man above still beats us down  thanks to this sub for keeping me in check and calling out my own bad habits  like caving into the 60-70 hour weeks  working on weekends  and responding to emails at all hours  i needed something like this community to make me realize how messed up my work environment truly is  maybe one day i will give up on making a difference and will finally put myself first ,ok96lh

1809,Just some thoughts on immigrant values,of course i have to start this post off with a disclaimer i'm not nationalistic or xenophobic nor am i advocating for that     studies have shown that immigrants who moved to western societies from 'not ' western societies tend to have a more individualistic outlook than their fellow country men who did not   i don't remember what article i read  sorry y'all  regardless   my own parents are from southeast asia and to put it lightly are completely full of shit   i'm just talking about me specifically so no offense to people with immigrants in their families from war-torn countries or those escaping oppressive poverty   when my parents moved to this country they both held bachelor's degrees in engineering   on my mother's side my grandpa was an engineer and on my dad's side my grandpa was an engineering professor   the more i think about their stories of 'struggle' and 'how hard they worked' the more i realize how full of shit they are   they were by no means rich growing up but never struggled to put food on the table and always were comfortably middle class in their home country   they came here on student visas and my dad originally came to america to start an aerospace engineering phd at northwestern fucking university   my parents have never once acknowledged the decades of privilege that they had or have ever thought that even when they were struggling for money they had means to achieving financial stability many would kill for   nope it's always just  we worked really hard and struggled really hard blah blah  additionally my great grandparents worked for the british government under colonialism  so i don't have a very strong history of moral fiber in my family    i began asking myself what kind of values would cause a person to leave a relatively stable life   both my parents are shameless neo-liberals  racist  provincial  elitists  who always made sure to stress the value of 'studying so hard you want to cry your eyes out to make us proud ' so my theory is they just ran away from their problems rather than staying and addressing the cultural issues in their own families   they saw an opportunity to enrich themselves and jumped on it without thinking about the consequences of their actions   do keep in mind nothing in the us has ever happened by accident  google didn't support policies like skilled labor visas because they thought it would be good for the working class  global altruism lmfao  they did it because they knew they could pay an indian engineer 65k a year for the same job they'd have to pay a citizen 150k to do   tldr  my parents are pieces of shit who have lived incredibly privileged and coddled lives who refuse to acknowledge that there ability to 'make it' in the us has been the result of decades of privilege combined with neo-liberal policies at the expense of the working class   other immigrants  children of immigrants  thoughts  similar experiences ,ojw0uc

1825,Do I go to my boss or HR?,i started a new job a month and a half ago  it is nothing like they described to me over video chat  they said i would be working with a team of people my age and get the chance to meet a lot of people  i also never saw the office since it was over zoom  i sit in a cubical alone in the back corner of a large office surrounded by empty cubicles and fluorescent lighting for 9 hours a day  everyone works from home in my department but me and 1 girl who is only in 2 days  she is quitting and this is her last week  so 1 month in all the responsibility will be on me and i will be the only person in my department in this office  i relocated to the area for this job and spend all day alone at work and then go home to be alone all night  i am miserable  i have been applying for other jobs but barely get any calls so i'm worried i'll be stuck here a minute   i broke down crying yesterday because i had gone 4 hours without a call or anyone checking in on me with no work to do  literally got 1 call in 8 hours and it was my boss asking me to send an email  the receptionist noticed i was down and i told her i hate that i am alone in my department  she told me to go to hr and tell them how i feel  i don't want to piss my boss off since it's just her and i in this office now  well i only see her 2 days a week anyway  but this needs to be said and heard  i feel isolated and unsupported  i do not get paid to do the whole department's work and someone needs to know i am stressed  i am still new and feel completely neglected  all my training has been over email or a document the last girl wrote before resigning  lacks a lot of detail   also  today is the perfect storm of my boss and co-worker being in the office  this only happens 1 day a week  so i'm not sure if i should talk to her today or tomorrow when just my boss will be in  would hr be more appropriate for this  i feel lame telling them about this but it's really affecting my mental health and not even an executive sits alone alllll day every day ,ojiw5y

1828,I'm so fucking happy this subreddit exists,its insane how deep the capitalism conditioning goes  i always considered myself fairly self aware  i knew i wasn't ever going to fit in with the  normal  sort of career path after high school  but it still took me years to truly accept my feelings versus society's expectations  having been suicidally depressed basically my whole adult life so far  i'm 28 as of tomorrow  its crazy looking back on how much of that depression was fueled by guilt for not being able to just be satisfied with the jobs i had  i spent so much energy feeling weak and worthless  on a spiritual level i was even directing my existential anger at the universe for what i felt was setting the bar too high on reality itself  as if working a 9-5 rat race job was some universal truth ugh   then last year happened  and after quarantine i realized i just couldn't bring myself to go back to work  which was the only job i had been able to hold after going through a few years of trying different jobs  having mental breakdowns and quitting those jobs  then repeating that process  enough was enough  seeing the usa's response to the pandemic was the tipping point  i knew this country's work culture was fucked up  but it was incredible to see it fail so completely and so obviously before everyone's eyes   we've been working for bread crumbs  and then nature comes in and brings the world to its knees  a time when you'd think it'd be a no-brainer for the government to do at least the bare minimum in getting its people through this  if only to maintain the illusion that they care  not only do they not care  they don't even care enough to pretend to care  i finally had my moment of antiwork nihilism after that  capitalism wasn't this inevitable  all-powerful force that dictates a  survival of the fittest  society  its literally just a bunch of emotionally immature  privileged  fucks making themselves richer while exploiting the fear and vulnerability of others  i had been through hell in dealing with my mental illness for years why the fuck should i waste one more minute beating myself up by trying to justify the absurdity of living paycheck to paycheck  why should i put any ounce of faith in a system that tells me i should be thankful for the tongue-in-cheek stimulus checks that took months of debate when a trillion dollar corporate bailout was passed pretty much overnight at the start of things last year  nah dude  my life is worth more than that    amp x200b   anyway  just wanted to get that off my chest and also tell y'all thank you for existing  its so nice seeing a community of others with similar mindsets  reminds me that i'm real and my feelings aren't some inexplicable quirk ,ojkq0f

1862,A local restaurant chain from my area has a “No one wants to work anymore sign” but no job posting on their website.,this has been bothering me for the past few days    there is a sandwhich shop from my state and over the years they have grown a lot and have locations in a few different states across the country   well my mom sent a picture that of a sign in their front window that claimed no one wants to work anymore and please be patient with the staff   i was going to contact them and find out they were paying low wages and point that out to my right leaning family   but what i found out was that this particular restaurant is not even hiring  when i went on the companies website they only had 5 job postings for the entire state and not a single one was for that location  the website did have the sandwich maker jobs and stuff listed for other stores  so it s not a matter of them just not listing that job on their website   so either this store is straight up lying about being short staffed   they are i the risky keeping staffing levels low and shifting the blame onto the working class by saying no one wants to work anymore   or they are not advertising a position and just claiming no one wants to work   well i can tell you that i m not going to be patronizing that restaurant chain moving forward ,ojuw4m

1914,So here are the 17 Passive income ideas 2021 that helps you to make money passively:- (Antiwork),so what is passive income exactly    passive income is an income stream where you put your time  efforts  and money at the beginning to create it  and in the future  it will pay you passively without doing any work or little work    here is one thing i noticed that many people have a theory about passive income  and that theory is passive income doesn t require any work  it just pays you without doing anything    i want to clarify something about this theory    according to my perspective  that is 50  true and 50  false    true because when you have an established passive income stream  then it won t require any work from you    false because when you re in the path of establishing a passive income stream  it requires lots of time  effort  skills  and money     so here are the 17 passive income ideas 2021 that helps you to make money passively -  1  invest in a reit  investing in

investment trust  is a company that owns and manages income-producing real estate   as an investor  you ll earn what reit pays its investors   there are some reits platforms like streitwise and fundrise  which you can consider for your investments    2  dividend stocks  companies pay their shareholders quarterly  and your earning potential depends on how many shares you re holding of that company  the more shares of stock you re holding  then the more your earning will be higher    investing in dividend stocks could be a great way of earning passive incomes    3  rent your home  renting the whole property or just renting a room can be an excellent way to generate passive income every month  if you have any property  apartment  or a room in your house which you re not using  then you can turn that into a money-making opportunity    there are several websites like airbnb  where you can add your room for rent   4  renting your car  pretty much similar to renting your home  now you can rent out your car  let your car make money for you when you re not using it  if you have a car or more than one car  then you have the opportunity to rent those and make some money passively  sites like turo is a great place to list your car for rent  this site helps you to rent out your car  and when anyone rents your car  it will manage the further activities   5  savings

1943,List of useless jobs,after failing to find one after a cursory glance at this sub and related ones  i figured i'd compile a list of useless or near-useless jobs    in no particular order   1  human resources -- might need one or two people-managing-people  but there are too many and they are primarily concerned with protecting the company  2  some lawyers  this is a hard one  but i feel that rationalizing the tax code could make many tax lawyers unnecessary overnight  3  greeters at walmart etc  i don't see how they even help the company  let alone society at large  4  loss prevention personnel  there would be no shoplifting  or close to none  if there was no poverty  5  police in general  for the same reason  not all police are useless  but their numbers could be reduced with decent welfare programs  6  some ceos and other executives are completely useless  others are useful for the company but not really useful to anyone else  7  most taxi drivers   uber not-employees would be obsoleted by decent public transit  8  chauffeurs  personal chefs  and other jobs that exist as status symbols for the rich  9  lobbyists are not  useless   per se  but they are the product of a broken political system and only serve to perpetuate it  even when they push good policies  10  it varies by company  but many middle managers are of severely limited utility  they might only accomplish a few hours' worth of necessary work a week  11  management consultants  i have heard countless stories of consultants either doing nothing useful or stating the obvious and being ignored  i have never heard of one who improved efficiency at anything  12  secret shoppers and other jobs that only exist because companies do not trust their own employees  13  high-frequency traders  14  everyone working in the poverty-exploitation industry  payday loans  debt buyers  etc   that's all i can think of for now  if you think one of these isn't useless  or have another you'd like to add  i'll modify the list ,oja12e

1946,The middle class doesn't exist,t helps to realize there is no  middle class  economically   this has several ramifications   the  middle class  in your perception may imply some sort of  averageness  in that it is  average size   the mental implication of calling something the  middle  is that there is around 33  low class people  33 middle class people  and 33  high class people   this is false  in fact the average person in the  first world  sits in a class of around the top 10  of people in the world   this is  an average  though  and wealth inequality is much greater in  first world  countries  however the  middle class  in your perception is a vanishingly small number of people   the  middle class  is a buffer class  that is put in the  middle  of the large mass of working class people and the ridiculously small ruling and owning class   this has two purposes   by standing in what appears to be the  middle  of economic accomplishment  they inspire the lower classes to work harder and achieve a  middle class  existence   the buffer is also a defense for the upper classes  in that the middle class is kept just comfortable enough that they are unlikely to attack the upper classes and hurt their place in society  and are likely to even fight and die to uphold the system that oppresses them ,oir3o5

1953,"Work is destroying my personality and turning me into a robot, what do I do?",i've been working at a warehouse for about 2 months now  and i feel myself becoming less of the person that i was before i started working there  everyday  it feels like i loose brain cells as i do the same mind numbing thing for 12 hours a day  whoever thought that 12 hour shifts were a good idea seriously needs to reconsider their whole life  whilst being forced to listen to a stupid radio station with its overly cheerful and fake presenters who absolutely love to play overplayed pop songs  we can't listen to our own music  which i find really annoying  and there's not much i can do other than to listen to the radio so that i don't have to think about my physical health going down the drain   i can barely enjoy the 3-4 glorious days off that i get in a week because it involves me trying to decompress from my job only to mentally and physically prepare to go to work again  as well as waking up at the crack of dawn  usually at 5am  just to push a stupid trolley about so that i can make a bunch of impulse buyers  that i'll probably never see  happy with their items for like 5 minutes   i can barely form a coherent thought anymore  even writing this post feels hard  although i used to enjoy writing one way or another  my attention span has gone down the drain  thanks to the fact that we have to be  efficient  all the time  even when i was an avid mainstream social media user  i e  using instagram all the time  i had a better attention span and could at least do things without losing my concentration for a while  along with my short term memory as i'm starting to forget things a lot more often now  and i barely have the energy or headspace to actively enjoy my hobbies anymore  not to mention that work has literally invaded my dreams and all i get now are dreams that are somewhat related to work instead of the weird and wonderful dreams that i used to have   i still haven't acknowledged the fact that i'm now 20  despite celebrating my birthday last month although i had to end it abruptly because i had to go to work the next day and didn't get to enjoy it as much as i wanted to  the day itself was fine  but when the evening rolled around  i started to become on edge  on top of that  i always feel anxious the night before i have to go work and knowing that i'm going to be rudely woken up by my alarm at 5am  to the point where i've tried to speedrun my sleep so that i'm awake before my alarm   it feels like i've become a robot who only knows how to navigate a warehouse and that's it  i've become another cog in the machine  which is my worst nightmare and i wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy  and a part of the army of zombie robot penguins that all mechanically march out of the warehouse just after 6pm only to come back just before 6am the next day to do the same mindless drivel for 12 hours  the days where i work feel wasted  like i've been in a coma  since i have nothing to show for them  and the worst bit is that i don't even get a glimpse to see the fruits of my labour   i've practically lost my personality  not to mention the amount of insane numbing headaches that i get  which last for days at a time  and i really do not enjoy work at all  so i'm surprised that i've managed to stick it out for 2 months  i've gone past the point of caring and my mindset now is  fire me  i dare you  because i absolutely hate being another cog in the machine since it's made me downright miserable  not to mention the amount of times that i've come home from work and tried my best not to cry tears of boredom and stress   i have no other alternative since most people my age have jobs and i don't want to spend the summer sat at home when i could be getting the all important work experience as well as money  and i'm struggling to find another job  so  what should i do   also  if i see another hi vis jacket  i am going to scream ,ojd2f1

2021,"Already a Wage Slave, Now I'm a slave to Google Reviews?",got an email from management that the company received two one-star reviews   keep in mind  any asshole off the street can leave a google review    now  i had been trying to grow in this company  i did more work than is my job - mainly because it's the work i'd rather be doing  it's work that is someone else's  but that someone else is way overworked  and underpaid  i've been helping out  because this work is something that someone should be giving 100  of their attention to  it takes a lot of energy to do main duties and this work    in this company they like to say that  everyone wears many hats around here    so i've been wearing this goddamned hat also  and asked weeks ago if they could just hire a pt replacement for the menial tasks i do and let me take this work on full-time from home  i said that since they're a growing company  they need the extra staff to be effective  i'm really good at this job  i don't hate it like my current duties   we'll talk in the future  never did  i've still been helping out  hoping they'll see the merits of my point    now this google bullshit    all the hard work we did to get 4 stars and it's been wiped out by these two one star reviews overnight   yeah  almost like it doesn't fucking matter  employers care more about some dipshit review than what their own employees are telling them they need     how can we work so that this doesn't happen   so i let management know -- reply all -- that it was my fault  because i'd gotten so wrapped up in helping out with this other work  i neglected my own duties  and how it's easy to get wrapped up in this other work because we're understaffed  and how this isn't an isolated issue  it's actually affecting multiple facets of the business  but that from now on that person whose work it is  is on their own and i'll just go back to focusing on my own work  and  only  my own work   which means they just lost a bunch of extra free labor over this one star bullshit   it's not just that they care about the ratings  it's not that they wanted to point out places we could improve but they recognize how hard we work  it's the bullshit  what can we do  attitude - when the answer is the same one repeated over and over  hire more people  but they want the answer to be 'oh no  oh i'm so sorry i'll work harder to wear more hats and do everything to the liking of any asshole on the street'   fuck you  google reviewing motherfucker  experiences may very   ugh  anyway  i'm quitting  long live the great recession ,oj4big

2063,"7, this rule is so underrated, keep your family and business completely separated",i'm so fucking done   i'm a business trainee  it's essentially a paid internship where by the end of my 12 month contract  i'll have a business qualification  i was hired by the employment centre that runs my traineeship and they've placed me in a fucking squalor  it's a family run roof-racking business managed by three bothers -- the manager  the eldest  the orders man  the middle brother  and the fitter  the youngest  additionally  their bat-shit mother at aged 70  also works here  there are only three of us who are non-familial employees -- the apprentice  also an employee at the employment centre i'm employed by  the phone man  a retail salesman guy who answers many of our phone calls and works in the shop  and me    and my god  that one lyric from the ten crack commandments could never be more true  biggie knew some wise shit   i haven't worked much in my 24 years alive  i didn't start working until i was out of high school due to school commitments and wanting to get into uni  though that never worked out  so i threw myself into full time  i've only ever had two full time jobs and the last one was also a traineeship that ended badly due to negligence from the host company i was at  ironic  and the second is where i am now  which i've somehow miraculously managed to not slit my wrists through after being here for 7 months  the rest have been casual stints that never lasted long due to lack of hours or i was a christmas casual   i have never worked in such a disrespectful workplace  i have never worked in such a toxic environment where this family cares nada about their employees  want to go on leave  even when you have enough  i don't think so  because we don't have enough staff because these fuckers keep dragging their heels  the phones guy wanted to take a week off for school holidays so he can spend time with his kids  what does the manager do   no  i need you  a week is too long  i'll give you friday and saturday off  is this illegal  pretty sure it is  i'm just lucky that these wankers aren't my true employers because then i'd never get leave despite being full entitled to it like the phones guy   the family fights all the time  there are literal screaming matches  all caused by the fitter who is essentially a man child throwing a tanty when things don't go his way  the mother is always on the fitter's side  basically being very combative against the orders man and the manager -- her own sons -- making the situation worse  the screaming and swearing is so loud that you can hear it from upstairs  and there have been many instances where customers in the showroom upstairs can hear the screaming matches  how do i know they can hear it  oh  well  it's clearly displayed on their faces as their eyes widen in shock  it's embarrassing to say the least  every single one of these people have a screw loose  some more than others  not just that  these people are so disrespectful to customers  it baffles me that these people made over a million dollars in profit last year and yet the rudeness they exhibit to customers who have knowledge of the industry is baffling  it's always to people that know some or even equal to them on product knowledge  so it's like they're threatened by this or something   the manager is an asshole  he's supposed to be training me as my host employer and as a trainee myself  does he do that  nah  so i have to go around blindly trying to teach myself  which obviously means i'm going to make mistakes  and when i do make these mistakes  i get talked down to -- i guess even mansplained -- which can be easily avoided if i was fucking taught how to do shit  the manager is snappy  talks to me disrespectfully  and clearly doesn't trust me because every phone call i answer he hovers over me like a helicopter parent  after 7 months  he does not trust me  do i blame him for that  yes  because i have if i was trained properly  you'd be able to fucking trust me  when the manager is stressed  he takes it out on me through snappy remarks  eye rolling  cutting me off during explanations and just in general disrespect  therefore completely not incentivising me to want to ask for help  i hate asking him for help from him  but i never have a choice because i know nothing about this industry nor have i been taught properly  rather  when i do ask for help  i get sarcastic replies  complete disrespect  and he makes me feel stupid for asking anything at all    the orders man is no better i'm not a graphic artist  but i have a bit of experience doing it for my own small business  but when i've made stuff for him with little to no idea on what he wants -- so i ask questions  get very vague answers  so i just freely assume what he'd like -- he never gives me constructive criticism  rather  his replies are usually   what's this shit around here  or  i don't like this shit  majority of the time  it's just   figure it out for yourself  well  okay  i'll do that   what the fuck is this  i didn't ask for this  well  cunt  maybe give me more of a fucking idea of what you want next time  he's asked me what i think  i tell him and always finish with  whatever you want  i'll make it  which i get an eye roll for  well  what do you want me to say  when i do what i think  it's  shit  when i do what you think  it's still  shit  i've sat next to this motherfucker as he's thrown the phone receiver at his desk -- like  full-on hurled it -- while the customer was still on the line  he calls everyone who calls into the store wanting questions answered  dumb cunts  and things similar  and he swears every sentence  even to customers  i don't have a problem with that  i swear every sentence too  not at work  though  since it's supposed to be a  professional environment  apparently  what i do have a problem with is calling my work  shit  when if more directives were given  it wouldn't be  shit  oh  also  this asshole has made fun of my math skills on more than one occasion  okay  yeah  i'm sorry that my math isn't that great  but i'm not a fucking accountant  i'm a business admin trainee  i do office work  not number work    ironically  despite having the most screws loose  the fitter is the nicest out of the three  he's never gotten angry at me  is never snappy or mean  he's always been very cordial and nice  he's had a tanty and then i've talked to him a bit later and he's always nice despite previous events  i don't respect him  though  i respect no one here   the mother is just a weird creature  she comes in at 6am every work day despite us opening at 8 15am and fucks around in the workshop for ages  and she doesn't use deodorant  my god  the smell  it's terrible  she comes into the office sometimes to count the money to take to the bank  and i have to hold my breath and breathe shallowly every time she sits across from me  it's that bad  in winter -- which it is now -- she's not that bad  but when it was summer in december  it was absolutely putrid  i have a horse and even he and his shit doesn't smell has bad as what this mother stinks of    i fully regret not complaining to my supervisor of the employment centre earlier  at least  i regret not properly complaining and demanding a transfer  i've complained about this treatment before and asked to be transferred about 4 months in  but got persuaded to stay and give the manager and his team a chance since i got dumped here at an erratic time  essentially  i was asked to be patient  well  it's been 7 months and nothing has fucking changed  it's gotten worse  even  i have no incentive to work for these people because of the disrespect  i have no drive to do my job because of the constant nasty criticism and snappy replies  i don't have any wish to work here when these people are stressed  because it's like walking on eggshells and i have to crack one because  whether i like it or not  i have to ask for help and then i get bashed with words  i hate it here and i want out  the qualification isn't even worth it anymore  i never go home happy  i never come to work happy  mondays are days i dread  i'm depressed  i do the best i can  i do everything i'm asked  i'm a fucking doormat for these assholes and i'm done  i can't do it anymore    my supervisor comes in once a month to visit and see how i'm going and to talk to the manager about my  progress  this time  i'm telling her everything  i'm laying all my cards on the table  and  this time  i'm giving her an ultimatum -- you transfer me to somewhere better  healthier  more professional  and somewhere where i'll actually be trained or i'm walking  i'd rather be unemployed than work here  the qualification is simply not worth it  i'll be grilled about why i didn't say anything much earlier  and all i can say is that i've been patient and i've tried giving these people a chance  and there's nothing to show for that  i'm done     amp x200b    7  this rule is so underrated    keep your family and business completely separated    money and blood don't mix like 2 dicks and no bitch    find yourself in

2065,Full time should be 30 hours/week and OT should be expensive.,i feel like the 40 hour work week used to seem reasonable because when it was instituted  there wasn't nearly as much to do besides work  sleep  and put up with your family   i imagine more than a few workers went to work just to escape screaming child hell   nowadays there is too much going on and 8 hour shifts don't leave enough time to attend to it all and still be able to rest or do something because it's fun instead of because you have to   also  real wages used to be a lot higher  because the dollar was more valuable  so while you'd work your 8 and be tired at the end of it  the pay you got was actually decent so being tired didn't feel quite so bad   it was a lot more worth it   compare to now  where we're exhausted after working 8  and the pay you get is barely enough to get by and you're constantly having to scrimp  and scrape  and cut budget   it feels so bad    my paycheck would be much more reasonable if shifts were 6 hours instead of 8    after 5 to 6 hours at work i start to feel really trapped   going in knowing that i'll be stuck there for 8 isn't a very happy thought either   the worst shifts are the ones where were busys slammed and it feels like it must have been at least an hour  maybe two  because we're doing so much  look at the wristwatch and nope  5 minutes   and again  more being busy  has to have been at least an hour  nope  5 minutes   if the who shift is like that  it's incredibly painful and by the time we finally get down to 2 hours left  it feels like we've been trapped in the building for days   it's a lot different when it's a 6 hour shift  because  at least for me  it's like  eh  i don't really want to go but it's only 6 hours so that's not too bad   there's still time to get things done and not have to run my ass off after running it off at work   lastly  overtime needs a reform   if full time is 30 hours  then 30  to 40 should be time-and-a-half  1 5x  40  to 50 should be double time  2x  and 50  should be triple time  3x   also  the law should set a limit of 5 working days in a row max  if the employer requires more than that then the 6th day would be 1 5x  whole shift  day 7 would be 2x  day 8 would be 3x  day 9 would be 4x  and so on  and those modifiers would stack multiplicative with over-hours ot modifiers   third shift   all work done after 11pm and before 8am should be 1 5x  stacking with all other modifiers   people always say the same thing to me when i suggest this   that won't work   the companies can't afford that   they'll go out of business and then you'll be out of a job   they're right about one thing  the companies can't afford that  but they won't go out of business   they'll stop forcing the overtime   i don't want to see such a draconian ot reform to make wages higher  or to cost companies money   i want to see it to kill off ot in general  just get rid of it   lastly  lunches need to be paid  no more  8 hour  shifts that are really 8 5 hours because lunch isn't paid   your commute mileage should be paid because we're putting wear and tear on our own cars so that the fat-ass  overpaid  overstuffed ceo can buy a new boat every year  and car repairs are expensive   the employer should have to cover that   driving is a miserable experience on top of that  and it's a misery we're not being paid for  we're paying for it   that's all for now  fuck work   don't get hit by a bus ,oigvpo

2067,quit my retail job today and it went ugly,my job was ugly before  for example they told us not to get tested when covid started  so we still have enough workers  there were a lot more health risk issues before  but  let that one sink in    i was blind and trusting  and let myself be manipulated even before this job  i'm 33 and have reoccurring panic attacks  burn out and was in therapy before because of it and of course  i hoped it would get better    we are chronically understaffed since 2 years and every schedule switches constantly  everyone is expected to hop in whenever at this point-get a call at 11am  be there at 2pm  we weren't paid what we deserved- when covid came they made huge profit  and cut our pay  i'm still not convinced it was legal     when i told them today that i'll quit  they showed every bad trait available  bosses went angry at me first  ranting to me  no one here holds together  no team feel  and when things just get a little bit bad people quit - and left me standing there  she and my other boss later tried to talk me out of it   not with offering anything though  no  they  chatted  in front of me about how everywhere else it is the same bad circumstances  yet trying to tell me that  right here  it is still so much better than anywhere else and that i am very valuable to them    later in my shift  one of them tried to get me with fear of  future since they know about it  talked about tight money  and how people without a job get treated badly  get sent to far districts and what not  they both tried bit more later on  knowing i'm in bad mental shape  trying to get me there    all i have to say about that  is  i  can't believe that i trusted these people and went along for so long   i'm going to get myself mental help and then see what my better options are    and i want to advice anyone thinking about starting in retail to look up narcissist as well as manipulative behavior to be prepared  it is just so ugly how all that went ,ohoqgk

2075,The machine is a wood chipper: A story.,i had something sad happened friday and i didn't realize it was still bothering me until tonight  i guess i'm looking for commiseration  empathy  maybe some shared stories  though certainly not unsolicited advice   here's the story    i went back to college in january of this year to try and find a new career path  chokes on buzz words    one of the guys in my class today  was mentioning how he had started working a job recently and that he was exhausted all week from working 8 to 9 hour shifts on top of going to school full time   he said that his workplace had been giving him too many hours and he was asking people's opinion on whether he should talk to them and let them know that it's too much for him  or wait it out  i later learned that it's a new job  etc some other details  so the advice shift later once i knew that  but here's how the convo that pulled my heart went   i of course  being far older than the rest of the folks in the class   they're 18 mostly  and i am decidedly a long way from that   offered my own experience   essentially i said  totally do whatever it is you need to do  and if you need to make the money  then by all means no judgment and do what you got to do   but  if you have an option of financial stability some other way if you stand up for yourself aka if you have a buffer   i'd say to let them know  because that's a lot of hours and working any job and being in school is a lot to deal with  you run out of time to person    and the dude said  yeah i mean i don't have any time for myself anymore  i just go to school  go to work  sleep  and wake up and do the whole thing over again   my heart is already cracking a bit at this because this guy is so young and he doesn't realize this is the lie of adulthood  the one they don't tell you  you can't be anything you want  and shit is brutal more than is ever told to kids to prepare them   so i said  yeah man  you definitely need time to person  and like  not everyone will agree with me on this  but not everyone can do the work and school thing  and the job will very likely push you because you're a young guy and basically no one is going to look out for your physical or mental health but you so make sure that if you need to let them know  do   and this poor boy  my heart honestly broke  he goes   yeah  like i don't even have time to myself anymore  to be an 18 year old kid   and like  just the honesty of that was    i mean the curmudgeon in me went  oh the sweet flower still thinks 18 is a kid  for a hot second  but i stopped and was like  woah there brain train  he's right  and more importantly than  right  or not biologically or societally   that's how he sees himself and feels  and realizing he is so terribly unprepared for how brutal working customer service can be to your soul and how i was also once that innocent and optimistic   the machine is like a woodchipper for meat    and the meat is us   our hopes and dreams    our sleep and social connections    our ability to brain and not cry that it's monday    it all goes to the meat chipper that is being forced to work  work or starve and be homeless   earn a living   i just  oof     thanks for reading ,oikch5

2090,I'm anti-work and it's a problem.,i'll keep it short   i hate being commanded by someone  especially if it is not necessary  for example hierarchies such as a boss   the next problem is simply forced social interactions such as customer service   now to my personal problems  i don't like doing physically demanding work  but all that 'unskilled' labor is only left around here  or work in the social section such as careworker  no  sorry  i just can't do that kind of work especially with shitty wage   another problem is the time  40 hours  seriously  not even 30 hours  i want 0 hours  but maybe i can do 10  15 hours  there's not even jobs around here with 20 hours  and the wages would make it impossible to even 'live' from your work especially if you need to use the public transportation   what do i even want money for  basically nothing  i just want to have a somewhat modern computer so i can play normal games and guranteed healthy food  that's all i want yet i need to work 40 hours or even more technically to have that guranteed especially with shitty temp work 'unskilled' labour   and the most ironic thing is that i already knew this sort of when i was 14  now i'm more or less half a decade older and i dislike work even more    what would be my next step  doing 3 years some apprenticeship where i'm paid even more shitty  doing it for 8 hours a day and feeling dread because i'm wasting my life by slaving away and then i'm locked into some kind of job i don't even want  like i scrolled through all jobs  i want none of them  maybe there's a few where i'm like  hm  maybe 10 hours a week    urgh  just wanted to rant a little bit  it's hard being a long-term unemployed anti-worker and you're surrounded by neoliberals and distasteful teachers trying to psychological manipulate you into slaving away in employment courses meanwhile they earn money from doing so ,ohqbd5
2091,Job application work culture stinks,i submitted my cv for review but what got on my nerves wasn't the critique  which is fine  but the mentality behind employers  here are a few examples    from the way the cv is worded  you come across as a  doer  as opposed to an  achiever  too many of your job descriptions are task-based and not results-based  this means that they tell you what you did  instead of what you achieved  this is a normal mistake for non-professional cv writers  to be effective and create excitement a great cv helps the hiring executive envisage you delivering similar achievements at his or her company     i guess this sort of reeks of false advertising  or selling yourself  i don't like this culture  i ignore ads and sales pitches routinely and i find go-getters insufferable for their narcissism  i don't understand the appeal of gary vaynerchuk at all    here's some more     when i read your cv  i did not find the kind of compelling language that would bring your work to life  instead  i saw passive words and non-action verbs   phrases like  preparing  and  providing  are overused  monotonous  and add little value to your cv  strong action verbs  used with compelling language to outline exemplary achievements  are essential parts of a well-constructed cv   now  let's put it all together  here's a real life example taken from a former client's cv  by changing the language  we helped to improve the perception of the candidate       passive language   doing   negotiated contracts with vendors      action language   achieving   slashed payroll benefits administration costs 30  by negotiating pricing and fees  while ensuring the continuation and enhancements of services   one thing i've noticed across the board  not just in cv writing  is the fetishisation of active sentences  i never knew that passive language now extends to specific words rather than grammar  but from the above example  slashed  sounds like some patrick bateman style serial killer wordage   if you've read 1984  corporate approved language does remind me a little of newspeak  again i don't profess to say my cv is perfect  i just hate the mentality behind hiring culture  it reeks of egotism  falsity and an undercurrent of violence  and yet they make it seem like it's normal and something to strive towards  yeah  i guess and i'd ask how's your society doing these days  not so hot eh ,oi362s

2094,I want to quit my job.,i am 27 and i have been working in a security company for the last 3 1 2 years  the only reason why i got this job was because i currently live with my dad still and my dads roommate was a supervisor for the company  i hate working this job because they ask me to do a lot of overtime sometimes 10 to 12 hour shifts and some of it is standing outside in 115 degree weather  i get asked to do a lot of ot but i am afraid to decline since my supervisor was once my roommate he moved out earlier 2020  he would know that i just would rather goof off and play video games  not only that but my dad has a strong pro work ethic and says that i should take as much ot as i should even though i personally hate it  he also says i should quit a job right when i have another one lined up   i have been thinking about wanting to do a remote job for a while now ever since the pandemic hit and everyone was told to work from home  i would like to switch jobs but i got a couple of vacations one in late august and early september that i want to go on  but i hear that companies don't like it when you go on a vacation right when you start a new job  i personally think that working from home would be great for me  i know that some people say that they hate remote work  but most of the complaints that i see against remote work are that people have kids they want to get away from or they live close to the office  i am alone most of the time and don't have kids so it should be great for me  plus  i get to sleep in 8 hours fully  no commute 40 minutes by bike or 1hr 30 minutes both ways by bus  i get to wear the clothes i want  i get to take gaming breaks  make dinner  and watch tv shows and movies in the background  so with all that  should i quit my job and how would i find a remote job ,oi8ybz

2180,A good read,farmer bones  his is a hell of a paragraph   americans are  of course  the most thoroughly and passively indoctrinated people on earth  they know next to nothing as a rule about their own history  or the histories of other nations  or the histories of the various social movements that have risen and fallen in the past  and they certainly know little or nothing of the complexities and contradictions comprise within words like  socialism  and  capitalism  chiefly  what they have been trained not to know or even suspect is that  in many ways  they enjoy far fewer freedom  and suffer under a more intrusion centralized state  than do the citizens of countries with more vigorous social-democratic institutions  his is at once the most comic and most tragic aspect of the excitable alarm that talk of social democracy or democratic socialism can elicit on these shores  in enormous number of americans have been persuaded to believe that they are freer in the abstract than  say  germans or panes precisely because they possess far fewer freedom in the concrete  they are far more vulnerable to medical and financial crisis  far more likely to receive inadequate health coverage  far more prone to irreparable insolence  far more protected against predator creditors  far more subject to income inequality  and so forth  while effectively paying more in tax  when one figures in federal  state  local  and sales taxes  and then compounds those by all the expenditures that in this country  as almost nowhere else   their taxes do not cover  one might think that a people who once repelled against the mightier empire on earth on the principle of no taxation without representation would not meekly accept taxation without adequate government services  but we accept what we have become used to  i suppose  even so  one has to ask  what state apparatus in the  free  world could be more powerful and tyrannical than the one that taxes its citizens while providing no substantial civic benefits in return  solely in order to enrich a practically overinflated military-industrial complex and to ease the tax burdens of the  immensely wealthy     ,ohjwm8
2181,Saw another post about interviewing experiences- I just had someone fall asleep in my virtual interview,i'm currently employed but not happily so  trying to find something new and less stressful    just got off my third interview with this company  all of which have been virtual  the first was with the manager this position would report too  it went great  the person and i totally hit it off and agree on work life balance  the last two have been awful and with other leaders  the first wasn't paying attention at all- would ask a question then start typing as i would answer and then would scramble to find the paper with the next question on it  the third was ten minutes ago- the person was slouched on a couch  didn't seem interested in talking to me and then proceeded to fall asleep  i didn't notice at first but after ten seconds of dead air i heard a snore  i sat there for thirty seconds and then just hung up    i'm so over this process  its the worst  i feel like i should reach out to the manager and explain what happened but i don't even want to be involved with a company like this  the two leaders were 2 of 5 at the top  just seems pathetic    if i behaved like the did  i'd never got through round 1,ogzl2h

2199,"Got my dream job 2 years ago. Almost got raped by a manager, left immediately, I've been freelance since. TY for this sub",i've been lurking in this sub for awhile  i'm kinda glad that you all have the sentiments i have regarding my views with work and how truly manipulative some companies can be  i never told this story before to any of my friends because i feel like its a burden  judging from this sub  you seem to understand these type of things  abuse  it makes me feel validated for the beliefs i attained after the incident when i got my first real job in my field cause i never went back to  orthodox  jobs because i have trauma still and have been trying to decide if i should go back to office work corporate in general  i love to work whenever i feel like it and now i'm faced by the pressure of my parents decisions about my freelance life  well here's my tragic story   three years ago  i always knew that i'd work immediately after college since our school culture loved competing with who's gonna have work first and the biggest company to work for  it's toxic  i know but i jumped on the train and did my resume  i was an active student  i even made it really pretty using photoshop and bought a nice suit for interviews   i am already a freelance worker to begin with  i loved creative work but my folks didn't like that and wanted me to be in an office instead  cause they are asian and they want me to be a  professional  so  i got a job in this really big food company in my country  my psrents were floored because its a pretty big deal  they'd love to please people and tell about it  i didn't care i judt wanted to earn money to have good equipment for my creative work    so  to start  i got my own huge office  huge benefits and a really great ladder of opportunities  yet that's what i thought   i was hired to be a trainer and offered a salary that was pretty competitive to where i lived  i was given a big office  it all seemed too good to be true  then my hunches were right  i suddenly had to move to another office  yet  i had to well  clean it cause  they never hired a janitor yet  i had to buy my own supplies too which was weird  they never told me this in the interview which is already a big red flag cause i didn't work for that responsibility   what am i supposed to do  i have no problems cleaning but they won't pay me for it  my manager told me  just see this as tapping knowledge in office architecture  rude but okay  this is my dream job so sure  it looks like i could do it on top of the multitude of stuff i had to do    second red flag is  i was presented with contract for signing and my monthly compensation dropped noticeably  i said  i thought i was offered  x  amount  then they were like  we know you're willing work here right  its just that you'll get so much here such as travel benefits  its gonna be on your travel card  the extra cash is in it  it'll be the same  i was so confused  extra work  less pay  maybe  then i never got the card  also i had to train people so i had to stay in hotels and staff housing  i was even told i would travel from island to island  which is not what i signed up for  because it would be a town to town thing i was like  well they have accomodation so alright  naybe free food too  it was all like clouded at this point    i was travelling long hours and started to contemplate that this job was a mistake  i had to carry office stuff using my car  i am not a company car why am i doing this  this is not in the contract  i got stuff too heavy for a woman like me  yet the  cool  free uniform they gave  the free stuff  the pride they shown me it seemed so rewarding but it felt like a scam  then i met the people who i will train  the crew  i was part of the fastfood department for training so i got an immersion  oretty normal  then i cried right after   let me tell you  these people  they don't have bathrooms  they don't have lunch breaks  they work 12 hours for 10 dollars a day  sometimes even 7 dollars  sometimes none  someone reported to me they worked 36 hours straight because they couldn't get someone to cover their shift  some were pregnant  some made mistakes and begged me to not tell the upper management  i couldn't stomach it  morale is zero to none  alot of questionable stuff is happening  then reality hit when i met the folks training me  they were all leaving me   they told me they couldn't stomach the job anymore  they are leaving me so i could do all the work by myself  they said thy only worked for  x  amount of time because  its a famous company  my manager at the time was a terrible witch that  transferred her whole office in a different part of the building in the company cause of her attitude and maltreatment  her assistant told me nasty shit and told me  leave before you can  this isn't the place for you  and i didn't even ask  it was scary and heartbreaking because i thought so differently of this company   the three nights before i decided to leave  i stayed in the staffhouse  i said i was gonna stay in a hotel but they dropped me there because of scheduling reasons  yeah right  it was gender separated  so it's only natural to see only women in my quarters  this was not the case  as i was about to sleep  three drunken men forcefully entered my room  they wanted me to drink with them  i was in bed with my pajamas  i remember earlier that day  the lady in my room introduced me to one of them and he was a manager  i was so scared i pretended to talk to someone on the phone using a voice recording of my friend as they wanna yank me  i cried after they left when they heard the sound of my phone  i never experienced being harrased like that by three large men  it was so scary i thought i was gonna die  then i asked my roomate  the lady l if men were allowed in our rooms and they said that was a big violation  i was really done for cause if a newbie like me reported something like that in a foreign place  id be ridiculed or power tripped  i couldn't handle the stress anymore because it wasn't what i was expecting nor applied for to have jfc  i left after a month  i got nothing  not a single cent from them  which i'm glad for  don't want any dirty money   my mom then was diagnosed with a strange gout that left her legs slightly paralyzed  i used that as an excuse to leave work indefinitely  my girlfriend picked me up and told my mom she will work and she wants me to stay freelance instead because of this story  so guys  working for greedy bastards is terrible no matter how reputable they seem  it's not worth the trauma   ps  whenever i tell this story to my parents they say i should try again because i was just unlucky  that really doesn't help  i was exploited  mom and dad ,ogylmz

2289,"This might be it, I think today is the day I walk out forever",i'm done  i am planning on quitting today  i have had enough   i want to preface this with a little bit of info  i've known since my first year that the ceo and a ton of higher management are scientologists  i've essentially just minded my own and paid no attention to any of that  but in regards to how me and other employees were treated i definitely feel like that factors into this  seeing as how the ceo has a legal history of firing people for not wanting to convert   i've worked for the same office for almost four years now  i do data entry for an at home sleep study office and at first i was pretty content with my job  it was my first office job and the people i directly worked with were wonderful  i liked my manager  coworkers were great  and even people on the phone were tolerable  there were always minor things that happened  but nothing too bad   well  2020 happened  that was a shit show    first off  no one took covid seriously  i heard higher ups joking about it comparing it to hiv aids in that it will eventually not be an issue  lol  they only sent people to work from home once the local government required them to  and even then as soon as they could we were demanded to come back in office  no one wore masks  no safety precautions  nothing  multiple people became sick  they never informed anyone that covid cases happened in the office   after that  they outsourced about 40 percent of the office  i had to watch coworkers leave in tears  they expected us to keep the same workload with half of the office gone and with incompetent outsourced employees   after all of this  i was very drained and stressed but still working due to y'know  capitalism  but they decided to mess with the one thing you should never touch  paychecks  the pay period was change from biweekly to whatever  this http imgur com a adslrhz  mess is  honestly a lot of us working here think it's due to the ceo not wanting to have to pay employees potentially three times in a month  three times now checks have bounced  and as of today they handed out checks on today  our payday  and said we cannot cash it till next tuesday    i feel like this is all some sick twisted joke  i have reported this place multiple times to the department of labor and nothing has ever happened  so i am doing what is best for me and plan on walking out today  i have nothing lined up but thankfully i have some savings and i'm thankfully in a good rent situation  i'm still scared but this is the right thing to do ,ogwx80
2290,"Cheer me up, please",hi    i'm going in front of my desk to work every day for months  and yet i don't work  i put myself in front of my computer  i boot it up  i open the software required for my work  i respond to a bunch of messages and emails  but when it comes to actual work  i do a pause before working  then i do another pause after that pause  then i go grab something to eat  then it's not worth to begin working before lunch  and i do that all day  and it has been months  i'm not even doing something enjoyable  nice or productive  i just distract myself on internet  because i'll work right after that  or so i convince myself  i'm just trying to find energy to begin working  but it takes me ages to find it  sometimes  i find the energy to actually work  but it usually doesn't last more than one day   a few months ago  i actually had a several days streak  but then  one day  i woke up  motivated to work  i open the company chat app  and some colleague is asking me to change stuff because it doesn't please his way of working  he doesn't present it this way  he's asking for improvements  but these improvements are really just style changes  i try to argue politely that he's wrong  it's only about style  and he can't force his style on my work  but he's not having it  my motivation evaporates  i could argue against him more  go to higher ups  but i just don't have the energy  and accept to make all the changes he asks for the sake of getting rid of the task  even that was hard because he'd change his mind multiple times along the way and would make me changes stuff back and forth  at least  during that process  i very clearly  firmly and politely told him he's full of bs  and he'll never bother me anymore i think   i'm amazed i didn't get fired yet  frankly  if the boss calls me and tells me he fires me because i underperform  i'd just agree  no hard feeling  just the plain truth  but it doesn't happen  it has been almost two years  and i think a productive worker would need a single month to do what i did in that time   i liked my previous job way more  i was a productive worker  but they were underpaying me  they bs they couldn't pay more  but i knew it was bs  invoices from some projects went over my desk  i knew they had tremendous sales  i applied elsewhere  got offers  they made a counter a bit lower than the best offer  the raise i initially asked was way below that counter offer  i doubled my gross salary by switching job  i wouldn't even have applied elsewhere if they didn't try to lowball me  i would have accepted the counter offer if the new job didn't seem so nice  industry and technology wise  anyway  the previous company went under because of covid  so there's no going back   it's not like i hate my job  well  i had some difficulty to adapt because my team were asocial people who would eat in front of their computers  always speak about work related stuff  and the tasks i had were poorly defined  among other things  i changed team a few times  and after about a year  things were better  yet  my motivation never came back  colleagues are friendly  tasks are well-defined and useful  i don't have to speak with clients  the pay is good  but i can't work   i'm wondering  will it get better if i switch job   do i need like a year of holiday to reload   i fear i'm just broken and that the job is not the problem  anymore  well  it's not like i don't have a plan  i'm doing evening courses along my full-time job  i'll present my thesis next month  being able to enjoy my evenings and weekends should really help me rest  then i go freelance by next year  that way i can switch job way faster if i don't like it or take time off whenever i want  i obviously need to pay bills but worst case  working six months a year should be enough to survive  i'm really not sure if it'll work out  though   thanks for reading  sorry if it was long  i needed to vent ,oh52kt

2293,Just a idea?,since many managers and ceo want to cry about how lazy people are nowadays because they don t want to be mistreated and treat like a disposable cog for minimum wages   maybe we should start making fake resumes that look amazing  ie  college degree  years of experiences in fields  etc  and apply for some low wages job   accept the interview   at the interview  agree to all awful crap they want to stacks onto employees   toward the end  look at them and turn the table on them  ask hard questions such as     and  would you be happy to take such a position    if this happen  how do you want to be treated  will you treat the lowest staffs in such manner    how many hours do you actually work  why should those people work more than you for peanuts   i think if we all can gather up all of their answers to such questions  it would be great to get them out in the public just so the world can see the difference ,oh0u0x

2307,"Hate my Job as a software developer, need to transition careers for the sake of my health",i currently work as a software developer and i hate my job  i absolutely cannot stand it anymore   it's starting to get to a point where it's seriously affecting my physical health  not just my mental health  i have an anxiety disorder and i absolutely have to find a way to reduce my stress  i wake up every week day morning with a sense of dread  i'm having issues sleeping  i'm having digestive problems  i get deeply depressed on sunday evenings  i am just miserable    i'm realizing i hate coding  even if i only had to do it 40 hours a week or even 30 i'd still hate it   the work is boring  difficult and tedious  i can't daydream while working bc i have to constantly be focused  my evenings and weekends are basically useless in terms of my personal life because i have to spend that time recovering from work  i'm always exhausted after a work day or work week  this makes it hard to look for new work because my current job takes up all my time and energy    the industry has zero respect for work life balance  every single company i have worked for lied to my face about only having to work 40 hours a week  i regularly work 50 or sometimes up to 70  hours in a week  if i take a day off they don't reduce the amount of work given to me so when i come back from a day off i have to play catch-up   it's also a thankless job  i receive constant feedback criticism on my work  but get no acknowledgment for the long hard hours of work i put in  i'm ok with constructive criticism  but they should acknowledge the good with the bad  i frequently have to have meetings super late at night to update systems when users are not online   it's expected for developers to sacrifice their weekends and evenings on a regular basis  everything and i mean everything is  we need this yesterday  and the constant rushing to do really complicated shit is really fucking with my head    i've had 5 jobs since 2015 including my current one  i keep getting fired or laid off bc i eventually reach burnout and my performance declines  i worked for 1 company twice though  once as a consultant for a year and then for 2 years as a direct hire  i've been at my current position since mid january  and i feel like it's only a matter of time before i get let go  i feel like i'm running an endurance race and my body is about to give out  i just physically can't do this shit anymore    i'm feeling trapped  i have a lease i have to cover and other bills and many lower stress jobs just don't pay enough to cover my expenses  they also often don't have benefits  i have no clue how i can turn my resume into something that will land me a better job    i make 85k now and i know that amount makes me lucky  but i don't really save because i blow all my money on weed or alcohol and eating out bc i just can't cope and i don't have the energy to cook after working  i've been doing a bit better about saving since i started my new job  but i only have about 2 months worth of savings at best  i'd be happy making far less money as long as it still covered my bills and wasn't so damn stressful    i'm just not sure what to do  i don't have family i can rely on  i'm completely on my own  if i run out of money i'm fucked  i'm exhausted and overwhelmed  i have no clue how long i am going to be on this earth and i desperately want to find a way to not be absolutely miserable  i'd like to have a job where i could listen to podcasts or daydream while working  but idk if there is a decently paying job that fits that description    any advice on what to do and how to healthily cope would be greatly appreciated  if anyone has made a career switch after only having experience in one field  i'd love to hear about how you did it  what i'm doing now just isn't sustainable and i need to find a way to make a change    tldr  i can't take it anymore  i feel trapped in a career that i absolutely hate  it's affecting my physical health  all my job experience is only in software development and i'm not sure how to transition to something else  i need something lower stress that still covers my bills  and has health insurance ,ogz9ib

2331,Open Plan Office or Cubicles,hi    i was always wondering about this  i have never worked somewhere  where i had a cubicle  i had a shared office with 1 other person  later alone because he left  shared another office with 3 other people and worked in an open plan office  the offices were okay regarding noise  i had a wall behind me  no people walking past me constantly  work from home being my favorite of course  because i can get all my work done at my own pace in peace   however  i hate the open plan office  or larger office rooms with 8  people  it is just loud  someone is always talking  you have to have your headphones on all the time to be able to concentrate  no privacy  people being able to look at your screen constantly  this annoys when i do work  feels like someone is always watching me  they added some dividers in the open plan office  why not just add walls  we got some fake cubicle walls that we could attack to our desks  we had silent rooms in case you need to focus on your work  like should this not always be the case   anyway  so my question to people who have worked in cubicles and open plan offices  is it better  you have at least some walls  i am assuming the noise levels are still bad and from what i heard people hat cubicles just as much  i am just interested ,ogr62z

2388,"Got laid off yesterday. Story in body. If you think companies care about you, you are wrong.",first off  i don't care that i'm saying who they are  superior plus propane  corporate office in rochester  ny  accounts receivable team  i'll even provide manager's names too       it started off as a decent temp job  it wasn't very busy  steady work  decent co-workers minus 3-4 absolutely miserable people  i didn't mind it  then  about three months in  i realized they were paying my friend whom i referred to work on the team with me  2 more an hour  despite us doing the same job  with the same experience  we are both 25-26 years old  so i took action      i called the rep at the agency where i was employed and asked for the same pay raise  worker's rights  after all  i do not blame the guy for giving me three different reasons why he made more than me  i don't think there was good communication between the agency and my employer       he said everything from oh he negotiated it  to i don't know how much he gets paid  to this position pays  2 more an hour  all bullshit  i think he was trying to cover his ass because the employer is completely toxic  i don't blame him one bit  i think he was trying to scramble for reasons      fast forward to a few weeks  ago  we told our other co-worker  yes  i know  be careful about befriending co-workers  but i have a keen eye for reading people so i knew she was safe with us  about the pay issue and she goes wtf i want to be paid the same too  she was getting  17 an hour and doing wayy more work than we were  i would be upset as well      word got out that we were discussing pay and as of yesterday they laid off my friend making  19 an hour and myself  citing  performance issues and discussing pay  first off  it is not illegal to discuss pay on the job  i will be filing a wrongful termination complaint with the labor board in my state and filing a few other grievances against them  i think they let us go because we were adamant about fair treatment and management following through on things they said  which  shocker  they did not      i never had any warnings about pay  performance  or any outstanding issues with management  this all threw me for a loop  i can't say i'm surprised  but this only cements my feelings about management at corporations  the day we got laid off  we didn't find out until after we got home  we had a team meeting and both our upper manager and direct supervisor were talking about  changes to the team  and  restructuring moving forward  all while never looking us in the eye      you do not matter to these people       i had a gut feeling after that regardless  i knew something would happen so i just played on my phone the rest of the day  i didn't expect to get laid off but at the very least i expected a notification about the position being gone      whatever  i believe we were forced out for standing up for equal pay       we were not working from home anymore but yet my manager would work from home whenever she wanted  we were chastised for making mistakes yet her emails had horrible grammar and she would never get back to us about issues for at least 3 days  yet  when we messed up in a minor sense  it would be immediate  priorities  i guess  asking questions about the job warrants a 3-day window  but making a small error with dates is a 2 minute response time type gig      the place is disgusting  you have to question nothing and be okay with doing mindless computer work and paperwork for 8 hours a day  as i said  it was okay to start  but my anxiety was getting worse and worse the more i was there because i couldn't use my brain  the last week or so i was in fight or flight mode  even after i got home  i had been doing so well with my anxiety too      if you looked at your phone or took breaks  the old boomer in the corner would shake his head as he walked by you  the man worked 6-4 30 a m  and never left his desk  i can see why he was a miserable piece of shit      overall  if you love double standards  unfulfilled or changed promises  and management that couldn't give less of a shit about you  then this is the place for you    oh  and to top it off  they promised us we would be paid for the holiday on july 5  yet when i submitted my time card  my manager said i only was entitled to work 16 hours this week  not 24      mmmm  nope  not gonna fly with me  so i re-submitted the same card that had 24 hours on it  and she approved it      sleazy  fucking disgusting  i don't play around  companies do not care about you or your rights as a human being  if you speak out  you get shunned  and in my opinion  in this case  laid off      i give no fucks if they see this or not  they probably know who i am just by some details in this ,og8by6

2405,I quit 14 jobs before I turned 23,i just stumbled upon this sub and i would love to tell you my story  maybe you will find it inspirational   i grew up in spokane  wa and did horrible in high school  graduated with a d average  no interest in college  i bounced from shitty job to shitty job after high school  mostly restaurants but also a costco  between 95  and 2000 i had 14 jobs and left every one of them on bad terms  not because i was a bad worker but because they all treated me like shit and when they did i would quit  usually when the restaurant was busy  oh did i fuck over some assholes  costco was a special case  they had a policy that after 90 days you were considered a real employee and they gave you a 25 cent per hour raise  yippie   they let me go out of the blue on my 87th day  a week later  a manager called me and was like  where are you   uhhh i was let go   well i have you on the schedule and we need you  can you come work  i did because i didn t hate the job  yet  i returned  worked the day and was informed that because i was let go  my 90 days restarted  i was like   okay  thats how it is  so i slowed my work to a crawl  collected a few more checks and was fired  just basically made it my mission to stress them out while i was there   anyways  i was now in my early 20 s and all i knew was there was something out there better for me  i am artistic but didn t know how to make a living off it or what my art even was   i can draw well and i m sarcastic  my mom kept telling me i needed to get a job and stick with it  i just said  but these jobs suck and they treat me like shit  so no thank you  she worried about me  a lot    i ended up moving to seattle with a friend who already had a place there and was going to let me live there free until i got on my feet  i quickly found a job as a cook in a restaurant and we were off to the races again  i actually liked this job  i chalked it up to spokane being a low class place because the people in seattle were just more fun to be around  just more cool culture in the air  people were more interesting  that pleasantness lasted a year and the manager just turned on me  no idea why  he just decided to take his rage out on me for several weeks  i had asked for a few days off around the holidays and i was given that time off  one week leading up to it i was on the schedule for christmas day  i reminded him  he denied it  he said you will be here on christmas day  i looked at him and said   my bad  i thought i had asked for that time off  see you then  you should already have figured out those were the last words i spoke to him    now i was fucked  i have rent to pay and no job  mom and dad are far away and i refuse to go back to spokane  i just sat at home for days brainstorming how can i get myself into a position where i am my own boss with no college degree  it hit me  i had done a brief stint helping a buddy in spokane do some interior house painting  he gave me  60 for 3 hours of work because i did such a good job   artist  i got on craigslist and cold called painters in seattle asking if they needed any help  my 3rd call i found myself talking to a rather hilarious australian guy who was like  you sound cool mate  meet up and i ll train you  i fucking loved it  we just hung out in empty houses chatting  joking and getting the jobs done  he paid me decently and it was heaven  as far as work goes  eventually he was sending me out on my own jobs  around this time i discovered stand-up comedy and really took to it  now i was finally set  i was going to be a comedian by night  and a painter by day  i would eventually stop painting when i could make a living off comedy  that was the new plan  best times of my life  met some other comedians who wanted to move to new york city and really try to forge a career in show business  we moved and i had no fear even though i had never been to the east coast and neither had anyone in my family  my painting skills took me far  i was number 3 on yelp for all of manhattan  i did cash jobs daily that paid between  300 and  1000 per day  i was very good  tidy and fast  i answered my phone on the first ring  my customers loved me    during my 6 years in nyc i made a shit ton of money  had fun spending it all too  and transitioned out of stand-up into filmmaking and thats what got me out of painting    cut to today i live in los angeles and am married to a comedian   writer who now brings in at least 150k a year and my best friend who i met in seattle and moved to nyc with is a very successful actor and comedian  he s so successful we live in his amazing back house and make a good living directing stand-up specials and we even sold a show to comedy central a few years ago so we shot 8 episodes  if you are wondering  that gig landed me  120 000 that year    i don t know why i had this rebellious nature from the start  maybe i have to thank my dad who worked a shitty hard job most of his life and was miserable  he set the example of how not to do it although he did retire at 45 so he could be a fishing guide and an artist in his own right  so he got there too  he never made great money but he was happy so you d never know    people  its okay to have a shitty job   just use it for what it is  a stepping stone to the next shitty job until you figure out how to break free  everyone has a talent  i didn t hone in on mine until i was 30  when the job pisses you off  if you can  leave it and have no regrets  you can always find another shitty job but keep looking for that thing you know you can do that will get you away from it  i am proof you don t need money  good grades or a college diploma to succeed  you just need to survive and bide your time until you figure it out ,ogsv93
2406,Opinion: The term ''NSFW'' is another aspect of how our society is needlessly obsessed with work,so  i hope everyone here is in agreement that our entire society is needlessly consumed and obsessed with work  in kindergarten  one of the very first questions we are asked is what we want to do when we grow up and we all say shit like ''police office''  ''fire-fighter''  ''doctor'' etc but most of us will be wage-slaves for retailers  restaurants and shipping companies with only a tiny minority of students actually being ''successful'' through unnecessary sacrifice  special connections and wealth   anyway  everyone here knows that the acronym  nsfw  usually applies to erotic or ''adult'' content and every subreddit has the option to add it to a post  it means  n ot  s uitable  f or  w ork and i'm not sure if anyone has ever really thought about the meaning of that   to me  nsfw basically means   ''if it violates the working standards of your employer  you should not be looking at it''  it dictates that the interests of your job boss employer supersede your own personal interests  even if they are private and it's probably the oldest and most socially accepted example of employers controlling the personal lives of their employees albeit inadvertently   thoughts ,og6n3s

2430,"Here is my story for those interested. I think it brings some honest discussion coming from a young person in canada, with my own personal elements tied in",originally a cross post from r homeless    im not sure how to put all this  im in canada  near vancouver  on vancouver island in a smaller city  21 years old  male  and also lgbt in what i believe to be a socially conservative city  quietly rascist and homophobic people  retirement town wealthy old people and some very rich and elitist too from all ages  nimbys and all  alot people here would shit on homeless so casually  it was always quite sad eyebrow raising  and the poor low earning folks too  some compassion fatigue and a whole lot of   it is what it is  definitely not as progressive as people put it out to be in my personal experience but i tried to see the light in other peoples eyes of this place like they did   lived here for 3 years worked low paying jobs lived with roommates  however i live with an emotionally abusive ex boyfriend right now  were together over a year  and the rental market here is bad  near 0  vacancy rate  and im thinking of trying to go to vancouver for help  and also what i think would be a better chance at life and opportunity in general  but not so sure  but why stay in a place where the homeless are demonized and the poor looked down upon   for not working hard enough  or not applying oneself enough  i did do all that here  worked especially shitty jobs to get by  the job market always seemed to have slim pickings and youre bound to customer service  almost half of job postings on job boards  if you dont have a car  for manual labor type work  or are not in school  people assume you cant be as intelligent as you can be for not having gone to school while so young here    i feel almost like somebody the canadian government  whoever rich people stand behind them  wants there to be a hierarchy in place  where there must be  losers  in this world  and as if its the  natural balance of all things  but that seems like an unfair and brutal way to go about life not necessarily saying you think that way but showing it in action in what you say and do  and while too you may not necessarily suffer in the system the way others are  like how i feel where i am at  im not trying to rant   yes  i have some trauma from my life before i came here and as well as some new trauma after the fact  and even when i was working and providing for myself before i met my abusive ex i still struggled finding a place for myself here in this city and fitting in  trying to be my true open and honest self  nobodys perfect but im in a uni city and felt so much peer judgment from those my age for not going to school or having a car    i had a job  it was pretty low paying  but i quit it recently from all the stress and hopelessness over not being able to find a decent and affordable place to live here  and just not having been able to have a social life and a sense of belonging that i wanted  i dont really know what to do  my family i have a very detached relationship with and for very good reasons  neglectful parents with their own problems  mother lives out of province in rural ab  from alberta but lgbt men i think have it much harder there  i did growing up  my father  step father  lives in smaller town north of my bc city but was always emotionally manipulative and condescending every chance he got  only ever seemed to care about money he got from me  same with my mom i helped her out alot but they never cared much about my life or what was going on    people used to say i was a very intelligent boy young man with alot of potential  however i feel like there is a ceiling been built over me  i am a very creative type  i would sing and play music and go to open mics in the past outside of work  and people liked what i did  other creative hobbies like writing  it helped me find a place within myself even if i couldnt find it in my community wherever i lived   this post is a sort of vent of sadness and hopelessness but also some proper advice  i just wanted to live by my values that i think were good but i seemed to have been socially rejected in my city  people here always put off hanging out with me and overtime it does get to you when you live life paying bills and being part of the system society much the same way everybody else is  and from my ex boyfriends part  he would constantly downplay my feelings  my uncertainties  and my wants and dreams in life  call me psycho and delusional so so much  but he did lie alot about alot too  he actually was paying for gay onlyfans content the entire time we were together to give a sneak peek    with my family not being there for me emotionally  and my ex constantly making me question myself  how much i really did mean to him  and feeling like i wasnt enough  or i perhaps got too old for his liking  that is a whole other story of pain and so much learning in the way of trusting your gut when you should have  that i now had a complete eventual breakdown of my selfconfidence to where i am today   i am just a person trying to make it in this world but its been getting harder and harder every day lately and i know ive done things people tell you not to do but where is the yellow highlight   is it me  is it the canadian municipal  provincial  and federal government failing their people on their part  do you think i actually sound like a crazy person  or like someone whos been radicalized  i don't know what to do or really think anymore ,ogaix3

2523,We finally reported our abusive employer to the labour department,for context  this is my very first job  i've been working in this company for more than a year  my emoloyer has withheld our salaries for around 3 months now  and for the past years everyone would regularly get delayed and deducted salaries  our employer is borderline abusive  the company's environment is so toxic because of his management  he'd yell at staff for every small mistake  he would make people work late without overtime pay  if anyone wants to leave the company  he'd give them a really hard time  and he would find absurd ways to deduct from employee salaries  we're on a limited contract  so there's gonna be a  resignation fine  if anyone decides to leave before their contract ends  our situation now is we all want to leave but we dont have money to pay the fine  and nobody wants to pay that asshole  i think he got cocky because so far nothing bad has ever happened to him and he thinks he'll get away with anything   we got fed up  a few guys and i filed an official complaint to the labour department  i was fucking nervous  i'm scared that nothing will happen or the employer would come after me  and i dread any future interactions i'm going to have with him after this complaint  it was quite reassuring that the labour department actually had our backs and assured us that they'll investigate and assist us in dealing with or leaving the company  since not giving salaries is actually considered a breach of contract  we won't have to pay anything if we leave the company and we'll receive all our pending salaries  the labour department told us that whatever happens  the employees would have the upper hand in this case  and it's a good thing that we went with the proper steps of filing an official complaint   now i'm relieved but also filled with anxiety  i fucking dread the awkwardness of talking to the employer again  professionally  and discussing the matter with him  required by labour dept  but at least we finally made the big first step   i kinda feel bad that the employer's now scrambling to convince us to stay  but it's not like he wasn't aware of the consequences of breaking labour laws and treating employees like shit  plus he had it coming  so fuck him ,ofggjm

2530,What is success in life? Short rant about a sleepless night thinking about what I should do with my life and what happiness means to me,yesterday my wife asked me if i wanted to do a masters degree  she is about to start hers and i am supporting her decision  it makes me proud seeing her rise to her potential  but thinking about doing a master myself made me feel inadequate  scared and sad   i never really liked the thought of finding happiness in work  work is just work  no amount of income  fancy job title or amount of responsibility would make me feel like it is worth wasting my life away in a corporate setting  in my opinion  everyone is replaceable nowadays  you can be the superstar of a company one day  and the dead horse the next  corporations do not care about their employees  they care about key indicators  profit reports and pleasing the shareholders  you slave away everyday and get a fraction of your earnings in return as a salary  yes  you get some kind of stability  insurance and other benefits  but in the end  you are still a replaceable part in a giant machine of generating more wealth    i work in social welfare and i see everyday how easily people get discarded by the employers if they can't  provide and commit  anymore  it makes me sad to think  that this is all there is to the human existence  we aren't born to work in closed rooms  in cubicles  in front of computer screens all day  while trying to not reveal too much about our personal life's to our coworkers and try to please the higher ups in hope to get a shred of recognition for selling our time  i always got asked as a kid what my  dream job  would be  i don't dream of working  i dream of having a happy life  work is just a mean to survive in today's society and not be homeless  i am effectively forced to do labor to be able to provide a roof for me and my wife  put food on the table  pay my bills  pay my taxes and have a little something left for leisure activities  which i need to be able to tolerate work   so getting back to the initial idea of the message  the question my wife asked scared the living hell out of me and i couldn't sleep that night  i was caught in a negative loop of thoughts  spiraling downwards into my deepest fears  ripping up old wounds of feeling inadequate  being called a loser and feel like a failure   i told her  that i don't want to do a master  because if you have a master  you need to find a job on master-level  this comes with master-responsibilities  master-workhours  master-activities and so forth  since i rather have a meaningful job  like social work  instead of a high paying career  i do not want to advance  to the top  where i need to make my job my life  i'd rather someday be a stay at home dad and look after the kids  my wife is different  she is driven by the need for success  without a high paying job  a good career and social recognition of her achievements she feels inadequate  quite the polar opposite of my personality  but she would be happy if she can work and i stay home  i see people whose only reason to get up in the morning is to run to the office and play the capitalist game are missing out on life   so that send me into my thinking spiral     amp x200b   1  if you don't get a proper job  your wife will resent you and leave you someday  2  if you become a stay at home dad  you will not be able to find a job ever again  3  if you become a stay at home dad  people will judge you for it and make you feel small inadequate  4  society demands that a man has a good career and brings money home or else he is worthless  5  a man needs to constantly try to  succeed  in life e g  playing the capitalist game and win  6  if my wife leaves me after being a stay at home dad  i would be lost  i wouldn't be able to provide a proper life for my kids without a job  7  if i lose my wife before we have kids  i have nothing left in my life  i lost too many people already  i barely got friends  i got no family left  i would end up as a hermit  8  how could anyone love someone like me that has no real ambitions  e g  winning the capitalist game     9  what if everyone in my youth was right and i am a no good deadbeat loser   10   i am 34 years old  still playing video games  what is wrong with me  shouldn't i  hustle  like everyone else   11  why am i wasting my time enjoying life  when i could be more  productive   12  if i lose it all  i would lack the strength to make another comeback  my energy is gone  my will to withstand death  loss  loneliness and  grinding my way back up  is exhausted   13  i think i would call it  a good run  at that point and end my life while i am not a depressed broken piece of shit     amp x200b   and that spiral went on and on and on  thoughts getting darker and darker every minute until i was almost crying from existential dread  life scares me sometimes  losing both my parents and a lot of other relatives  losing long lasting relationships in an instant and seeing how replaceable i am in the work force taught me that the dream of  retiring and finally live my life  is an illusion and a luxury for only a few people   all i want is to be able to be content and happy with my life  i want my wife  some kids  a nice apartment house  being able to pay my bills and have enough leisure time to feel like i am living life  i want to grow old and see my family succeed and my kids thrive  i want to die an old man and know  i was there for my family and that my kids grew up with a lot of happy memories and not trauma or memories of  dad being at work all the time  my definition of happiness is choosing life over corporate slavery  sadly this mental image is not accepted in today's society  you're only a  proper man  if you work hard  every day without complaining  your only value is your social status at work and how much money our bring home  how fancy your car is  how big your house is  how many people need to listen to you at work and do your bidding  how much you prioritize being a good employee over being a human being      amp x200b    if this is life  the thought alone makes me sad ,og3uek

This company is shady.",first off  i don't care that i'm saying who they are  superior plus propane in rochester  ny  accounts receivable office      when i got hired on  it was a  17 per hour job  i noticed that a co-worker that they brought on after i started made  19 an hour doing the exact same role after he told me about his pay  i figured okay cool  they pay you more than me despite us doing the same job  i'll contact the agency and ask for the same pay raise      my rep said everything from  well we don't really know how much they pay you  to   well this position does pay slightly more  sorry about that  to   well he did negotiate for a higher pay  all from his mouth  not his fault here  just saying what he said      my direct manager was horrible  she basically laid me and the other person making  19 an hour off because of  performance issues  and  discussing pay  which by the way is not illegal  and i will be filing a complaint against them through the labor board  i just don't think they liked that we weren't corporate sheep who did everything they told us and questioned nothing      they preach solidarity and taking breaks  yet they tell us to cut back on breaks  they chastise us for making mistakes even though we are human  their motto is  everything can always be done tomorrow  yet we were criticized for speed      they tell us they like us and want to keep us on  then can us for restructuring  no warnings  nothing at all  hello unemployment  how do you go from liking us to canning us in a matter of a week      i went in  did my work  took my breaks  and didn't over-exert myself  i stopped talking to my co-workers because frankly  it was exhausting  the small talk was a waste of time  and there were a few people there who were absolutely miserable  the place sucked the life out of me   i didn't need to talk to them to do my job      i am going through a lot so taking breaks was very necessary for me      the point is  the company is shady  and part of us being let go was wanting fair wages and flexibility with working from home  there were others i'm sure  but needless to say  i'm glad i can take a deep breath and collect myself  i thought about leaving the place for a while  this is just a nice gift for me      so all in all  this company is shady  unprofessional  and the office environment is crushing  know your worth  do not be treated like a piece of shit or a piece of meat  this is most corporations now  sadly  but either way  there will always be a better fit  there are decent places to work  sometimes you have to experience the bad to appreciate the good when it comes      i liked most of my co-workers  but there were about 3-4 that made it insufferable  not all in my department  but in the same office area      horrible company to work for that didn't even give annual raises based on inflation  unreal  zero growth potential there      i am so glad they let me go ,oftelq

2597,"A rant, and an essay.",the sentiment  work is work  is a bastardization of what it actually means to be a  worker  now  it goes without saying that there are variations to this topic  work can be many things  and what we do to make money is entirely relative  each person has distinguished paths that determine how much they enjoy their job  how much they have to  work  how well they are compensated  etc  etc  but this all goes without saying  a large portion of  work  that humans do is not just a simple job  a trivial  productive task we perform in order to contribute to society  we do things at our jobs that we would normally never do  i would never  and i mean never  vouch for a large corporation the way i do at my job  i would never  and i mean never  spend 40 hours a week in a dimly lit building surrounded by mass produced products created through slave labor  these character-breaking actions  of which there are many more than previously listed  belittle my spirit  to provide evidence of this would be pointless  because it is purely anecdotal  except  it s not  my feelings of hopelessness as a result of my  work  is shared by millions throughout the world  mental health america  a non-profit devoted to mental health issues in america  has quantified such evidence  determining that my workplace industry  retail  is one of the three workplace industries that score in the bottom 10  of occupations  alongside manufacturing and food and beverage  cheang 1  minimizing  work  by expressing a sentiment akin to  it s just a job  completely degrades the millions of individuals that are being stripped of their humanity every day as a result of forced labor  that pushes said individuals to the point of mental and   or physical exhaustion   the side effects of these jobs are overwhelming  with over 50  of employees in these workplace industries feeling unappreciated and looking for new jobs on a consistent basis  cheang 1  these numbers have surely risen since the covid-19 pandemic  with one study conducted in arizona stating that of the 3 996 grocery union members who answered the questionnaire   sixty percent of workers surveyed reported feeling above-average levels of stress  thirty-seven percent reported feeling moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression  hernandez 1  i could cite specific sources indulging us as to the reasons why these mental health issues have worsened  but i feel that to be unnecessary  instead  recall an instance when you were browsing the shelves of a grocery store during the first six months of the pandemic  recall the customers walking around without masks  grabbing things off of shelves carelessly and placing them in incorrect locations  and remember the instances when these individuals would communicate maskless to employees wearing their required ppe  could you possibly imagine the sheer anxiety the employee would experience in such an absurd situation  a situation where a customer is putting the employee s life at risk for reasons of stupidity  laziness  ideological maliciousness  or all of the above  could you imagine the loss of faith  the adrenaline  the fatigue that would follow such an experience   i could spend the next hour working on citing this little essay i ve typed out  but honestly  i have nothing further to articulate in regards to quantitive evidence  the exploitation that service workers suspected was occurring for decades has since come to fruition  not only were we left on the frontlines of a life threatening virus unqualified and unprepared  but we were compensated monetarily the exact same as we were previous to these newfound obstacles  we never received more than a few scraps of our fair share of the profits  while every imperishable food and roll of toilet paper were selling in record high volumes for record high profits  we didn t see more than a few hundred dollars in  thank you pay  when we voiced our concerns regarding our own personal safety and the safety of those we love  we were told not to engage with the customers who would risk our lives for their laziness because  escalating conflict is never a good idea  these fucking cowards that we call  management  bent their knee to the shareholders who wanted nothing more than to capitalize on panic buying  leaving us  the bottom of the barrel  the servants  the service workers  to deal with hoards of potential walking death sentences and the increased labor that coincided with the multiplied traffic   and now  our  management  expects us to return to an era when our naivety was fruitful and easy  when we would allow customers to disrespect us to our faces because  work is work  never mind the psychological scars that occurred as a result of their greed  never mind our still-thin bank accounts and directionless free time  never mind our sustained exposure to the worst impulses that our consumeristic society has to offer  leaving us unable to look people in the eye due to distrust and disillusionment   work  at least to those average enough to maintain a consistent employment status with a large-scale department store  is a malformed and dismembered existence that we are required to physically and mentally engage with for a third of our waking lives   work  is indentured servitude with a few amenities  amenities that do not compensate for the absolute discomfort that we are put subjected to for 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year   you may say  there are people in this world that cannot eat  sleep in dirt  and are slaves in the

2622,Can't get over how I have to work a 9-5 for the rest of my life,i just recently graduated from university and up until this point  i tried to avoid the idea that i'll have a 9-5 job  i tried to think of ways i could completely bypass it  but unfortunately times up  and i have to work  this entire summer has been me stressing over jobs and my parents badgering me about getting a job  i feel like i've been sabotaging myself though by not applying for tons of jobs and not doing my best at interviews because i'm not ready to give up my freedom  that sounds dramatic  but i'm serious  there's no more going grocery shopping in the morning  hanging out with anyone throughout the day  or sitting around and doing hobbies i love  now it's 9-5  not even that maybe 7-5 considering the traffic  coming home to make dinner with only a few hours left until i have to wake up again  no more staying out late  sleeping over at my partners  etc  it all sounds miserable  being in the same place 9-5 not being able to enjoy a nice day  not being able to hang out with friends as consistently because i'm most likely busy and tired from work and have to prepare for the next day   i told my mom this and of course she said the usual cliche dismissive statement   welcome to the real world  followed by  you'll love it when you start getting a paycheck  she and my dad are both upset i don't have a job and i'm pretty sure my mom sees me as  lazy  she's called me that before  i seriously hate it  my plan is to really start looking for jobs within the next two weeks before my apartment lease is up next august and i have to move home  i give myself two weeks so i can enjoy my life before i basically go to prison  again  dramatic but it's the truth  no amount of benefits  events  or friendly team will ever persuade me to want to work  and i don't want to hear the typical  you have to have a more positive outlook  or  you can still do the things you enjoy you just have to have time management  everyone keeps telling me the same shit  like yeah you don't think i know that  you think i don't know i need a job to survive  man i fucking hate it  i don't want to work but i know i have to  high key want to go to grad school so i can avoid the 9-5 but i'll just be in the same boat when i get out ,of2dwq

2678,Has anyone else successfully escaped the grind? Share your story?,what drew me to this sub in the first place was having been out of the rat race long enough that i'm permanently horrified by the thought of going back to a  normal job   the more i contemplate it  the more i realize how goddamn lucky i got   i worked normal teenage jobs  babysitting etc  during high school in the u s  took clep tests to knock off as many college courses as possible  started college at a community college on my own few hard-earned dimes  only to drop out several months in and spend my little remaining cash on a plane ticket to north africa  lived there for a couple years  supporting myself as a preschool english teacher  while learning arabic   met a black american woman there who introduced me to the idea of online freelancing  and gave me a long list of online companies such as call centers  seo companies  transcription companies  etc  that didn't require a degree or experience  did seo for a while as a side hustle with the english teaching  until they fired me for being in another country  against the rules  forgot to use a vpn a couple times  and then another side hustle as a transcriptionist for asc services llc   returned to the u s  and lived with my parents for a year  continuing to transcribe while finishing off my associate's degree at the community college  in general studies  no career ambitions with it  purely to make my mom happy for getting to see me walk  and then worked a minimum wage job at a used bookstore for a summer  took the extra money from that and flew to another north african country  where my paltry u s  dollars from transcription were enough to live off of   continued learning arabic and happened upon upwork by pure chance  where i decided to try out translation  having been lucky enough to grow up bilingual  and acquired two more languages since then  built up good client reviews and enough of an income to quit transcription  and focus entirely on translation  earning enough to put well over  500 a month into savings after all living expenses  only working at  most  15 hours a week   fell in love  got married  moved back to the u s  husband works a 9-5 minimum wage despite being able to do the same translation i do  because he  wants  the routine and 'normalcy' of a  9-5 outside the house like everyone else  and i continue to translate  setting my own hours  my own prices  my own rules  and making enough in 15 hours of work a week to cover my share of the bills  savings  investments  and driving or jetting off where i want when i want  digital nomad style  i'll never be wealthy  i'll never have benefits or paid vacation sick leave  but i consider those tiny  miniscule prices to pay for the nearly total freedom i enjoy    example  i decided to fly off to mexico and belize last year just before covid started  backpacked down to an island off of belize  went snorkeling in the barrier reef  popped into a cyber cafe and paid for the snorkeling with 30 min of translating a word doc  and continued like that the rest of the trip  road tripping through mexico  jumping online at my nightly airbnbs once in a while and turning a document around to pay for the next leg of the trip   sheer luck   and i realize i've been ruined for ever returning to a  normal job  again  where i have to jolt myself awake at ungodly hours with an alarm clock every goddamn morning for the rest of my life  pack a lunch  show up  with no right to take off when i want without prior written authorization from a 'superior'  submit to coporate scheduling and rules  make small talk with coworkers i didn't choose  eat in a gross artificially-lit lunchroom with an eye on the clock  with absolutely zero freedom to prioritize my mental and physical health when and how i want   i don't know how people do it  i don't know how people like my husband have been brainwashed into thinking  normal is good  and  wanting  a  career  i hate the whole concept  i want to be outdoors in nature as much as possible  go where i want  when i want  with whom i want  never be forced to do or say anything  and still have disposable income  and somehow i stumbled ass-backwards into that life   curious to hear others' stories ,oejxut

Help me understand.,with how diverse and specialised our knowledge and technology has become  the only way our society could function is through a 'capitalist like' labour for currency system  thinking that humans would want to provide for others out of the kindness of their hearts and love of labor seems so antithetical to what humans are actually like    plumbing literally entails digging through shit on certain occasions and dealing with less than hygienic situations on a daily basis  plumbing is also extremely important to people's health and safety  and those without it face horrible diseases and filthy living conditions  you could ask some plumbers if they enjoy their work and some would say they take pride in their craft and helping people  but an extremely small percentage wouldn't say they love digging through other people's shit  plumbing is at least a very highly paying trade  because otherwise there wouldn't be enough plumbers to make the world go round and the shits go down   can someone explain to me how society could function if this antiwork stuff was implemented ,oeg9xy

2746,This might not be perfect but hear me out. How about rewarding effort instead of result? -The Junaidian ideology,i've seen way too many comments and posts on other subreddits saying all r antiwork does is complain i e  they don't have any solutions so i'm posting my idea here  the main reason people hate working is because they are working for someone else  just a few minutes ago i saw another post  which says that people aren't mad to work to support a family waiting for a stimulus but they hate it when they have to work for a guy wanting to buy a 3rd mega yatch  obviously  i get it  why would you want to work to death to make someone else richer  then i thought  if i'm the one putting in so much effort  shouldn't i be the one entitled to benefits  that's when i thought how different society would be if we started rewarding effort instead of result  we could set up a system where a committee decides and rates various forms of effort  by deciding how 'effortful' a job is  everyone who does a certain amount of effort week  the threshold effort effort must be beneficial to the society can be in the form of any service to the society  is eligible to a weekly reward  say x amount of credits  these credits will be enough to provide for a week's worth of basic necessities like food shelter etc   now  i know the effort deciding committee will have a lot of influence and too much power so a workaround would be de-localizing governance-related jobs  i e   instead of offering jobs  any services that help in direct administration governance will be grouped into 'job categories' and the jobs will be offered on a cyclic basis every week  people can choose whatever job category they want  the jobs provided to them will change on a weekly basis  they'd still have to put in the same amount of effort each week no matter what job they work to be eligible for the threshold reward   threshold effort   i figured i can explain this better  why threshold effort is needed and how it is decided   any society needs working human beings doing various jobs to support it like farming healthcare governance education emergency services  police fire control etc  let's say all of these combined  require 100 units of effort week  if at this point of time  assume 50 people make up our working population  the threshold effort would be 2 units of effort week person  an individual can choose to work whatever job he she wants  there will be no discrimination because all members would still earn equally every week       this type of society will solve the following problems   1 unemployement due to automation  a lot of people are losing jobs because they were replaced by machines  that's just foolish because if humanity has enough potential to reduce the workload it's been put through  people should be happier and more resources will now be available since many more people are free  however  contrary to that logic many people are suffering today from automation because they are tossed aside as their jobs are now automated  this problem will be solved because automation will decrease the amount of threshold effort therefore  everyone will still have work  except they'll just have to work less and be entitled to the same threshold reward since they no longer have to work as much as they used to  the machines worked instead of them and took work off everyone's shoulders  a concern one might raise here is 'if automation in one sector takes jobs away  how are people  who only know how to work in that sector going to reach their threshold ' well  i'm thinking people have job categories right  they don't have to confine themselves to one single job  they can earn effort in any category as long as they are qualified to do that job  like say they can offer sanitary services and clean up their own neighborhood  they'll still get rewarded for that effort and sanitary jobs won't be looked down on because they take a lot of effort and hence will have a higher pay hour rate  doesn't mean the job itself is better than other jobs because other jobs will earn you effort too  just at a slower rate  what i'm trying to say is  all jobs have an equal effort to pay rate  it's just  sanitary jobs demand a lot of effort and hence the threshold effort is met in a short time  the amount of effort you would do every week is the same  some jobs just have you put that effort over a more dispersed time and some demand that effort all at once  even if they don't prefer sanitation  they can still go for similar jobs from their job category  the big win here is less available jobs   less threshold effort and hence easier weeks for everyone  in normal capitalist societies  less available work   unemployment and provision of resources to only those who cater to those jobs  in this society  available jobs are given out equally to all the members and hence everyone becomes eligible to the reward  the society won't go bankrupt because the work is still getting done  just by machines  let me use a simple example  say farming just got automated  now  instead of farmers losing jobs  the net threshold effort will decrease and everyone will have to work less every week  the farmer can choose to earn his her effort via other services jobs in his her job category or any category he she is qualified to work in  the community won't lose anything because the farming work is still getting done  just by machines and not humans    2 job based societal status will be invalidated  all jobs have an equal effort to pay rate  it doesn't matter what job you choose to work  no job is 'better' than other jobs because in the end  all of them will demand the same effort week and give out the exact same pay   3 no income inequalities  all income will be decided on how much effort you have put in the society's benefit  no one will benefit off others working to death  there are a few complications here like we might need to restrict credit transactions but honestly  i'm too inexperienced to think about it all on my own  ofc  i do have a solution of my own but i'm worried it might be too restrictive so i thought it would be better if i got external opinions and community suggestions on this  let's think about this together    although the benefits look promising  no society is perfect and the same applies to this too  however  just because an idealogy has problems doesn't mean we should completely abandon it  right  let's try listing as many potential problems as possible and solve them  i've listed a few below   possible concerns faq   1 what about income differences generated from companies   2  what if people want to make more money   answer by pathan azeez khan for both questions    if any one wants to make more money after already earning their threshold reward  they can do so by working for private companies  walmart  google  or by starting their own company  and private household services  maids  running errands  etc  all companies will be required to pay their employees on an effort basis and the effort that goes into their tasks will be rated by a small drafting committee that evaluates the effort for each company and if required  each special task  the company will also sell it's product based on the effort it has put into it  their product can be sold at a higher price than what it cost the company to make because the company has paid all its employees on an effort basis but the profit margin shall not exceed a set percentage to make sure the company isn't ripping people off  for example  say a company of 10 employees  owned by a single 11th person makes 50 products a week  the cost of each product  will be  credits the company payed to its employees   other company expenditure no  of products    a small profit  so if the employes spent 100 units of effort in making those 50 products  the company will pay all its employees for the 100 effort units  the same pay they would get if they worked for the government or its essential services  say the pay came out to be 100 credits for each employee  therefore  the company can charge 100 10 50   profit and set the price to 22 credits per piece  that way  the owner can earn 22 50    1100 credits in total  subtracting the employees' salaries  the owner and the employees would've made a 100 credit profit for their efforts  i haven't thought of any means to decide on the profit part in the above equation so i can use reddit's help here as well but as a general rule of thumb  for now  let's say it is 5  of the company total expenditure  note that for simplicity  it's been assumed that the company's only expenditure is the employee salary ,oe1p0p

2808,Strikes Like Never Before,i get it  coordinating massive nation wide  even state wide strikes is quite the task    but i have been thinking    if we can just start one business at a time  one neighborhood at a time  a day  a week at a time we might actually be able to do this      sure as an individual we wage peons are replaceable  right now  however  anyone and everyone - nearly - is struggling for labourers as it is  so now is the time to  ahem  strike for what we want    work at a dollar store  that means organizing  like  four dudes ettes     work in a restaurant  maybe like seven    walmart might be a bit more difficult      the major issue is that these people doing this will require support for some period while we're taking back what's ours  which means - i imagine - organizing a handful more people to sponsor each individual during these strikes  hell maybe a go-fund-me would work  there are enough people on this sub-reddit to pitch in even a quarter each and we can get this going      then as each locality leverages their labour against their employer in this way  they can pay it forward several fold because they've availed themselves of their daily wage peonage  ideally       thoughts anyone  now is the time to act  now is the time to get things done or we're just going to get clammed harder and harder by the 'ownership' class ,odfiiw

2819,Life tip - use up as much time on the clock as possible demanding a good raise before you leave your job.,before you quit or preferably get fired so you can get your unemployment check  please be smart  waste as much of your company s time as possible in your manager s  office complaining about how they pay you peanuts and that you need a living wage  remind them that they promised you you could grow with the company  remind them of how you go above and beyond for the company every day and how they need to be loyal to you with a raise  make them feel terrible  make them listen to you  these boomers running these businesses like it s 1981 need to hear it  they need to hear that they re going to lose their professional staff and go under if those professionals can earn more stocking frozen crabs at walmart or working a drive through than they can selling expensive makeup and skincare in a major us department store    i work at a jcpenney and last week i got caught in traffic and was approximately one minute late for my shift  one minute  the store manager was already waiting at my department register for me to clock in with the most pissy expression on her face  standing there unhelpfully watching me instead of helping while a lower level supervisor opened the registers  i nodded at her  clocked in  took my time as i put my things away in a drawer  and finally looked her directly in the face  she loudly asks so nearly the whole first floor could hear  what is going to motivate you to come to work on time  and i just as loudly replied  well gee  managers name  a living wage and not laughing in my face when i asked for a raise would motivate me  i had recently asked two other managers for a raise and they both told me there s no raises in jcpenney  keep in mind in my hiring interview and for months afterwards i was promised a decent promotion and supervisor position paying around  20 hr  and even though they never promoted me and deleted the position from all locations i am still required to do tasks of that position without extra pay since i am now trained  she demanded i go to her office with her and long story short i got paid a good hour to fight with her in her office about their empty promises of a living wage  and how she has the entire store  minus her  living below the poverty line  most of the staff in our store make  9 hourly  some make  12 at most  and almost all of us are working 40 hour weeks with no benefits or pto  she told me i should not be discussing wages with other employees and i replied that her telling me that is  actually illegal which shut her up briefly  she then tried to make me end the conversation by lying to me that she only makes  4 hourly because she works 60 hours a week on a 40 hour salary  she told me i clearly have poor work ethic because i m demanding a raise that would put my company out of business  it was an unbelievably terrible argument  first of all either this lady can t complete her work assignments in 40 hours or jcpenney is such a terrible company that they give their employees 60 hours of work and only pay them for 40  also  if  15- 18 hourly is going to cause one of the biggest stores in the us to close down  well  maybe the company is just terrible and has too many problems to have any business being open  she thought my demand for at least  15 hr was the most ridiculous thing she s ever heard  even though thats going to be the minimum wage in 3 years in my state  i m the  5 credit earner in the store making her god knows how much bonus money in her paycheck every month and she won t even pay me an extra couple dollars so i can afford a used car or my own place  it s sick and retail is a miserable place to live  at least i ve gotten paid 3 hours of this companies time in meetings with 3 different managers demanding raises  insulting the companies empty promises  and complaining about their slave wages  the exact words i used ,odduq0

2824,Jobs That Try to Fire Workers Over A Workplace Injury/Worker’s Comp,   yesterday  i took my mother out for dinner  and upon going to dinner  we talked about life and work and such  during our conversations  she revealed her neck injury and how her getting injured is about to get her fired     my mother and the people she were working with were supposed to move this box  this box is too heavy for my mom and a team lift would better suit the situation  so she asked the people in her crew to help her  her crew said  no we are about to go to lunch  you need to do it yourself  the crew then go on their two hour lunch break  yes two hours while my mother tries to move the box        while trying to move the box  my mother suddenly felt the sharpest pain she s felt in a minute within her neck  this pain was so sharp  that she said that it physically hurts now to move her arm because of her neck  my mother took this opportunity to file for worker s compensation        higher ups at her company heard of this and are pissed off and are  as they said   investigating her for worker s retaliation  and are trying everything they can from not having to pay that worker s compensation  ironically  not too longer later in the same week  my mother s co-worker gets injured and she helped him file for worker s compensation too which has made the company even angrier at my mother  thankfully  she has documented everything so far and even secretly recorded full blown conversations of them planning to fire her       my mother is thankfully lawyering up and getting prepared to take the company on to court as she has realized exactly what they plan on doing so they won t have to pay her for worker s compensation     i understand companies don t want to lose money because they have to pay compensation  but dude injuries happen in life and we should not fire workers for injuries that have come from the job    gt this is very similar to when i was working at amazon  amazon fulfillment centers will have banners saying something like  we have gone however many days without a workplace injury  which is the greatest lie ever told  amazon hates worker s comp and will fire workers  so if you get injured  they rush you to their on site doctor called  amcare  that can only do so little as they are not a hospital  amazon will then try to their damn hardest to cover up said injury  to prevent an osha investigation because the media will eat them alive  at my fulfillment center  we had many injuries that they covered up so people couldn t get worker s comp or nothing   gt this is the same amazon who less than two months after they gave worker s hazard pay during covid  took it away  claiming  our warehouses have become increasingly safer during covid so our workers don t need the extra pay boost  this whole statement they released is funny considering every day  every damn day  me and every other worker were getting amazon texts that multiple new people have got covid  so it s like  oh yeah  we did become safer from covid  even though the data and infection rates are increasing every month ,odmtpr

2827,I had a temp Christmas job at an Amazon warehouse and they finessed everyone to work harder and never call in sick.,so in the area i lived in the uk amazon was actually the highest paying employeer for low skilled workers at  11 21 hour for night shift employees   on our first day our manager stood up and gave a speach to all the new starts about how he had also started working as a temp  green badge  and worked his way up and if we worked hard we could emulate him and get our blue badge  permanent employee   he gave this speach to every intake   everyone who works there except receiving uses a handheld device to work which monitors your activity and starts beeping if you don't have any activity after a few minutes  after training you start your first day and at the end of the shift you are told your stats and immediatly how well you have done compared to other new starts   after that initial training you're set loose and basically told that the top workers will get the blue badges and poor workers will be fired   they start rumours that the workers who have left were fired because they were too slow  i know this because a manager told me that someone i used to speak to was let go for being too slow  but when i found him on facebook he told me that he simply found another job   this blue badge nonsense and oppertunities to go far in amazon become a mantra for people desperate for a job and they work incredibly hard   it creates a lot of tension and reckless behaviour  you see people pushing heavy carts at lightning speed everywhere to boost their statistics   people fight over good jobs and there is literally internal corruption between different roles in the warehouse so the stackers can get good trolleys   one dude even asked for blowjobs for good trolleys it's that bad and there is a major conflict between the romanians and the africans for control of the trolleys   eventually they give 30 people blue badges  but 2 weeks later they take them away   they fire 90  people 2 weeks before christmas and in the end at the end of holiday season they take on zero blue badges ,odrxh0

2851,IS everyone really happy? Or is it just a fake version of happiness,many of us were told that we could  be anything that we want to be  but as we got older our parents would react negatively if we veered off their version of  the path to success  many older adults from generations before us have been working in the same job for 20  years  and although they may be financially satisfied  there are some who seem less than happy and have turned to unhealthy habitual stress relief tools like drugs and alcohol  they seem to have lived their entire life according to societal standards  such as  sticking to  one job  even though it may not satisfy them  the stress and unhappiness caused by this creates a ripple effect that can extend into all areas of life  and therefore out into the rest of the world  it's worth it to honestly question yourself at an early age about what will really make you happy or give you meaning  and to continue to ask this question throughout your life  i don't think we were taught this idea enough  and i feel that many older adults are very critical of this discussion ,ocwzpi

2853,Workers rights in the US: The single biggest issue we should be focused on,why the f ck have we in the united states not organized and voted for politicians who will make real changes in labor law in regards to paid time off and healthcare   the science is pretty clear  that we are a very stressed out and mentally unhealthy nation  and a lot of that is due to the fact we are all over here grinding 24 7 365 days a year getting screamed at by some maniac boss without a vacation  and without our toxic soul sucking glorified indentured servitude  jobs  we have no healthcare and no ability to not go into massive medical debt for things like cancer  covid  heart problems  and whole hosts of issues that aren't our fault   as most of you are probably aware  in most european countries  they work 32-40 hour weeks and have guaranteed 5-6 weeks vacation  yes  they get taxed more  but its pretty much irrelevant in my opinion  they don't need the money due to all their social services  their quality of lives are higher   i have a good job here in california  all things considered  6 figures   benefits  unfortunately it is borderline breaking my mental health with the stress  i'm getting screamed at weekly by my boss who micromanages our every key stroke and watches us work on the cameras when he isn't in  i have 15 days pto to use between vacation and sick days  but we are so busy that my boss gives us mad shit if i even use my vacation  he's literally a psychotic maniac from hell and our whole office looks out the windows to see when his car rolls up to work because we know shits about to go down every morning  he's an owner  so he is the boss of hr  there's literally nothing i can do about it other than take it or quit  and to get to this point i worked through a whole host of shitty jobs like scraping gum off of sidewalks  washing dishes  and loading ups trucks in the 100 degree summer heat   i just watched my buddy get his first job out of college with a 4 year stem degree  he had no healthcare and needed something  his first job only gets 5 days off a year total  that's it  no extra sick days  no unpaid leaves  he has to be there 5 days a week  52 weeks a year  if he takes 1 day off because he needed a mental health day  that means no week long vacation for the entire year  i know there are jobs out there that have it even worse  with zero days off   the point of this isn't to get in a pissing contest about how hard your job is or how much you work  or for someone to come out and say i should be grateful for my job  because all of that is just some version of stockholm syndrome  we need to vote for better workers rights  paid vacation  paid parental leave  not getting emotionally abused in the workplace  universal healthcare  this shit is insane what we are dealing with ,od8v35

2861,Advice for those who want to escape oppressive work environments,i have seen numerous calls for people to share more actionable ideas on how to enact antiwork values in their life   i don't think there are any easy answers  but i wanted to share a strategy that i think can help  this is from the perspective of the us job market  and might not translate well to other areas of the world   first  it is important to recognize that similarly to consumption there is no ethical non-oppressive wage labor under capitalism  this isn't meant as a total solution to escaping work  but instead a pragmatic strategy to help have better working conditions and a better work life balance   cast aside the idea that your manager or boss will ever create a path for you to escape wage labor  the best they will do is give you token raises that don't keep up with the cost of living  in order to find a livable existence as a wage worker you will need to use the collective power of workers to bargain and fight for you  start by looking at skilled trades in your area  most have paid apprenticeships and training you can use to get started  look at government and university work  custodial  tech support  usps mail carrier  package sorting  etc  most of those jobs are unionized and get a livable wage and regular cost of living adjustment   of course  this is easier said than done  all of these types of jobs can take months if not years to get into  but why not start now  if you are going to keep working an oppressive job for now anyway you can take the opportunity to hatch an escape plan  apply at one of those programs or jobs a month and just see what happens  in the meantime you can join the iww  member dues are sliding scale  learn about labor organizing  and network with other members to find out about better opportunities    again  this isn't a total escape from the awful weight of capitalism  but it is a reasonable way to get good pay  excellent work life balance  great benefits  a path to actually retire  and a pool of workers willing to go to bat for you if your employer tries heinous shit   it took me 2 years to land this type of position  it wasn't really hard work to get it  it just took time as those organizations run slow  i just kept trying over and over again  i weekly checked union and government institution job boards  those places usually don't post on indeed and other popular hiring sites  and sent off a copy or two of my resume  now that i have it  it's a great improvement in my life    i'm a big believer that we can have a world where wage labor is a thing of the past  but for now worker power is a way to protect ourselves from the worst of it  i also believe that if we do move to a world beyond work it will be the workers who make it happen and not the bosses  so  what better way to prepare and bring about that world than to join with other workers and organize ,od6kdf
2862,"Covid19 ruined my Master's which was the last of my freedom, and now all I have left is a lifetime of wage slavery and no one understands why I hate it so much and am so depressed.",i feel like you guys will understand and need to vent somewhere   i am doing my master s on a scholarship and it got ruined by covid    i know i am still  getting my education  but the truth is that i never really wanted to do this degree in the first place  it was something that was necessary for career prospects    but at least it was meant to be an overall experience  i was going to get to make friends in my classes  there was a study trip to italy i saved money in anticipation of doing on  my campus is really beautiful and i looked forward to spending time on it  and i looked forward to treating myself to a graduation trip to south america when i was finished  i also wanted to have a nice graduation photoshoot   three weeks into my degree  everything went to shit and i ve been online schooling ever since  next semester is my last semester and it will be online too  i didn t get any of that because of covid  and i couldn t postpone my scholarship  so i just had to suck it up  i had to move back home away from all my friends  i fucking hate my hometown  i m 26 and everyone i know my age already has a couple of kids  the only way to make friends here is to go to church  and i m bisexual atheist    i feel like i got all of the work of the degree - all the essays and shit  but absolutely none of the rewards  i didn t get to make friends  i didn t get to spend much time on campus  i ll probably get a scaled down graduation  if i get one at all  i didn t get to go abroad  all i got was shitty online lectures and more work  since they can t do exams  they make us write an extra paper every semester  and i d rather just do an exam and be done  since we can t discuss things in class  we had to hand in 500 word reading summaries every class  every week  which again  is way more work than if things were normal    i ve hated every second of it    i got offered a really great graduate job which starts 3 months after graduation    everyone is acting like i won the lottery by getting this job  i get it  i am  lucky  i got a good job in a pandemic economy   but i m basically going from shitty online school into working the 9-5 grind until i die    i wanted that big graduation trip as a  last thing  with my freedom  i will never again have 10 weeks of freedom to do whatever i want without having to beg a boss for time off  without having to pay rent while i m gone  i have lost that forever  but i m selfish if i say i m upset about that because  people died  just because people died doesn t mean life hasn t been shit for people  i ve been stuck in my family home with parents who don t understand depression  and isolated from my friends  and my last bit of freedom before going into the wage slave grind has been stolen from me  i wanted that so bad  but now all i have to look forward to is wage slavery and it s honestly making me wish i just got covid and died  my life is fucking over when the wage slavery starts ,odbc3e

2960,I've traced pretty much all of society's issues back to employers.,there are fewer and fewer jobs that people can honestly say  they are proud to work for this company   i am not 30 yet and notice the amount of service i receive is not the same  the service my parents used to get was better   there has been a shift  starting sometime in the 80's or 90's  where companies went from being for the customer  to being for the shareholder   companies have grown so massive  merged so many times  that they literally don't give a shit if you call saying you are leaving them  for some people  that may not even be possible anymore    workers have pretty much been turned into biological robots  everything is on a count down now   i worked at a call center for a year  and the biggest reason for people getting mad is not having enough time to help them  you see  we had an  average handle time  which means if i took an hour to genuine solve a complex issue  i would then have to rush on the next 10 calls    companies do not care about the customers anymore  few do  it's bottom line or bust  they pay people so little turnover is massive  which also makes people pissed because stuff you learn over time vanishes when someone who has been with a company 10 years quits   i remember going into radio shack or sears as a kid in the 90s and the people there knew their shit  now turnover at any place like this is so high  it's hard to even ask someone what isle something is in  because they genuinely don't know  go into home depot and ask someone in electrical an electrical question  or someone in plumbing a plumbing question  and they have no clue  they haven't even been there long enough to know what half the shit even does    people just seem so angry anymore  so flighty  so quick to fight  always rushing  always in a hurry    i think a lot of it is psychological  you spend 8-12 hours a day at your job rushing to get everything done on time  naturally it rubs off on anything that goes on beyond work   people didn't have to rush back then  watch a video of a car or some other type of factory in the 1950's and watch the same factories today  people took their time  they didn't have to do everything 100 miles an hour  which also causes more mistakes    this rushing  how you are treated on the job  etc causes stress  you naturally vent your frustrations  taking it out on friends  your partners  or drinking or smoking to take the edge off    it is also why the us has some of the highest rates of depression on the planet  or why people just lose their shit one day and go out and mow down a school with a gun or blow shit up    i can say with absolute certainty that the cause of 95  of stress  depression  anger  suicide  etc is a direct or indirect byproduct of a person's work environment  the impacts they have on the customers  on the people in their life  etc ,oc0b72

2994,Need to get this off my chest,so i'm 18  finished high school last year and am now doing a course in film and television which is pretty full on  5 days a week  around 25 hours    i've had two jobs this year  one at a pharmacy and one at a cafe  i actually quite liked the job at pharmacy  it was walking distance from my house  the hours were super flexible to fit my schedule and it was very slow stress  too bad that after about only a month of me working there  they stopped giving me any shifts  i went into the store to ask if there were any upcoming shifts but they said there weren't any available  so that was the end of that    about a month later i got a job at a cafe  the shifts were not the best times  early mornings before class  and it was faster pace  making it more stressful  nonetheless i still was content with it  as it was giving me an income at the end of the day  then about only two weeks later my state went into a lockdown and the cafe closed for that period  when lockdown ended i contacted them asking when my next shift would be  i got a reply back saying that they found someone else to take over my role  so that was that      so basically  i'm writing this post after just having an argument with my dad about work  my dad was going on about how shy and closed off i am and that that's the reason i've been losing all this work   and you know what  as much as i hate to say it  he's probably right    i would consider myself an introvert so it takes me a while to open up to people  so in a retail   hospitality setting  i'm not going to be the bubbliest and most outgoing person to a customer  and it's not that i'm trying to be rude  it's just kinda how i am for now   i've been looking for more work but i'm so sick of it all  the applications  the trial shifts  the rejections  it really get's to me    well  that's my rant over  not really sure what else to say expect that the thought of work now just makes me so drained and sad  and i really  really wish i didn t have to get a shitty minimum wage job to pay off my education ,obl78o

2998,"Is Self-Monetization the Key to Financial Freedom and ""Anti-Work""?",i'm new to this sub  and am not sure how to phrase the above question adequately so bear with me   i was thinking about this idea a few months ago and when this sub was suggested to me  it got the wheels turning again  i don't know a ton about the future of the internet and technology  but i'm curious to know if anyone here has researched or analyzed it   more and more people are making incomes through online businesses  many of whom are not necessarily monetizing their passions  hobbies  or talents  but monetizing themselves  i don't know for sure  but i think it's safe to assume that earning insane 6 and 7-figure incomes in a year as content creators on platforms like youtube  twitch  tiktok  onlyfans  patreon  or other monetizable platforms is not the norm for most people  that being said  it seems like over time more people have been able to make a living that supports themselves and their lifestyles as creators and influencers online   people shit on google and youtube consistently over their crappy practices  regulations  and penalties against creators  but the reality is  youtube isn't going anywhere and more and more people are joining the platform and gaining substantial enough followings to make a living off of the platform's monetization program and sponsored  branded content   influencers  sharing branded content exists on most if not all social media platforms    youtube is only one example--you can replace it with any other relevant social media platforms used by millions to billions of people  if every adult in the us  again  just as an example--or say  rather  every adult in the world  created a channel account and posted content specific to them  but of reasonable quality and of general interest  would it be financially and technologically possible for everyone to subscribe to follow one another  watch through a variety of content regularly to boost others' views  and the creator can make a living off of their earnings  advertising on social media seems to keep shifting more towards dedicated branded content from creators and sponsorships embedded in-video content  brands are not going to stop using influencers anytime soon and more and more dtc retailers are born online everyday  influencer marketing obviously works  so would it be in brands' and companies' best interest to treat each person online as a salesperson  or would over-saturation population occur on each platform and negate the effectiveness of social media monetization and influencer marketing  would it render content creation useless   essentially  i'm just curious to know if anyone thinks it could be possible for the internet to turn into a human marketplace where people solely support themselves by selling their lives souls  online ,obtj63

3006,"Boss told me, “Don’t use life circumstances as a tactic for a pay increase”",been working here 22 months  and just got a performance review from my boss that said  frequently exceeds all expectations  with no areas where i need improvement    so a week later i asked for a raise and he goes  well  you re still pretty fresh but maybe after your two year mark we can discuss again  i know you re at an entry level rate and i ve been there too but i ve never given anyone a raise and i m not sure how the equation works with senior leadership   i mentioned my apartment lease is expiring sooner than that and i m not sure what my budget should be  but that i d like to live closer to work  since they are forcing us to go to a hybrid model even though my job can be done remotely  admittedly this wasn t the best response but i ve been very stressed out by my living situation and he s always asking me personal questions and what he can do to keep me happy  so i thought it was a relevant point to bring up   he interrupts me and says  with me it s ok but as a piece of career advice  you shouldn t use  i want to spend more money  so give me more money  as a tactic in any business transaction  it s not relevant because the higher ups can just tell you to go live outside the city   the rest of the meeting was pretty uncomfortable because i was so annoyed he would try to gaslight me like that  obviously it wasn t meant to be a tactic so much as a very stressful reality of living and working in such a high cost of living area    so now i m stuck in limbo while i wait to see if he ll vouch for me or not  but honestly  that interaction just made me lose a lot of respect for him and i don t even want the raise anymore  i just want out   commiserators welcome  feeling pretty anxious at this point ,obs5to

3008,How I went from depression to bliss and how you can too!,   yes  corona has in some way hit us all hard  what is the worst part of this pandemic  isn t the illness itself  but the fact that it has pushed millions upon millions of people out of their livelihoods and into states of depression and anxiety  a huge percentage of the adult population in america have started seeing life coaches and therapists to find some way out of the mess that their lives are in   but here is the problem  life coaches and therapists charge exorbitant amounts of money  not everyone can afford to churn out 1000s of dollars every month to take care of their mental health   another problem with these life coaches and therapists is that they don t provide solid solutions to actually lift people out of depression and bring them into a state of joy  almost every session is filled with a higher percentage of solace than a tenable solution   as a person who has struggled with depression myself  and gone to all these coaches i can attest to the fact that i haven t found a solution from them for my issues   but after a lot of self-introspection and pouring over book after book for months together i built an actionable plan for 40 days to implement in my life to come out of depression completely   i followed it religiously and voila  after 40 days depression felt like a distant  far away dream  i can say for sure that  now i am bubbling with joy and bliss  and every day is a celebration    i feel it is my moral duty to share it with as many people as i possibly can  and i also feel it is my moral responsibility to not charge the kind of money that life coaches charge for their sessions   so i have now been offering sessions to thousand and thousands of people who are struggling with their lives for a very very nominal fee   i can afford to charge a nominal fee for it  as i am not reliant on this for my source of income  i charge only to cover the time and energy i spend on this  i have various successful businesses and i have been blessed with abundance in the financial level   what really touches me isn t the money  but the fact that in some way i can help people who are need of help  when people come back to you a few days after the session  and say what you told me transformed my life  that is the greatest fulfillment i feel i can achieve in my life   you are free to send me a pvt mesage anytime if you wish to get your lives sorted  ,oc47gu

They are usually super easy and you can find a good paying one if you are fortunate.,recently found a job that has been my favorite job ever so far  i do patient transport at a hospital  and i basically pick patients up and i drive them to whatever local hospital they need to be moved to    this job pays pretty good for my area  16 00 an hour  and we are contracted through the local police department   there is no bullshit busy work  no working as a slave  i literally sit around 95 percent of the time doing nothing  i sit in an office and just browse my phone all day long  i just wait for a call  if there is no calls for the day  we just sit around and collect 16 an hour for doing nothing     i have worked shitty physical jobs  jobs that are super fast paced and breaks are hard to come by  jobs that pay shit  honestly  i lucked out with this job  but seriously look into a security job if you absolutely hate the concept of working  stay away from hospital security guard jobs  unless if it is something separate like patient transport  and you should be good to go  vast majority of security jobs at private companies are just bullshitting and standing around  it can be boring  but it is some of the easiest money you can get  and as someone like me  it is the perfect job i absolutely hate a  traditional  job  if you want to maximize your time  at a security job you have a lot of free time at  it is a great opportunity to catch up on classwork if you are in school  if you wanted to work online through something like lionsbridge  you could do that in your free time at your security job and essentially double your hourly wage  i can pull  30 00 an hour with doing lionsbridge in my free time  and collecting a free 16 and hour from my patient transport job just throwing a tip out there  that i finally realized ,oby17q

3068,Why do we have to pay money for existing?,so recently i was in the countryside with my boyfriend  we saw a pigeon and he was astonished by that fact and asked  why pigeons would live in the city when they could live in the countryside instead    and i asked him   why do we   and the answer is that we have to live in the city in order to go to work in order to get paid in order to sustain our living in the city  living in the countryside would be too expensive  we couldn't even afford land there  so why the fuck do we have to live miserable lifes in big polluted cities  working 50 hours a week for a life we don't even want ,obkg27
3069,Send me good vibes to not accept this job offer if the salary is below a living wage,i've been offered a job  it's a retail job  so not in my field  and part time  but it seems like an ok place to work - small business too  only thing is the owner didn't have a wage in mind when he offered me the job   he said he'd be able to give me a number by tomorrow if i could come in to get a sense of things and see if i think i would like the atmosphere  the owner seems really cool and i would definitely like to work there  if they can pay me a living wage    i've always been really bad at negotiating for myself  so please send me positive vibes to turn him down if he comes at me with any number under 15 an hour  that is the conservative estimate of cost of living in my city  i'm tired of working for so little money i'm draining my savings and left too exhausted at the end of the day to search for anything better  i deserve to be able to feed myself with the wage i earn  i deserve to be able to make rent ,obxqqn
3070,Thoughts on the FIRE movement,seems the way to go to escape the grind  shame it takes so long though  i personally have another 10 years due to mishandling my money in my 20s   do you guys subscribe to fire or think it's also flawed ,obj1va
