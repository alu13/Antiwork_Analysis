57,"My job completely prevents me from taking care of myself, it's so frustrating.",ive been getting all these health issues which were most likely triggered by stress from work all the hours of work cause me to put off doctors appointments to treat the health problems my employer caused in the first place and everything worsens  ive also had a pest issue in my home and car issues my job has slowed down the process of treating these things  its like they all pile up and linger but if i worked less during the week i could take care of them in a few weeks  im quitting my job soon and i have this huge list of things to catch up on that i couldnt do because of work doctors appointments pest control etc it made me truly realize how much my job holds me back  i find it absolutely insane how people have no problem with a work arrangement that is so intrusive god forbid if any disasters happen in your life you cant just take a break to take care of yourself no matter what you haver to be at your employers service 5 days a week all day then theres only so much you can do during the weekend on top of regular life responsibilities grocery shopping cleaning cooking exercise bills etc  what pisses me off even more is that the employer prevents you from taking the paid leave you rightfully earned by imposing pointless deadlines and arranging mandatory meetings shit happens in life we should be able to just take a break if emergencies come up the way we are treated is disturbingly inhumane  i cannot wait to quit and finally be able to take care of all these lingering life issues i just want everything to go back to normal,cvfczv

61,I found this excerpt a while ago when and it’s really stuck with me. When I came across this sub it made me realise how many other people feel this.,but the 8hour workday is too profitable for big business not because of the amount of work people get done in eight hours the average office worker gets less than three hours of actual work done in 8 hours but because it makes for such a purchasehappy public keeping free time scarce means people pay a lot more for convenience gratification and any other relief they can buy it keeps them watching television and its commercials it keeps them unambitious outside of work weve been led into a culture that has been engineered to leave us tired hungry for indulgence willing to pay a lot for convenience and entertainment and most importantly vaguely dissatisfied with our lives so that we continue wanting things we dont have we buy so much because it always seems like something is still missing    your lifestyle has already been designed,cwmp6o
62,Why are people constantly saying 40 hour work week?,i have yet to see a job in my experience or those around me that is really  40 hours a week where i live if youre on 40 hours a week youre on a salary we all know a salary is a safety net for employers with no advantage for employees that 40 hour week is often 45 50 hours because you have to eat shit with a fixed income and work overtime as a slave  if its not specifically 40 hours a week on salary its at least ten more or ten less ten less and you struggle to survive ten more and you dont get to live any kind of life if youre in a rostered industry kiss your ass goodbye to any money over your allocated hours  its not your employers fault that youre taking 11 hours to do a 10 hour job right  this 40 hour week bullshit is just a selfperpetuating lie now its a minority of cases honestly i wish it existed as the majority sometimes  whats the solution i think its a 4 day work week that pays the full five 32 hours a week with a wage inflated to represent a 40 hour one work less have more fun and also come back to work more productive knowing your employer gives a fuck about 1 your life and 2 your need for money in order to thrive as a person the company would be making a sacrifice for the worker because they want to not because they have to i think thats the first and only step forward to success,cwycit

67,Why does everyone have to be perfect to get anywhere in this life?,reddit being full of white middleclass males tend to promote the selfimprovement movement one of the largest issues i have with this movement is that it presents the world as if you dont do what they do you will 100 fail that has caused intense anxiety for me i actually had my first panic attack in years after reading some posts on ritcareerquestions a recent posthttpsoldredditcomrantiworkcommentscw4td2thisdailyplanforjobseekers on here shows some of this ideology  whats wrong with wanting to leave work at work any professional field such as it seems to require you to live that life it isnt a job its a lifestyle if youre not setting up a homelab reading specialized tomes getting new certs reviewing fundamentals and building soft skills you are fucked any job forum will just give you tough love because they think being tough and realistic means theyre adults and confirm that you will become homeless if you dont do those things its very blackandwhite they will come up with well if you dont like it you can do manual labor 247 i guess the only two jobs in the world are it or working in a roman slave mine  i really dont know how to handle this life maybe i am not tough enough but i dont want to do any of that having a job is fucking stupid enough but i now need to dedicate every waking moment to the field this always seems to apply to everything too if you want to date your tinder profile needs to be perfect and your social skills top notch   part of me feels like this is false i see imperfect people dating getting okay jobs etc and that the majority of it workers never even heard of ritcareerquestions or rsysadmin let alone post there but i cant i feel like this is definitely reality it horrifies me because i view suicide as a rational choice if this worldview is true then the suffering will be too much and i will pick the option that means no suffering whatsoever i dont want to be a typea bootlicking libertarianminded person who only has one singular specialized passion i dont want to but if this is all life offers then i want to quit,cw6woa

73,Above/Below the Line,recently i had to sit through a twoday long presentation about efficiency of communication in the workplace part of this presentation involved a concept called abovebelow the line basically its the idea that you need to be happy and positive at work and if you see someone who isnt 100 excited to be there you need to do whatever it takes to bring them above the line i knew it was bullshit from the moment i heard it but it never affected me personally until about 10 minutes ago   its a tuesday probably one of the worst work days in the week  ill admit im not in the greatest attitude i havent smiled yet today but why would i our operations manager comes up to me after our morning meeting and asks if im ok i said its just one of those days he then proceeds to ask me are you below the line i gave him the biggest blank stare possible and just replied yeah i guess so he then proceeds to ask what he needs to do to get me above the line again i proceeded to just walk away   why is there this idea that you should be happy at work i show up at 730 get my work done take my hour lunch break and then leave right at 5 i am not here to put on some fake smile and act like this is the best part of my day a lot of days im pretty agreeable and i have a genuine smile because im alive and i have some fun stuff to look forward to after work but some days i just dont have anything great going on and im sorry if my grim demeanor bothers you its one thing for my wife or friends to ask how they can help me be happier but i dont need a damn coworker trying to put a smile on my face   sorry rant over,cw5hv9

76,America is fantastic at capatalist propoganda,it seems almost every day im telling someone who wants to immigrate to this country to not bother  this place was never the land of opportunities  my tinfoil hat theory is that the origin of that myth was to attract desparate immigrants who can be exploited for long hours and low pay  someone told me they dont want to give up their us online job they live in another country because they love their job  i told them your job doesnt love you theyre trying to take a month off work the job wont allow it unless they have a freaking doctors note i told them as an american who works online through other countries dont give up your life for our jobs they shouldnt do it for any jobs but they have a passport where they could go get jobs in other countries and not have to fight for a months vacation  this job loyalty and to this extent is how people spend 10 years in a career in a slog and then end up in this depressive state where they think to themselves what the hell am i doing here  dont sacrifice your life for a job somehow this is controversial to say,cw38fn

82,Interesting talk I had with coworkers,ive found some new friends who work in the same company as me but different departments they were all in their young twenties and i brought the 40h work week subject up it was surprising how they reacted they agreed with me and even said that they cant do things like grocery shopping or follow their hobbies during the week one even said that she needs 2h daily to get to work amp back and that this time should be paid too  it was interesting to see how different ages react usually the older folk i talked to here were like thats just how its always been we cant change it or you gotta find hobbies to do after work   this discussion kinda motivated me tbh if unions back in the years fought for 8h instead of 12h work days and won then im sure that we have a chance too also fuck the boomers with their attitude just because you had to suffer for 50 years in the same job doesnt mean we have to also how can we expect to grow as a society when we just repeat their mistakes and pain,cxfjoc

84,Realisation I had about the education system,i can only speak for the region i live austria in but i assume its pretty similar everywhere else in the west and to extend the rest of the world  have you ever noticed how mathematics is being taught in school from grade 1 not that theres anything wrong with that its just that physics and chemistry dont get taught until grade 7 why is that because physics and chemistry is only needed if you have a related job while pretty much everyone needs mathematics from ceo down to a cashier or builder  now the reason why this bothers me so much is because physics and chemistry along with mathematics are the 3 most foundational sciences there are whose laws apply to the whole universe imagine you land on a foreign planet and you meet aliens there the only way to communicate with them would be to draw an atom core or an mathematical formula without human signage to prove them that you have basic understandings of science  this cheesy example of course doesnt have much application relevance but it shows how fundamental these subjects are instead the main subjects are those which serve mainly the economy mathematics the specific countrys native tongue and english,cxhkvp

105,Anyone else constantly going through an existential crisis?,i have the opportunity to work very little and have my parents take care of me but i would be excluding the facets of life such as purpose love and contributing i would just be a burden indulging myself constantly at most living this life i could work a simple part time job  but by doing this i would constantly be reminded of what i could potentially accomplish and experience in life even though im 27 and have no reason to believe i could even hold down a job for longer than a couple months  and the fact that i might have an out is probably deep in my heart knowing that i dont have to sufferwork for shelter and food basically a life for myself  anyone else go through this constant battle of selling yourself too short only to bring yourself back up and hate everything   and lastly what would you do in my position,cx0g6q
106,A company built to eventually generate passive income and minimize work for all employees over time?,warning long as fuck post consisting of bullshit ive been thinking about for a total of 15 days definitely room for improvement here feel free to contribute your ideas    had a thought the other day about a potential company structure us antiworkers might be able to create something that can exist within the current system to tide us over until we can finally overthrow it heres the tldr  gt companys main goal would be to find some way to generate a passive revenue stream with minimal upkeep required so that everyone involved in creating it could sit back and collect a paycheckbenefits with minimal time spent doing occasional updatesmaintenance to keep it viable  i work in software so this is kind of softwarecentric and i dont know how well it could or couldnt translate into other industries im just trying to think of a way to exist in this capitalist hellscape without having to spend 40 hours of my only life every week at some bullshit job enriching someone else in return for scraps of the value i create  anyway there are a lot of software companies that will develop an app api etc that pretty much just generates money with minimal upkeep involved what if all the programmers involved in creating such a product could just share the spoils evenly instead of the riches going to some greedy fucks pocket at the top of some company maybe there are parallels to these kinds of products in other industries i dunno  heres how i think it could work open to suggestions     detailed and boring ideation below   stage 1 formation  a limited number of people mutually agree to work on some product idea probably for free probably in addition to their existing fulltime jobs more people can be hired to the company by majority or unanimous decision with the understanding that each person brought on would get an equal share of the profits generated once the company enters its final maintenance phase more on that later   stage 2 development  at the outset all coowners of the project will determine an end goal a profit threshold after which the company enters maintenance phase again more on that later but essentially before any work starts everyone involved decides after were each making x in monthly passive income were going to stop active work on the project and transition into maintenance alternatively instead of picking some number every member could agree to transition into the maintenance phase at any point by unanimous vote  product is worked on for as long as it takes to reach the profitability goal all profits could be evenly distributed from the start or kept in company hands as a financial buffer depending on what all coowners want to do if there are costs associated with keeping the company running web hosting materials etc it may be wise to keep a multimonth or multiyear buffer in company coffers at all times  critical business decisions including hiring and firing should be made democratically either by majority or unanimous vote if youre going to decide things with majority rather than unanimity everyone should probably agree on that being the rule to prevent conflicts   stage 3   maintenance  after the profitability threshold determined above is crossed maybe its crossed one time or crossed on average over x months depending on what people want or everyone votes to do so the company enters its final maintenance phase this is exactly what it sounds like nobody is obligated to do any more work and everybody sits back and collects a paycheck  okay so theres always going to be a little bit of work involved after this point someone has to process the payroll and shit so either someone can volunteer to do this forever or you can do it roundrobin style etc also some work will have to be done occasionally to keep the product working update software to prevent security holes etc any member can volunteer to do this you can split it up whatever you want to do  theres one critical piece here after the project enters this phase even if one of the contributors decides to say fuck it and not do any maintenance work anymore or they die etc they cant be fired if someone decides to check out the remaining members will have to pick up the ideally minimal slack to keep the money rolling in and keep the company from collapsing  i dont think most people who help carry a company to this stage will be so greedy as to abandon the project completely especially if the work left to be done is minimal and occasional but the possibility remains and i think thats okay because it guarantees the passive income to every member after the maintenance phase is reached in return for their contributions toward the companys profitability if everyone decides to abandon the project and the company falls apart so be it i think thats pretty unlikely though  extra work by any member to improve the product at this point should be welcome but it wont result in any greater share of the profits everyone gets an equal share regardless of the extra work they put in period     anticipated questions  gt a competitor has shown up or market forces have shifted in such a way that our company isnt going to be viable anymore what do we do now  im wondering if there should be an optional 4th stage called redevelopment or something essentially all members or a majority would have to vote to enter development again for some time in order to stay competitive this would be a limitedtime thing after which the company would return to maintenance mode  alternatively a new company could be spun off from the original one and it could fork source code from the first in the case of software to create an even bettermore competitive product i think its important that all members of the original company be provided a chance to join this new company at its inception with the understanding that their income from the previous project might decline to 0 once the new competitor is launched  gt why cant we fire anyone after the project enters maintenance  because ideally no more heavy work should have to be done also if someone hasnt been fired up to this point its because their contributions have been valuable enough to keep them therefore the product in its profitable state couldnt have existed without their contributions and they should get their fair share of the reward  this is also meant to protect against personality conflictspolitical drama its like being a tenured professor once youre in youre in and barring any extreme legal circumstances youll keep getting your paycheck everyone benefits from doing things this way because theyre guaranteed a paycheckhealthcareother benefits no matter what happens in the future  gt how are these rules enforced  when forming your company youll need to get this all codified into legal language with the help of a lawyer this is just a framework and you can tweak it as you please but hopefully youll stick to the main idea of creating a passive income stream for everyone involved in your project    what do you think again totally open to suggestions on this are you interested in starting this kind of company im a webmobile developer lets talk im willing to front the initial costs like getting a lawyer to codify this stuff into a formal contract pay the web hosting bills etc  also im hereby placing this whole idea into the public domain so feel free to useremix it however you like with zero attribution,cxa3p1

me he needs to not be lazy and get a part time job  ive chosen to support him i make enough money to support him i also wasnt complaining about supporting him i didnt say i couldnt i was just sharing hey im about to do this thing  we dont want him to get a physical psrt time job because part time jobs love to do this thing of oh youre only available 25 hours a week alright well well feel fully entitled to all of your time schedule you on days you wanted off and threaten your job if you ask for some basic respect of your time  and theyll inevitably do the thing where they schedule you close one night and open the next day and they will never give you a consistent schedule even though its what every single employee wants and theyll never post it in a timely manner and change the schedule on you without telling you and then discipline you for being late because apparently being a manager in a retail store means you can actively ignore details like fred picks up his kid every friday so he cant work close but you schedule him anyway while micro managing and yelling at your subordinates about things that are out of their control  apparently im an idiot for not wanting him to deal with this nonsense and focus on school   there area couple basic online jobs that would bring in an ok income and pay a lot more than the awful minimum wage job in the area so were going to try to get him those but if not hell still be taking care of the house which will be such a blessing with how much im working and learning extremely brain intensive things like coding i dont want his head space occupied about how he didnt meet the quota for inventory   hes getting a software development degree im going to get a marketing degree weve talked about how i could help him get into freelancing by working on the marketing stuff   the big plan is to go to south korea we hope hell have a remote job or maybe freelancing by then well have free housing ill be a tefl teacher in the public schools i am currently a tefl teacher online i do really enjoy the work though its not what id be doing if i didnt need to pay bills  its common to get to south korea work in public schools for the first year and then move to a hagwon private school because they pay more but you get far less vacations youre often working extra on the public holidays because public school is closed and parents still send their kids out and a lot more stress  i am hoping to stay in sk for 3 years and will gladly take the 2 weeks paid vacation with the many paid public holidays off you also have to come into the office during winter break and sit around all day the smart ones do something meaningful to them during this time msny study their distance masters or write their novels ill be working on my passion project i will happily trade a little more money for a lot more time  ill stay in sk for 3 years ill then use the savings from those 3 years to spend 1824 months living in cheap beautiful tropical countries and working on my passion project  i saw multiple people here talking about how you buy free time and thats your priority financially i 1000 agree  and then onto the next multiple year saving plan to save up for the next passion project  ive never seen myself retiring from a company after 45 years in the same office one week of vacation is pithy nonsense and youre lucky to get that much also many of those days get eaten up by life with things such as family emergencies sick days your car broke down you rarely get to live your life for yourself  and our society has made us out to be the lazy ones the immature ones   as long as im not negatively impacting anyone else around me what does it matter im lazy for being dilligent with my money and prioritizing my life over leasing the brand new car  theres somebody on youtube i love their channel name is creativity rv their sister died and it compelled them to completely change their life when their sister was sick she said to them im paraphrasing from memory  are you happy with your life because i always imagined you in a field making a painting or working on your novel  they werent happy they were in a corporate job that was making them miserable they bought a house and their boss said something along the lines of i love debt equity  what do you mean  now i own you for 30 years  they hsted that and rebelled against it shortly thereafter against all sense they sold their house bought an rv and set off they now make a tiny income on youtube adsense they have written a couple books and little other odd things to survive and they couldnt be happier   in a recent video they talked about the importance of not working theyll drag their couch outside the rv lie there and watch the clouds and sleep not caring about time until they feel fully recharged  they do still have to work to make a living but not in the traditional way and in a way where they can travel full time and fully enjoy life  ive seen a lot of people like this i feel grateful i grew up in a home that never placed a high importance on a career or being financially successful  id much rather be the hippy with the off brand hiking boots the falling apart backpack knowing i have no debt then to be the one who gets turning heads from my vintage cadillac that is just hemmoraging money   i am getting a marketing degree purely for my south korea goals and the other reason is because i can get it for minimal to no debt same is true for boyfriends degree ive gotten criticism for this but i really dont think it matters i am not interested in a teaching degree im not interested in a teaching career ive had it suggested it to me because of my plans i just like it and can see it propelling me to my next goals i have no idea what life looks like after 10 years from now and im ok with that i may get some skills that will help my boyfriend with his path   i personally think there is merit in getting a degree for the sake of having a degree so many jobs literally did not care what my degree was in they just wanted me to have one because we have to keep creating others in society and even if someone ditched most of their classes smoked weed all day didnt work and scraped by with a bunch of c grades   theyre more valuable than the person who went into retail work straight after high school so they could feed their family and have worked 10x as hard as the college grad  so im not interested in doing the puritan college route where i pick a degree in my ultimate passion and sacrifice everything i have to get into that field and then face extreme shame if i ever change my mind  something like only 30 of american college grads are in a job relevant to their degree im just skipping the steps to get to the other 70  i remember a fast food job i worked the manager told me i could get a management job if i got a business degree all that time and money to get this at the end of it i dont know why anyone would submit themselves to that  thanks for reading if you got this far my boyfriend and i are really excited for our next step im excited to give him the opportunity to focus on school im excited for so many of my future plans im also really glad that i hopefully found my people you seem to be understanding that many of us need to work you also seem to not be the type to act like you know my life better than me something ive been dealing with a lot lately   so hi if youve got plans for the future anything at all id love to hear them,ctyzyz

242,Got a written warning for reading a paperback book during downtime.,today i got a written warning for reading on my downtime not taking a lunch break when my boss wanted everyone pretty much takes it before leaving and goes home early and for taking 1 ot hour     i have this job i started this job a year ago its a help desk position for a giant company the largest for their type of company in the world actually i have so many complaints with this place all the way back to the start im a contractor because big companies contract work out to save money my contractor company bait and switched me telling me in the first interview a higher rate of pay than what they eventually offered at the time of signing papers not enough to make me run for the hills but definitely below what i should be paid i took the job because i am desperate live in a rural area and for the low cost of just traveling an hour to and back a day i can make enough money to barely afford a life     i busted my ass 60 hour weeks on rotating shifts you switch every week from 6 am  4 pm to 8 pm  6 am to 10 am to 8 pm and back to first shift it was brutal but i did what needed to be done to get to a stable place in my life the shifts were hard but they allowed you to get a natural 50 hours 10 hours ot every week just by showing up for work    i went beyond the shifts often because people were late or i volunteered for extra work on the weekend my manager knew i was using ot but he saw i did a good job and let me be i learned like a sponge and soaked up everything they threw at me soon i knew everything about 200 applications networking enterpriselevel computer imaging active directory company procedures data workflows i am helping take hundreds of calls a week for a two man team  making hundreds of tickets a day i get so much experience at an enterprise level its got to count in the long run right  after three months of being a great worker i was promoted to the supervisor position of help desk still a contractor no raise was given to me by my contractor they conveniently ignored when i got the promotion i was too tired and busy to fight for a raise because i was excited my efforts were going to get me even more promotions very soon my contractor craftily told me that the only  way to get raises in this company was to get promotions so i bided my time  my schedule becomes set no more rotation i start coming in at 4 am waking up at 3 am and leaving at 23 pm so 910 hours a day i do this to get my reporting for management done during my first two hours there when its quiet and not hectic and so i can be available for third shift to tell me what happened while they were manning things alone people think its crazy but my boss knows this provides it coverage when no one else is in the it area to provide it he lets me do it and im honestly okay with it because i am no longer on rotation i am getting enough sleep and no longer having micronaps while im driving     as supervisor i know everything and i basically carry the help desk with my knowledge of processes i suggested changes to the way the help desk worked and everyone on my team enjoys me and our work now i try to do the best job i can so i get noticed by the departments down the hall that pay twice what i make now if i can make that kind of money and learn what they do and get that experience ill be set for life i just know i fucking know it it fuels everything i do that dream of making it my contractor tells me after i interview for a position like that that i definitely am first in line to get it months pass the promotions never came i figured out the big company was more interested in hiring overqualified outsiders to be safe or getting h1b visas in for sweet government kickbacks     however financially i was finally getting things in order settling some debts feeling secure then the big company changed my management      new management comes in and is cleaning house as of this month they are writing people up for things reducing costs etc they notice people taking ot and tell everyone to stop it in a general email so i look at working 8 hour shifts instead of the 12 i usually did i immediately know this is going to kill me i calculate my new paychecks my landlord raised rent and now a single check will not cover my rent i feel like the skeleton of economic endgames is tap dancing on my career grave because i am financially fucked  i take the 8 hours and swallow it i start to weight options i cut off expenditures i go to my contractor and ask them please god a raise they tell me that because i received a mandatory cost of living raise not col its only half a percent already this year everyone received it that i am no longer eligible for raises this year that skeleton takes his top hat off and starts rattling his cane in my face     because i am a supervisor i am taken into many meetings at various tables about all the stuff thats going to change for help desk more responsibilities more things we are going to take over on to make the new management look good good good   oh by the way they tell me again no more ot especially not mine they also say that it would be best if i came in at 6 am and left at 3 pm and i must take a lunch during the day because you know at the managers old job back in the 1980s or some such someone sued the company for not being given lunches so we must take ours   ouch i am trying with  8 hours but i have my reasons for leaving for work as early as i do because i live in a rural place theres only one road out of the mountains around 5 am tons of people get on this road to get to the city they drive like madmen to get there brights on riding your ass the whole way on a twisty road with blind curves and semis crossing the lines its stressful and scary and i prefer to leave at 330 when its empty sometimes i can even get to work in under an hour this way i prefer 6 am is all my new manager says and thats that  by the way i ask while were here can you talk to someone on your end about the raise i heard the big company can influence the contractor on getting people raises why no i cant do anything about that dont you know i have it hard too im only making 90k but i should be making 100k because im a manager and not a specialist anymore     oh yeah i totally understand that what a hard time youre having      the skeletons head falls off onto the table were sitting at but my manager doesnt seem to notice  so i wake up the next week and come in at 530 i leave at 100 to stay under 8 hours the next day my manager assigns a meeting at 230 pm i ask if we can take it earlier he ignores me so i have to stay over to meet with him i read a stephen king book about a child murderer during the downtime at help desk to take my mind off everything thats going on   i have the meeting i am going to train the new hire thats coming in and by the way we need you to write up a whole training regiment for her by friday the skeleton is in the parking lot on my way to my car holding up a time card that says 903 hours of time for that day like a demented olympic judge and i feel like i just took a dive from way up above the concrete     today i get a call on my cell phone this morning my manager has called me from the meeting room right behind me telling me to come in why heres my manager seated with a woman ah its my contractor company rep ive talked to her many times told her about whats going on at the help desk been a good friend now ive finally met her face to face  my manager says  you disobeyed me i told you no more ot and you have 1 hour of ot on tuesday you came in at not 6 exactly and left at not even 3 i am going to have to have you sign this written warning      my rep agrees yes we told you when you signed up you must ask a manager for ot they didnt but im tired im really tired and i see no hope in this situation i dont even argue i just write on the paper for comments you do realize i am paid less than the people i supervise now right i dont get the natural ot they do how do you think youll ever get another fool to do this job if it means a huge rise in responsibility no raise and less pay overall     i read this message out loud as i write it they stare at me goggleeyed they have no response because this was a pageant not a meeting of rational minds they said their canned hr warning and did their grim dance right there in the meeting room as my coworkers watched me in greedy lurid fascination already gossiping about  getting chewed out yuk yuk   my manager does finally say something well would you like to go back on rotation  i set my head down on the desk and look at the floor the skeleton is underneath the desk staring at me it gives me a thumbs up  my manager then says also dont ever read a book at the help desk again you are setting a bad example for the other help desk workers if you arent seen working when you are the lead this is an official warning  while i work to learn and grow and do a good job in the workforce that skeleton of disappointment of absurdity of banal pointless labor for no real reason its there in the corner while i work staring at me doing those really obscene push ups where you clap with both hands on each push maybe even winking just waiting to throw me the stupidest fucking dance routine it can come up with     im tired i think theyre crafting a case to dismiss me its really weird two months ago the old management loved me and they let me do what i needed to do to tread water it changed really really fast  im going far getting nowhere one of my friends who heard my story of today said dont be sad keep going i have so much to offer i said i feel that while it might be true i also feel like im running out of places to find and put my effort they all seem rotten am i crazy if i keep doing what hasnt worked before     im really really afraid the next place i go to that skeleton will be there,cu6e4e
243,The job market right now for those without connections or wealth,as an adult most of the jobs ive worked have met one of the following criteria  1 servant class to the wealthy eg customer service or retail for luxury industries  these jobs paid higher and the workplaces themselves were good but it was basically like being a servant by kissing a ton of ass to rich people who can be very rude and dealing extremely expensive luxury goods ive styled children for family holiday photoshoots dealt with gold rewards cardholders who spent over 10k per year at my workplace and overnighted one of a kind occasion gowns to customers spoke on the phone with actresses in la about their makeup appointments and resolved delivery issues for businessmen buying designer bag for their wife i did these things while living a working class lifestyle and the difference got to me   2 various grabbag workingclasspay jobs lower end retail generic customer service tutoring domestic labor like childcarebasic cookinghousekeeping  these jobs paid very low often without benefits but had friendly and team oriented environments with flexible scheduling and part time options honestly these are my favorite jobs because my health stays okay and where im at again now retail   3 tempcontract jobs in entry level office work with zero benefits status or job security   the office placements through my agency were generally okay because they were higher end places looking to save money while having some low status person be a warm body to finish a task or fill a seat not terrible but you can be sacked at any moment and your hours can be cut plus you never really feel like you belong where you work which is extremely lonely and depressing   4 office jobs that are open for a bad or suspicious reason  ive landed what appeared to be a fantastic office work opportunity with upward mobility benefits pto and on the job training a few times now and quickly realized that the job was open for a reason and not a good one extreme overworking abusive boss piss poor morale disrespect and company culture problems to the point of causing illness to me etc i stayed in these several times until my health collapsed i keep seeing some of my old jobs reposted again and again online every few months because im sure the horrible pit of misery that that part of the company is hasnt improved,cubiy5

316,Possible Corruption I've Encountered,so this is going to be a bit different from a lot of the more general posts on this sub but i couldnt really think of a better subreddit to put it in this is more of a vent post about what is possibly the biggest corruption i have encountered in the workplace  so ive been working at a manufacturing firm for a year now and was staffed by staffing company 1 sc 1 a few months back they were removed and replaced for reasons that were never revealed to us contract workers so sc 2 comes in and on the first day made a promise that they would honour all of sc 1s policies benefits etc  well immediately after the first week this staffing company gets everyones pay incorrect they seemingly never realized that some contractors that had been there longer had a 50 cent raise and that one of our breaks was considered on the clock most people were losing about 10 on every paycheck weekly for the next couple months we had to go to their office individually to correct each paycheck even after they should have had us in the system to be getting correct pay we were still getting shafted for a bit and had to keep micromanaging our every paycheck a lot of people i had talked to never made a fuss about it and it seemed like many people perpetually took the ghost pay cut and probably thought it was taxes or something but anyways as for those of us who made a fuss we were back to our postgross amounts that we were used to getting  the next issue that came up was regarding holiday pay sc 2 is now claiming that they have literally zero records whatsoever of what sc 1 was doing and is relying on word of mouth or something i guess some of us are getting our holiday pay and some arent its supposed to be active for us after we have been staffed for 10 months but they claim they have no way to know who has been here that long some people show them check stubs individually and we get stuff sorted out like always other people are clueless and just take the pay cut   the final thing they give us trouble with is a bonus of 200 that we would receive after 10 months as well they really tried to fight me on this one and i was basically the only employee that was doing anything to fight back i gave them a copy of my sc 1 documents to show them evidence which they then hilariously claimed was the first time they have been capable of getting hold of such papers they never asked a single employee for this in their introduction meeting  time goes by and after a very long time me and a couple others get our bonus cash after a lot of work done mostly by myself they made sure to let me know that sc 1 had actually completely changed their policy a few months before they left the mfg firm and that the bonus is no longer offered so i shouldnt tell the other employees that i got the money they then start saying ridiculous things like you only get holiday pay once as in for one holiday and then have to work another 10 months to get it again which honestly sounds like lunacy to me what company only pays for a single 8 hour holiday once every year i double checked the original document and it says verbatim holiday pay will be paid when a staffing employee has worked 1500 hours 10 months in the past 365 days from the holiday i feel like they are totally rules sharking that statement and intentionally trying to twist what is slightly ambiguous wording when this was discussed with sc 1s onboarding they verbally made it very clear that holiday pay kicked in after the 10 months and stayed for all subsequent holidays there is some ambiguity with how that thing is worded but it just seems ridiculous to think they meant it starts over  but going beyond all of that there really isnt any evidence that sc 1 actually did do away with the bonus they keep sticking to that point but how can we possibly know that they arent just making it up to avoid paying us because it really seems like they are jacking wagesbenefits left right and center from hundreds of employees what really pissed me off was in a meeting following the time i gave them the papers and made them wellaware of the bonus someone asked them about it in the aftermeeting questions portion and they put on the fakest what bonus we werent aware of any bonus timothy do you know what she is talking about kind of thing you know damn well what she is talking about and after someone from my group whispered to her about what to actually call the bonus by name they referred back to how sc 1 cancelled that before they left the whole situation has me seething but i feel powerless to do anything at all because there is so much information being withheld,cnd1j9

375,Labor for income,i want to try and be as concise as possible but please forgive me if this post is scatter brained  first of all the idea that humans must work at corporations in order to not starve to death is problematic in my opinion i wont go into that here because the response os usually something along the lines if well you gotta do something to survive if you lived in the wilderness youd have to huntforage etc granted but my complaint is that what we call work in this system is largely divorced from any kind of meaningful scrutiny to the extent that the work we do is either unnecessary or arbitrary   what i mean is this there are things that are intrinsically valuable like keeping the electricity flowing fixing leaky pipes cleaning up someones yard etc  however a majority of the activities people must engage in or starve and be homeless are either meaningless or arbitrarily defined take the 8 hour work day often it is unecessary counterproductive and completely debased from any sort of logical definition take telemarketing or a lot of office work   my point it this modern society exchanges techology and material comfort and trades it for the type of environment that humans evolved in pleistocene and the individual cost of these so called benefits of modernity are engaging in meaningless illdefined arbitrary actions that are only existing because it generates profit for some owner   again i applogize that this is a very scatterbrained post i have been looking a lot lately at how modern lifestyles actually generate things like depression and trying to express this in the language of antiwork or a type of criticism of modern economic organization especially as it relates to individual humans doing gainful activity in the context of our current system  please post any thoughts you may have on this i would love feedback or criticism to refine my thinking,cqaum5

383,Office jobs are just as bad as the blue collared ones,just how the heck can people tolerate sitting down 812 hours a day on a chair staring at a computer screen for so bad years just how it is known that sitting down for extended hours is bad for the spine and standing up is a much healthier choice which is why a standing desk should be a compulsory requirement for all office jobs and there is the damn computer this is absolutely a torture staring at the screen for so long without any chance to relax your eyes further more the additional screen time we get after work from entertainment is nothing but extra stress to our eyes it is like we are spending 23 of the day staring at a screen two thirds there are so many different things to see out in this world and we are spending so much many on a screen i am really starting to hate computer and want nothing to do with them in a job a janitor sounds like a better option over a data entry assistant at this point,clh2h2

401,They're onto me.,the society where i live and situation in my personal life has created this environment where i can work only two days a week sometimes working a bit more but for the last year ive generally worked 23 days a week now i think that things are changing for the worse i work in restaurants as a waiter i work for a company that rents out hospitality workers to restaurants its a zerohour contract and im allowed to accept or deny shifts that are offered to me and this system has allowed myself great liberty to organize my life the way i have more free time i can do this because im a good worker i know i am so there is always restaurants that offer shifts for me or ask for me specially when they contact the company i work for      resturant worker mindset is radically different from my own personal views on work and employment in the industry everybody is pushing hard and people do long days and long weeks and the culture is all about working hard cooks and waiters see themselves strong and needed when they work those crazy hours and everyone in the industry are a tight group pushing forward together every day while i can honestly respect hard workers and their contribution and determination and passion i dont want it myself when i was younger i too worked this way i did it because i had found the thing im good at and i felt that this is it my thing but quickly i just found myself drinking and doing drugs with other workers on a tuesday night after a 12hour shift going off on unhealthy sexual trips with other workers and literally not remembering anything else than work from a few years of my life i understood that gift of life is greater than to spend it at work      now this summer ive been working for a good restaurant in my city they rent me from my company but sort of have agreed that ill be their number 1 guy when they need some extra workers so i do the weekends there and rest of the week im chilling but obviously they have this mindset that i too am hungry for more work and they keep telling me more hours will be coming to you youre good worker how you like it here would you like to do more work during autumn so on and so forth   in this industry it is impossible to bring out my life philosophy if you will its unheard of that someone is refusing work just because at work everyone is literally speaking about how busy it was or is going to be and thats good the harder we work the better so i need to play along to that tune because i still need to pay rent and make some money and i like working in this good restaurant but i dont want more work but when they offer it im forced to accept it because otherwise theyll find out that im just a freak a fake someone who doesnt share their ideas of working someone not be trusted     its difficult and stressful to pretend to be part of the ratracing slaves that just want more hours the other night i got really hammered first time in a long time because i came to the conclusion that theyre onto me that if i dont accept more work from them they will make sure i wont be able to work for them anymore and their word spreads around this not very big city quickly because theyre one of the best   maybe this working very little has only been a short lived illusion and the gaping abyss of employment is about to swallow me whole,cn3lyf

430,UBI and Antiwork: Some thoughts on a controversial subject,summary at the bottom for those who want the gist of my essay  is ubi compatible with antiwork this is an interminable debate within the antiwork community and for obvious reasons if you go into a grocery store or a mall everything has a price tag that price tag tells us how much we have to pay if we want to possess the item in order to consume it   the only means we have to purchase an item  money  is earned by selling our labor power to capital thus our work plays an essential role in securing the money we need to purchase the goods we need to live  antiwork proposes to upset this neat relationship between work and living by removing wage work in so doing antiwork appears to remove the sole source of income we have to secure the goods we need to live   for many in the antiwork community the only way around this problem is for the state or some other authority to provide a universal income that is not tied to wage work a ubi to cover basic needs that used to be covered by wages the ubi idea is simple and easy to understand without a lot of convincing or sophisticated jargon because it fits neatly with our experience   our experience is that our income is tied to the amount of labor time we provide to our employer as we reduce the hours we provide to our employer our wages should fall if we work 40 hours we get paid 200 but if we only work 20 hours we should be paid only 100 this is how it works when we ask for time off and it seems like it should work that way for a general reduction of hours of labor as well   but does labor hours reduction really work this way   less work pays for itself   labor power is a commodity and like any commodity it has a market price if you sell less of it in the market you will receive less income but this is not the only effect if you sell less of it the supply drops and what happens when the supply drops the price of labor power rises of course   the logic here is not particularly challenging in 1973 many oil producers imposed an embargo on oil sales to protest the low price of oil the price was artificially set by the imperialist countries agreeing to pay some very low price the opec countries refused to sell at this price the price of oil skyrocketed as a result of their embargo by the time the embargo ended the long standing regime of artificially low oil prices had collapsed  although it is unclear to many in the antiwork community the antiwork movement acts on the labor market exactly like the opec embargo acted on the oil market by reducing the availability of labor power for sale in the market it raises the price the capitalists must pay for labor power within certain definite limits reducing hours of labor pays for itself in higher hourly wages  if you want to protect wages raise the minimum wage   although i think the above argument is ironclad no one has ever been convinced by an economic argument people are driven by emotions and there is no more potent emotion than fear in a public debate  advocates for an antiwork position can expect to be inundated with millions of tweets reddit posts and facebook messages about why any reduction of hours of labor must lead to millions starving in the streets   ubi may seem like an easy answer to the problem but there is actually an easier one raise the minimum wage to offset the wage impact of less work   a higher minimum wage is better because it is what everyone already expects to happen although they may not realize it at first people expect that if the minimum wage is aggressively increased employment rates will fall in this case we have simply reversed the order we reduced hours of labor first then raised the minimum wage to compensate for the reduction   second raising the minimum wage rather than ubi attacks income inequality by aggressively raising the wages of the lowest paid workers upward toward the highest levels   third the minimum wage can be explicitly set at a level that ensures every wage worker even the lowest paid is paid multiple times the meager income that the census bureau defines as the poverty level  fourth theres no question where the higher income of the workers comes from by raising the minimum wage profits fall income that once accrued to capital now accrues to the working class we no longer need to follow the tax revenue from its putative sources to the pockets of the recipients of state handouts everything is transparent   ubi and the state   having said this if ubi did not complicate the antiwork movement no objection would be raised to it by me but this is not the case   ubi heavily relies on the state and its currency it is therefore a national program particular to a specific national territory and a more or less specific citizenry many in the antiwork community reject these attachments but have failed to explain how ubi can work in their antistatist framework   many in the antiwork community also assume the state is more or less the ideal representative of capital against the wage workers but ubi proposes the state directly assumes control over the basic subsistence of the working class population of a country how can these two ideas be reconciled who would advocate to let their survival hang on the whims of their class enemies  tldr   1 people work because they need the money ubi says it can fix this problem but its not really a problem because less work causes wages to increase   2 if it were a problem raising the minimum wage would be a better fix for a host of reasons i detail   3 ubi relies on the state to work and this is a big problem for people anarchistscommunists who oppose the state,clz4ic
431,Work sucks.,just as the title says work sucks  for teens or young people in the audience who may be unfamiliar with the concept work aka a job is trading your time skills effort and ability in exchange for money which can then be used for goods and services  when you first get involved in work it can be seductive you become part of a team engaged in a common task and the fact that you have to show up at a certain time and obey certain rules helps give you structure in your life the money you earn can be certainly appealing  however work can also be a drag after awhile it becomes increasingly intrusive when you discover that there are nearly infinitely better ways to use your extremely valuable time here on earth i cant say what these things are only you can answer that question if your work contributes nothing positive to the earth doing it may depress you the money you make doesnt compensate for the icky feeling inside when you realize youre not doing right for other people and going nowhere in your own life the money too is never enough a 1200month rental in an apartment turn into a first house which turns into a fixer upper which turns into a 370k house the beat up piece of shit honda turns into your second used car which turns into signing a contract for some fucking vehicle for 60 months at 09 apr once you start spending it you realize how inadequate it truly is if you play this work game for long it will feel like prison  indeed for the vast majority of the worlds population work is nothing more than slavery they dont call it slavery of course because technically people are free to leave their jobs if they are unhappy once you have been in the workforce for awhile you will probably start to desire something for a better job as your lifestyle changes you end up in a cycle though of working more hours for other peoples interests theres always a limit to the satisfaction you can achieve from it that time could be better served pursuing your own interests being creative spending time with loved ones or whatever the fuck you want i meet so many people in my life that go i wish i did this i wish i could that but blah blah blah blah  even good careers like doctor or social worker can get you down after awhile turns out almost every worker is a slave if not to an economic system then to a government one where they are serving a bureaucracy more than the people they really want to help  ultimately you may find that you have better uses for your time than any employer does and that your own intelligence is better served trying to make yourself money rather than trying to make a corporation richer thats when you realize how much work really sucks its completely a drain and it should be avoided as much as possible  if you need to do it then do it but just remember its only a fucking job and you shouldnt give a flying fuck if that company lives or dies you certainly shouldnt be doing more than the absolute minimum amount of effort effort you spend elsewhere that could give you greater joy in your own life  you can avoid work through a combination of extreme frugality and finding innovative ways to make money for yourself that involve very few compromises frugality may be painful but certainly not as much as working long hours at a job you hate just to pay for shit you dont need unfortunately i cant tell you the money making ideas they are unique to your time skills abilities and you will have to find them on your own  the ultimate goal is to spend more time doing meaningful things and less time working for some assholes that clearly dont give a shit about you that over time is where your life has to lead,clo1pw
432,Wages,face may ke july 30 2018    as     its cut how people will say why should a fast food worker get paid 15 an hour when a paramedic gets paid 15 an hour for saving someone life instead of now come a paramedic gets paid 15 an hour while a 30 minute ambulance ride costs 900 now it looks like the fast food worker the paramedic and the person in the ambulance are all getting tricked and somehow mad at eachother about it instead of being mad at the people who are profiting off them ,clertg
433,There's undoubtedly a limit to a person's happiness and potential under capitalism,i think this is the worst part of growing up and realizing the systemic pressures over us  theres just no escape i will always be subject to wage slavery anxiety social pressure stress no matter how much i relax how many hobbies i try how much i meditate leave my hedonist and teen addictions behind i will still be here suffering not being able to find any motivation in a system that kills my energy my appetite my will to go on social relationships etc this is why individualistic solutions are problematic they dont cut it they arent made for the majority but for a little minority that can live off the labour of others with loads of free time and money to spend many hobbies are just off limits for the many  also the mindset needed to change our lives is too difficult to find in a constant cycle of forced work and capitalist relaxation it just dies off succumbs to the unbearable patterns of modernity and worse of all the gates to happiness like free time creativity or relationships are scarce and filled with worries and commodity fetishism commodification of human beings makes social existence harsh its not about being anymore its appearance its selling yourself as a commodity that others have to appreciate in our delusion of narcissist depression  how can people like exalcoholics move on amazes me stoicism does too cynicism dronelike waking up at 600am everyday on 6 hours of sleep how can people handle this and progress and just not go crazy over the state of things is alienation so powerful i find myself being alienated as hell too videogames internet surfing movies sometimes porn thats my free time well spent and im still going on but its as hard as ever  then lets look at the limits to education even if you are in a country with affordable or free education you still have to have gone to a good high school or be intelligent to pass the entry exams or courses and then time is looming over you because as soon as you begin working it all becomes hard as hell grades dropping attention span decreasing like with everything education as a way to get a better life is also classist  not only alienation but how can anyone see this and think it is ok or a matter of personal choice are people shit most of the people i know would say that you failing exams or getting a bad job is your fault like with your psychological problems you are just too worried stop complaining and enjoy just talk to somebody etc like it were so easy to change my state of mind and my life already people think their environment and personal history have nothing to do with them that theyre just as free as everyone else and can change on a whim  not really rantiwork focused but fuck it,clgfbg
