0,My boss is fucking abusing me,i'm  24f  from south africa and in my first job since completing my marketing degree  i've been working for a year and a half now as a digital campaign manager for a well known company   i have really grown in the company and have so many networks and skills now  however  overloaded with work and probably have a job that 2 people could do  i receive r8000 a month  r7100 after deductions which is completely shit   i've been work even more during lockdown  even on weekends and overtime that i don't get paid for  my boss has promised me many times that i'll get an increase but never   there are people in my department doing a little work and getting the same salary as me with no degree or experience too   my boss has now told me that i need to take over monthly statements  including my usual digital marketing work  so i need to send customers statements monthly  this is a job that another department has done and have now moved it to marketing  so he put it on me and immediately told me to do training after online screen sharing training yesterday i messaged my manager and said that this is a really strenuous task in addition to my others  i'm not sure how i'll manage it  all he responded is that if its too much he'll get an assistant for me    what i see from this is getting an assistant gives me an even lower chance of getting an increase  cause then they have to pay another person  and also he'll probably trick me into teaching the assistant everything in case i decide to leave  because he knows i have much skills and so much potential to easily go to another company    the amount of work is something that another person could do as a job on its own  now he's forcing me to do it and i'm still getting the same shit pay  i can't even get an increase now or leave my job cause of this lockdown   i'm just so sick of this shit work and shit salary   i have created a website to make money online but this obviously isn't an overnight thing  i just need a way out of this shit rat race ,grh9nd
1,That moment when your dream job feels like an actual job,basically  i've always wanted to be a cartoonist  i've been drawings since kindergarten  doodling all over my homework papers  and i made several comic books back in elementary and middle school  once i learned that my grandpa was a cartoonist  i pretty much had my mind set   though nothing professional  i have finally achieved that goal to a certain extent when i started to get hired by people to write and illustrate comics for them  fun  right   well  a combination of lack of creative control and the grind of it all makes it not so fun  like   actual  work  all i can think about while doing them is how much i want to get through my commission list so i can work on other stuff i have plans to do   not saying there's no fulfillment or fun in it  but eh  gotta build up that portfolio ,grdrtn

5,What does the next year look like for cooks/chefs?,i'm in a bit of a grey area when it comes to the unemployment crisis in the service industry  the fine-dining restaurant i worked for closed two weeks before covid stay-at-home orders were issued  so i'm not furloughed  but very  very unemployed  with no prospects for the near future  in an industry that will  assumedly  be cutting down their number of total kitchen staff by not calling them back in  cutting the hours of the ones who are called back in  and not being able or willing to hire anyone new for what  the next year at least  i got unemployment started right before the system became bogged down   i'm definitely not wanting to go back until my unemployment runs out  and will try to apply for the 13 week extension in november  there is absolutely zero incentive to even think about applying anywhere until the extra  600 per week runs out  i'm just curious what others  who may or may not work in the same industry  project for the near future ,gqzty5

7,Just a personal rant.,i want to preface this by saying i am aware i'm in a really privileged position here  i know others are much worse hit but i needed to get this off my chest and thought it would be unwise to post on my personal social media   i  28f  interviewed for a new job on a friday morning  i was offered the position that evening  handed in my notice on monday morning  by monday tea time the industry i work in was shut down  i worked one weeks notice  the weekend between finishing one job and beginning another the uk went in to lockdown  i still began my new job and i do have to be thankful to my linemanagers for lying to head office to make sure i started as planned when the instructions were to stop all recruitment which would have left me unemployed   i work in customer facing administration so have continued to work  in the office  serving customers throughout the pandemic  our company has classed us as key workers  which is total rubbish to be honest  90  of our job could be done from home   i started my job 4 days too late to be eligible for the government job retention scheme  so  whilst every other administrator at my city's branch has been furloughed for 3 weeks at a time  each on full pay  i have been working every weekday and picking up their work too  security have been furloughed on the same basis and managers have been in work on a rotating basis  3 days working from home  2 days in the office  myself and the two maintenance technicians are the only ones who have been in as normal  don't get me wrong  i am so relieved they have been able to stay at home and mitigate some risk and im pleased the company have done the right thing and topped up their wage so theyre not doing  without  i wouldnt have that any other way for them  but i have been feeling very overwhelmed   i started my job in march and brought up at the time that the salary on the contract i signed would be below national minimuim wage as of april 1st when it increased  i was assured it would be amended as soon as the increase came in to effect  last month my pay slip was confusing as i had worked an extra week so i trusted everything was okay but when i received my second slip this morning i realised i'm still being paid at the original salary  that is around  600 a year under the new minimuim wage    on top of this  the accounts department have not submitted my details to hmrc so i have been emergency taxed by around  300 a month for the last two months  ive rang hmrc and they said its with my company to fix it as the tax code they have generated for me is correct    i am extremely lucky to be in work and to be staying with my parents who aren't charging me rent right now  maybe i'm being petty  but i feel so cheated out of money ive earned and so stressed i wont be able to afford to live when i move in to my own place next month  i want to cry   tldr have worked full time  customer facing during a pandemic only to be paid under min wage and have  nearly 25  of my wage taken in tax,grgm7n
8,Anxiety of returning to the classroom,i am a primary school teacher here in the uk  i am currently on my first year of teacher training through a programme called teach first  from september to march  my anxiety and depression levels have been the highest they have ever been from a job  i was previously a project manager    since the lockdown was enacted here in the uk and schools closed  my mental health has improved tremendously  i am still required to set work online for my class  however i have time to cook  clean  relax and effectively spend wonderful quality time with my son and wife  i had always hated work in general  and would get really bored with a job after about 8 months and quit  i also like different things and to learn new things  so i've worked in so many different industries  retail  sales  fitness  translation  project management  now teaching   i have always thought that the grass was greener on the other side  i e  that there was a job or industry out there that i could enjoy and excel at  that is why i got into teaching  in order to make a difference and to have direct impact on positive change in childrens' lives    now that the uk govt have announced that we will be returning indefinitely from 1 june  my anxiety is skyrocketing  it is almost like a bodily response - work is a virus and my body is trying to produce antibodies to get over this condition of disease  work  i now know that i want to be a stay at home father and not work at some job  this sub and various anarchist texts have really helped open my eyes to the slavery and indoctrination that we are subject to with regards to work culture  it is toxic and i want to escape in any way that i can   sorry for the rant  just needed to vent a bit and say thanks to you all for helping me through this   tldr  teacher who hates work and doesn't want to be forced by some shite government to return despite safety concerns ,gqayqp

13,"I'm 18, I've had 2 jobs for less than a year each, and I already despise working.",i've always thought there was something wrong with me  even before i ever had a job  i swear at 12 years old i said i never wanted to be one of those people working a 9-5 desk job or serving up burgers and fries behind a counter  i knew from a young age there was something undesirable about  growing up  and i tried to prolong childhood as long as possible  but now i'm an adult  and i just got fired from my job at amazon after a month  and honestly i dont want to seek out another draining job i hate   i have ideas for ways i could earn money until i can get a ged and start attending mortuary school art school- or better yet just have none of it and do my own thing   here's some ideas off the top of my head  -grow fruit  sell on the side of the road -buy clothes in bulk from thrift stores  sell online -make clothes customize them and sell online -paint and sell my art  maybe do caricatures for tourists somewhere -dog walker -become a musician and sell my music -dog trainer -become an online sw and do cam guy stuff i guess  is there a market for that  -sell weed  i've actually done this before when i was 13 14 so i could probably do it again -focus all of my attention on learning animation and create the idea i've been sitting on for 4 years and then sell it to adult swim for a big payout -freelance photography  maybe wedding photos family portraits and stuff like that  does anyone else have ideas  i'm seriously looking into just getting a part time gig i can stand just until i can get another source of income to take off  i'm just so tired of the rat race  i'm not even fighting for anything  i dont want kids  i dont want 3 cars and a boat  i dont want three story mansions  i just want a nice roomy place away from the city with a nice yard for gardening and dogs  that's it  this constant struggle and misery just to come home to the place i pay 1 450 a month just to sleep in  i dont want it  i fucking hate it  i hate watching my boyfriend kill himself at his job every day  i want to just get away from it all and live my life in peace  is it possible to not have to join in the noise but also not struggle to survive  i'm starting to think it's not but i'm at my breaking point  i cant see a reason in living if all there is is work and bills ,grhx1p

15,Work vs mental health,guys  i've been off my meds for the two months i've been off work  i have been so productive and i have been enjoying life so thoroughly  i actually read a book  which is a big deal because i went from five a week to zero a year  it took me a year and a half to finally get past the first three chapters of mistborn  i blew through it this past weekend   i still have mental health issues  but without a job to go to i feel so much better  i was getting better  i was focusing on my actual health instead if my ability to force myself to function at a job i hate   but i found out that my job is being given back to me soon  my mental health is declining again  so i'm getting back on my meds  my therapist will be getting a call from me soon  my anxiety was so low  guys  i felt confident  i felt good  i felt  productive  inspired to create and put forth effort in everything i did   anyone else here feel like psychological treatment hinges on making you a productive worker instead of a happier person   i don't want to go back  i've never felt so good in my entire life  and now i'm scared that i'll go back to being a mindless drone the second i get back to work ,gr493l
16,We are on the same side. A majority of people have a common enemy. This enemy puts us against each other to distract us from the real enemy.,when i talk to people on the left and right sides of the spectrum about their personal beliefs  they usually agree on most fundamental things  the division is created in pedantics  class separation  and confusion   let s take guns for example  republicans are under the impression that liberals want to take away their guns  so they outlash and bring their guns out more  and fight for more gun rights because they don t want guns taken away  they also want guns to protect themselves from the  dangerous mexicans    but why are the mexicans so  dangerous   not claiming they are  just going over the logical argument  because guns aren t more tightly controlled in the us  over 70  of guns recovered in mexico can be traced back to the us    so in reality both groups are really just against those who use weapons wrongly  with republicans thinking more guns is the solution  and being conditioned to praise violence  and dems wanting tighter control as the solution  but they re both trying to solve the same problem   this is true with most political divisions i see  people trying to solve the same problems but working against each other in doing so  making both groups ineffective in achieving the goal    let s think of another example  abortion  republicans don t want innocent babies to be harmed  they are conditioned into believing thats what abortion is  but democrats also don t want innocent babies to be harmed  after birth  both have the goal of wanting less harm  but they are conditioned to think they are against each other   i ll do one more so you can see what i m talking about  republicans want cheap reliable electricity  democrats want cheap  healthy renewable  reliable electricity  this one actually has a solution that pleases both sides  nuclear  but both sides have been conditioned to believe the solution is wrong  so they fight over other shittier solutions  if they worked together and put money into fusion  it would please both completely    i love you  we are on the same side  we need to put these bullshit useless arguments to rest and work together against the true enemy  those who divide us  oppress us  and profit from our labor,gtmijc

""Tips for Revolutionary Homesteaders: How to Render Fat from a Corrupt Public Servant,"" By Christopher Swanberg (ME).",tips for revolutionary homesteaders  how to render fat from a corrupt public servant    useable for  eliminating waste  cooking  greasing machinery and  generally  easing friction between social componentry of your machines of personal dignity    for this life-hack  i like to use an obese state-court judge  past its prime  known for their especially fatty livers  and in the process of whithering  you can know when it's ripe by its condescending smile  you may  however  choose to modify this method to take advantage of any bureaucrat or fascist population that becomes intolerably abundant for their season and which starts to harm your garden   note  yields will vary depending on the source  a demonstrably racist police officer will likely produce less grease than an obese judge  though  sometimes such racist police oil is of exceptionally high-quality and very satisfying in a vinaigrette over a light salad  and a politician may yield prolific volumes of oil  but of very poor quality  politicians in nature will consume anything - even putrid garbage  politician oil is well-known for its impurities  in sufficient quantity  even low-quality politician oil may be effectively utilized on the revolutionary's homestead for the general betterment of conditions while you work    rendering fat also can serve as a fantastic justification for getting out and culling any  blue lives matter  or  thin blue line  sympathies from your garden  which may have grown unconscionably parasitic and self-serving  luckily  these parasites voluntarily identify themselves with badges  blacked-out american-flags  him gt i stickers  and their exceptionally small and underutilized reproductive bits - indeed  curious at it would seem  many of these parasites openly brag about how they underutilize their reproductive bits  i've asked a biologist who told me this starts to develop at the smallest biological scale   in cells  he said  whatever that means  in no time at all  you'll become a marvelously proficient parasite-hunter  and  after your first few attempts  your garden will be grateful   safety note  rendering animal fat may be dangerous  as is the collection of animal fat  live animals have a tendency to lash out  once cornered  and are known to claw and scratch  do not fear  they are generally weak  having accrued fat for rendering through years of lazy exploitation of real wealth-producing parts of your garden  a single  forceful  and deliberate ax-strike  blunt or sharp end  to any point above the renderee's shoulders will suffice for permanently subduing a subject of nearly any size  don't worry about causing pain  they are parasites causing pain to productive parts of your garden  they are thorny and hard to manage  they grow to spaces where they are unwanted  they are hard to remove  and  last of all  they are like lobsters  what appears to be their screams is just pressure being released from within their exoskeletons - they are incapable of feeling pain like you or i  happy hacking   step 1  preparation   dig out a shallow pit in sandy soil  roughly 12 inches deep  4 feet wide  may need to be wider  depending on the width of the subject  and 2 feet longer than the hight of the subject   fill this pit with your kindling and fuel material  i like to use charcoal - for the convenience and the chance to use my propane flame thrower  and ignite  once your coal bed is smoldering at a constant low-to-medium temperature  assemble your cast iron army of pots and fry-pans and set them into the amber embers  proceed to step 2   step 2  melting   animal fat  like that from a judge  renders at a low temperature - a little bit higher than 100 c or 212 f  higher temperatures can lead to a less pure end product  a lingering acrid or burnt tastes in the fat you render  or even a dangerous grease fire   remove liver and heart - usually dense with fat -  especially in an older judge  and set aside   we'll address how to make the best use of these tasty tidbits in a later episode  i promise   remove visible fat layers and globules from the subject's body  trying to separate meat and tissue  cube this fat into 1  by 1  by 1  inch cubes and begin placing these fat-cubes into your heating cast iron army  animal fat must be rendered slowly  allow chunks to liquify  eventually  cackling cracklins of small bits of meat will turn golden and the fat will be liquid  with sufficient stirring and careful heat attendance  the liquid fat should be mostly clear  remove from heat and allow to cool until you are comfortable handling  further  proceed to step 3   step 3  filtration   of the various methods of filtering rendered fat for use and storage  my favorite is the most rusticly basic  through a few layers of cheesecloth into a recycled mason jar  allow to stand  check for rancidity before consuming at any time in the future  especially if you are trying to limit your refrigeration related power expenses  remember that once-good-fat can lose freshness and its constitution - never be afraid to throw out bad fat and start again   rendering fat can take all day  it will leave your homestead smelling like bacon for a week  and it almost certainly attracts hungry bears that russian as soon as they smell an opportunity for a fat-dense snack  sometimes  rendering fat is a good distraction from work  a fun way to spend a day  other times  it's a completely necessary chore -

26,I don’t know what to do.,so i used my stimulus check to pay rent for may  june  and july and move out of my parents place  however the job i work right now is part time and before covid i barely made a little over  400 a month  my rent is  400 a month and for right now i m not being charged any utilities  obviously though i need to find either a second or full time job if i want to stay here after august  which i definitely do    so i ve been applying to different places and all that  haven t had any responses until yesterday when a call center position emailed me to set up an interview  went to the interview today and they offered me the job and i accepted  after the offer we chatted a little more and it came out that they don t offer breaks    i pretended like this wasn t a problem and went home and read some of the reviews of the place on indeed  should have done this before the interview smh  and apparently they don t even let them take proper lunch breaks  apparently they make you take lunch right at your desk  they also expect you to come in at least 10 minutes early to find a computer and get set up so you re ready to take calls as soon as your shift starts and of course if you get a call right before you re scheduled to leave you have to stay until the call is finished    my state doesn t require employers to offer rest or meal breaks so this is perfectly legal but i don t think i want to work for an employer who expects me to work an 8 hour day without so much as 10 minutes away from my desk to myself  it s an even bigger problem for me because i m a smoker  i know i know  horrible  and i start getting nicotine withdrawals after about 2 hours of no nicotine  i can go 4 before i reach my absolute breaking point  and yes i can get nicotine gum or something to make it through the day but that s not really the point  the point is they don t value the morale of their employees at all  they don t even offer benefits and i m ignorant of the law but i thought that was illegal for a full time position    it sounds like during the first few weeks the shifts for training are just 3 hours  i don t know if i should follow through and accept the position and just pray to satan i find a better offer before training is over or if i should just email them and tell them to fuck off  i m just scared if i do that i won t be able to find another offer before august and i ll end up having to move back to my parents place  ugh ,grz5gl
27,No longer on furlough,i'll try to keep this brief  but i just had to share somewhere  and this sub is the only place that will understand my feelings   i was fortunate  enough to work at a place that didn't have to shut down and or fire any employees once the pandemic started  however  revenue understandably dropped pretty heavily  so they eventually furloughed some of us  in this case  they had us working every other week  we were able to receive unemployment aid for the weeks we weren't working   being furloughed was the happiest i had been since i started working  i finally had free time to do the things i wanted to do  or just be lazy and do nothing   and luckily my hobbies don't involve going out so the quarantine and self-isolation wasn't an issue for me  i think my mental health and general happiness was at an all time high  even with the ongoing pandemic   but now  things are opening back up  and even though i can't imagine our revenue has increased much  they are bringing furloughed employees back in  i'm going right back to having no free time  basically  i still get to work from home for now  which is already a lot better than having to go in to the office  but still  this just fucking sucks  i really  really don't want to go back  but i need the money  like we all do  so i'm stuck suffering   anyway  that's it  hope you're all doing well  despite all the crazy shit going on in the world ,gszwnp

35,"Have you considered running for public office? Senator, mayor, governor, etc",there are many jobs in public office but the higher you go the less work is involved  you may have to work your way up to those jobs by getting a degree and some experience in public service but its not a requirement  for example  aoc   all you really need is a loud mouth and people in your constituency who agree with what your saying  which isnt hard since most people agree that the system is shit and needs fixing    if your a naturally gifted gabber and have the ability to ramble on for hours while saying essentially nothing  it could be a good opportunity for you to avoid work  the pay is good and you dont even have to show up half the time to get paid ,gt03zi

(Mental health),i m truly grateful that you guys exist when in real life  i m surrounded by people who can t even begin to understand my ways  it s very refreshing to know that i m not stuck to the monolithic ideals of my household thanks to the internet   however  every single time i m on reddit  though i feel validated by asking questions that aren t responded with capitalist bullshit  i also end up having things in my feed that depresses me that i can do absolutely nothing about  i can t do shit about the minneapolis situation  i can t make the work bullshit disappear  and i certainly can t easily escape my dystopian household  yet everything that shows up on my feed depresses me to the point that i can t eat  i have insomnia  and i m incapable of finding any meaning in my hobbies   i ve become dependent on reddit  i have no friends at all in real life  and as i mentioned  i don t get along well with my family  but is it worth being on reddit if i can t do anything about the world  is it worth the instant depression  what do i do ,gsbhwe

72,Friendly reminder that working hard doesn't always pay off in the corporate world.,so i got my yearly performance review today   exceeds expectations in all categories    lmfao what  i have been lazier that ever this past year  yes  i am a decent employee  however  my super hardcore drive and motivation to improve things around the office is completely gone  i slack off a lot now  i probably only work 15-20 hours a week    how the fuck is my performance the same as last year  i hate the job but it is so damn cushy i can't leave    anyways  i have been down this road before  working hard and adding stress and responsibility to your job will not mean you are paid more  good work is only rewarded with more work  my best advice to people in the software industry is to sit back and chill as hard as possible  you will be a lot less stressed and will make about the same money in the end ,gr2e71
73,I don’t understand how people do it.,i know this is kinda long  but i wanted to share my thoughts and recent experience with being introduced into the wage slavery world    so i l recently got out of the military and decided to jump right into the workforce despite not needing the money bc i figured it would be a good idea to ease back into the lifestyle  picked up a security job working night shift making 15 hr  didn t seem too bad at first  didn t take long for working there for my overall mental well being to go to shit  to get off every day at 8am and then go to sleep just to wake up to have work again that night was making me fucking miserable    doing this every day just to make less than 500 a week honestly blew my mind how people live off of work like this  the only full day i had off was saturday and i was usually too tired to even enjoy it    i decided i didn t need to live like that anymore  i put in my two weeks notice and i m going into my final week tomorrow  and i couldn t be more excited  what is weird to me is that i usually worked longer days while i was in the military  but since it was salary pay i felt more like i was getting paid for the contributions i made vs just being paid for giving hours of my life  i don t know if i can do hourly pay jobs ever again   i did some research and the ceo of the company i was working for made 17 millions dollars last year  me working full time with 2 weeks of vacation would have made about 24 500 after taxes and deductions  this had me thinking  what if it became mandatory that employees had to make at least 1  of what the ceo   highest paid official makes  this could be an actual approach to closing the wage gap  i d love some other input from others in this sub  thanks for reading,gsl7zv

75,"Reflecting on ""Hard Work"" and the mentality supporting it",i've been reflecting on various ideas related to hard work and laziness and wondering whether this would be the right subreddit       i feel like so much of our life seems to be based around this idea of  hard work  in some ways  it might be one of  if not the most universally respected value      we make moral judgements based on it  i e      - you have to put in the work  to work hard     - if you're not willing to put in the work  you didn't want it enough       -no matter what  someone will come up with a scenario where you have to work hard and not give up  and it will be grueling but worth it       even if people don't like hard work  they've conditioned themselves to respect it in some capacity or pay lip service to it       my take        -i don't consider hard work a virtue in of itself  i think it needs to be something worth doing        -at the same time  it's true that not everything in life is something you want to do  in that case  you have to find the right tools and strategies  i suppose this would be in line with  work smarter  not harder  if you have to do something you don't want to do  you still have to find the right solution  and not try to toil endlessly       -in the off chance that you really have no choice  you just have to break things down into manageable chunks       in short  i'm looking to get a better sense of this ideology and how i feel about it ,gshcyp

149,Has my manager crossed the line?,i'm 24f and i'm in my first job since completing my degree in 2018  i'm a a digital marketing campaign manager  i've never really dreamed of working for a company  always planned to be financially free and still do  i obviously still need to do this crappy 9-5 life until i figure things out   our country  south africa  is on lockdown so we're all working from home and can only go to the grocery store etc  last weekend i decided to stay at my boyfriends place for the weekend   my manager messages me at 9pm on friday night to say that i need to do work on the saturday  btw we don't work on weekends and if we ever do  we never get paid for overtime work or weekend work  so i respond to him and say i'm unfortunately not home and have left my laptop at home  i'll be back on sunday  he then responds and says 'you're out  during lockdown ' and i respond 'yes'  then he says 'but you're not allowed to  if you don't want to work then you can just say so'  i was in disbelief  i just responded that this is a personal matter and i have no reason to lie  then proceeded to give him contact details of our agency that could do the work he needed me to do  he then called me the entire day saturday  knowing i wasn't home  and on sunday i eventually rushed home to do all this work he needed for monday  because 'senior' told him to   i'm so tired of this rat race  this cannot be my life x x  this is the second time this has happened now  the first time i refused to do work on the weekend and he gave me a long speech about how he had to work weekends when he started out his career  i responded that i did that in previous side jobs too but the difference now is that i don't get paid for it  even though i do occasionally choose to work overtime because i'm passionate about what i do  back then his response was that he never doubted my passion and that i'm one of the best in the department    btw the salary i receive isn't even worth all this  but what other route do i even have when the whole country is on shut down  not like i can quit and find another job  i don't even want to be working at all for someone else  and getting a damn company rich ,gpd2o4
150,Unique situation I'd like to mention-- atheist working in a church,hey all    i feel like i need an offmychest moment  i guess there's a sub for that    i'm an atheist-- have been for a long time  i meditate a lot-- have thoughts on divinity etc  etc  and can parse theologies-- but not a believer outside of any mystical sense  my job  i'm a church musician    i'm thankful for my job because it's stable and i've proved myself a huge value add with all the tech work i've done to put content and livestreams out for our parish    but i am sooo sick of a  talking to stupid people-- and b  pretending to value christianity  it's not even close-- i can't handle a religion mounted on belief in specific doctrines and claiming to know about a discrete entity at the helm  it's just unbelievably ridiculous to think that    being inauthentic for a long time has a cost  i am living a lie-- pretending to believe things i don't  constantly helping organizations i don't support  etc  etc  it sucks to dump energies into menial and shitty musical presentations for people with bland aesthetic values and accuse me of showing off if i produce well  i understand the conceits of my complaining  my context  etc  etc  so don't start about it  i'm aware of my luck  what's positive in my life etc  etc    so   what is your situation  does your job make you live inauthentically  do you feel like a faker  in what ways is your personhood made smaller because of job interactions  do you deliberately lie to continue working  as i do    reply or no reply i thought this was worth sharing ,gq01bd
151,I can’t imagine going back to work right now...,i ve been furloughed for a month and a half  during this down time i ve literally experienced a self-renaissance   i m a lifelong artisan who practices many creative trades  all this down time has not only allowed me to indulge in them with passion again  but also to successfully launch the business i ve been planning for years  sales aren t crazy for being open a month  but i love the entire process of running my own brand and making art that people will love   i m doing house projects that have been on hold for literal years  i m thoroughly enjoying  the little things  about life more often than ever  cooking and cleaning feels less chore-ish and more like things i m happy to be doing in my comfortable home  more time with all the people and animals i love  my boyfriend and i are having a wonderful time together  my spirit feels aligned and at peace  not in some  quote on a yoga mat  way but like seriously the energy in my body is thriving and untainted by the rampant negativity i experience while working   when i found out that in a week we ll be opening again  i immediately burst into tears  i work at a casino  the industry is mega fast-paced  ruthless  and unforgiving  i don t want to come home smelling like cigs every day  i don t want to get harassed by customers for hours  i don t want to watch rich people burn through tens of thousands of dollars while others look for change tickets on the floor  i don t want to walk back into the epitome of existential capitalist dread but it s the best paying job i ve ever had and i hate that i can t imagine not bringing home the income i normally would because i ve still got one foot stuck in that  wage slave  mentality    i have enough money saved to be okay for a few months  but i don t see my business growing enough to sustain me the rest of the year  but i m sure as hell gonna try   what would you guys do ,gof6pp
152,A Fun Quote from Marcus Rediker’s “Villains of All Nations” About Pirates and Antiwork Attitudes, some mariners cast their lot with pirates in order to escape any sort of work at all  a transatlantic merchant ship of 250 tons  which would have had a working crew of 15 to 18  hands  would  if taken and refitted by pirates  have been manned by 80 to 90 men  each of whom  accordingly  had much less work to do  as pirate joseph mansfield said in 1722   the love of drink and a lazy life  were  stronger motives with him than gold  admiral vernon knew of such motives and sought to address them in his own way  from jamaica jails he took sixteen suspected pirates aboard his man-of-war and immediately assigned them to backbreaking work at the pump  thinking  it might be of service to carry them out of the way of falling into their old courses  and  moreover   mighty be a means to learn them  working  which  they turned rogues to avoid  woodes rogers  governor of the bahamas and another man who knew pirates well  noted that when it came to work   they mortally hate it  samuel buck knew the pirate community in the bahamas before rogers arrived and echoed the governor s words   working does not agree with them  -marcus rediker   villains of all nations  p  58-59,gpudbk
153,Businesses obsess over driving satisfaction and delivering results to their clients...,because  if you piss  them  off  their money will go elsewhere and may possibly trash your company name  obviously    but   what about driving satisfaction and delivering results with their  employees   i've had two jobs in recent years that made big promises during the hiring phase but then as soon as the ink dried on my acceptance letter   boom   those minimum 4 weeks of training  surprise  you get one   all those nice people who said you can ask for their help  any time  ghosted    we won't expect you to run with this on your own for several months  sike  we meant 3 weeks  oh and the customer is  really  upset  good luck  beotch   if you as an employer do not empower your workers to do the job you  promised  them  don't be surprised when you have massive churn  and you best believe they are dragging your name through the mud  poisoning your talent pool    you want to cut corners on basic training  don't be surprised if your new hire makes a tonne of mistakes  that also piss off your customers   end rant ,govudr
154,"TIL - During the 19th in China, incense was used to keep time, instead of clocks. Making the life of the workers even harder.",thus  though the huizhou merchants continued to burn old-fashioned incense timekeepers  the character of their application had changed  originally  tea-makers concerned themselves with making the best product  that is  they focused on the consumption of tea  eventually  merchants would use incense to regulate activity with the aim of maximising production  timekeeping was no longer a passive function of the natural processes of tea refinement  rather  the abstract units of time now served to actively regulate the physical activity of the workforce  his was not a blind preindustrial  business  for its own sake  as in hands s deduction  but a pointed impulse to raise the productivity of human labour  ,goslzq

156,Capitalism and 'working on yourself' culture,posting this here because i know it'll go unappreciated anywhere else    it seems like nowadays it is not enough to work an exhausting 40 hours a week  sometimes more  work schedule  commute  go grocery shopping  cooking and cleaning  on top of that you have to constantly 'improve yourself'  be the best version of yourself you can be  we are under constant attack by the forces of the free market  they make us alienated from one another  they force us to pay ridiculous rents and live in scarcity and uncertainty  but of course if you feel lonely  you just need to stop whining and 'work on yourself'  if you feel depressed  'you need to love yourself more'  people treat themselves as a start-up  they have applied all the entrepreneurial gibberish and propaganda to their personal and emotional lives    humans thrive on cooperation and community  mutual support  you're never going to replace the affection of friends  family and a community by any amount of 'improving yourself' whatever that means  it's genuinely disheartening to see hoy many people buy into this individualist dogma and perpetuates it giving it in form of advice  especially on the internet  the oligarchs and the capitalist elites want us to think like this  they want us divided  they want us to not care about each other and be only preoccupied with production  they want to erase any kind of working class conscience and solidarity     amp x200b   we need to treat this covid thing as a wake up call  we can't go back to 'business as usual'  our future and the future of the planet is at stake  de-growth  togetherness  sustainability  wealth redistribution  we need to organise and fight for it ,gmmwsu

163,Others Like Me,having just come across this sub  i feel a genuine sense of relief and community with the rest of you all on here  i guess i just want to share a few things about where i stand regarding the idea      most people  get  my feelings of not wanting to work but no  they really don't  they get wanting to go home early but they still defend it  like it's still outside their comprehension that work is not a fact of life itself       most people assume that not wanting to work equals depression but i'm sure many of you know it doesn't  i have certainly dealt with depression  but i experience lots of passion and enjoyment as well  i want to do all sorts of things  freely  on my own time  in my own way       we are all in the same boat  hard-working people have many of the same desires i have and are doing their best to achieve them from within their worldview       most people wish their was a better way  i wish they would just admit it completely and not pretend like it's a good system      i'm pretty confident in the belief that  if everyone stopped doing what they don't want to do and started only doing what they genuinely wanted to  everything would work out  the right people would be inspired to take care of the food  the right people would be inspired to do this and that  previously untapped resources would be revealed  etc      this society of ours is a reflection of our collective beliefs  we believe in a zero-sum game  we believe our authentic nature is not enough  we believe in survival of the fittest  we believe that the basic nature of our lives is to fall apart  we believe that  so we see the evidence of it  and we act accordingly and reinforce it  perhaps not a single one of these beliefs are objective facts       i wouldn't want to take anyone's world-view away from them forcefully for a second  i've dealt with existential fear around the loss of my old world view plenty and wouldn't wish for anyone to go through that  still  it's kind of stunning to me that people can live for years and decades as adults and actually believe that lifestyle is 'what life is'       i'm not surprised or upset that people work  i'm more surprised about how unconsciously most people seem to make that choice  and that's the difference in this community that i appreciate      i think it would be more helpful and freeing for any of us to be more 'pro-the alternative' vs  'anti-work'  but that doesn't make for a catchy subreddit title ,gp2l4q

183,"How am I supposed to survive until I get SSI? I'm tired of having to be a ""good disabled person"" and pretend that I WANT to eventually get out of the system and work until I die. Having a basic income for the rest of my life would be life-changing, I'm tired of being demonized.",sorry for the long title  i just have a lot of thoughts   i've been trying to be approved for ssi for officially a year now  i'm in the appeals stage where i need to find a lawyer  but because i have no income since i can't work i've had to move around a  lot  which makes it pretty difficult to find a lawyer  to say the least  in total  i have moved 8 times in the past 2 years to try and avoid being on the streets  more often than not  the places i ended up took their own toll on my mental health  when i first started out i sincerely did want to try and be a good disabled person  and try to not remain in the system for too long   get better  and enter the work force again  but after these 2 years of struggling  sometimes while actively working  i decidedly do not want to work anymore  ever again  if i can at all help it   it's beyond exhausting when everyone acts like people on ssi are leeches and unworthy etc etc  doubly so when your disability is due to mental illness and nothing physical and even then  i've seen people tell amputees to get a job because they've seen  other  amputees still working  it's a one-up contest on suffering and there is never a winner  the most work i've ever been able to do is one-off odd jobs  but that's far from sustainable and i can't do things like that regularly enough to actually get by  i don't know how i'm going to survive like this  i've hardly been surviving at all  i've literally had to beg to have my basic needs met  the only reason i was able to move out of a life-threatening abusive situation was because of the stimulus check  and the cross-country trip back home bled me dry  so while that was a temporary relief now it's back to groveling it feels like   is anyone else in a similar situation to me  how do you get by  how are you  supposed  to get by when you've tried to work  can't  don't really want to anymore  and are now just waiting for a pittance ,gpu9o7
184,What Pandemic? Is Capitalism Fighting Back?,that's it  all done   last week world governments were telling their people to stay home  and stay safe  that was the message  global pandemic  death tolls were rising worldwide  people were adapting to a new social behavior modification  no choice  lives were at stake    this week world governments are declaring it's open for business  back to work  back to schools  daycares  and all things capitalism pretends to give us  economy before life  that is now the message  global pandemic  death tolls continue rising worldwide  but this time go about your daily activities  no choice  lives are at stake   wait  what   is it that nothing has changed but the message   it appears that's exactly what is happening  as death tolls continue to mount  it's become evident that elite capitalistic leaders  large corporations  and now bank executives are calling for an end to the lockdown   the skewed priorities could not be clearer  the economy is king   now it's at the actual expense of the people  the economy must survive  your brother  mother  friend  or coworker not so much  no longer important  the worlds capitalistic economies are now willing to sacrifice a select portion of the entire population in order for the existing form of capitalism to continue   go get your hair cut  go to church  visit with friends and family  but most importantly get back to work  earn money  spend money  and for that  you could now die and or kill others  that's the message  like it or not   what are the people supposed to believe  who are they supposed to trust   a reasonable person would believe that getting back to normal fast should not be the priority during a pandemic  world governments  large corporations and banks would have you believe otherwise    capitalism is fighting back  looks like a fairly even fight so far  the pandemic came out strong  made an impression   capitalism's indifference to the death of its people for the sake of the economy may even things out  the weak are a drain on capitalism pandemics kill the weak  the poor are a drain on capitalism  pandemics kill the poor   the elderly are a drain on capitalism  pandemics kill the elderly  minorities are a drain on capitalism  pandemics kill minorities  if you didn't know any better a person might think that capitalism is going to use the pandemic to cull the herd and ease the burden   5 million cases worldwide and climbing  a third of those in the u s   up for a game of hoops  let's hit the mall  take in a movie  go out for dinner     what pandemic ,gp42hn

187,"I resent being a beast of burden, but see no alternative solutions",on a fundamental level  my brain and body require that i partake in a community  feel a sense of belonging and worth within my sphere of influence   the problem is that the modern world hijacks these primitive reward systems by constructing a culture where only a limited pathway is available to receiving this form of social validation     it's almost as if i was born to work and that's really it  not a profound realisation  but a discouraging one  given that wider social factors are largely out of my control ,gq7kd8
188,Corporations are private dictatorships in disguise,i am going to speak plainly  corporations are dominant authoritarian regimes  they operate with a top-down hierarchical power structure and hold concentrated power at the top  they have arbitrary policies that can be leveraged against you at any point   over time  employees are groomed through operant conditioning which they call  professionalism  which helps the workplace maintain social stability  employees thoughts  actions  and words are regularly suppressed  while harassment and other inhumane abuses of power have become almost standard   human beings are often looked upon as objects  only to carry out their orders in the most efficient way possible just because you're a moderately comfortable worker who always has the option of  volunteering  at an alternative dictatorship doesn't make you a liberated individual   we should feel compelled to take action and not stay silent in the midst such evil there is something called indignation  it is absolutely necessary and healthy to be indignant about this situation make no mistake  corporations are extremely dangerous and will continue to strip future generations of their human autonomy unless we do take action   i've often heard the repeated sentiment of someone's job being  soul-destroying maybe people should grow a spine and take the hint that we're living under a fascist model of authority and control  how long will we keep bending the knee to these fascist institutions  do we have any dignity left as a species   i get physically ill thinking about how nearly everyone on earth blindly submits obedience to these fascists institutions  they truly believe they are being virtuous by passively accepting tyranny  as if they are somehow working towards the greater good of humanity  absolutely disgusting   according to corporations their is no objective truth  do you know how many atrocities have taken place in the name of  following orders  and being  obedient  this is where true evil exists  where truth and morality become relative and subjective as arbitrary codes of conduct   there is also something significant that a lot of people tend to overlook  the fact that our societies are saturated with addiction  there is a broad spectrum of addiction ranging from pornography  pharmaceutical drugs alcohol and gambling - to shopping  television  internet  and much more   if we understood that we have become complacent slaves with unhealthy addictions  we would stand a greater chance of a fundamental shift towards legitimate freedom  we need to be honest with ourselves about our addictions  change cannot be brought forth by a degenerate population with unhealthy addictions  and the powerful ownership class are intimately aware of this fact   i don't necessarily have a miracle solution either - after all  i am just some dude ranting on the internet  but at least i've pinpointed the problem   the zeitgeist movement https www thezeitgeistmovement com and  the venus project https www thevenusproject com center-for-resource-management  are some of the more promising grassroots movements that i've come across   also  if you enjoyed my rant and would like to investigate new concepts and theories of our emergent consciousness  please visit the community  adampants https www reddit com r adampants comments fh6i4d an introduction to this community utm source amp amp utm medium amp utm content post body thank you ,gpcn62

its victory using broad social policies  these social policies where possible thanks to very good prosperous years of the previous government and taking debts that future generations will pay dearly  from the get go the government started destroying the rule of law  paying trolls to pitch one part of the country against the other  and making shady deals that would benefit the politicians  i created a website aggregating all the scandals  briberies  nepotism and deals of the government using copy-pasted articles  not one word was mine  everything was quoted from articles wrote by other journalists  i just took it and put everything in a wikipedia-like website  it had more than 300 entries and was visited by hundred of thousand of people over the course of a couple months  the end result  got sued by multiple politicians  got arrested  every electronic device was taken  and worst part is that the majority of the population is still voting for them because they get monthly money from social policies  but most of them don t know that this money come from taxes  create inflation  create inequalities  i m all for good social reforms but you can t tie the them to buying votes especially when you don t have money    but that s only the pinnacle of the things i have to endure  let s talk about the ecosystem  we are heading for a global catastrophe and no one seems to care  the pollution is through the roof  corporations are greedy engines of pollution and the politicians are just vehicles that allow them to destroy the earth  over the last 10 years i tried to do something about it  articles  protests  letters   it didn t change a dime   people are aware of  and concerned by  climate change  but choose to ignore it  it is an unspoken collective turning away  anthropologist kari norgaard labelled this phenomenon  socially organised denial https www theguardian com environment 2020 may 21 i-dont-want-to-be-seen-as-a-zealot-what-mps-really-think-about-the-climate-crisis  people just don t care  they want they v12 trucks  huge houses  consume everything  work until death and they want everyone else to also work their asses off  don t people understand that there s no stopping of climate change and it will bring massive changes to our societies  migrants  wars  droughts  famines etc    the current pandemic is not better  viruses come in waves  like the spanish flu that came in 3 waves and killed millions i have a feeling that everybody around me forgot already about this virus  half of the people don t wear facemasks and the other half is wearing them as  chinmasks  in case police spots them and they need to put in normally on the face  pub are reopening  people are returning to restaurants  they are waiting in queues at the groceries  i feel like i m living on another planet  and it is mostly thanks to the conspiracy theorists fighting with the quarantine saying the virus is a hoax and the above govt  that downplayed the virus during an election year  they cooked the numbers to show that they have everything in control and it is simply not true    and that s another problem  the greedy corporations and the way they use people as cogs  just look at amazon  look at any bigger company  people for the sake of consuming and buying useless shit go above and beyond to earn more  nobody is satisfied with what they have  i lived in africa  in the middle east and saw true hunger and true poverty  people are happy with a small tv or just having a week worth of food  and them you are coming back to your country and you see fat karrens screaming for more cheese of their fries at mcdonalds  and 40m unemployed that get no help whatsoever  capitalism is killing everything on its path for the befit of the selected few  politicians are bought  people are brainnwashed and we aer all paying the price  fighting it will only bring you legal problems and jail  the divide between rich and poor is growing every single day and nobody cares   and people are at each other throat constantly  at work  coworkers will backstab you for a raise because they have bills to pay and mouths to feed  they are played by the propaganda screaming that we must hate  migrants   that the other person is bad   that the poor are the parasites  the whole society tries to make us angry at each other to divide and conquer  that's why you have blm  ecodenial vs ecofreaks  religious zealots against lgbtq  race war and wars between countries  all this is has only one single purpose  to make money  money for the politicians  or money for the 1  i mean history is repeating itself  why can't we understand the pain of our peers  why can't we understand a migrant fleeing war  why can't we understand that the hispanic is not taking your job but the corporation wants to pay the bare minimum  why can't we see that the whole propaganda is there to divide us   and what about privacy  in the face of the a  looming threat  we are giving away our freedom  people are posting their whole lifes on facebook  kids are creating tiktok that are scanning their faces and creating metadatabases in china  we have devices that are listening to us 24 7  and nobody cares about it  they pass law after law that strips our freedoms and the best part is that some of us are all for it  don't they know that destruction of privacy is just a step before abusing your rights   as you may have guesses  i don t have friends  it is due to lack of time  due to them backstabbing me  for promotion or other  due to them being just brainwashed or we just parted ways  i have nobody to talk to about it and it is killing me from the inside out  i volunteer  i donate money  i save money religiously for downturns  i try to be calm and respectful but lately i just want to explode  from antivaxxers to flat earthers  to trolls  to denialists  to propaganda people  i can t win   i could go one and on and on about it but i don t have the willpower nor the inner strength  i m just tired and i don t want to die due to stress  how do you shield yourself from everything around you  how do you just don t care ,gol02d

277,Capitalism just seems like modern Feudalism,instead of aristocratic lords owning all of the land  we have the rich owning most of the capital and means of production  instead of working said land and paying tribute to the lords while being allowed to keep a portion for our own sustenance  we are  rewarded  with an absolute bare minimum wage salary that in a lot of cases is hardly enough to survive while the majority goes to the rich in profits    as time goes on this wealth inequality continues to grow and the middle class continues to shrink  where it seems that in the near future we're only going to have the super rich and the super poor   admittedly its allowed the rapid development of technology  but it's all centered around growing profit  if you dont contribute to the scheme of ever expanding profit margins then you're essentially unproductive and worthless to the system  and if the growth stops then the system falls apart as we are seeing now  although that isn't the worst thing for the rich because it allows them to buy up even more assets for less money and further solidify their control   it's even gone so far as to make essential institutions like healthcare and education for-profit  nothing is safe from being turned into a profit generating enterprise    and even with the rapid development of technology as i mentioned above  we're still working the same amount because the rich see it as  if workers can produce twice as much in the same amount of time as 50 years ago  then that means double the profits  instead of working less  because again  it's all about infinitely growing profit   the ruling class have done a spectacular job of trapping us into a system of modern slavery and selling it to people as being more free and independent    i might be wrong in comparing capitalism and feudalism  but it seems pretty accurate to me,gldsh9

280,A thought that’s been troubling me as of late,there has been an increasing trend in companies getting their employees back to work as soon as possible  just as even a sliver of news informs us that the virus isn t as badly affecting the country  uk in my case  working from home had become not just a strategy  but the only viable method for many to continue earning their pay  whereas now it s been tossed aside to allow employees to come back to their offices   i know this isn t exactly a good observation  it s pretty obvious really  but what bothers me more than anything is that soon myself and many others  not just in my country but all over the world will be sent back to our little germ harbouring havens  to tap the keyboard for hours a day whilst there is an invisible fire raging all around    there will be safety gear on hand for us workers of course  we can have our face masks and our gloves to keep ourselves feeling a little less anxious about being there  but that isn t the point  while the bosses sit in their own homes or offices miles away from human contact in relative safety  we have to congregate in droves and risk spreading this virus once again  with the only safeguard being that we will have paper thin masks and gloves  surely  if we have to wear such things to work somewhere as basic as an office  then we shouldn t be going back there just so soon  though who am i to dare suggest we take human lives into consideration when the bosses are losing cash daily ,gkvj3d

295,Beginning steps in obtaining freedom. Please read and give feedback/contribute.,hello all  i see a lot of people here that just can't take the bullshit of delusional capitalistic society and i'm right there with you  if we spend time thinking through a complete solution  the abolition of capitalism at once will yield some pretty disastrous results  riots  unruliness  etc  i've seen reports of people admitting that they're waiting for just a little bit of instability so they can go around with their gang of douche bags to kill and rob people  there are other ways to bring about the change we seek   the power of rich people is contingent upon the sustained value of their money  so long as people utilize money as their means of being  rich people will always be powerful and regular people will always have a hard time combating wealth fueled corruption    i think a lot of us share a frustration with billionaires  these people  are the most capable people of bringing about the change this world desperately needs  but don't  they hoard their money  inflate their own power and exploit as many people as they can  i'm tired of these sociopaths being the ones who are most enabled to creating change   here's what i'm thinking  the power of billionaires is completely dependent on the recognition of the value of money  without their money  they have no power  furthermore  so long as our means of survival are dependent on money  we are slaves  we can't volunteer in capitalism based on our interests  we must do it to survive  we need to separate our means of survival from our participation in capitalism   our first step in shifting power from billionaires to  the people  starts with gaining living independence from money  things people need in the 21st century  shelter  food  water  electricity  all of these basics can be supplied and maintained outside of capitalistic systems  an absolute prerequisite for freedom is to stop playing the rent game  get land  property tax is bullshit  but one thing at a time   shelter  earthbag homes are so efficient and cheap it's ridiculous  there are also plenty of other alternatives home construction designs that doesn't require you to fork over your paycheck for 20 years    food  perennial food forest  people can be so clever  we have now found ways to incorporate companion planting in very efficient  space saving ways  in an acre of land or less  we can grow a crazy amount of food if we tune our allocation well  lawns are a scam   water  water is underground  water is in the air  water falls from the sky and at flows atop the ground  unless you're in a very arid area  water is in many places  stop buying water  it's a very corrupt industry  we can gather water from precipitation  above and below ground water sources  humid air  in 2020 information and technology can empower us to strive for freedom   electricity  so many ways to go about independent electric  hydroelectric if you have a flowing water source  solar panels  wind power  piezoelectric tiles  and so on   with these expenses removed or minimized  money acquired can be saved or spent on extracurricular things  we will have the freedom to quit a job when we want which will apply pressure to employers to treat us with some damn respect because they know we don't have to work there  we can use our money like votes  buying products from companies that we want to support  we can have the freedom to avoid companies that abuse their production means the most and can sell stuff for the cheapest because that's all we can afford and we're just trying to make it  with the ability to choose  corruption and exploitation can dry up in a fair capitalistic environment  if people stay aware   our main problem is that our means of survival are tied to capitalism  if our means of living were separate from capitalism  then i think capitalism wouldn't be as bad as it is now  at least  it'd be a step in the right direction  some of you might be bothered by the fact that i say a prerequisite is owning land  realistically  i don't think there's any other way  how can we be free if other people are in charge of what we need to survive  so long as your means of survival are controlled by someone else  you must do what they want you to do  when they want you to do it and that is not free   for a lot of us  we live in apartments  myself included  barely able to save money  this is okay and we are not out of options  don't get apathetic  see the way forward with me and find a way to make it happen in your situation  this subreddit is full of so many supportive people and i would be willing to bet that an open discussion  regarding how an individual in their unique situation can stride towards freedom  would be welcomed  land can be quite expensive  but it can also be really cheap  we don't need a massive plot of land to implement independent means of living  if your main sources of income don't provide enough money for you to save a few thousand to get some land then find something that you can do a couple times a week  online or not  and save it  yeah it sucks we gotta work harder  but this is the situation we are in  like it or not  it is an unfortunate reality  but this is it  there isn't a convenient easy way out  but there is a way out if you're truly motivated  don't let apathy take over your mind  you owe it to yourself to get there  it helps me to think in terms of time  not difficulty  if i do this for this long  i'll get this far  not  if i do this that is this difficult and will make me this tired anddd  there goes the motivation   i've had many long conversations with a good friend of mine about the mutual problems we all have here on  r antiwork r antiwork  him and i both agree that widespread coordinated action is difficult to achieve  given the tight grip of control we are under  but  a lot of people  independently taking the right steps forward  is major progress in the right direction  we don't necessarily need people banding together in the streets to protest  we need people to start separating their means of living from their involvement in capitalism  this is truly how we can begin to take back our power as people  we can't demand change  we must be the change   i plan to follow up on this with a thorough guide on how to implement each point i discussed  more elaborated perspectives  speculation on society  change and times to come ,gjavjy

297,Why you should absolutely detest landlordism, don't dare try to write this critique of landlordism off as some kind of far-left analysis  here's a quote from the notoriously anti-socialist winston churchill https anotherangryvoice blogspot com    roads are made  streets are made  services are improved  electric light turns night into day  water is brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains   all the while the landlord sits still  every one of those improvements is affected by the labour and cost of other people and the taxpayers  to not one of these improvements does the land monopolist contribute  and yet  by every one of them the value of his land is enhanced  he renders no service to the community  he contributes nothing to the general welfare  he contributes nothing to the process from which his own enrichment is derived the unearned increment on the land is reaped by the land monopolist in exact proportion  not to the service  but to the disservice done   landlordism is so ridiculously parasitical from an economic standpoint that it even makes capitalism look good in comparison  and it doesn't matter how many soothing fairy stories landlords might tell themselves about them being the good and responsible ones  not the nasty exploitative slumlord ones  the fact is that what they're doing is still economic parasitism   but the worst thing of all is the absolute entitlement of these exploiters when it comes to economic hard times   they simply won't accept the inherent risks in borrowing cash to make unsecured property investments  and then expecting to indefinitely live off other people's backs to pay off what they borrowed   the whole economy is taking an enormous economic hit  the second mega-crisis in the space of twelve years  and these idle exploiters expect to be bailed out at the expense of the genuinely productive economy  so that they're the only ones not to take a hit   the worst thing of course is that our political and media class are absolutely riddled with landlordism  the liberal media outlets are just as full of landlords as the hard-right propaganda rags  and even the labour party front bench is stuffed with landlords   it's difficult to see how we ever begin to move away from this economy-sapping model of parasitical landlordism when the establishment class is absolutely riddled with the idle beneficiaries of it    - another angry voice https anotherangryvoice blogspot com ,giiux2

301,Working for one of the most sinister industries during lockdown is affecting my mental health,so i've been working from home for two months and i really need to vent  but i'm also going to keep it vague for privacy reasons   i graduated and found a job in my city at an organization in the insurance space  it was a really random opportunity-- one of many job applications i filled out within five min and forgot about  because i didn't particularly like the idea of working anyway  fast forward a couple of weeks  and i decide to take their job offer  not knowing exactly how fucked up the organization industry job was  rip old me for thinking unlimited pto  nice retirement match  and free health insurance was good for anything   i've been at my job for  2 years and holy shit  it's literally run by a gang of incompetent millionaires who fuck around all day and do absolutely nothing in terms of productivity  it's driven on nepotism and idiocy  with myself being one of only a handful of employees hired on  merit  the organization runs a massive pac dedicated to upholding things like employer-sponsored healthcare  the reason why we don't have m4a in america  and other shady insurance practices  which hurt the average american 100  of the time  to top it off  they don't have an hr dept  and i was met with absolutely zero accountability when i attempted to report a coworker for harassment   i've hated it since the beginning  but since we've been working remote  it's gotten so much worse  i realize that over 90  of my day is filled with me doing absolutely nothing while upholding the status quo for my bosses  all day i sit at home and wait for my bosses to ask me to do some menial task that could've taken then five min to do if they cared  meanwhile  my  work  continues to drive the organization forward  effectively preventing folks from accessing healthcare through a single payer system  instead  the org fights to keep insurance relevant  while lining the pockets of all the execs who are constantly on vacation   i'm so tired of this  i don't know if i should keep  working  and drain the company of their money while doing nothing  or seek something more  fulfilling   we all know that work is not fulfilling  it's mindless and unnecessary  i feel trapped here because i have a lot of student debt that i'm working to pay down  i don't want to be responsible for the massive amount of suffering that the insurance industry causes  but i also don't want to quit this job in the middle of a pandemic with nothing else lined up   i sincerely wish we lived in a world without work as we know it  bad coworkers  and industries hellbent on exploiting human needs  i'm so tired and i wish i could just tell my entire organization to fuck off forever ,gj2zry

303,"The law of value, our value in society and capitalist ideology",i usually encounter many people who say the usual  if you don't work you don't deserve to eat  in different shapes and forms    society owes you nothing   get up by your bootstraps   nice analogy because it's physically impossible   why do i have to work to give you a house   you have no right to anything  and so on   first of all  it's incredibly ironic that people use this argument to attack socialism  where the goal is to make a more efficient use of labour and eliminate the biggest parasitic setback  the bourgeoise  when you ask these people  most of them think capitalism rewards their output  capitalists are selfless servicers of the community  and that humans need always live in a state of deprivation to motivate them to work   secondly  this basically stems from the functioning of capitalism itself  the output  to this people  means nothing but your labour-force embodied in some commodity or service which can be monetized  it's the theory of the law of value  where your access to others' work is mediated by the market instance using the socially necessary labour-time as a measure of value  of course  this measure is deeply flawed  as goods and services only have value as carriers of exchange-value and surplus-value  therefore  you end up producing toys  war machines  drugs  etc  insofar it yields a profit  illegal or not  these activities are tied to the profit they generate  no one would be making or selling drugs for the sake of it  at least not at the scale we see today  with the amount of violence and turf control  thinking they do a service to anybody  the mechanism of value is what allows a huge deal of corruption and human narcissism to take a new form  too  it is what keeps pollution rising  in our society  profit matters more than our lives  this is precisely the problem   the measure of this output is flawed  because it is neutral towards the morality of the activities carried on to achieve a surplus  because it leaves out a huge deal of reproductive work  care of children  the disabled  the elderly at home  personal reproduction  and also in the realm of value  most of that output is not rewarded or recognized either  where do you think capitalists make money from   thirdly  this ideology is blind to the structural limitations in the access to the mere production of surplus-value  you're not even granted exploitation to survive  many people are basically thrown out of the mechanism of capitalist reproduction  you have to compete in demanding fields  train for years  have social capital  and even then getting a job might prove difficult and very anxiety-inducing  again  this process is flawed  too  and the more capable individuals often don't get positions because another person with more social capital got the job  this is evident in politics  but at the workplace too  people rely on nepotism to get by  if this doesn't speak to you as yet another example of why this system of labour doesn't work  then you have to be benefitting from it   fourthly  why wouldn't my value as a human being be more important to society  isn't society a mechanism  in principle  to better human lives and not leave the astray on the wilderness  to give them purposeful social lives  to care for them when ill  these people's idea of society is just a market  that's how flawed and capitalist-realist their thinking is  a big shopping center when you receive when you give something in return  living in america might not be so different  that's why people there are so fucked up mentally  with issues like school shootings  deep alienation  racism and homelessness being commonplace  i'd argue the ideological component of these comments stems from a vision of society akin to that of the usa  if not more rooted on capitalist ideals  eugenics  a hate of the poor   why wouldn't we want to help people live good lives if that's what they want  why would we prefer to pay no attention to their needs  and even sabotage any help they might receive  do these people have a limit to their empathy  maybe  some totally do  narcissism is so prevalent today it's painful to watch and experience  i think this ideology is another form of the just world hypothesis  value works in the same realm of abstraction  capitalism  to these people  means something totally different  they're unable  unwilling to understand it can be as flawed as it is  there's nothing just about our world  our work and our society  how is people dying because they can't produce surplus-value just to anyone  what's the morality behind this  is death  lack of a roof  food to eat  healthcare  etc  the penalty for not producing useless stuff  producing more value to feed the autopoietic all-devouring machine of capital   this is how we get fascism  this is how it begins  people become means  disposable and of no value  and then they claim the moral high ground no less  evil is all around us  it's our status quo  and most people are really no better  right now  our society is narcissistic  wanting company to their misery instead of freedom  they will even push away rights  benefits for the sake of proving themselves to be  valuable  they can't envision the economy right now being so inneficient it's producing so much surplus to pollute the entire planet but unable to put a roof over everyone's heads  purposeful shortages  not only do they lack a care for social life  a disdain for the other's life  but also are weak and subservient to forces which don't care about them  their work  their dreams and loved ones  they rejoice in their just world delusion  when the bourgeoise reaps half of their working day to themselves  they are being drilled a new hole by capitalism and their only coping mechanism is that someone else also needs a new hole  it's like the joke where a man encounters a genie  who says that for everything he wishes for  his neighbor will get double  so he wishes the genie to make him one-eyed   fifthly  it's feasible  the amount of useless work being performed is staggering  unemployment traps millions in poverty and a life of shame and fighting the system to defend the value of their lives over the idea that they're a  cost  we can get by with a 4 hours workday  the rest is just profits for the bourgeoise  which we don't need at all  we know now that most office work consists of procrastination  tedium   faking work  millions trapped in useless routines just to prove others they have  value  if you don't work  you must feel ashamed  if you aren't studying and training for work  you have to feel ashamed and get  motivated  fast   man up   become an adult  and basically become the perfect slave which is not only ignorant of its demise  but also happy about it  we can provide for everyone  we can reduce our work a lot  we can forgive debt and restart social life with a new  real  social contract  whoever tells you it can't be done is blind to the fact vacant homes outumber homeless people  more can be constructed fairly easily  bullshit jobs exist  40  of the food is thrown out  automation could reduce work significantly  etc  etc  it's more of a matter of a bad-faith argumentation than anything else  even nixon  keynes said we would be working less than 20 hours by now  what happened to the capitalist dream of leisure  what happened to the focus on quality of life  what happened to real progress  what happened to humanity   the worst part is  precisely  that this is our normal  being on subreddits such as this gives too empathetic and conscious idea of human society under late-capitalism  in the end  we are alone  we have to live thinking about how we can enter  re-enter the profit system somehow  by being a wage slave  having a position of authority  nepotism  or taking hold of surplus  to earn  passive income  or rely on the state to lead a life without actual work  getting an  easy job   big income  it all revolves about our relation to society  there's no alternative to value as of yet  this is what we are stuck with as long as people delude themselves that this is just and are unwilling to care for the other or be conscious of their own exploitation  so  in fact  the ideology i'm here portraying as ridiculous has in fact been the most effective in many parts of the world  despite the bloodshed  the coups  the sanctions  the most effective weapon is and always be compliance  ideology  protecting the system in the minds of people  so no idea to overthrow it can ever arise  why has it won  why has capitalism  privation  exclusion won ideologically  this  i must admit  is the biggest unknown i have with regards to societal matters   if i may adventure an explanation  it boils down to capitalism adapting to our innermost drives  it provides the constant promise of desire satisfaction  an endless route to get surplus-enjoyment from  it fosters narcissism  tribalism  petty competition  it also gives the illusion of justice  as marx said  when workers enter a contract  they don't usually know they're being ripped off  the law of value hides the mechanism of exploitation and excludes other forms of work  this tied to patriarchy  it invites technological progress  which also helps with the illusion that society is going forward  while it also digs it's own tomb  and  here goes the unexpected one  it provides meaning  capitalism is above all a system of distribution of value based on the mechanism of value  this value that it's distributed in the form of money is  at the same time  a form of social recognition  give yourself a pat in the back   you are someone  because you are someone  your work also matters  your  output  is appreciated  it gives people an easy way to measure their worth  to see themselves as valuable  it helps people  all in all  truth be told  to at least equate meaning with their role in society  even if this role is meaningless to societal reproduction  this is not everyone  but how many times have you heard  so what do you do  at conversations  it's our primary quality   people are in desperate need to hold to things and anchor themselves  the truth of meaningless suffering is unmanageable  and we grab onto whatever we find to overcome this suffering  so while it's obviously true we're narcissistic and capitalism goes well with the structure of desire  it also provides a basic framework  a map  for people to follow and pride themselves upon  this is undermined in leftist debate and more so on here   oh  how can you derive meaning from work  it's like dying each day  and we make fun of people who say they get bored outside work  in the outside world  and even in other communities  people really act like this  however   i got a job  i'm no longer depressed  can mean much more than the fact that interviews can be frustrating  maybe that person felt useless and the only way to regain his or her pride was to re-enter the workplace  how many times have you heard an unemployed person be shamed  yes  it's flawed and precisely the opposite of what we need  but it works  it happens more times than not  to force others into entering wage-slavery  people don't have the same level of criticism we do  no matter how we wished it was so  people function and follow the status quo much more like automata  disregarding social forces comes at a big cost  it makes of you an antagonist  a flaw  it makes you doubt your own value  it shatters personal connections by unmasking your value as temporary  it's easy to just give in without a fight  maybe  just maybe  humanity will never truly have the mental fortitude to lead their lives and their social world rationally and with conscious direction  this is what i fear the most if we are to keep roaming this planet  still  i just can't be at peace  i can't justify or embrace the suffering  it ought not to be this way  and not doing so is seen as the flaw  not adapting becomes  a chemical imbalance  being angry or negative a clear way to ostracize yourself  seeking enlightenment a naive trickery to keep us in check  we have no spiritual community as did the buddha  we live in a world which can only destroy contemplation  shame it  it's unproductive to criticize  this  mindfullness  is the perfect companion to late-capitalism of anxiety  constant work  no free time  reaching a stable state of mind amidst oversaturation means the bourgeoise can now milk you for longer  and better  and you will even feel good about it  thinking you're now at peace while being more productive and accelerating forces which are ravaging our planet as we speak  and making others redundant  oh  the irony of wellbeing when it disregards the impact our actions have on others and other living beings   what is to be done  well  nice question there  really  everyone thinks they have the answer  everyone loves to preach about their own organization  unions  charity  stealing and work  and such  but we are naive and when facing the challenges we face today  we require a level of organization and power that trascends everything we've seen in history  we have to stop a wheel that's spinning so fast and it's so massive it sends anyone trying to make it stop miles away  capitalism has destroyed everything  from mountains  rivers  forests  to collective institutions  entire countries  cultures  do you think your walmart union can stand a chance  don't be naive  we don't need hope  we need results  a conscious analysis on overthrowing capitalism  revolution  not puny reformism or benefits for a small sector of the working class  in the end  automation is coming  and with this remote-work craze going on  how many people will become redundant  how many things will be automated  it's time to think  more than ever  i'm sorry  but unionizing won't come back and work will be treasured and fought for like bread in a famine  the welfare state is shrinking  as soon as the coronavirus crisis passes  we are headed for a new kind of capitalism  with more unemployment  more disparity  more authority  debt  and new climate crises  the climate is really changing faster than expected  which are going to spark migrations  xenophobia  maybe wars  i'm sorry to break your illusions  but we don't eat imagination and no revolution has been made without an analysis of the material conditions and the development of capitalism  imagine if lenin  like him or not he lead a revolution we can not even dream about thanks to ideological constrains  hoped that  after the war  russia became a world power and no revolution would be needed to promote better conditions  at least in the short term    well  that's how i see many posts in here  people hoping that the overlords will grant them ubi  remote work for life  increased benefits  it's the last breathing reflex before drowning  a level of naivety which makes me douby my previous statement about people here being so different  we are more empathetic  no doubt about it  but we can also be prey to delusions  i for one was  we don't need platitudes  easy money schemes and dreams of a cabin in the woods  everyone who preaches these alternatives is not a comrade  they're not paying attention  they're not really aware of societal conditioning  they're just anti-capitalist because it goes well with their minimalist lifestyle  not because they feel or understand the pressure  a true comrade doesn't take your issues as meaningless strivings when you could just  rent a cabin  plant a garden  and some shit like that middle class first-world people say like it was easy or feasible to everyone  hint  it isn't even physically possible and it would be terribly wasteful to give 8 billion people the same suburbian lifestyle  no matter how your dreams look like  this sub has been filled up to the brink with liberal delusions masquerading as socialist alternatives  when one preaches platitudes with no argumentation behind them  or recommends a minimalist lifestyle  remote work  a trade  coding  etc  as the solution to everything  they're doing a huge service to capitalism  capitalism needs that hope  it needs that delusion  too  universities are filled with hopeful people thinking they are changing the world and just end working some other bullshit job just to make profits more often than not  a comrade doesn't say  oh just meditate and quit that job bro  a comrade says  so  how are we going to overthrow capitalism  like it were that pinky and the brain cartoon where pinky said  gee brain  what are we gonna do tonight  and brain replied   the same thing we do every night  try to take over the world  that's comradery  not some useless life plan that's subject to everything but your own volition   i think i've extended myself enough already and i wrote what i wanted to write in the first place  thanks for reading my post   tl dr  capitalist apologists are deluded  afraid and show tendencies which are akin to fascism  capitalism hides behind a veil of justice  which is nowhere to be seen behind it  that resembles the operation of the law of value hiding exploitation and unequal exchange in the production process  not taking into acount reproductive labour and not having any sort of care about the use value of the commodities produced  and a criticism of the liberal tendencies of this sub which sabotage the devising of revolution ,giczlh

321,"Workers are not supposed to be a part of the system, just capitalists.",if you think about it  the need for workers is simply a transitional phase  capitalist endgame is to eliminate workers and consumers alike   true capitalist ascension is automating all workers out of their job and establish capitalist socialism where a chosen few enjoy benefits many shed blood for  the whole production of everything is automated and the output belongs to capitalists   workers without job have no income therefore there is noone to sell products to   this is already happening  you can clearly see the professions that eliminate jobs and sometimes even whole fields are rewarded the most  these professions  programmers  assembly line engineers  robotics  in the end cannibalize themselves too   the future will be truly apocalyptic ,gkx8yn

336,Should I quit?,so this is something that i've been thinking about for awhile  i have a decent paying job that involves a whole lot of travel and practically zero work life balance when i am working  i have many problems with this job if you can't already tell  i've been off for the last month or so due to covid and it's been an eye opening experience  i find that i'm getting back to my old self and not nearly as depressed or stressed out  i've been wanting to quit this job for so long yet i have this lingering fear of not finding another job and going broke again  so i have about 1 years worth of living expenses saved up and i am considering quitting and taking 6-8 months to figure out my next move and work on what i enjoy full time  i realize this is a huge risk and i honestly don't have a guarantee of replacing my income other than the extreme motivation of avoiding homelessness  there aren't many other jobs that pay what i'm getting paid that i've found so there's also a chance of a massive pay cut if i do get desperate and have to get another job  so far i'm on the fuck it side and leaning toward quitting in hopes of using the time to create find something better  but i still have the extreme fear and don't really see any good resources for a solution  so i'm not exactly sure what to do here  what would you do in my shoes  would you also quit  or just keep saving ,gkzhnr

long one so buckle up   let me start of by saying this  i hate working    you got to be in bed early and on time because if you don t you will be tired all day  set that alarm  make sure all your work gear is washed and ready to go   hearing that alarm clock at 5 in the morning or earlier and the first thought that goes through my semi awake mind is  oh not this again   not another day of the same thing that i have been going through day in and day out since i as old enough to work   then you have to force feed yourself as much as you can because you know that you will have to work through that first break just to meet those deadlines that you have    work forces you to associate with people that you would never go near with a hazmat suit  it puts people who are intelligent and puts them with people who still think that they are in high school with all their little clicks  sure there are some people that you like to see  but as soon as management see that  they split you up just because   knowing that you have to face some people and be stuck in a confined space that you cannot escape makes me want to eat a bullet  have you ever sat there and just tried to will that light to fall on you  or go into the bathroom wet your hand and play about with a plug  just to get a day off work or avoid that one asshole you have to work with  to me being electrocuted is better than being at work   managers seem like an undiscovered species of prick that science is yet to understand  how in the name of fuck did people so inadequate and incompetent get in a position of power  i imagine that a manager application form goes something like this   as a manager you must do the following   amp x200b   1  know      how to push every employees buttons when not needed 2  talk      down to everyone who is not management 3  get      everyone to do your job for you and take credit for it only when it goes      right   4  only      do work when a higher manager is looking 5  not      know how to do any of the jobs that everyone does  but tell them how to do      it better anyway  6  take      30min more for all breaks but make sure that everyone is back on time if      not sooner  7  take      as much vacation time as possible 8  hit      on and make passes at all female workers  9  threaten      to fire one employee per week  doesn t matter what for 10  must      love the smell of the bosses shit   when it snowing heavily or it rains so much it floods  you call in and say i cant make it in  they are all like  why cant you  right you are on a warning  you are not a team player  fuck being a team player  no way am i going to work in a snow plough or a dingy  team player my ass    the customer must be treated like a demi-god  a walking avatar of truth that can never be wrong or questioned  they shit silk and piss hugo boss  they fly off the handle at the tiniest most insignificant thing just because they can  just because they know that you cant do shit about it  i could not care less if your burger has the tiniest bit of mayo on it and that your virgin taste buds have been violated  i don t care if tiny tim did not get his crutch on time in london by drone   i hate this  the customer is always right  bullshit  one time a customer couldn t find his jacket when the club was emptying and he kicked up such a huge shit storm about it and everyone was saying sorry this and sorry that  calling him sir and all that pandering crap  turns out when the lights came on it was over his stool  we still had to say sorry and that it was our fault    we are paid a crappy wage to suppress our human feelings and to take shit from people that are truthfully assholes in the purest from of the word  is it any wonder people break down and just can t face the world  we want to just say fuck this and lunge across the counter and punch their lights out   speaking of pay  we have to deal with all of that while getting paid the lowest wage possible  management want a hundred things done all at once and they wanted it done five minutes ago  but for the bare minimum of pay  we get taxed up the ass  we live pay check to pay check and are also expected to be on call 24 7  well how is this  you pay peanuts you get monkeys  minimum wage you get minimum effort   you will spend more that 40 years of your life working for someone or something you hate  by the end of it you have a tiny pension to look forward to then live out the little time that you got left  you will be broken up mentally and physically ill  unable to do whatever you had planned  the only way to live from that moment on is to purge that last 40 years of your life from your brain   but lets get down to the science and it s a grim picture at that   the average american spends 90 000 hours at work over their lifetime   and nearly 60  say their jobs are making them insomniacs   the average american spends more than 100 hours commuting every year   and a quarter of americans say work is their no  1 source of stress   in the us  stress from work is estimated to be the fifth-biggest cause of death   and the majority of americans don't even use all of their vacation days  there were 705 million unused days off last year nationwide   and even when employees do go on vacation  42  of them say they feel the pressure to check in with their offices while they're gone   what the hell are we doing too ourselves  who the hell wants to live like that   but you always get some politian saying how lucky you are to have a job  most people i know have two of the fucking things  two dam jobs  so you are getting double of all the stats above  but i should be grateful right   look i am not lazy  i have been working since i was 16  but it just the constant grind and the ground hog day feeling that i feel it has been ever since    am i the only one who feels this way ,gj6bxf

349,I like my work but I am anti-work because I hate the game. Here is why:,i have a quarterly package that i do each month   it is due on may 31st    the package process this month   i received final materials on thursday and had the whole package completed by friday  except a piece that my co-worker charlotte does  which i also need to incorporate in one cell in excel in my materials   i requested her to do it on thursday   i sent my package without charlotte's piece on friday for preliminary review to my boss regina     on monday morning first thing  i followed up with charlotte so i could add her piece to the final package   she told me that regina's boss wanted to review her piece and was still looking it over   late morning after this on monday  regina  my boss  asked me where i was on the final piece because it needed to be sent to the user by tuesday  i knew this was a lie   i told her that her boss  john  was looking over charlotte's work so that was where the bottleneck is and everything else is done   i also told her i followed up with charlotte already   regina said she'd follow up with john   today finally regina said she'd look over this piece   i guess john never got around to it  and to incorporate it  which i did in 5 minutes   i pdf'd the whole thing and she told me to send to john's boss to get signed  which we do every quarter  i sent around 2pm today and john's boss hadn't sent it back by 5 30pm   so around 5 28pm i emailed regina john and said that the big boss hadn't signed it yet  and did it still need to be sent out by today   john said tomorrow is fine and not to worry   obviously this stupid thing wasn't due early after all  and my boss just assumed i hadn't finished it yet because i was just twiddling my thumbs   when i told her it was actually her boss that was the delay  turns out there really wasn't an early deadline after all   but she was just being one of those micro-managers   note  i am very good at my job and do everything asap and single-handedly solved a major major problem for them that took 3-4 months to unsnarl  which they needed to repeatedly ask me for help on b c they lack excel skills and problem solving skills   so there's no reason to ever question how fast or how well i do things   in fact  i did this pretty early this quarter ,gilq8k

391,I disagree with this stance on work,just got suggested this subreddit  it is dumb  if you stop working you will just feel useless  in the long run  you will likely feel worse  we evolved to want to improve our lives by working so our genetics could be selected and passed on  you might not be very happy with qork  but you are not going to be any happier without it  likely  you will become bored and fall into misery or you will find something else that is just like the work you ran away from -- perceived to be evolutionarily productive  you think you will somehow be happier do you not realize the hedonic cycle that you keep on going through -- this hedonic treadmill  if youre not happy with your happiness  following your instincts and fulfilling some desire is not going to make you any more happy  only genetic engineering has that potential  the only issue with not working is that it is not sustainable  which means that you will be in such a bad situation that you will actually be depressed as fuck because at that point  strong negative reinforcement feelings will kick in because your life has worsened so much and is not sustainable ,gi7olw

400,Work from home will never be the norm,despite what covid showed us  work from home will never ever happen for these reasons alone   1  useless layers of middle managers would have nothing to do  2  employee who finishes their assignments early could use their free time  this is bad for both the employer  can't extract more work  and the system  people would stop being depressed and finding cure in buying useless products  3  rows of employees chained to their desks in vast open floor plan are actually employer's status symbol   i think 3  is actually the main reason  owners are probably well aware of the 80 20 rule  here 80  of work is done by 20  of employees ,gevkhu

409,I hate work from home. I would literally rather do anything other than work from home for this company. This job makes quarantine 1000% worse,my day job has moved to wfh and it is the most stressful god awful thing ever  i hate working from home and i d rather just not work at all   what  you have a job and you get to work from home  what are you complaining about   well  i ve worked for a company for about 2 years on and off that does proxy voting for shareholders and we ve recently moved out of the office and into wfh using our personal computers and cellphones   the office will not provide us with any equipment  it goes through a program that keeps our information secure  if we did not have the necessary equipment or our equipment could not handle the mass amounts of software  we had to spend hours on the international help desk line  and if the issue was not resolved  we were fired    on an everyday basis we have to contact wealthy or middle class shareholders and ask them to vote their proxy for the upcoming shareholder meeting for whatever company  we are not trying to sell them anything as this is not a sales job  most shareholders think we are scam callers so we get yelled at  hung up on  which is actually the nicest thing they can do  mocked  i ve even had some person go so far as scream in my ear as loud as they possibly could  one person put the phone back  told me to hold on a second so they could get their husband or wife who handled the investments on the phone  they never returned  it was basically a  your going to waste my time  i m going to waste yours  i ve been called every name in the book  i ve had jealous wives demand why i want to speak to their husbands  i ve been called  sleaze   slut  and  whore  by those women  i usually just laugh because they re probably jealous of maybe a mistress or something  i d be mad too if i had cobwebs in my vagina but whatever    i had some guy a couple of days ago try to keep a really long conversation with me because he said he was bored in quarantine and it had been a long time since he heard the voice of a female  then i heard a zipper unzip  and i swear i am not making this up  moaning and some wet noise  i just ended the call immediately    i go into work with 2 or 3 emails sometimes about  dispositioning  a call wrong or not logging in on time  then there s the infractions  we have wrap infractions and you can get one of those by taking too long in  wrap time  which is the time after you end a call where you re supposed to take notes on the call  then  you can get  break infractions  which is what happens if you go even one minute over your break or lunch  then there s the  aux infractions  the aux is just a phone code that tells our supervisors what we re doing  we have aux codes for break  lunch  system issues  whatever task we re doing etc etc  you can get both and aux and break infraction for staying in the break aux code too long   we are allowed a whopping 8 minutes  plus obviously lunch and break  of personal time a day  that is time to get a drink of water or go to the bathroom  we are expected to make 30 calls an hour  which doesn t seem like much but when you re working on a really slow  outdated system with angry shareholders you ll be lucky to squeeze 15 an hour out of that  our team lead had the audacity to complain to us today that we were not working fast enough and he expected an improvement today    so yeah  basically my home has become a massive place of stress for me  headaches and anxiety included  i am a big simulation gamer  ts4  cities skylines etc  and this job doesn t even make me want to look at my computer or game anymore in my free time    i m in the process of registering for summer college classes and financial aide for said classes which is stressful in and of itself  i am very close to a bachelors degree  so i d like to squeeze that out here in the next few semesters  due to all the covid stuff  i can t really get a hold of anyone    i have another source of income so if i quit i wouldn t be taking that big of a hit but i would like to save up some more money ,ghq5y9
410,The Oppressive Nature of the Triple Eight Rule, cw  some depressing content and work-related depression   i've made a plethora of content about  depression and capitalism https www youtube com watch v kpfxqha4lyk  on my channel  and i feel a bit guilty for making so many videos that i have to put depression suicide warnings on  my newer content has swayed away from that  but i still like having outlets to discuss these things  so that's why i'm here    you all have most likely heard the triple eight rule at least one time during your lives  it's a semi-common colloquialism and  arguably  a piece of capitalist propaganda to force an anti-worker  reductionist view on the populous  if you haven't heard of it  the triple eight rule is  eight hours of work  eight hours of sleep  eight hours of play    a little background about how this rule becomes more and more painfully obvious to me  i was laid off in late march due to covid  and have now recently returned to my job  to put it lightly  the extra time off was a  godsend  i had time to help one of my boyfriends move into an apartment  clean up my space a bit  which i'm sure made a  certain canadian https carleton ca align wp-content uploads jp-e1528757689361 png  happy  and i was able to relax to an extent that made me feel a little guilty  because i wasn't spending all my time being  productive  like i would at work   now  i'll say right now that not everyone is going to have the same problem as me  and if you have depression   please try meds  sometimes it takes trying quite a few to find one that works  many of my peers believed that my daily suicidal thoughts and occasional crying fits breakdowns might have been the cause of a chemical imbalance  i had tried one medicine at the time that gave me only side effects  and during my time laid off due to covid  i switched meds  my concern  however  was that the cessation  or rather lower frequency of  the  thoughts  might not have been due to the new meds  but instead  because i wasn't at work    returning to work  i realized that it wasn't the meds    now more than ever has it become more painfully obvious to me how very little time we have in our lives to do what we want  my  time anxiety  has become quite a bit more like  red-ataraxia's https www youtube com watch v t1hrhudvqwq  and it's something that's hard to distract myself from  i see my full time job as a leech on my energy and time  the triple eight rule doesn't account for time spent doing work-related activities  commute  getting ready  etc  i get up to go to work at 8  i get off at 5  and by the time i arrive and home and am done having dinner  it's already 6  if i go to bed at 10  or 11 if i'm feeling risky  then i only really get 4  maybe  5 hours of time to myself  around  half  of what is proposed in the absurd  triple eight  rule   does it not run people ragged knowing that they have so little time to fit what they want to into such time  i understand scheduling  but i shouldn't have to waste time putting effort into efficiently spending my free time  it's  leisure  why schedule it like it's  work   it's ridiculous that one must surrender most of their day's time and energy to get the  privilege  to survive within a capitalist society  i have to wake up  eat  go to sleep  and work on someone else's time  i hypothesize that people are more spontaneous than that  some days we have more of a capacity to work  some days we have less  the system does not care about this  because we are flesh machines  we are expected to work at constant  unwavering rates   my biggest and only life goal right now is trying to escape the 40 hour workweek  and considering this is such a huge gamble in my life  it causes ample anxiety  i have plans  but there is no guarantee they will succeed  and even then  it will still pain me to see my friends and comrades work in jobs equally  if not more  oppressing than the one i'm trying to escape    i've learned that i won't get the easy way out  i've tried meds  i've tried therapy  i've talked to at least a dozen people who have their depression under control  i've shared my thoughts on r mutualaid  i've tried meditation and similar distractions  i've tried absurdism  i can understand those who survive for the revolution  or those who survive for who they love  and while i find both revolution and loved ones paramount  it still just doesn't keep me from wanting to commit the final no-no  i'm that broken     it won't help me hurdle this wall  i cannot accept the life given to me if the 40 hour workweek is a necessary condition  i am weak    work has broken me  truthfully  like many other people of this mindset  i don't want to die  i want an escape    i'm not sure if this kind of post belongs here  and if mods see fit  you can delete this  i understand    unfortunately  i can't help but scream these morbid thoughts into the voids i have access to ,gi5xtf

412,employer screwed me over with unemployment,me coming on here for consolation because my job cheated me out of  1800 worth of those pandemic checks which was supposed to compensate for my reduced hours and now i'm being forced back to full-time even though 1  90  of the entire building is still on furlough 2  other depts  are being allowed to bring people back on short hours 3  my dept  for some reason is having a hard time bringing our people back because management is fucking incompetent and is too scared to make a fucking phone call to the people on furlough to come back 4  they're telling me and my boss that they're trying to  maximize the hours in the dept  before bringing more people back which is why we both have to be full-time  which is bullshit bc of  2  and 5  they only made this decision when my boss and i found out that i wasn't eligible for the  600 pandemic check and that's why i haven't been getting anything for the majority of fucking april because apparently they made me work just enough hours to not be eligible for it   i know it's based off last year's income or whatever which i also think is stupid because what the fuck does that have to do with what i'm making right now  but now i'm being forced to full-time  so where's the fucking 3 weeks worth of  600 pandemic checks that's supposed to compensate for my reduced hours  did i just fucking work those 3 weeks for nothing  those paychecks i got those weeks wasn't even enough to cover a trip to the fucking grocery store  will i see that money or am i supposed to just lick their boots and go back to full-time even though my whole fucking department isn't back yet bc they're still on furlough  i asked the hr dude about this and all he can tell me that it's a  business decision  lol okay  also why do they get to make the fucking decision instead of my fucking dept  manager  my dept  manager literally told me if it was up to her she would've had me work 16 hours and just called another person in to work 20 hours since work was picking back up  there's no reason why us two should be the only ones in the entire fucking building being full-time busting our asses while the rest of our dept  gets to stay home on furlough collecting the  600    amp x200b   sorry if this is super lengthy but my job has honestly just been a pain in the ass about this whole thing and obviously they don't give a shit about their employees  it just infuriates me and honestly i was gonna quit around april and find another job before fucking covid-19  until my job trapped me with staying for unemployment only to screw me over with it and now they want me to go back to normal even though they clearly exploited the shit out of me  i'm this close to just walking out and never coming back but i also can't because i do need the money  i just don't know how long i can do this anymore because this is fucking with me mentally and i honestly don't know what to do cause there's no jobs out there ,gi2xju

Covid-19 pandemic just made it worse.",context  i am asian  specifically  singaporean  singapore is a pressure-cooker society ruled by boomer logic and the relentless growth for prosperity  it is exceedingly difficult to be your own boss  so most of us are salaried workers    now  i just graduated from college 2 years ago  majoring in the humanities  my first job was manageable but mediocre  my boss was inept  he couldn't even operate the office-scanner after 30 years in service  a micro-manager  he would scrutinize your reporting time and the time you went home  and someone who offered zero guidance but was quick to blame you when things went wrong  he sure had his nice points  but at work i was quite overwhelmed  in addition  i had to front customers that were rude and self-entitled  i have been called an idiot for merely communicating policy positions and for being unable to accede to the customer's ridiculous requests  my boss just asked me to suck it up    i lasted for 1 year 7 months in that company  during that time  i constantly prayed for a job change  i finally got one and i tendered my resignation immediately    on paper  my new job sounds like everything i wanted  opportunities for greater exposure and the opportunity to apply what i like doing best - research and writing  the first 3 months were alright  and then it rapidly turned to shit  i can never seem to satisfy the expectations of my new boss  i can have multiple submissions for a single task  and it will only return with curt comments to change this or that  it is frustrating    worse of all  my boss is very hurtful  she is the kind that does not mince her words and it is causing me to have multiple episodes of anxiety attacks  i am trying my best  and she still rubs caustic shit like  please buck up or  it is very difficult to assign you with more work until i see improvement  by the way  she is the first ever person to tell me that my writing and research skills are not up to scratch  not to blow my own trumpet  but my professors back in college and ex-bosses have praised my flair in writing  what a fucking bitch  6 months in  and i am looking for another job  sent out 80  job applications  and in this covid-19 pandemic it is understandable why replies are slow  but urghh    talked to that bitch about it  and she sounded defensive  she basically told me to level up  and that her unreasonable expectations about work are  justified   my parents simply do not understand my job woes  unlike much of the western world  singaporean singles generally live with their parents until the age of 35 or when they get married - whichever is earlier  as i mentioned earlier  singaporean society is still largely ruled by boomer logic - get a job at a prestigious firm and park yourself there for 40 years  you are not allowed to leave unless there are better tangible benefits  higher pay  bad bosses  too bad  just suck it up  its better to die at your bosses' hands than to die of joblessness  when i wanted to leave my first job  i got a big fat scolding  and when i voiced my intention to leave my second job  my friends looked at me and gave me judgmental looks  huh  what  changing jobs again    i have never felt so alone and scared  i am currently working from home and even then  i dread opening my inbox  even though i have to  at some point    i am aggressively applying for jobs  but there is also another fear - what if i land into another cesspool    i am so scared  i have never felt so suicidal  even when i faced rough patches in school  help ,gi23wo

428,In praise of idleness,the work ethic is a relative recent invention  it has its roots in the protestant reformation   the tudor authorities were hostile to idlers  monks were considered to be lazy  it gathered force in the industrial revolution when the mill owners required a docile and punctual workforce to toil in the dark satanic mills  that s when punctuality became a matter of essential morals  and most recently silicon valley has invented its own version  unless your side hustle has a side hustle  then you are going to fail in life    earlier societies  though  were not so work-oriented  the ancient greek philosophers insisted on the ideal of  schole  or cultivated leisure  for a happy life  and even the brutal romans believed that civilised people should enjoy a decent portion of otium  life was not all about business  they called that negotium    in the middle ages  the great creative projects of the cathedrals were carried out voluntarily in people s spare time  guilds were against overwork as it might give you an unfair advantage over your brother in the guild  and there were multiple holy days and feast days when working was prohibited    some are born idle  some achieve idleness and right now  a lot of people are having idleness thrust upon them  and many of them rather like it      from this article   https unherd com 2020 04 how-lockdown-helped-us-rediscover-laziness ,gesz2m

Why are so many people okay living on shit wages for meaningless work?",i just graduated from university with a degree in finance and one internship under my belt  i got paid a pretty good amount but i hated the job  it was in capital markets  think investment banking  i've never really known what i wanted to do as a career aside from sports but that didnt work out for me unfortunately  so i went to school for something  practical  after i stopped playing club  but now im realizing finance isnt even that practical and the jobs dont pay enough for the high cost of living of being in the city where finance jobs are  so theres too many graduates  and not enough jobs  and i hate the industry anyways  i cant even think of anything worth doing and im getting stressed out being at home with nothing to do and having my parents breathing down my neck  i feel like ive lost all the autonomy by moving back home  i keep applying to finance jobs even though i hate them all   anyways i started getting into music about a year ago and now im thinking i'd want to pursue that maybe  but thats just as hard as my first dream of professional sports  i dont know why i cant be realistic  it frustrates me a lot  i wish i could just be happy to do a regular job like other people but i cant  what do i do  im not even good enough yet for sure  but its the one thing i can look forward to in a way  my other interest is exercise and fitness but thats also super oversaturated industry and personal trainers dont get paid anything  and god knows we dont need another fitness youtuber   i need advice on what to do with my finance degree  and how to pursue music along side whatever job i get  i feel so disillusioned and hopeless  i see all these people doing regular jobs and wonder how they do it  but i also see successful musicians and youtubers and entrepreneurs and wonder how they got there   sorry for the ramble but how do i figure out what i should be doing and how do i go after it while havign enough for rent  and food and necessities  im so burnt out and miserable and i just feel hopeless  slaving for 50k a year after a degree and working 9-5 while living with roommates and paying 1200 month on rent simplt isnt what i envisioned for myself   i need a way out ,gfii9y
470,"The Actual True, Really Real Story of How The Bureau of Labor Statistics Made 8 Million Unemployed Workers Disappear",so  the actual true  really real unemployment rate  according to bureau of labor statistics own methodology is almost 20  -- 19 3  -- but the bls itself reported it as 14 7  yesterday even though they know that figure is wrong  again  according to their own methodology   i am not making this crazy shit up  the bls actually reported an unemployment figure they knew was wrong  knowing it was wrong  this is some insane  fucking crazy shit    so  how did this happen   well the bls admits in its release yesterday that 7 5 million workers reported they were  absent from work  the category   absent from work  means they are still working  just not at work  so  according the bls they are not unemployed  the bls knew this might happen  so they told their people to reclassify workers who said this in another category  as  absent from work due to coronavirus related business closure  which would make this 7 5 million workers unemployed temporarily   instead of 22 5 million workers being unemployed for the period  there would be 30 million workers unemployed   well  the correction never happened  that's right  the correction never happened  the bls didn't correct the numbers  instead  they reported that 14 7  of the labor force was unemployed  not 19 3  that was the headline that went out to the media  8 million people just disappeared from the ranks of the unemployed just like that   that story is here   the new york review of books  the pandemic jobless youthquake https www nybooks com daily 2020 05 08 the-pandemic-jobless-youthquake ,ggfqcs

I don't want to lose my unemployment.,hello comrades   so when the virus got bad  i voluntarily took time off work since my hours got slashed  felt like there was no point in risking my health anyway  and i took the quarantine seriously  but i'm going back to work on may 18th  which i feel is premature but i don't really have a choice  it's company's orders    i wouldn't be balking if it meant i was going back to the same exact work situation  but i'm not  i previously used to work in elementary schools for about 40 hours a week  since the schools i worked for are now closed  i'll now be getting around 10 hours a week in a different setting  same company role  i absolutely cannot live on that alone  point blank   bummed because i'm actually financially secure for the first time since i started in this field nearly 3 years ago  it's been  so damn nice  not having to worry about money and getting paid a living wage  i hate the idea of going back to my previous lifestyle of always having money problems  makes me angry just thinking about it   but i've heard that if your usual hours have been cut due to the virus  you still may qualify for unemployment  but how exactly does it work in the other direction  e g  i started as completely unemployed but am now going back with reduced hours  not just reduced hours to begin with  is anyone familiar with what i have to do to keep getting unemployment payments  i'd expect some of the money to be reduced  of course  but i'm just extremely unfamiliar with the overall system  since my searches on this topic are leading to dead ends  i would like some advice on how to keep afloat if anyone has any  i'm in california  if that matters    thanks guys  stay safe out there ,ggpesz

475,Weird Unemployment Question Ohio,hello all   so after my employer kept saying we weren't going to get furloughed guess what   we got a day's notice that we were getting furloughed and were not allowed to use our vacation time   i had told my employer about 6 months previous that i would be moving in the next six months   however hadn't said anything since   so  my wife gets a job out of state and we are moving at the exact same time i started working from home and then furloughed   soooo  i now live in another state and i am tentatively scheduled to go back to work on the 26th of may   because of the job market  i haven't found a job in north carolina yet   i have never not given a two weeks' notice but i am kinda stuck   i know on the 25th  i am going to say i am not returning to work   i am assuming that i can kiss my unemployment check goodbye at that point   i am also assuming there is no work around    thanks for reading ,ghg0um

478,[Idea] I think you would all enjoy working..., if it wasn't so kafkaesque  it took me a while of practical thought to get here  but i'm logically here with my train of thought  instinctively humans love to feel resourceful  as it is a trait carried to us from our neanderthal forefathers  however given the state of affairs that exist today  between wealth inequity and the lack of communal presence  related to one s job  we have a big portion of the population  myself included  who are anti-work    however  we still have people that enjoy playing games like  the sims  or  animal crossing  we have people that love slice of life shows  such as  the devil is a part timer  a big portion of the population who are anti-work  also enjoy the idea of work from afar  but why   i recently watched  this https www youtube com watch v ahd2rmhcbfm  video discussing a theory about  animal crossing  in summary  the main character is dead and you are in purgatory  the theory is is partly evidenced through the ideas that life within animal crossing is very simple  work is simple  bills are simple  owning a home is simple  and life within animal crossing is simple because it is viewed through the objective lens of a  deceased  child   kafka poses that through excessive bureaucratic burdens  people are left confused in paperwork  we don t know what's going to happen next  nor where to turn  u blom95  and we are stuck in this jungle of complex ideas with little ideological substance    gone are the days of communally working as the towns blacksmith  or the state s teacher  present  are the days of working as someone s  senior insurance claims adjuster  woo   the aforementioned ideas parallel and describe the anti-work situation today  work is no longer a simple lifestyle  but at best  complicated  the population of anti-work is not a lazy population  but rather those who desire a simpler work life ,ghnzeh

486,I would be better off getting laid off (Rant),my company is cutting costs so they reduce our hours saying they decided to do that instead of laying off people during this time of crisis  so then people started applying for partial unemployment which would help a lot thanks to the extra  600 you get a week  however some people were asked to work an extra day  still not normal hours  but that made them ineligible for unemployment benefits  when they brought this up to management so they could get their hours moved around  ie maybe work one full week then a short week so they could at least get unemployment for the short week  management decided to increase everyone's hours so no one will complain and now no one is eligible for unemployment  i am a temp so i don't even have any benefits  i would be better off just getting laid off completely and benefit from the unemployment  also we had 3 positive cases of covid-19 so we are risking our health going into work  management had a chance to help out their employees at no cost to the company but they decided to screw us all instead ,getw8f

497,My first and worst job,this is my first job ever and is probably the reason i will never work at a restaurant this is on my phone so sorry for bad spelling   i got my first job about two years ago  i was in the middle of my jr year in high school  i felt bad asking my mom for cash cause i wanted to buy my own stupid shite  so when my mother told me that the restaurant she works at just made a deal with an airplane company to create over priced food  i was down for it as well as occasionally prepping food  my job was simple  the company would call my boss and tell him how many of whatever food they needed that day  then we would come in to put them into containers which would be driven to the airport  the pay was good at least for me  it was 12 dollars an hour   i was told to get their the next day  when i got there however the working conditions were horrible  first off we worked in the storage room near the food prepping area  second the plastic makeshift tables were too low and would hurt your back  third problem was that we were timed and since the demand was too high i'm talking hundreds to thousands  other workers including my mother  would have to take time out of their day without compensation  to help  the final problem was my boss  he was generally a piece of shit who acted like he owned the place and would rarely help thank dagon he got fired for incompetence   this would go on for two years  which got harder as one day i came to work only to find everyone but me quit  so for some of those two years  i was  making  hundreds of raviolis  sandwiches  quiches  by myself  from the beginning of the day   the last time i went to work was last halloween  100 sandwiches which wasn't too bad  i'm still waiting for them to call me back but due to covid i'm basically out of the job   my advice  work anywhere but restaurants  if you have any questions feel free to ask ,ghmpyx

507,quitting my job during the pandemic,as the title says  i'm about to quit my job during the pandemic and i've never felt so free      my brother sent me this sub last night and i have been devouring all your stories he thought i should post mine  so here it goes       so  i've been at my current job 2 years  i was hired as kitchen staff at  14 hour and since then  i have gotten pretty decent raises  also  i've got to explain my payroll a bit before i continue  so for kitchen  that's my main position  the position i was hired for  but sometimes i clock in as  barista  for  9 hr but that is not often and only for an hour or two at a time  i am the only one at work that has two different ways to clock in  with different pay rates for each       the women who work with me all clock in as  barista  and all started at  9 hr but since they've all been working here for years  they have obviously gotten raises  too  so they make probably  11-12 hr       okay  so now the main point of the post      our cafe closed back in march for 6 weeks went into work that monday  everything normal  come home that night to an email saying we will be closed until our stay-at-home order expires  one thing my boss said was  currently  xxxx s is financially sound and we determined we do not have any employees that depend on xxxx s wages in the next few weeks to make their rent or feed their family   okay  alright that's mostly true because its high schoolers and retired soccer moms i work with but for me  yeah  i kinda depend on my check  it just seemed pretty tone deaf on her part to add that    anyway  i thoroughly enjoyed my time off  it felt like this is what everyone's life should be like  basically i went through a huge awakening where i realized that working for someone else is definitely not what i want to be doing with the rest of my life    then two weeks ago  i get the dreaded email we are reopening  i audibly groaned when i read that groaned even more once i read what my boss sent me  privately        hi coldmoon      also  i plan to have you as a  barista  starting out   but would like to have you do the prep for the first hours of the day  we can discuss more this next week  just wanted to let you know what i m thinking    excuse me  what       so basically  i have returned to work with a paycut but with the same responsibilities i had before  and i know i am the only one who received one  because i asked my coworkers  and it makes sense too  because i am the only one with two ways to clock in so this was the easiest option for my boss who seems to think she's saving a shit ton of money by doing this       i am done  all the loyalty i had to this business  went out the window when i received that email  i know my worth  i am one of her best employees  she has said it herself  and so it just feels very much like manipulation  like she thinks i am loyal enough to stay with her through anything  she thinks she's pulling the wool over my eyes and that i'm none the wiser       but i've had it  i don't care anymore  i don't want to make blended caramel mochas for the karen who refuses to wear her mask inside  fuck coffee  too  i quit drinking caffeine during my time off and it was one of the best decisions i've made       since returning  i've never been more repulsed by our customers  people aren't tipping as well because they think that calling in curbside isn't us  waiting on them  people aren't following the distancing rules we've implemented  they aren't wearing masks  some are saying that the preventative measures we've taken are  too much  its insane  i don't want to go to work now  i don't feel safe  i feel very exposed and it doesn't help that i feel like this is all for nothing  i am coming to work to risk my life and the lives of my loved ones because some idiot can't go a couple more weeks without their oat milk latte  just fuck right off  we shouldn't be open  point blank period  no cafe should be open right now      the service industry isn't for me  my dream is to buy some land  learn to farm and have a self-sustaining property that i can live off of  i've been looking for biodynamic homesteading courses to take when i finally quit  i really am grateful for the time i had in quarantine  it gave me a whole new perspective    now  the only thing i have to do is quit not sure how i'm going to do that but i cannot wait ,ghnzp4

510,So what's the plan?,hey everyone   i just stumbled upon this wonderful community after some heavy-handed google searching and i've got to say  i am curious to know more   i posted on here earlier today with a bit of a rant that will give you some insight into my story and where i'm coming from  so i won't repeat myself too much  you can check that post out if you'd like  with that being said  my sheer rage over how the us is handling this pandemic has boiled over  and i feel like my eyes have been opened to how absolutely laughable the state of affairs has become   the fact that the government tossed a  1200 check in all directions is bad enough  because let's be honest  who can really live on  1200 for an entire month   i know i can't  and i get paid a bit less than that at my current job    i don't see how the american people can be so up in arms over this meager  stimulis  check  and in the same breath call us essential workers  heroes  when mere months ago  they would've spit in our face for taking too long to make them a god damned hamburger and claimed we don't deserve what little money we are getting paid    now all of a sudden they're all a bunch of kiss-asses because even though they're out of work  at least they can sit on their ass and order a bunch of saturated fats that people like me get to deliver to their doorstep  all the while potentially exposing ourselves to the virus   and you have the god damned nerve to thank us  and deem us essential   we aren't  karen  what we are  is the portion of the population that don't have the luxury of taking leave from our  essential  jobs to self-quarantine and ride this thing out  while you complain that  1200 isn't enough for the month  we are paid roughly the same amount when we're working anyway   i've been running in the rat race for a long while now  probably not as long as most of you  i'm only 23  but every day feels like a year at any crapshoot job i've had  and something is obviously  and visibly wrong with our system   how do i get out  what's the secret  i don't want to be a rich man  all i need are the essentials  plus some wifi so i can keep making angry posts on the internet like this one   where do i start ,gdlpqt

540,Anybody else working low paying/skilled jobs?,i don't know where else to post  i found this subreddit and i feel like a lot of it lines up with how i think  i guess i'm here for some support  to see if there's anybody else like me  i'm 27  it feels like everyone around me is doing ok in terms of work  all of my main friends and family members my age have seemed to find either a career or a decent paying job  i'm still looking for that   ever since i was in high school i had no idea of what i wanted to do  and still don't  i have had many aspirations but all my adult life i've been crippled by anxiety  depression and chronic pain  my anxiety specifically has prevented me from seizing upon several good opportunities in the job market  i don't have any real skills or experience  i have worked service and retail jobs and currently drive a truck and deliver snacks    with the way things are looking i will have to settle for a customer service job or go back to school  i have been dreading the thought of doing either  i really don't like dealing with people all that much and school scares me  i really consider myself to be a smart person  just not booksmart when it comes to hard skills  i've always been a failure in math and sciences  two areas that are very important  i'm at a crossroads where i really don't know what to do    i hate working and most of all  i detest work culture especially here in north america  i hate how people judge you based on what work you do  i hate how competitive school and work is to the point where job requirements are laughable  browsing online i see ads for jobs paying 15 bucks an hour  canada  but a degree and very specific experience is needed  it's absolute nonsense    i guess the main thing that scares me is the perception and my self esteem  taking a low wage customer service job would be a blow to my self esteem  i'd also be looked down upon constantly and talked down to  i was fine with working at a grocery store in my early 20s but i'm now 27      i don't have high standards  i'd be absolutely content with 40k a year salary wise  i currently make close to 50k but i might have to quit soon due to chronic pain issues  all i'd like is a job that pays ok  that's it  i have everything else in terms of a girlfriend  parents  friends  car etc  i live at home and am comfortable  however everything in this world revolves around jobs  if i don't have a job i lose almost all of that    i really don't know what i'm trying to say here but i hope people here understand ,ge58fw

554,Passion Is Privilege,i still remember the first time an interviewer asked me the  passion  question  dumbfounded  i stumbled my way through a response  while thinking   what do  you  care  i show up  i do what you tell me  you give me money  only now have i figured out why the passion angle rankles so    when you're growing up on the south side of town  you can only afford to be passionate about not starving to death and not getting shot on your way home from school  only when you start moving up the maslow hierarchy can you afford to pursue pastimes unrelated to survival  and that's why the  passion  trope grates on me  it's full of coded privilege    asking what someone's passionate about serves two purposes  first  the person must have sufficient means to pursue a passion  choosing your job for pragmatic reasons signals low ses and limited options and we don't want  those people  here  let's face it  darling  taking what you can get is  soooo  plebian   once you pass that test  the interviewer must now screen for the  right sort  of passion  after all  it wouldn't do to have a theater kid hanging out in an office full of classic rock fans  would it now   this happened to me  i can still remember the interviewer's disappointed  dismissive tone when i told him the last concert i'd attended was given by my favorite broadway singer  no  we've got to make sure you're  one of us  that you're  our type of person   the passion trope is really not much more than a way of screening for privilege  i hope that once our economy starts resetting itself  we'll do away with this silly  not to mention discriminatory  practice ,gbrev7

They would rather have me work than be safe and not catch Corona.,so some background info  i m a 21 year old guy that still lives with my parents and currently work at a grocery store  i want nothing more than to move out but of course  you can t support yourself as a grocery store employee but i m apparently a  hero  an impoverished hero  apparently hero s are only worth 14 50 an hour  sure i could get my own cheap little apartment  i live in an expensive city  if i do nothing but work but that s not a life worth living to me  i value my freedom and happiness over everything else  and ever since i can remember my parents have been work horses  can t even count the number of holidays my mom missed because of work and my dad routinely works 60 hours a week so we obviously aren t on the same page on the topic  it always felt like they care more about money than their own kids    anyways  like i said i work at a grocery store and i m getting worried about catching the virus  i think about quitting every day cuz the risk isn t worth the reward  the problem is my parents won t let me quit and  i live under their roof so i have to do as they say  i m already someone that can t stand working bullshit  meaningless  tedious  customer service based jobs so that isn t helping either  and on top of that  it sucks seeing all these people protesting because they want to work when i don t want to work and yet i have to  it s so backwards and really pisses me off  the one time in my life where i would get an opportunity to be unemployed and nobody can say shit about it  and i m an essential worker  frustrating as hell  i m not even a lazy person  i would say i m the best worker in my department  but the american work culture is inhumane and i really don t wanna participate at a time like this  at the very least we should be getting more than the people on unemployment    some people are prolly saying  just quit  fuck what your parents say  but they would have no problem kicking me out  that s there most common threat towards me and my siblings  anytime we would do something they don t like they would always say  you re lucky we don t kick you out  they would say this stuff to us even as kids  it honestly made me stop trusting them and i don t open to them at all now that i m an adult    i don t even know what the point of this post is but i need to vent ,gdissn

594,"""she is, for the most part, a good boss.""",my boss tapes people s mouths shut during meetings  by alison green on eebruary  45 2020   a reader writes   recently started my first  real  job in a small office  eight people  he have strategy meetings every morning for about 30-45 minutes  by boss is really intolerant of bad ideas  the keeps a tape dispense on the table by her chair and whenever someone suggests something that she thinks is dumb  she will feel off a piece of making tape and pass it to them  at which point they are required to put it over their mouths so they cannot contribute any more  bad  ideas for the rest of the meeting   heedless to say  the first time i saw this  i was shocked  but my workers don t seem too gathered by it  or maybe they just don t want to complain  i m not sure  by boss can be kind scar   by issue with this is that enforcement of the rule seems arbitrary  it depends entirely on her mood  some days  no one will  get tapped  but other days  if she is feeling particularly sour most of us  if not everyone  will end up  tapped  and the meeting is just her dictating to us   is this normal  i m thinking not  but does that make it inherently bad  is there something i should do  other than this idiosyncrasy  it is mostly a great job and she is  for the most part  a good boss  ,gcz3uh

614,Thinking about excuses for missing work and how individualistic they are,when i was a freshmen in college  my friend was having surgery or a test for cancer  it was years ago  so i'm fuzzy on the details but i know it was important  and she didn't have anyone to be there for her while it happened  i worked in my college's special collections library  none of the work i did was time sensitive - it was things like scanning pages of a book or reading old letters to figure out how to file them    anyway  i asked for time off so i could be there for my friend and my supervisor said no and looked at me like i was an idiot  this was a surprise for me at the time  but i've since learned how unforgiving the working world is about missing work  even if it's not vital  i just think it's so fucked up and it doesn't make any sense  if your best friend or a partner loses a parent   you have to be there for them  i don't understand why that's not seen as a legitimate excuse for missing work   you guys know what i mean  like we're accountable to each other  but work only sees us as accountable to work  it's so fucking soulless ,gdy86a
615,(Long rant) All my talents are worthless to the Job Market(TM). Looking for thoughts from people who share my values?,sorry  i didn't really know how to title this post  longtime lurker  but i've been hesitant to reach out to the internet for some reason   an odd crippling fear it'd come back to me somehow  this is going to be kinda disjointed  i just need to get it out and see what happens   i posted here because i feel all of reddit's normal  advice  channels would just tell me i'm not being practical  wasted a bunch of time  and should pull up my boot straps    about me  i'm between 20-30-something  no degree  live with my wife and her two family members    i've worked at a public-facing help desk in nevada for too many years now  it pays well enough for being a part-time job  but dealing with a very-regularly nutty public has spurred plenty of chronic anxiety depression over the years  i'm constantly looking for my way out   the idea was for it to be a stepping stone until i could really figure myself out and establish my own way in life  it's the very definition of dead-end  because i have no degree  there's literally a hard ceiling directly above me  that's it    in real life i'm a 3d artist and studying development on my own  where i've built a number of creative skills over the years  but i'm in this awkward  valley  where it seems like none of them are to a level where they are  worth  anything    point being  i've always hated this job  but we got lucky in that they continued to pay us while we sheltered in place due to the pandemic  the governor's orders are the only thing holding them back from putting us in danger for  wave 2   at first  it was a total dream  i got to stay home and work on my art as best i could  the hope was that this was all i needed to be up and running  i could get a portfolio and maybe start selling my art so i'd never work in another  business environment  again    maybe when they tell me i can come back to work i can just say 'thanks but no thanks  i'm sure somebody else needs it more than i do  good luck with that   but i was just fooling myself  i think   well  if the lockdown persists past late may  they'll stop paying us  then comes layoffs and furloughs  i hate this job anyway and i don't want to wait around to be booted to the unemployment system  which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't completely overloaded right now   so  i thought maybe i'd finally get around to putting together my personal website  i'd find a place i could at least deal with working while i figured everything out but then i realized  what would i put on it  i feel like i have nothing to offer  like i'm a joke    job searching is the most depressing thing in the world because i feel like i could step up from  customer service  and finally put my skills to use  but i'm expected to already be some kind of master  i'm not a  specialist  or an  engineer  for anything  so what  am i basically doomed until i go from 0 to  nailed it  all of a sudden   i want to make an  anti-resume  stating that i'm a sociable polymath looking for an environment to cooperate in  rather than be someone else's  people product  but i still feel like i don't have anything  tangible  to offer    time's ticking  i simply don't have enough time to  develop myself as an artist  and somehow turn that into cash all of a sudden  i would go back to school just to get a  see  i told you i can do shit  degree  but my wife is currently in university and that's about all we can manage right now   if i search for jobs  i come up empty and i just burned a ton of time i could have been building up artwork  but also i'm just too slow at artwork to have a sizable portfolio or catalogue or whatever ready to go   how the hell do find my voice when i'm constantly up against the wall    basically   nevada's pretty damn unfriendly to co-ops and anarchists by its very nature  seeing as what is settled  here is basically a capitalist cash-farm colony  i don't know where to escape to  and i don't know how to put my existing abilities to use for support before i'm kicked into another  service-industry  hellhole   what kind of work out there is friendly to fellow anti-corporates   thanks for reading  thanks for being here  appreciate you all   ,gdnon5
616,Anyone else prefer working until they have a bit of savings and then jump ship?,37 years old  this has been my habit for a while now  i just can't stand being tied to a place  faking enthusiasm  while pretending all the petty work politics are serious  oh  and pretending i actually respect management and the idea of making someone else wealthy with the time i'll never get back  it makes me sad how many people are hoodwinked by this game    my father is 63 and spent his life in the military  after being on active duty for a while and then teaching he moved to va just outside of dc and spent the past decade driving 1 5 hrs  each way  to an 8-hour job  he's on 12 pills a day because he sits in front of a steering wheel  then a computer  and then the tv with a full tray of fattening goodies  heart issues  knee issues  back issues  constant emotional issues he's never been able to solve  but when he retires a few years from now  he's  definitely  going to start living       i like having a few thousand   to live off of then i go wwoofing or move abroad for a while  even when the work is easy i just can't wait to have a backpack and a camera so i can keep exploring  i always  think  i'm done traveling and i'm ready to do things  right  but then i settle into an apartment and in a few months i'm so over it ,gdh34c

619,"The work problem and the workplace problem are linked, but they are not the same",i have come to realize  reading some interesting posts in here that i used to mash up two distinct problems  the work problem  and the workspace problem    although they are linked  and they certainly affect us in similar ways  when is aamir symptom of the other  but more importantly the solutions to the workplace problem do not address the work problem   i came to realize that as an advocate of freelancing i was misled and misleading people  freelancing is a solution to the workplace problem  it addresses the problems of having a manager  being accountable for the time spent on whatever activity  having to go to places  being told at what time to eat  go to the office  and go home   it doesn t address the fact that the vision of the future used to be one without work thanks to automation  increased efficiency  the better understanding of our needs and our environment  it doesn t address the fact that while we are enjoying those progresses  through the concentration of wealth  work hasn t been made somethings one freely chooses to do come out with something we all need to fight for in order to sustain ourselves and meet our basic needs   i do not have a solution  just felt like the honest move on my part to say out loud what my conscience stumbled upon   i wish us all good luck  and to keep being compassionate even when we feel enraged ,ge9q29
