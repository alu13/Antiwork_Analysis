0,I actually love being unemployed,you know what  i'm not going to lie  i love being unemployed  sure  the money is a little tight  and i had to sell some stuff which i haven't used  my old amp  a guitar  and a mixer  i'd prefer to have that stuff  but i couldn't continue with my job  and my emergency fund didn't cover an extra month off    that being said  i  love  staying at home and doing what i want to do  i go to the gym and actually feel refreshed and content because i don't need to immediately head to work afterwards  i can study something which i actually love studying  and can see myself progressing every day  a second language  i feel well-rested  more extroverted  and more loving to the people around me    i think there is a misconception that the unemployed don't want to work  i tutored for a week  and plan to tutor next week as well  i really like working  but my preference leans more towards 15 hours a week than 50 hours a week    honestly  i have a substitute teaching job  and i'm a little nervous that one day i'll have to step up to be a full-time teacher to support my family  it's so stressful  i won't have to time to learn what i want to learn and i won't have time to excercise to be healthy    i am praying for some monumental thing like a windfall to allow me to work at a more leisurely pace more of a marathon than a constant sprint  i don't care about the status of work  and i don't care about making way more money than i need  hell  all i really need is my computer  food  and my apartment and i'm happy   when i first became unemployed for a month out of university  i felt this enormous stigma  like it was a tribal society  and everyone was pushing me away from the central fire  i don't feel like that anymore  i feel like  this  is the way for me to live  leisurely  happy  content    i've studied about 3-4 hours every day consistently during my unemployment i love working  but i don't love trading my labor  and my life  to a corporation with foreign leaders  ,3i7ksa
1,I am anxious all the time because of the pressure my family puts on me to get a job...,they shame me and see me as lazy  is it so bad that i would rather spend my time rather than sell it to someone else    i don't see myself as leeching off society since i don't take benefit payments  i would rather save it for someone that needs them  any advice on how to get over this crippling feeling of anxiety  ,3hzmjb

3,C'mon over to /r/Technostism for in-depth discussions of how we can get to a post-labor society!,i mean  there are only a few such deep discussions as of yet  but that's only because this theory is still being worked on    r technostism is an economic system where people profit directly from droid labor ,3i4hpo
