0,Brainwashed people...,i always wondered  why is it that people in this  and most other societies in the past  have always regarded hard work as something admirable - and why is it that they shame those who find most of it horrible and disgusting  an endless drudgery without respite   hell  i might even be able to tolerate it if it wasn't for the fact that most of my work's worth goes to some rich asshole at the top i think it is horribly degrading   honestly  how do people get this brainwashed - how can't they see that they're being exploited - why do they pride themselves on being serfs  it has to be some kind of stockholm syndrome ,6h6jxi
1,Anyone interested in working together to help spread awareness?,hey all     so  for quite a while i ve been disillusioned with the status quo when it comes to western  capitalistic based politics and frequently i see on my own social media  many right and far right leaning propaganda  viral videos and images that i don t believe tell a balanced story and focus on economic theories i find that are deeply flawed  such as trickle down economics     i ve started to sketch a bit of a road map of a collective that we can form  to help generate our own succinct content that can be easily consumed that can help spread awareness of alternatives to the right and far right economic and social policies  the goal is the creation of mature  non-gimmicky content that helps spur independent thought  action and pressure on various elected officials      the focus will be on   viral images spread via social media  facebook  twitter  instagram  etc  videos created and uploaded  youtube  facebook videos  curation and generation of discussion      will this be in support of a particular political ideology  party or government system   not specifically however the focus will be on primarily left leaning policies  i understand that this is a wide spectrum and the left doesn t agree on everything and with the evolution of politics that there isn t even a clearly defined left and right  however there are many core tenets such as  wealth equality  redistributive economic policies  egalitarianism  universal healthcare  strong  amp  independent public education  pro environment policy  and so on      what kind of people are we looking for   anyone interested in the cause will be able to help even if it s just contribution to the discussions and feedback  in particular  those with specific skill sets - including graphic design  website design  copywriting skills  etc      how will we stay in contact   primarily through an invite only discord server     interested   if getting involved in something like this is of interest to you  please send me a dm telling me a little about yourself and we can go from there    ethan,6gwvdr
