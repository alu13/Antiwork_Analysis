0,Lame Magazine open for submissions. Theme: Work,"My name is Cody Yeo and I am the writer of the comic book series ""EPOCHS"" (www.facebook.com/epochscomicscanada), ""The Beasts Of North"" webcomic, and my new literary zine ""Thanks. It's Not Much, But We Call It Home.""
For the release of the next issue of my zine, I want to release it under the publishing title LAME Books. With the launch of this new small press publishing house I want to do an anthology zine titled ""LAME"".
The zine will be open to all printable art forms: short stories, comics, opinion pieces, illustrations, photography, or whatever else you can think of.
The theme of this issue is WORK, and definitely in a NEGATIVE aspect. Let me hear all about your shitty bosses and co-workers, and the shady things you've done at different jobs. All written pieces must be under a 1700 word limit.
Please send submissions to: codyeo@hotmail.ca

1,My sister just got fired,"This is my issue with the work culture. They expect someone to come in on weekends, stay after hours, never get sick or take vacations. This is pretty much what they told her when they fired her. This is pathetic and unrealistic. How can they expect someone to stick to this demand and want to stay with a company that expects this of them? No one should be guilted into staying after hours or being in on weekends. No one should be punished for taking vacations or getting sick.",False,3zf6td,Crosstitution,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/3zf6td/my_sister_just_got_fired/,6,15
