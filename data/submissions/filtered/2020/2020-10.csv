2,"""Working"" is slavery, and to say it's anything else is propaganda",what exactly makes slavery so bad  sure  violence  but mainly the lack of control  lack of freedoms  lack of the option to do else  you're stuck doing whatever someone tells you to do under the threat of not being able to eat or have a roof over your head  saying work isn't like slavery is pretty much equivalent to saying  slave owners who don't beat their slaves were perfectly fine  your freedoms are still being majorly infringed on  in most cases 60  of your time will be dedicated not to what you want to do  but making money for some rich guy who doesn't even fucking need the money nor give a single fuck about you  you produce more value and work harder than they ever will  yet they will make 100x more than you  this is not okay  this system needs to be completely demolished  ceo's should be limited to only making something like double what their workers make   and the majority of profits should be used to increase wages of everyone  not just the owners  that way everyone can prosper and not just the dickheads who own it and don't do shit to help ,jjduel
3,What a wake-up call: A rant,i always knew managers were shit  i've only been working 10 months but i've already learned so much about how dreadful the working world is  however  every now and then something will happen that really brings it all home    i am an apprentice in the nhs  my apprenticeship is a dual one so i was supposed to spend half the year in clinical coding and half the year in archiving  but due to covid and the fact the manager needed me more in coding  i spent 8 months there  i really wanted to be a clinical coder  it's a fascinating job that suits my skill set and introverted personality  i applied for an opening in march and was told that  while my application was excellent  i just missed out on an interview  i felt this was fair enough as the job did require medical knowledge and while i felt i covered this well in the application  i was all too aware that anyone with a medical background would easily beat me out   i moved to archiving in august and a couple of weeks ago another vacancy popped up  i should stress both vacancies were for two positions but were posted as one  i immediately applied and was more confident about my chances given that i had been working with patient case notes for a near constant and daily basis and had picked up more knowledge of anatomical terms  as well as a general knowledge of how patient case notes are structured  the other apprentice in the office also applied  she has been at the trust for three months and is applying for everything  regardless of her level of interest   yesterday she was studying in the library for her apprenticeship and emailed me asking me about the fact that there is an anatomical test as part of the interview  i immediately checked my personal email and found that i had not been successful    to say i was devastated is an understatement  i was fucking mortified  i have never felt quite so humiliated  a 20 year old who has 3 months of experience working at the trust got an interview for a job in a department in which i had worked  my manager had made a comment to another high-ranking employee  who is lovely and supportive  that  it was a shame i hadn't been at the trust longer  i have been an employee there for 10 months and previous to that volunteered since july of last year   i talked to the lovely employee and she had sent an email to the manager who claimed that my medical experience was lax  the other apprentice mentioned she had a gcse in biology  i said the same and included the previous patient case note experience    i worked my ass off in that department  i hated that job and constantly stressed about it  i threw up twice before work because of anxiety  i only worked so hard because i wanted to make a good impression and felt that i had  i used to sweat constantly because of the heavy physical element of the job and the stress of dealing with difficult  bitchy secretaries    i always knew managers were shit but every now and then something happens that brings it home  this is an example of that  i know  i'm an idiot  i know  i'm naive  i wanted out of work since day one  but i really was foolish enough to think that my manager had a high enough opinion of me to not pull a bullshit stunt like this  i'm boo boo the fool  and my manager is a cunt ,jjthdq

5,"My ""dream"" job",i just wanted to say for the last 6 months  i think i've finally achieved my dream  job  high stakes poker taking money from rich ceo's that don't deserve it  i finally found an answer that allows me to not work and i've never felt better  every  job  i've ever had i've been extremely depressed  anxious  and never making enough money for anything more than rice and beans  every car bill my livelihood was at risk  my diet was ramen  rice  and beans  i couldn't afford new clothes  you know  the usual things someone with a full-time job should be dealing with  s  but now i feel liberated  poker is a hobby so it's never forced  and i have time to do things i'd actually like to do  i just hope this lasts  and that the game doesn't get much harder than it is currently  still worried about my future in that regard  but for now  and for once  i'm proud to say i'm finally happy ,jjlz3y
6,STOP EXPLOITING ME,i'm so fucking fed up  back in march two of my superiors were fired  and believe it or not  i got their responsibilities but not their pay  i had noooo clue what i was doing  the two were lawyers in foreign jurisdictions so i was googling endlessly how to do the job  i had to speak with foreign authorities constantly to get everything right  i wasn't trained and i'm not a lawyer  my boss kept carrot dangling  saying if i show what i've got i can be promoted  fastforward to now when the promotion is due  and you guessed it  a lovely performance review sesh saying i'm too slow at all the extra  unfamiliar stuff i'm doing  ontop of my actual tasks  lol  so someone will be hired in above me  and i lose out  so great  you got me to do the job of two lawyers for cheap for months  you exploited me  and now you're taking away the reward you promised for the effort   i'm so glad i have extremely low expectations of all employers already  it doesn't shock me  i'm just bitterly confirmed in my antiwork views  i'm ok with labor and i take pride in my work  but why do you  exploit  me  why do i deserve these lies and being misled  why get as much out of me for as little as possible  i just want to survive ,jju3to
7,Conditional Cash Transfers,so in brazil  they have these things called  conditional cash transfers  which are small sums of money given to indigent community members  in return  the state requires the receiver of the funds to keep their children in school  which has helped brazil achieve higher educational attainment rates  the increased likelihood of a child finishing school results in a better workforce that has generated economic growth  i often hear how social assistance is only used by drug users and lazy people  yet  there are clear pros to it that benefit the whole of society in the long run  what are your thoughts ,jk70ns
8,So tired...,so today my manager comes over to my office and starts telling me that i need to prepare some samples to ship to a client  he doesn't even give me a chance to get a pen and paper before he starts talking  i asked him to repeat it because there was people speaking behind him as well  he starts saying that i never pay attention and that i don't listen and whatever  i asked him to either write down what he was saying or to just send me an email with the information and he keeps going that i'm not paying attention  later  i went to his office with a pen and some paper to ask him exactly what he needs me to put together  he goes back to saying that i don't pay attention and that i don't collaborate and essentially telling me that i'm not good enough   i've been struggling with this place since i started working there  the only reason  well  besides covid  that i'm still there is that it kind of works because my rent is not very high and i can walk to work  but i just feel trapped in this loop and i don't see a way out ,jjvxp6
9,Anyone else have to watch those annoying corporate videos that try and talk up how good of a place it is to work ?,had to watch the latest round today and i sat through an hour of countless different shareholders talk about how well they re doing and how this is a place where everyone can get on with their careers  which is an absolute joke because i ve been here like 4 years never seen anyone get a promotion and when i asked because i could do with more money they were like there s a job going at a branch 200 miles away that you can take  it ll come with a pay cut though i think i ll pass  ,jkiupr

14,I will start to lie a lot from now on....,i will start to lie a lot from now on  the reason why i want to do this is because of some stupid school project that we have got  if i would have lied to my parents about what has to be done in the project  i could have cut a lot of corners and everything would be easier    i won't argue with anyone anymore  i will just tell them what they want to hear so that they leave me alone  they can argue with someone else  plus i actually get away with lying because i'm not exactly known for lying   - we had school until 15 30 but i left at 12 30     oh  well  that's unfortunate  i thought school ended at 12 30 that day  i want to apologize   - i didn't do my homework     oh  i thought we only had to do this task  i didn't know we had to do that task   - i half assed the homework    oh  i thought the way i did it would be enough  i'm sorry   - my parents or my teacher notices that i was cutting corners at something     oh shoot  please forgive me  i really didn't know we had to do it that way    these are just a few examples off the top of my head  this handy thing called  lying  will significantly reduce the amount of work that i will have to do ,jkl1ys

17,Work is often the perfect breeding ground for those new to an abuser lifestyle,nothing in here is going to be news to anyone  it s just a rant   currently dealing with a manager who is neurotic  insists upon himself  and passive aggressive pretty much at random  every day   however  i know that i can t call out this clearly obnoxious behavior because that will instantly make me  confrontational  which will put any job progress in question forever and of course i can t really afford to just ditch the position right now  so i m forced to deal with a superior who is essentially a snowflake and has to be babied and enabled  in this situation  it s not unreasonable to assume that they get away with this here and will start to believe  if they haven t already  that this is acceptable in all other parts of their lives as well  that everybody around them is just totally beholden to their mood swings or judgmental actions   the end of friday can t come soon enough ,jkf72x
18,The constant stress is killing me.,i started work out of college back in may as an engineer    i spent 2 weeks organizing a large series of in person testing  amp  demonstrations  i coordinated schedules with a dozen people  we're all wfh and needed to meet in person  i finalized designs  amp  got prototypes  i wrote protocols  i did all the work    i got a pat on the back yesterday and woke up this morning to multiple emails asking me about deadlines for other projects because i'm now done with my main project   its just killing me  theres no break  theres no  you finished exams  take some vacation  how the hell do you guys deal with it ,jjqcme
19,The current labor model for most people just isn't going to work for much longer,in econ 101 the first thing you learn is supply and demand   if you know that then you will already get what i'm saying   firstly the supply of labour is constantly going up because we are having more and more people  a far greater proportion of people have been given the training to do many jobs now  thanks to globalization  labour from places in east europe  asia and africa are now accessible      yet the demand for human labour is either relatively static or is going to go down thanks to automation  a lot of jobs are going to be replaced by technology  and before you go what about all the new job created  is it enough to keep up with the growing supply of labour  do those jobs involve highly technical knowledge like coding which is hard to teach to people who do manual labour    so the supply of human workers go up but the demand for them remains the same or goes down  thats basically means our bargaining power is going down the drain here  doesn't help that many smes are being eaten up by the megacorps   people complain that firms like amazon abuse the workers by paying them little  overworking them  keeping them in fear etc  but amazon can just go  if you don't like then leave coz i can easily get someone else who probably asks for less pay and whines less    its basically a race to the bottom here  and it isn't getting better  people blame covid 19 but this problem has been taking place for a long time and soon it will it will be too much and too late ,jkazrk

And I don't want to.",i feel depressed as soon as i get into the 8 hour  or rather 10 hour with public transportation  shift  i just can't take it  i finally  snapped  in my 13  year in school  after i had to wake up at 5 00 o'clock only to come back at 16 30 o'clock and i  or rather  the class  get threatened in school to get kicked out for poor performance  the first one was kicked out after 2 weeks when school started  i would be the next  i just couldn't take that shit   so all i have now is a school certification which leaves me with 2nd best grade in politics  physical education  english  which is pretty much useless to get an apprenticeship  because i have the 3rd worst grade in german and 2nd worst grade in maths    so all what is left are physically demanding jobs  cashier-grocerystocker  and or customer service  and i can't do them  i'm a little bit underaverage in muscle strength as a men and i'm too annoyed by customer service  it builds up and i become angry at them   and besides that i probably have a low chance of even having a job long-term  it's not like i want to work   maybe 3-4 hours a day  but if more than that is taken away  i feel like what's the point of living   i'm having an existential depression since i'm 14  because i realized how the system works  at least how school worked  of course later i was able to research what was actually this rotten system that is called capitalism    so right now i feel somewhat happy  as long as i read interesting books  watch interesting shows  do walks and a few other small things i currently try to experiment on   but as soon as i'm forced back into that 8 hour shift  i know i will be so depressed i would probably contemplate doing something bad   and the worst thing  if i go to my doctor now to get sent to a qualified doctor psychologist  he will only try to talk me out of it and or fill me with drugs  there's no way in hell i'll get social assistance in this country  they made the hurdle too high and they even try manipulative tactics like wrong symptoms on questionaire about depression in health care    and don't come with the  you're the young  thing like one doctor said  thanks to the internet i have plenty of knowledge thanks to the contribution of other people    we're truly in a dystopia ,jktnqg

43,No Motivation In Life,part of the reason i'm a neet is because i have absolutely no motivation to do anything in life  even if i did i completely lack the discipline to follow through with anything  i spend my days doing things that require as little effort as possible which mostly comes down to consuming entertainment and food  you could say it has to do with depression or anxiety but i've always been like this  i've always chosen to take the easiest path in life for everything  i'm afraid of hard work ,jlsabv

55,The entire work system has made given me major anxiety and made me feel like I'm never good enough.,i don't fully know how to explain my dilemma because in ways i actually want a job  my issue is i have absolutely no trust in higher ups  and this isn't just for big companies this is for local places as well   i'm 21 and have never kept a job past about 2 months  i only started getting hired at 18 because i had an undiagnosed disorder that affected what i could do  not i have treatment for it  i hopped from job to job  it was very common for me to go into work happy and come home and tell my mother  i got fired again    every single time i've gotten fired it  according to them  hasn't been my fault or they don't give me a reason  i've asked other staff for feedback  to improve and they say i'm fine  one of my last jobs the manager told me that i was actually doing really well and i picked up on things that other staff members took 6 months at least  she told me multiple times how great i was doing  i wasn't constantly asking for feedback or anything  and then the next day called me up and told me they found someone younger and better  another time i lived a 10 minute walk from work  got in and the manager told me  oh someone else we had before wanted to come back  didn't you get my email  she had sent the email 5 minutes before  i at least tried to work that shift to get money but she already swapped me for that girl who had quit  another time i got fired because i had a really important event coming up on my night off  told one manager  just in case they called me in  and he said it was fine but told me to tell the other manager and the other manager went ballistic  he refused to hear me out  i have so many more of these stories but i don't wanna go on   my other issue  there's always someone younger but due to me not being able to get hired early i struggle to get jobs a teenager couldn't typically get  i did try bartending but they wanted me to have more customer experience  which i do have some but those are the jobs i gotta compete with teenagers with   i don't feel good enough for anything anymore  i worked in a cafe and while my coffee skills aren't amazing i could make a takeaway coffee with no complaints  can't do art for shit though  i don't even feel like i can apply to a run down  cheap coffee shop  i used to work as a kitchen hand but don't feel good for any kitchen hand jobs  just looking at websites like seek gives me major anxiety and that's before any interview  i do have a diploma and i am considered restudying something but i have 0 idea what because i'm so worried i'll end up not being able to get work after studying as just applying for minimum wage jobs makes me feel sick  when at work i can't relax at all  i have to constantly be 110  because i freak out so much at making a little mistake because tiny mistakes have gotten me fired  people say everyone makes mistakes but it truly feels like i can't within a job setting  and now with businesses reopening here it's 10x harder to get work   i honestly don't know what to do  i talk to people but i don't think they understand the severity of it ,jko78l
56,Most people hate their jobs and working,i see posts very similar to the ones on this sub when i look at many other subreddits from life advice to jobs  almost everyone i talk to hates work   but i see a common theme in other places that i don't see here  which is why i love this subreddit  i see that people say  every one hates their job  deal with it  also people say that if you don't work you will literally die   that leads me to the point of why do we live like this if everyone is unhappy  even the bootlickers    also  it makes no sense to ruin your life and your soul for just being kept alive  how is your life no different than an animal's  at least they live in freedom    why do so many people who hate their lives encourage working just to stay alive and brush it off as something  we have to do  it's such bs ,jkdw95
57,I just don't understand how people can stay sane if they have a job?,i've been living quite a poor life but rich at the same time  little money but a lot of freedom  but it's quite stressful and there's a lot of pressure still because it's just temporary solutions one after another    and sometimes i actually end up having to work  and that just makes me want to kill myself  i just don't understand how people month after month for years can stay sane    a full time job leaves you with barely any time at all for you to do something you enjoy during the after work hours  i've done the math on this many times where i go through counting the time it takes to make breakfast  shower  go to work  etc etc and after all chores and work related tasks of the day are over then i only have something like 1-2 hours of free time  and that also means i've used the time very efficiently without being lazy or slow    now i have found a job opportunity to work from home and i can work for example 4 hours per day and make a small income good enough for survival  and it's really the best job i've been offered so far  but it would still be a nightmare  sure it's less shitty than other jobs but it's still shit    i'm going to go insane having to suffer through 4 agonizing hours every damn day  but i think i am going to be forced to do that very soon because i'm running out of temporary solutions   i think one thing is that i don't like socializing  but i remember during my early childhood that my classmates wanted me to come hang out with them every day and all we did was walk around chatting for the most part  i mean that's basically like work  if they thought it's so fun to just walk around chatting all day long every day then i can understand why they think work is so easy  they probably love to have a job to go to every day and socialize with their collegeues and that's why most jobs require you to be social and fun to work with and recruit through referrals and friends  so  i just don't have the dna genes which makes it possible for me to enjoy working like most other people  i don't know how i can take this and keep living with the constant pressure to keep working a damn job every day  it's hell really    there has to be a solution to make life enjoyable  but i can't think of anything ,jjm0vu
58,Tipping culture and “unreliable” coworkers — how we’re conditioned to think capitalists do no wrong.,whenever a customer doesn t tip  the server never gets angry at the owners that refuse to pay them properly  but instead the customer for not tipping them  and it s gotten to the point that we demonize those who won t or can t  stop eating out  you re cheap  etc  honestly with that arrangement  only higher earners could afford to consistently eat out   a similar thing with  unreliable  coworkers  the ones that call out or quit suddenly and leave the rest short-staffed  no one questions the management owner class for not having enough people to cover absences  or the fact that they only hire the bare minimum to keep costs low  no  the lazy coworker is apparently the problem   we re literally propagandized to support our owners more than our fellow working man woman  why is it that we always place the blame on the easiest targets ,jjghwh
59,Being late quickly demonstrates that the whole point of work is to control you.,i once came in for a temperature check for a job  at the conclusion  it was 5 minutes past my scheduled start and i was lectured on how late i was  never mind the fact that i received contradictory information on when i was supposed to report for said check  was told before to sign in  and not too early of course  before the check   i wondered why it was a problem  it was a warehouse position so it s not even that much of a big deal  if they want i ll stay later to make up for it   then i realized that if they let me get away with lateness  other coworkers might test the waters to see what they can do  and from there  it wouldn t be long before the workers get bold enough to unionize   it s always been about control  it s the only thing more valued than productivity  and yet the bootlickers will continue defending this shit to the bitter end ,jjfuzd
60,Stuck between the beliefs and trying to expel others conflicting beliefs and find/live out my truth (also on mental health),anybody who can help me with this  thank you so much  i am currently 20 and i still reside with my mother  i don t have a job and i ve had some mental issues since i was about 2  i know i probably need to see a psychiatrist and get on some sort of add adhd and or anxiety medication  i currently sort of broke away from my fear-implemented christian ideals and beliefs after a long amount of time    these beliefs came from a bunch of conspiracy theorist-like christian youtubers  now i see all these convincing youtubers trying to inform me that an entirely raw food lifestyle consisting of only fruits and vegetables will cure me  and my mental health  also others saying i need to fast on only juice from fruits  amp  vegetables for over 100 days to clear out my colon and backed up waste in my intestines  other people telling me to continue taking benzodiazepines  anti-anxiety medication    i guess i m saying that i am simply having a hard time sticking to a path and following it  i hate living these extreme lifestyles and i don t even know who to believe anymore because everyone has conflicting evidence and opinions on how you should live  i m sick of my hair falling out  that sort of completely stopped for awhile when i was on the entirely raw food  fruits  amp  vegetables  diet  but the hair loss started up again  and i felt depressed and wasn t progressing in life anyway  so i started back on my benzodiazepines to help me focus  and drinking strong black coffee    i still eat really healthy  with some pizza or meat in between my healthy foods on some days  i m just not sure if i should be so extreme again  or see a psychiatrist to get on the right medication  probably a stimulant or antipsychotic  i don t know which path to follow  they all contradict and nobody seems to know what health and or prosperity is anymore  without suffering and feeling stuck in your own head and depressed all the time  ultimately i do realize the universe is made of magic and synchronicities do happen to me a lot   i at least have some money from unemployment nowadays  if anyone can or has related to this  which i am sure there are some people  please give me your advice on blocking out the wrong paths  which can be so convincing  and how exactly to follow your own self truth and prosper in all areas of your life  thank you a lot in advance ,jjvh8t
61,[Rant] The negative pay rise mystery,tl dr  it s a rant story about how jobs f you over    i have been with the company for over 6 years now  in the meantime i had two pay increases  one of which was part of the promotion to a senior position   before having my most recent annual review i opened a spreadsheet and did some math  i used take-home tax calculators separately for each year  i took the official government-published inflation numbers and calculated how much i am earning now in relation to 6 years ago  even though the inflation has been rather mellow  one year even at zero  the final number was nearly -5  to put it bluntly  if i was able to buy a 100 loafs of bread in 2014  today i can only buy 95 of them   i have worked there for a long time  became an expert in the specific aspects of business  became well acquaintanced and liked by the customers  i have widely expanded my skillset  and in the end i earn less  i don t think i need to say anything more to describe how ridiculously unfair and predatory that is   i have raised it during my meeting and my position was  that  if you re not paying at least 100  of what you agreed to when i was hired  i won t be doing 100  of what i can  yeah  i even ignored the fact that the pay increases should push you higher in the purchasing power with each year  even if only slightly  and i asked to be paid at the same  living level  as previously  after all  inflation includes all  energy prices  food prices  all other necessities and amenities  and unless i became less productive  less valuable  then i should earn at least as much  right  and as mentioned above  i actually became better at what i do   what was the company s response   you are not giving your 100  so there cannot be talk about pay increase  you need to do more than 100  and then we can reward that with higher salary   i tried to reiterate my point and even their point to show how ridiculous that statement is  in the end i was assured  that of course i am valuable and valued by the company  just not in a monetary sense   i m awaiting actual pay increase announcement that should be coming not too long from now  i expect nothing and yet i m sure i ll still be disappointed   guys  do what i did  don t just eyeball stuff  as inflation compounds with each year  just like interest  do some math and figure out how much more you re actually earning vs previous years  you might end up surprised to find that you numerical increase actually doesn t cover the rising costs of living ,jjowex

86,I need to vent,i like working at my workplace  but a bunch of my coworkers who excluded me from the discussion due to my nationality  which they'll never admit  met together and decided that my position was redundant  brought my concerns to my boss  she apologized at first then rolled back her apology the next day after reviewing policies and procedures and found that the discussion and decision was perfectly compliant with rules i've had no say in  irrespective of humanity  as a concession i was told that i could be transferred to another location pending my yearly evaluation  which i was promised would be undertaken fairly   narrator  it was not  fast forward to today  this woman just tears into me  maybe it was the loss of face involved in me telling her in front of a handful of people who don't speak a lick of english in a clearly concerned tone that i did not agree with the decision on a personal or professional level  maybe it was because after being treated that way i just lost the energy to keep acting like i like any of the people who voted me off the island  whatever happened  she came at me so hard during evaluations that everyone who sat in on it was put off be her vindictive attitude  everything from not following some expectations that had never been presented to me in the span of 4 years  to not greeting people enough in the hallways  fact  i used to greet everyone  then stopped somewhere between them never answering me and them convening without a key expert in a department to that the expert position was redundant  lots of talking down to me as though i were a child  since my next year's contract is on the line  of course i had no choice but to give her a bunch of yes  sure  okay  and i'm sorry for shit that i had no reason to kowtow to  what's my choice  fight her  lose my company housing and my job for sure and have to go back through the interview wringer to meet another soulless employer who will give me less pay and less time off   you guys will love this shit  she asked me if my contract was unfair  i said yes  affirming my prior statements that the contract was written by natives for natives with little to no input or consideration for the immigrant workers as human beings  nationals of course have some level of leverage  be it unions or protests  for us it's take it or leave it  and i know that  she asked me why i'd sign a contract if i thought it was unfair   you guys will love this shit   i told her  with all due respect  i'm a human being  and i need a contract for a job  and i need a job to buy food and clothing  otherwise i will die  so i take the least unfair contract i can get  because i will never get a perfect contract and i don't get to negotiate   that's right  she said  you can't negotiate so you better not complain   this is capitalist logic  it's not even a private sector job  but cannibal capitalism is deeply entrenched in the minds of everyone around them  boy i wish my job were in the private sector so instead of a public bureau deciding ways to fuck me for the sake of the nation  instead it would be bean counters deciding ways to fuck me for the sake of short-term profits   i can't wait to be released from this mortal coil so i will no longer be tied to human obligations that force me to accept slavery ,jjn31y

97,"Can’t enjoy my time off anymore, even missed my birthday and family dinner for work",i decided that maybe  after three years straight of working and working and more working  that maybe  i could have a little vacation  by some miracle  i was able to get three weeks off by lying about not having contacts  long story  and all i had to was provide a doctors note in that time  my plans were to relax  watch some movies  make real food for once  and actually live for a little  you know  like humans were meant to   i wish i had just shut up about my contacts and never tried to get time off  guess what happened  not only was i completely incapable of relaxing that entire time due to anxiety about work  it indirectly led me to me losing that job and missing my entire birthday month with my family because of the financial situation that just one week put me into  i had to immediately find a new place to work  which was only possible because i knew someone who was able to get me a job right away    however  because of the urgency of the situation  i m pretty much working as much as i can out of completely necessity and didn t even realize my birthday had passed until my parents said something about it  i wasn t able to fully explain to my mother why i couldn t make it to my own birthday dinner  and even then she just decided to guilt trip me  made me feel bad for not being able to show up to dinner  even though i even forgot i had a fucking birthday at all    so here i am  feeling guilty as fuck for just wanting some time off  i m in debt  missed my birthday  and am making less all because i needed a little break  guess i ll get my next break when i die  hopefully that s soon ,jktjqo

99,Any philosophy to help cope with the wageslave life?,i've read man's search for meaning by viktor frankl and i think it's a brilliant book and message  the only problem is i find it hard to translate into the modern wageslave life because it just feels meaningless by design  we make money to survive  consume and buy status objects with  that's pretty much it  some choose to start families but then you become even more of a wageslave because spendings tend to increase and if you have children you're really just creating more future wageslaves  it wouldn't feel right to have children and then expect them to leave at 18 into this world without a plan   my issue in life is the realization that there's not some noble goal at the end of this struggle  the only reward is survival and the only goal is death  maybe there's some sort of philosophical idea or some alternative lifestyle that can justify being a wageslave  do you know any ,jjmcja

105,I think I am burned out at the age of 22,a little personal post  but i am curious if someone is in a similar situation   i juggle with 3 jobs  one in accountig  one in construction and one in a hospital  why  because none of them would hire me normally  ever since the pandemic started i was lucky to get a job and had to sign contracts that would allow them to only give me hours when they need me with no regard of when i need to be employed  so i juggle 3 jobs to be able to pay for my living  my car and university  there are weeks when i literally have no days off  sometimes multiple weeks in a row  and i have to stay up all night studying  the worst is that i drink 7-8 cups of coffee a days just to keep up with sleeping 2-4 hours  one when i wake up  one before i leave home  one after i arrive  one on my lunch break  one before i go home  one when i arrive home  and one during study session  if i don't i'd just sleep on the spot standing  it just feels wrong at this point physically  but i think i am seriously addicted  not like  hehe i love coffee like an addict  but addict addicted  my 10yo laptop died  video card and fan both went out  it is already held together by electric tape  but i will have to make time to replace the fan so i can use it without placing it on the big fan  you know those you use to cool down a room  boomers and other people at uni tell me to just buy new  but i am happy if i have a couple dollars at the end of each month  i cannot afford to save up for a new one  i have just finished fixing up my car for good  i bought it as a daily cheap project  because i needed a car and could not afford one that was in good condition  and it has been in the works for 3 years  i finished it yesterday evenig  now it only needs and alignment  yet i feel no rewarding feeling like i used to  i am falling behind with schoolwork  yesterday after getting done with the car i have spent the time from 22pm to 4am to trying to focus  but could barely accomplish a thing  i only made as much progress in that time as i'd do in 1 or 2 hours if i was not that exhausted  and no  i was not watching youtube or anything  i was literally staring at the screen for minutes before catching myself doing that  i seriously don't know how am i going to pass my tests next week  i am not to cheat but this time i am seriously considering it   is it morally wrong to cheat in a game that is rigged against me  friends always invite me out and i constantly say no  why  because i cannot afford to go out  i don't have the time or the money  family constantly tells me that by now others have relationships  but on one hand that's not what i see  barely any of my friends do  only those who do not have to work more than 2-3 days a week and or do not attend school  the others are all single  i have tried to look for a relationship  but i am just never available  and when i am  then i am a really bad company  constantly tired  slow to answer and quick to anger  i actually remember the last time i felt genuenly happy by the date  it was almost a year ago on 2019 12 12  it was due to snow coming on my day off and being able to take the car out to the local abbandoned airport to screw around  as dumb as it sounds  ever since then that's the only thing i can look forward to now  the snow  other than that i don't see anything that would reward me for the struggles  i still do them  but it feels useless  and all i realistically see is only getting worse   anyone in similar situation ,jkt5sh

107,I have spent years hating being alive,i thought i was anti work  logically i know i need to work as i need money to live  but every job i got would drive me insane and i'd just want to die  so who cares about affording to eat when i want to die anyway   so i'd always quit after a month or two and be europhoric at the thought of being free  but then the money runs out and the hating myself for being a failure kicks in    has anybody here been anti work while liking their job  or while having their dream career   i was anti work because i just kept having shit jobs  mostly warehouse work   given how many shit warehouses there are and how they're accidentally doing everything possible to make a person miserable  it's no surprise    my point is  i reckon it's more likely we're anti bullshit mundane jobs and would happily work if it was something that we would be content doing and paid a respectful amount   perhaps work here  on the sub is just defined as a task we force ourselves to do for money while losing time  happiness and life satisfaction  at which point everybody in their right mind  would be anti work  but if work is just  a job for money  are any of you anti all jobs even after good experiences ,jk6bli
108,Please I need advice.,maybe this isn't the best place for unbiased answers but i will ask anyways because people here are probably smarter than i am   as we all know  there is another spike in covid cases happening  should i quit my job because no one at my work takes precautions    the first day i went there  it wasn't it even an interview  i talked to the boss about pay  he offered a handshake  then i started working that day  i've been working in landscaping for 2 weeks  all the people i work with are huge trumpers  they even make me listen through rush limbaugh in the truck when he's on  they all talk about how they really hate the whole masks thing  and i have to be close to these people   with all the leaf blowers and lawn cutters so loud  anytime someone needs to tell me something  they have to get 2 inches away from my ear to tell me  i really don't like right wind politics  and all these people do is talk about just that    this is my highest paying job so far at  13 an hour  but still  i do the same work  if not more  than a lot of the people there and the 2nd lowest wage someone gets paid is  18 i'm guessing it's because i'm young  not a good reason imo  the boss even tried starting me off at  12 when the online application said start at  13    do i have a valid reason to quit for when future employers ask why i quit  i would say no one would take safety precautions or wear masks  it's friday tomorrow  should i finish the week then quit my job  keep working until i get a better job  or just quit now  if i quit now should i make up a lie and say i'm sick or something  i've quit every job i've ever had and my mom will be pissed at me if i quit yet another job  what should i do  i need advice ,jkrqdw

i no longer have to import sleeping capsules from the us  over the counter there  expensive and prescription only here  to fall asleep on work nights because my body is dreading a fresh day of slavery in the morning    and then that propaganda pamphlet arrived today  all about how this party needs us to vote for them  and i won't because i don't vote conservative  so we can all get back to work    i'm so much fucking happier right now  i'm not suffering from suicidal ideations because i'm a miserable wagie    for the first time in 10 years  i finally feel like my life is my own    i've been learning spanish and korean as a hobby and loving it  i've been going for walks in the afternoon  i'm eating healthier  my skin is glowing because i'm not forced to paint it in makeup all week to be considered  professional  i am finally spending more time with my family and friends than co-workers i don't really like and have no connection to other than the fact we are wagies at the same place  admittedly  a lot of it is over facetime  but it is still enough to bring me happiness   i'd rather facetime interactions with my loved ones than in person interaction with coworkers  i now actually have the energy to go and spend a day with my 2 nieces on a saturday instead of being utterly drained from my 40 hours of wage slavery  i'm not nearly as reliant on anti depressants and sleeping pills as i used to be  i'm not dreading life anymore or wishing i could die   but the capitalists don't want me to stay happy  they want me back in my miserable station in life because fuck me for not being born to millionaires  i can't imagine anything worse  i hope this pandemic would inspire people to realise that the 40 hour slave week is miserable  but the normies are desperate to have it back because they have been brainwashed to think it is freedom   i finished graduate school in november 2010  and despite the fact this year has been a pandemic  this year has actually been the happiest of my life  i didn't realise how burned out i was  sure  i can't travel internationally right now  but i'm actually not craving a holiday as much as i normally do because i'm not suffering the usual burn out i do by this point in the year   i honestly  kinda hope the pandemic lasts another couple of years so i can continue to be happy and not depressed  i don't want this to end    but of course  the part of normalcy society is desperate to restore is the most miserable part of it - wage slavery  and people are so brainwashed by capitalism that they are eating it up and i just want to burst into tears  i finally feel like my life has meaning again  and like there is more to life than making other people rich  and the normies and rich people just want to take that all away from me and send me back to misery    i know this post is going to be preaching to the choir  but i just wanted to share my thoughts without being told i'm some combination of lazy  selfish  entitled  spoiled  or a typical millennial snowflake    all i want from this pandemic recovery is for part time work from home to be normalised  not a huge rush back to 40 hours a week of wage slavery  but it won't happen  so i kinda hope to drags on longer ,jgifl7

200,How I deal with my job and how you can too.,so you hate your job  you're expected to work overtime  your boss is an unfair  and your pay sucks  well same here  i on the other hand do not work overtime  i do not let my boss be unfair  and my pay still sucks  the way to deal with your job is to live life on the edge and have a good work ethic    now before you lynch me for saying a good work ethic will help you deal with your job let explain  and i'll start with living life on the edge   no    this is the most powerful tool you have as an employee  you don't negotiate  you don't make exceptions  you say no  the word no will solve most of your work problems or you won't have any more problems which leads to my next point    two resumes    you read that right  keep two resumes  if you get fired you still need to make money and i am sure you don't have savings because of your shitty pay  the first resume is your transitional job resume  this one you lie your ass off on so you are guaranteed to get some low level job  fast food  waiter  whatever  the other resume well you still lie your ass off but it's for where you would like to work next  you keep them updated and most importantly you keep them cycling  you keep sending them to places keep those resumes fresh in the inbox of what ever companies you like  i currently am not looking to quit my current job but i still have both my resumes under review at 6 other companies    just say no    again i can't stress this enough  just say no  just say i won't be doing that  just say it    live within your means    i am not saying so you can start saving money because i am sure the pay won't allow you to  but what i am saying is live within your means so you don't need overtime  in my personal opinion overtime is a scam  your time after work is worth exponentially more then the usual 1 to 1 1 2 times pay you get for doing it  but if you need it you need it  that's why you should do everything you can so you can live within the confines of your non overtime check  this also has the benefit of you not scrambling around if the overtime goes poof  overtime can't affect you if you don't need it    now onto the lynching     work ethic dun dun duuuuun   this is actually really simple get your daily work done within your normal hours  or do more  just don't do less  you don't do other people work for them  you don't do your bosses job  you do your job and that it  you get it done in that 8 to 10 hour period  you get it done in that week  don't say it can't be done  it can be done  i'll use myself as an example i can finish the daily work at my job in 4 hours  i work a 10 hour shift  i can work circles around everyone else in my job and everyone knows it  sometimes i have completed what amounts to 4 days worth of work in 7 hours just because i can  it's a power move  the most important thing is make sure they know in no uncertain terms that you only do more because you wanted to  which brings me back to the most important thing    just say no   for context i work in a manufacturing job  everyone but me does overtime  i tell my bosses no on a daily basis  other people around me have gotten fired while doing what everyone else does but i am still here    do i think this will help  everyone  no that would be unrealistic  do i think it can help alot of you  yes i do  do i sound like i am an asshole at work  i am but my fellow employees don't think i am ,jj1ei7

299,I fell for another marketing book- review for slashed it by unsah malik,i was sceptical to begin with- but i bought her book anyway- thinking there might reallly be something  different  that no other book course has- and the reality is everything she has in her book is out online- you just need to look for it    it s all right in your face  i am the fool who fell for her marketing gimmicks so it s honestly my fault    the reason why i wanted to write this to all  of you today  is that i don t want desperate struggling people falling  under the spell of marketing books courses  it s toxic and it will never end  look guys- there is no such special recipe  for you to make it or  knowledge that hasn t been discovered    you ll only need to have my experience to know what i know - are all apart of the marketing these gurus do to entice you  they need to make bread too- it s part of their business  they put time and effort into their products - but most don t have businesses of their own- their business is their marketing product     not to invalidate today s social media gurus marketers who write make courses books and blogs about marketing social media are not giving  anything different they re just the type of guys who sell shovels during a gold rush    now  going back to unsah malik s book- i don t have anything against it- it s kind of a 101 guide dictionary to social media  it s a super run in the mill definition based book  though  what i find so unsettling is not being able yo critique anything in her book  and her being on top of dmca ing people for apparent   power phrasing   etc etc  her book is empty i wasted money on it- and regret it  i was wishing to learn more about actual marketing - not   the algorithm doesn t matter it s all your content - or   how influencers get approached by brands      i really envisioned something else    lesson learned- be the dude who sells the shovels in a gold rush  since anything marketing related gets the highest cpm  more traffic on blogs etc etc  all this makes me feel sad    i feel like we all need to learn old school marketing advertising   not something gurus come out with every year  technology is changing quick  something that was popular a few years ago won t work today      info  i m just an artist who wants to do something to support myself  i just to get my work seen  and all i do is make cheap art for hours and hours and hours to get books like this  i m disappointed   srsly fu   ,jeu03f

313,Financial freedom vs wage slavery,let me just start by saying that i'm aware a vast majority of us are not  anti-work  in a sense that they're lazy bums who refuse to work at all  instead  the trend im noticing is that there's a ton of unnecessary  fluff  in our current system preventing millions of people from working on their own craft  avoiding debt bondage  obtaining a livable wage  better work conditions  dressing comfortably  having time off for important matters  and so sooo many more things that separate the indentured slave from a free man or woman    however  there's a very small yet very important step that separates the financially free vs the wage slaves which is the mindset that the economy doesn't run your life   it doesnt matter if you're a millionaire or working for minimum wage  people are afraid of money because they're ultimately controlled by it  it's only those who learn to free their minds that are truly financially free and there's plenty of proof to back this up on the web   i've known homeless people who don't need money  yet a few i've known live better than millionaires in the sense that they can do anything and go anywhere because they're in control  not the economy  in fact  one of them just took me cave diving in west virginia not too long ago and woke up the next day going kayaking near great falls  va   i've had a multi millionaire neighbor who worked for ibm who is stressed to the max  can barely afford to pay his mortgage  has health problems from sitting in a chair all day  and drinks himself to sleep because of his overwhelming taxes    you finances don't decide what you can and cannot do  ultimately  is your connections and you knowing that you can do something vs hoping you can    i know a lot of you will disagree on this  and this is not me bragging  but i'm almost 30 and i only work 4 hours a day making very little money  yet none of my wealthier friends get to do anything without their companies approval  they can't even piss without eventually getting in trouble for it  to me that just seems insane but it's completely normal for most  especially in america    all i'm saying is  try to see the world for what it really is  the matrix  and try to take the best advice from someone trying to escape it  free your mind ,jerqne
314,My laptop for work is broken and our IT department doesn’t know when I can get a replacement...YAY,i have been working from home since march and my laptops battery has expanded and now it won t turn on  our it team is all remote and doesn t know when i can get a replacement  they said it could be a week  this week is one of our busiest weeks of the month and it looks like i have to take pto until i get a replacement laptop  this is like the greatest christmas present ever  i ve been saving my up my pto to use so it s perfect    my weekend started off shitty because my second bedroom  my makeshift office  had a water leak happen overnight and my husbands closet was ruined along with most of the carpeting  our apartment is a mess  i have two big projects due for school  and now water damage in most of the office area so i was so stressed thinking about going to work this week when it s going to be insanely busy  this is such a blessing in disguise ,jdoa44
315,"My boss, who's seeking a promotion to DM, is asking our current DM to stay open two hours later during the pandemic.",she explains it away as we just crossed over into a new sales tier  but the real reason is nothing more than being a self-serving lowlife  i close at least three nights per week  so it really effects me as i'll be the one staying more often than not  yet i'm the only one she didn't mention this to today at work  i texted her after she left and informed her i had zero desire to stay a minute later than 8pm  and that i'd prefer to be removed from the schedule should she go that route  it's mindboggling ,jfq7lp
316,PSA: This isn't r/communism,i'm seeing more posts like  equal wages for all  etc   there are other subs for things like that  i don't think we need another one by turning r antiwork into that   i joined this sub because i'm fed up of the modern way of life revolving around work  we are work obsessed and spend too much of our life doing it  make too many sacrifices for it  and base our identities too much on it  when the places we work for don't care about us back   i feel like the sentiment is perfectly captured in the jim carrey quote    it's really sad that so much of our society says 'thank god it's friday' thank god 5 out of the 7 days of my life is over  now i'm gonna spend 2 of those 7 days so drunk i don't have to think about the upcoming 5 7th of my week ,jffukk

319,Why punish the good employee...?,i've been working at this job for over a year at this point started as a cashier  then was promoted to  freight manager  it was fine at first when i was just a cashier  i got promoted and i thought i'd be making at least 5 more dollars  i got a measly  50 cent raise  all i was supposed to have to do was stock  i have to open the store close the store  i use to cover shifts and stay late as a cashier it used to a be once in a blue moon thing  lately  my store manager has been making me cover shifts switch my days off  i haven't called in since august and the only reason for that was because i had to have a tooth pulled  i'm not sure i understand the logic behind punishing me because other people don't show up for their shifts call in  also  i'm a single father with two children it's hell trying to find someone to watch my children while i work too  my boss is salaried as well i'm hourly     tldr  boss makes me cover people who call in and it's not fair when i'm a good employee ,jgbx4i
320,What's the plan for menial labor after the robot revolution?,so the geniuses in charge already got rid of the blue collar jobs and shipped them to sweat shops overseas  today i read an article that says they are going automate and replace most manual task labor jobs  what the hell do they want unskilled untrained workers to do  no unskilled as in making fun of them  i just mean people like me  i'm not good at math or science  i get by doing grunt work  they expect me to become an engineer  how  why   and if not what do they think is going to happen to all of us who are unable or unwilling to retrain for these fancy engineering skilled labor jobs    not everyone has the drive or even natural ability to do these jobs  even if they trained me for free i would never understand the math well enough to be a robot programmer etc   does anyone have a guess or inside knowledge as to what the plan is  probably something evil ,jffalq
321,I might be quitting?,i'm burning out at work  i've only been here a year but it's mind numbingly boring  and the customers are prissy and annoying who can't wipe their own asses sometimes   but the reason i feel like quitting is because of the recent change to payroll   starting this month oct  1st they decided to stop using a company and do their own payroll  which meant on the 9th i should have got a check from them for one days work   oct 1st   they chose to move the pay period instead which is cool because that should mean i get ot for oct 1st as i now worked 6 days that pay period instead of 5   but it also means payday changed form thursday to friday and well people it's thursday and there is no check  and no direct deposit    i've had employers fuck with my pay before by skipping weeks and lets just say i'm not a fan   my state labor board says i have to wait 31 days without payment before i can complain but that doesn't make them any less late seeing as we were agreed upon bi-weekly pay when i was hired     between this and my general desire to not work here i'm thinking of emailing my boss that i won't be returning next week   it's not the best time to be out of work and needing to job hunt but i can see if my doordash account is still active and do that while job hunting   anyway i just needed to vent a bit thanks for listening ,jgho6z

326,Unreasonable expectations at work.,have you guys ever noticed how managers at work set unreasonable expectations in order to guilt trip people into working faster  for example  they ll take the fastest worker s best hour of work and then set that as the standard  if anybody complains and claims that it s not possible  now they have someone they can point to and say that they could do it  but at the same time  only one person was ever able to achieve that  so it s still unreasonable   the thing is  we never agreed to produce 100 widgets per hour or whatever the bullshit number is they make up  we agreed to work at a reasonable pace and with a reasonable amount of effort when we signed up for the job  nobody agreed to work themself to the bone  we have lives to live outside of work  it s not fair to work someone so hard that the only thing left they can do with the last few hours of their free time is to rest and recuperate for the next work day  then it wouldn t truly be their free time  would it  so either pay us for those hours too or can-it about your 100 widget per hour number   another thing management did was play the one-sided information game  only they get to know the number of widgets per hour that you re producing  you re not allowed to know the number  that way  nobody knows to question how reasonable those numbers are  if they knew the actual average  then they could use that against management  so they hid the numbers from the workers  they d only whip them out if they thought you were going slowly to guilt-trip people into going faster   on the floor  i heard one of the supervisors tell everybody they hadn t met their numbers the whole week  yeah  of course they haven t  because the numbers you re demanding are incredibly unreasonable  if it was a reasonable number  then they d reach it  but in that case  management wouldn t have an excuse to try and whip people into working faster anymore ,jfzcyq

329,Ted Kaczynski quotes, imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy then gives them the drugs to take away their unhappiness  science fiction it is already happening to some extent in our own society  instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed modern society gives them antidepressant drugs  in effect antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual's internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable      a chorus of voices exhorts kids to study science  no one stops to ask whether it is inhumane to force adolescents to spend the bulk of their time studying subjects most of them hate  when skilled workers are put out of a job by technical advances and have to undergo  retraining  no one asks whether it is humiliating for them to be pushed around in this way  it is simply taken for granted that everyone must bow to technical necessity  and for good reason  if human needs were put before technical necessity there would be economic problems  unemployment  shortages or worse  the concept of  mental health  in our society is defined largely by the extent to which an individual behaves in accord with the needs of the system and does so without showing signs of stress      power depends ultimately on physical force  by teaching people that violence is wrong  except  of course  when the system itself uses violence via the police or the military  the system maintains its monopoly on physical force and thus keeps all power in its own hands      the big problem is that people don't believe a revolution is possible  and it is not possible precisely because they do not believe it is possible      constitutional rights are useful up to a point  but they do not serve to guarantee much more than what could be called the bourgeois conception of freedom  according to the bourgeois conception  a  free  man is essentially an element of a social machine and has only a certain set of prescribed and delimited freedoms  freedoms that are designed to serve the needs of the social machine more than those of the individual         but what first motivated me wasn't anything i read  i just got mad seeing the machines ripping up the woods     alienation  low self-esteem  depression  hostility  rebellion  children who won t study  youth gangs  ille-  gal drug use  rape  child abuse  other crimes  unsafe sex  teen pregnancy  population growth  political corruption  race hatred  ethnic rivalry  bitter ideological conflict  e g pro-choice vs  pro-life  political extremism  terrorism  sabotage  anti-government groups  hate groups  all these  threaten the very survival of the system  the system will therefore be forced to use every practical means of controlling human behavior     they want you to obey  they want you to be a sheep like they are sheep  obedient  unquestioning piece of machinery  sit when told to sit  stand when told to stand  they want you to give up your humanity  your autonomy for a paycheck  gold star  bigger tv  the only way to be human  the only way to be free  is to rebel  they ll try to crush you  they ll use every tactic they have to make you obedient  docile  subservient  but you can t let them  you have to be your own master  whatever that takes  better to die a human being than to live as a purposeless cog in their machine  - from the show   you don't have to agree with his actions or even every one of his beliefs  i don't either  i don't even believe technology is the main problem  i believe its capitalism  but his analysis on the system  especially on topics like oversocialization  increasing control of human behaviour  surrogate activities  alienation  the psychological anguish the system creates in the modern man and woman and how it then blames it on the individual  and a slew of other topics are all spot on  especially considering the fact this was written 30 years ago and it is all turning out to be very true as days pass ,jesthm

336,The argument against UBI is ridiculous,they say people won't want to work if they have a guaranteed basic income  last i checked humans are rarely satisfied with  just enough to get by  that's why we go to ridiculous lengths like working the vast majority of our lives  breaking the law and risking our freedom  and straight up risking our lives in the pursuit of money   by that same logic  if people just wanted to give up working when they became financially secure  every millionaire and billionaire would be retired  your average ceo works 58 hours a week  even though they have enough money for 10 lifetimes by their 5th year in that position    sure there would be some exceptions  some people would be satisfied with  2000 month  but those kind of people are already likely out of the workforce  and doing gigs and odd jobs so they can live their nomadic lifestyle and travel around the country in a van or whatever  the vast majority of people would continue working like they did before  they would just have a little more money to spend  which is good for business and ultimately great for the economy   i'm tired of everyone pretending like poor people are the problem  poor people are just a symptom of a failing economy  there is enough to go around  but the elite are doing everything in their power to make us think there isn't  and for what  so they can look at a number with more 0's on a screen  its pathetic frankly ,jdwrwq

348,How do you do it?,i came across a book a few years ago that changed my life and how i think about my time  and what i really value  there were aspects of antiwork in it  and so after a few years of feeling this way  i found this subreddit     amp x200b   i got a new job just before lockdown  and although the hours aren't what i wanted  i understood i needed to accept it in order to actually get a job  it seems like no one is hiring for workers who are casual or part-timers  i just want to earn enough to keep my head above water  i don't need much in life    amp x200b   it's hard for me too  because i have spd and anxiety  there's plenty of jobs i quite literally can't do at all  or if i do them  i'm going to be very overwhelmed and burnt out  despite my stance on work  if you treat me nice  i'm happy to work hard  this is the attitude i've gone into my job with  and although i have good days there  i've also been unfairly told off for random shit  and thrown under the bus on more than a few occasions  it's only been 7 months and i've cried heavily twice due to things that have occurred there    amp x200b   the actual environment is good  i am outside mostly  and the actual tasks are decent enough to do  like 70  of the time  but i just feel like the culture of this workplace  and honestly workplaces in general  just want you to be and expect you to be emotionless robots who work at 100  efficiency  and nothing else  they also want you to be their emotional punching bag for when the boss is randomly in a sour mood     amp x200b   i'm already tired  i'm depressed because 2 days ago i had to make the choice to put my dog down and i went into work today and just knew they expected me to be on top of my shit - just ignore my feelings  just be there 100  present working hard     amp x200b   this world is designed for us to work around 40 hours a week but idk how much more i have in me right now ,jf5hzr

350,I am still Ready for a General Labor Strike,i firmly believe that most work in the modern world is outdated  i say that without hesitation    if an ai can compete in chess tournaments and win  understand math  science  religion  and social institution  then there is no reason anyone should have to flip burgers to scrape a living off rocks  it takes no morals to run numbers on money  it takes no common sense  so why bother forcing someone to waste years of their life doing busy work  really the only reason i can see is for the people in power to maintain power and continue to subjugate the people they deem lesser than themselves   i have been in favor of a general labor strike since early 2019  when i realized so much of what i do is bullshit to keep me complacent to being fucked my whole life  i have a job now  teaching  and i accept that i am underpaid because i am influencing the lives of the future  who could grow up to carry the will of my this movement  but if we decided tomorrow to go on a nationwide general labor strike  i would be there  and i think my colleagues would follow my example because i work with a small group of people who believe in the power of society  we must show our future adults that it is okay to stand up for what you believe is just and fair   i am still waiting for it to happen  and i encourage everyone else following this sub to strive for it  a real  nationwide general labor strike  we already know this is where it hurts the man - that's why they forced kids back in school and us back to work  they must maintain their power and wealth  it is all they have  knowing that  we should be busy rising up   alright  speech over  dick the rich ,jdr3pr

363,The Story of a Lazy Man,once upon a time there was a very lazy man  he was so lazy that he didn t even chew his food  seeing that he did not want to work at all  all the peasants in the village decided to hang him because he was not a good example for their community  one day two villagers went to the lazy man s house  they put him in a cart and took him to the gallows  on the way to the gallows they met a lady  she did not know anything about the lazy man  she thought he was ill and those two villagers would take him to the doctor  the villagers told her that he was lazy not ill and they were taking him to the gallows because he was not a good example for their community  when the lady heard that  she felt pity for the lazy man  she decided to shelter him in her barn where she had plenty of crumbled bread for him to eat   what a lucky man  he is so lazy and has got a lot of good luck  said the villagers   wanna go there  they asked him   is the bread softened enough  asked the lazy man   what a question  i can t believe my ears  you can soak it by yourself  can t you  said the lady   what do you think  wanna soak the bread by yourself or not  the villagers asked the lazy man   no way  said the lazy man   i prefer being hung to soaking the bread by myself  let s go to the gallows  added the lazy man  on hearing that the lady told the villagers the lazy man deserved to be hung  so the villagers took him to the gallows  thus all the villagers got rid of the lazy man  since then nobody in that village has dared to be lazy any more ,je1rwt

369,It's just a question of time,i think it's just a matter of time before nobody has to work anymore because it's just not worth it anymore  for example  i am currently working as a warehouse worker and nowadays there are already automatic warehouses that only need very few workers because almost everything runs automatically  there are not many warehouses yet that work like this because it is still quite expensive now  but over time it will become cheaper and fewer and fewer people will be needed  these are still relatively simple tasks  but if you look at the development in terms of artificial intelligence and so on  i think that it is only a question of time before it is simply no longer worth hiring people  i think that one might introduce some kind of tax for the machines that every company pays to the state every month for each machine and with these taxes that are paid for the machines one could then give the people so everyone would have money without working  i know the whole thing is probably a bit more complicated  these are just a few thoughts i had  sorry for bad english it's not my native language ,jdnx4q

450,The Time Paradox,just had a realization while i was staring at myself in the bathroom mirror as i washed my hands  preparing to return to my cubicle   i was thinking about how i ve been here for almost five years  and i imagined one of the new guys asking me about it  he s only been here for about a year  in my mind i told him the time flew by  i also saw other coworkers in my mind who have mentioned to me that  before they knew it  it s been 10 years  15 years  20  whatever amount of time  they all say the same thing to me  i laughed to myself because i m going on 5 years as of february and i realized how weird it is that every individual day i am here seems to take an eternity  sitting in my cube  realizing it s only 11am and that i still have to be here for another six hours before i can go home just as an example  it s almost 4 30pm where i am woohoo  yet for as long as each day seems to take  the last five years feels like it s just raced by    that s the real mystery  that each day here feels like an eternity but time is also flying by simultaneously ,jbyr2u
451,"""But what about my health care plan?"" A story of how I quit my corporate job",i originally posted this in  r simpleliving  but someone told me that i should also post it here since it might be helpful to some people here   this is just my story  not a guide or advice  just something that happened to me  maybe it'll resonate with some of you   ---------   but what about my health care plan  i asked myself   what will happen if i get sick or get injured  can i really afford to quit  how can i pay my medical bills   let's take a step back and look at my stats at this point  it's 2016     24 years old male   working as a tech consultant for 3 years straight out of college   saw a doctor exactly one time since getting employed--to remove a mole on the back of my head  aka purely cosmetic   not exactly the shining example of a person who should be worried about health care  why am i worrying about losing my ultra premium corporate insurance policy   ---------   but what about my health care plan   that was the response i gave to myself when faced with the decision to quit my corporate job  not  how am i going to buy food  or  what am i going to do for a living  or even  what's my next job  no  i was worried about my health insurance when faced with this life-changing decision   all the blogs i've ever read on the subject all parrot the same  advice    1  make sure you have another job lined up 2  make sure to interview   job hunt while you still are employed 3  keep your resume up to date 4  don't give up   but holy shit  how am i supposed to spend 40  hours a week reaching out to recruiters  polishing my resume  practicing interview questions  when my soul is already dead by the time 6pm rolls around and all i want to do is melt my brain with some youtube anime clips   not to mention  none of the blogs i've read talked about losing your health care plan   ---------  it's may 2016  exactly 3 years after i graduated college and exactly 3 years since i joined my first corporate job  how did i know that  i wasn't keeping track like a prisoner making marks on the wall--i didn't need to  i had linkedin  every year i get a shiny new red notification congratulating me on my work anniversary   i need to get the hell out of here   but what about my health plan  i can't quit  then i have to figure out the whole obamacare thing and what the hell is a state marketplace  it's illegal to not have healthcare now  what does that mean  will they come and arrest me   what about my health plan  i can't quit   ---------  one month later  june 2016  after a month of back and forth with my inner self  opening countless tabs about unemployment health benefits and closing them immediately once it gets too nerve-racking   i realize something  huge   it wasn't really about the health plan   it never was and it never will be   it's not the health plan  it's my 401 k  wait no  its my employee stock benefits  no wait actually  it's my eoy bonus  but wait what about my vested stock options   a million different reasons i couldn't quit   i was like a little kid--afraid of the broomstick in his closet because his imagination turned it into the boogeyman    the only way to convince myself that the boogeyman is not real is to just open the door  and maybe piss myself in the process   ----   edit  for some reason people keep assuming that i don't have health insurance  i do have health insurance  but that wasn't the point of this post ,jca0sd

453,Sick of seeing job postings without compensation information. RANT,i completely loathe when i am looking at job listings and there are pages and pages of listings that explain what is required of the potential employee  and nothing about what the employer provides  as if we are all just working for fun free and are seeking employment at their establishment because it would be some sort of privilege to work there without context  businesses should be providing information on what they provide to their employees - wages  benefits  hours of operation  etc  all i am seeing  however  is a strict syllabus outlining everything required of the candidate s  as if their lives should revolve around the business  they are written like college courses rather than a place to make money to survive  no thank you  i bypass all listings like this  they come off as arrogant  it is hilarious to see so many postings like this  with pages and pages detailing strict  thorough and complicated job details and what is expected without any compensation information - these posts are typically for minimum wage positions  it is sad  and disgusting   too much is expected for low pay and yet employers cannot even be bothered putting in proper compensation and benefits information  at the least  we have lives and families of our own  withholding such information on listings suggest that business job should come first  everything else last  things have to change  slave-like labor  brainwashing  and exhaustive work-culture needs to change  ones value and self worth should not be dictated by the job career that they hold  postings like this are becoming more abundant  we need to end the notion that work is a 1 way street of what we can do for employers  and realize that it is a 2 way street ,jbycbv
454,I'm about to be homeless and I keep on being exploited. I feel like I'm going insane.,i hope this doesn't get taken down  but i recently lost my job again just after two days of working and i'm about to be homeless in a few days  i just left california to go to another state because i lost my job and i couldn't afford it anymore  the last 2 jobs i had were from temp agencies and in every single one i didn't get a write up  a warning or anything  i would just get a text message that my assignment has ended  no  i'm not going to act like i'm a perfect worker and i go above and beyond  but i was just working at a normal pace  the worst thing that people said was that i was quiet  i really don't understand what being quiet has to anything if i'm doing my job     the first job i got fired from was amazon  i have a post about that  i got fired because i was told i had over an hour of tot  it was because i switched my device and forgot to log in and the manager said they would  check the cameras  of course they didn't and said they saw that i wasn't doing anything for an hour and i was  the second job was right after this one  i was working as well  i was working for 2 weeks  the manager didn't seem to have an issue with me  but one night i forgot to get a clip to clip some of the boxes because we needed those and some people at the warehouse were making a big deal about it and talking about me and asking me if i needed help  i said no  i'm fine i just didn't know we needed a clip and the next day i received a message that my assignment has ended  i couldn't afford to stay in the state anymore and told my landlord and the first thing out of his mouth was  but what about my  300  i was worried about homelessness and he was just worried about getting his  300  he doesn't do shit  he bought another house so he can rent out the living room and 3 rooms so he was making at least 4 grand a month from people including me  he pretended like he was so concerned but said i needed to leave early because i didn't have  300 to give him    my most recent job i was fired from i only worked 2 days  i wasn't even on my phone  chatting with people  or taking hour long bathroom breaks  the fucking person that was teaching me even said i was going well  the only thing people kept talking about was how quiet i was and i'm still wondering why does it matter  i got a message 2 days ago saying my assignment ended  no warning  nothing  i've been crying myself to sleep and waking up crying ever since then and no one cares     my ex boyfriend still lives with his dad and said he would ask him if i could stay with him  i ended up having to talk to him and he was kind of passive aggressive  he asked me if i was evulated for a mental illness and i said no and all i could think was why do you think something is wrong with me  he's also a pastor and said i needed the holy ghost and i just started getting really offended and annoyed and started to get an attitude  he said i could stay on his bus  but i'm starting to think it's not a good idea  i'm sure in his mind he thinks i'm just slow and i need to be  healed  and he wants to take credit when i get another job and i'm able to leave  i'm an atheist anyway  so all of shit doesn't matter to me anyway  at this point i'm starting to think i'd rather figure it out on the streets instead of being exploited by some pastor     i'm not saying i'm perfect  but shit happens and i've had a lot of bad things happen to me  i've grown up with an abusive family  has been bullied and isolated most of my life  for people that are going to ask me or tell me that i should go back to my family i'd rather not  when i was there my mom was in a competition with me jealous of me and would take most of the money i made  on top of that i had to pay over  600 a month in giving her money for whatever she wanted  the internet bill  and our phone bill before anyone just asks  why dont u just tell her no  she would proceed to beat me  tell me how ungrateful i'm  take my money anyway and then i would be gaslighted by my entire family to just do what she says i'm just so tired of being treated like trash  i can't even cry anymore  why does it have to be like this  why do people think i'm less than because i'm about to be homeless  because i'm not extroverted and i don't want to be bubbly to random people at work that don't give a fuck about me  my life has to come to this i can't even put into words how defeated i feel ,jbyo8f

478,Took me less than 2 minutes to lose all respect for the new HR manager.,we had are employee of the quarter meeting for the night shift the other day  it's nothing to crazy  few gift cards  a cheap meal and they tell us how hard we're working without having to give us raise    so the new hr lady late 20's-early 30's  introduces herself and gives a little speech about how happy she's been to be here these past 4 months and yadda yadda yadda  she also took off her mask to give this speech 5 feet in front of everyone like i don't mind having a seat apart between me and my coworker eating panda express outside for the meeting  are crew is around 10 people so i feel like it's a bit safer then interacting with new people everyday    anyways she goes on about how she went to all the stores and how all the sales people were talking about what a great job the night shift warehouse crew was doing and how they were saying something along the line of  you're the real heroes  or something along that line   i rolled my eyes and just imagined that doubt meme most of the sales people don't even know that are shift exists  let alone know what we do to compliment on all the  hard work  we do  i hate when management brings up the phrase  hard work  when there talking about the work we do  like you acknowledge how physically demanding odd hours and all the hours we work  yet only a few of us got  1 raises this year and everyone else got nothing despite how well the company is doing   she could of said that directly to us with out pretending it was coming from someone else  i figured she was just nervous and wanted to say something nice to us until she shifted her speech into how she was talking to the salespeople at the stores and mentioned to them that she had to go to this employee of the quarter meeting for the night shift right after  and how all the salespeople were telling her how dedicated to the job and amazing she was for a few minutes   at this point red flags are going off in my brain and i'm like this person borderline narcissist  thats when she left so we could enjoy are food  she was there for like 5 minutes and left me with a impression that i should not trust her ,jcl0wp
479,The American Public school system will be the literal death of me,its disgusting how the american public schools are modelled to shape the  best workers   the people who have the best grades and sacrifice their mental health  time  and energy are usually the a  students   i've ruled out for myself that i cant keep doing this bullshit any longer    i hate waking up extra early  asking to go anywhere in school including bathrooms  im almost 18 ffs  doing so much busy work and piling assignments  not getting enough times to do my hobbies  feeling like shit  taking shit from teachers who love the shifted power dynamic   this whole system was designed to break people down  i went into high school as a determined freshman  i could do 10th grade math  i had a college reading level  i was happy  now i'm basically depressed  stuck at the same level  and i try to pass classes instead of enjoying learning  i spent my first day at physical school crying for 2 hours because one of the teachers  got fired  did something inappropriate and being in that class brought me ptsd   also i hate how much pressure im under as college approaches  im struggling with school and my mom wants me to do sports  extra curriculars   and homework  fuck you college  capitalism  and the american public school system  i refuse to go after the horrid experience that is hs  and i won't go to experience a  sense of community  and freedom for crippling debt ,jcphga

483,"Hate my boss, so I’m thinking about tossing fecals all over his office before he comes in and walking out like a boss",pretty much title  but i m a bit worried if the piece of shit will call the cops on me  lmao what you guys think  this  of course  will have to be a few months from now ,jcn07f
484,The thought of having to work for the rest of my life makes me want to kill myself,i honest to god do not see the point in existing if i m just going to be doing shit i don t want to do for 90  of the rest of my life  my current job is 8-5 with an hour lunch  and a 30 minute commute each way  that s 10 hours of my 16 waking hours  by the time i get home  make dinner  do the dishes  and watch half an hour of tv  it s time to go to bed and start all over  at best i could shave a couple of work hours off of this routine if i managed to find a different job that was closer  i m 23  the idea of doing this shit for the next 40  years seriously makes me want to put a bullet in my head  work sucks the life out of me to the point i don t even have enough energy to play video games 90  of the time  i feel trapped  like i m suffocating  and all anybody can say is  everybody has to work  or  i don t know what to tell you  if the only two options for me actually are work like this or die  death seems like the more appealing choice  if i m already this fed up i can t imagine it being any better 5  10  20 years from now  i always used to tell myself i wouldn t kill myself because it would mentally destroy my mom  but she died over a year ago now  so i don t even have that to keep me going  i don t see what the point of being alive is if all i m going to do is work  come home  and go back to work again    this concludes my long unintelligible rant ,jbe7r4
485,"Once you leave, they won’t even remember your name..",so my boss yesterday was asking me whether i still do a task that the girl in my position before me started doing  her exact words were   do you still do what  what was her name  the girl who worked here before you  do you still do that task she started    the girl who worked here before me was here for 3 years and worked directly with my boss  kind of made me realise that  you can bust your ass for your employer  but once you re gone  they won t even remember your name lol,jc9r98
486,Pet peeves about overtime,there's this weird subservient expectation that you have to be willing to accept any overtime opportunity  i understand that it's necessary for broke people  but none of my coworkers are broke  they are so happy to have to work another 15 hours yet they make twice as much as me  they don't need to work more   i refuse to work overtime if it's not a real emergency  ie  snowstorms  i always get questioned about it by everyone within earshot  i don't hate my job but i just want to go home and relax  i need time to cook a healthy meal and do nothing  most of them complain about too little time and are always eating junk -- no sense of irony  i eat like junk  too  because work saps my energy  i need  less  of it   my involvement with work starts at 7am and ends at 3pm  monday through friday  if you want more  you should have put that in the job description    my last point  i work so i can afford to live and enjoy my time while i'm alive  if i don't have time because i'm working too much  then my job isn't doing its job    maybe people should be paid a reasonable wage without the necessity of overtime ,jb44th
487,Basically got called out in a meeting today,i work for a relatively small company with a very small  tech department   it's just me  my boss  and a senior developer  we have been kind of crunching over the past several months and working late fairly frequently    i also take a full hour lunch break every day   i legitimately feel guilty for doing it  because i'm aware that my boss doesn't take any breaks at all  and my coworker takes like 5-10 minute lunch breaks and works while eating   in a meeting today  that went an hour and a half past 5  my coworker said to us that  we  need to really buckle down and work harder and  not take hour lunch breaks   obviously a jab at me since it's just me him and my boss   working from home every day is really starting to bother me  it feels like i'm always at work   i'm frustrated and i guess i just needed to vent ,jcn8jt

489,Sometimes I think collapse would be fun just to see HR and corporate goons panic,obviously i would be the first to go in such a scenario being the polar opposite of a rugged survivalist but such is my hatred for hr and those who absorb the corporate culture philosophy into their very being  that in a post-apocalyptic world  i don't think they'd thrive as they do currently    my issue with this world is how utterly restrictive it is  i'm under no illusion that a post apocalyptic world would be better  it would be horrific  but part of the appeal of the fantasy is that the old structures  which you are forced to conform to  would be destroyed  this would tie in with the appeal of fantasy novels  if you were struggling in your village  you could go off on a quest and do well elsewhere  this option has probably always been lacking in one way or another in the human world as most humans are pack animals and homogeneity is inevitable from the eusocial nature of human behaviour  this is also the problem with the corporate working world  if you are unable to conform  then you're out of sight  out of mind  the corporate world is so obsessively  compulsively restrictive with its criteria for the  acceptable employee  that loads of people are going to be excluded and the hikikomori in japan are a testament to that    anyway  it's partly just imagining a freer world and watching the tables finally being turned on those smug robots we call hr workers  actually if anyone has stories of getting one up on hr please share ,jbrhkf

499,Y’all realize that we’re just slaves right? Crops of the rich.,for example  the rich own the government  everyone knows this  at least they should  the rich lobby  meaning they pay our representatives money to introduce new laws  or say yes or no to certain laws  they control what laws and rights exist  they fund campaigns  which means they use their money to get certain people into office  yes this includes presidents  and in return the people in office give power control to the rich or give them favors    the rich control the government so much that they own the military  how do we know this  the government has lied to us  created fake terrorists attacks  ect  to make us  the citizens  be okay with going to war with certain countries  afghanistan  vietnam  ect  what do they do in those countries  well we know that as well  they over throw the governments  or encourage the citizens to over throw the governments through manipulation  then companies swoop in and steal all of the countries resources  just like in old times  we have war to steal resources  companies also do this without war  in many ways  basically giving countries loans to help them industrialize and progress  the countries do  but end up not being able to pay the loans back  and they fall deep into debt  the countries then have to sell all of the oil to the companies at super cheap prices  to get out of debt  basically just scamming countries  tricking them into selling off their resources at a small fraction of the would be original price   so how does slavery mainly come into this    well we are crops  it s illegal to live without working  what  how  you can t fish  you can t build a house  collect rain water  in many places  use solar panels to get electricity  in many places  live on  or own land  hunt  dig wells to get your own water  trade crops or supplies with other people  ect  without all paying the government money  constantly  you have to pay the government money to do all of those things  the things required to be free and not work  meaning you can t be free and not work  you can try to find a way to live without working but you won t be able to  it s set up this way  you cannot live without working  without breaking one of these laws  you either work or go to jail  if you try to keep your freedom and resist jail  you die  for the non conformists  it s work or die  there is no option to remain free  slave or die   have you ever wondered why when countries go to war they don t just bomb the rich  or the government  or the individuals in power   have you ever wondered  the ones in power are the ones who did the wrong  they are the ones in control  why do they bomb and attack the citizens instead   because citizens are crops  money machines  all of the large bombings  like hiroshima  they didn t bomb the powerful people in control  they bombed large cities  why  money  they wanted to harm the elites crop  their power  their wealth  same as burning a farmers cornfield    you are a crop  a pawn  a slave  put in a system you don t question  you conform  do your job  die   why do we do this  because everyone else is doing it  it s  normal  people naturally like to follow the herd  and conform  it s also because we are put in a position that makes us comfortable  it s risky to seek out something better  it s easier and more assuring to just stay put and be comfortable  our brains are hardwired to fear the unknown  to stay away from it unless absolutely necessary  to enjoy being comfortable  and to dislike change  the people in power use this to their advantage  they put us in a place just comfortable enough  so that we decide to accept it how it is  and not strive for something better  for the unknown  the risky  and the uncomfortable  we also do it because we think luxuries  air conditioning  house  car  cell phone  internet  ect  will make us happy  when they don t  yes  they give us small hits of dopamine  but not true happiness  they often make life a little bit easier too  but thats not what s going make us happy  just comfortable  i want you to go look at videos of kids in africa  the ones who are living in huts  the ones in the forest  who have food  and water  they are the happiest people you will ever see  truly happy  learn from them  their primitive lifestyle is what makes them happy  if they wanted to live in our society they easily could  but they choose to keep living how they re living  they ve figured something out most of us haven t    if we all woke up  realized the truth  and decided to change we could get rid of this system  live in peace and harmony  be happy  we could be growing all of our own food  getting our own water  having farms and cattle  living nice  happy  primitive lifestyles    question  why has the number of depressed and unhappy citizens increased 1000s of times within the last 200 years  society  the state of it  humans are not meant to be like this  live like this  we need to wake up  we need to wake each other up  we need to change ,jbd8mh

598,Am I in the wrong here?,a brief synopsis  last july i took a retail pharmacy gig as a technician  i ended up transferring to another store that november because they offered more hours weekly and the store was in an overall better neighborhood with  what i thought  would be a better customer base  it was a nightmare from the get go  the store was woefully understaffed  the management wasn't great  the department manager ended up leaving about 6 or 7 weeks into my tenure there  now we had an understaffed  undertrained  and undermanaged store  i was already planning my exit from the company at that point  i decided to ask for a raise and was told i'd receive  1 50 more per hour by the store manager  i ended up only getting  1 20 and wasn't told of this till i checked my online pay stub a few weeks later as we are paid bi-weekly  then covid hit  i was then stiffed  150 by the company when receiving my pandemic bonus pay  by this point i stopped talking to most of the staff and my direct supervisors  i showed up  looked miserable  did my job  made no small talk  and went home  i also held out of work  and made it known  for a few days while corporate investigated my bonus pay situation  they ended up ruling against me and said  tough luck    the new department head is a woman in her late 20's who's extremely condescending and unprofessional  we don't get along at all  the other day we had a power outage and the automatic med counters went down as a result  she whipped a full bottle of pills in my direction out of anger and missed me by mere inches  i'm starting to show up less and less  i've always been reliable in the past  but i'm starting to wear down and don't care much anymore  i'm on auto-pilot  last saturday i tweaked my lower back and i was having spasms  so about two and a half hours into my shift i told them i was going home to get some meds for the discomfort  i never went back that day  i really don't like my co-workers  i hate my bosses  i'm over the bs  am i the one in the wrong for essentially pouting and being a cold jerk to my co-workers during my shifts  or is it justified  i'm salty  what do you think ,j8vifq

604,Starting a new job today after 6 months unemployed,back in march  i was hired for a new job at a new company  i wasn't able to start because i was immediately furloughed due to covid  my area has opened up enough now that the company is bringing people off furlough  so i start today   by all accounts  i will like this job  i like the company  i like the people i've spoken to  the workload and pay are all  seemingly  fair  but i legitimately cannot stop being upset that i have to give up my daily freedom to go back into the workforce    sure  being unemployed was difficult  we had to cut back a lot  even moving to a new place to cut down on costs  but i spent 24 hours a day doing whatever i wanted  i got to see new areas of town  spend more time with my so which made us grow even closer  and pick up new hobbies  it was really fun  and i wouldn't trade it for anything  but the money has run out  i've got to start this job  and i've got to stay in it for a while   i feel extremely disappointed to have to return to sitting at a desk for the majority of my waking hours  to have to put on my  phone voice  attend meetings  deal with difficult clients  and make small talk with new colleagues whether i like them or not  i don't want to get up early each day  eat reheated lunch at my desk  and come home to rest for a few hours and do it again  my last job was abusive and cruel a lot of the time  and i cannot fathom having to deal with anything like that again  i am riddled with anxiety that maybe all jobs are the same  and i should expect the same level of disrespect and lack of empathy i received at my last job  i am full of anxiety about all the things i won't get to do while i'm working  and how this is my life until i  hopefully  have enough money to retire  i'm 24  so we're looking at 40  more years of this   most of the folks i know irl would tell me to suck it up  and maybe that's what i need to do  this morning i am just disappointed ,j9sd66

637,Taking a job after an interview is like getting married after a first date.,today i found myself asking  how did i get here  in regards to my current job  because i'm a smart ass i said you applied and got the job   i could not have possibly known all the shit that i would have experienced in this job simply from that cookie cutter everybody be on their best behavior interview    so then i thought i need to ask some real   but respectful and professional  questions of the hiring group in the future   for my current job i needed to know that the leader of the team is a controlling tyrant  i needed to know that work always comes in but rarely gets finished  i needed to know that the culture  how people feel about coming into work  sucked  it's like im married and found out my spouse has a fetish for kicking kittens while sniffing dryer sheets  if i had known what i know now i would not have taken this job     now i'm on a mission to make up real people interview questions not  so what are you looking for in an ideal candidate  any thoughts ,j9zv86

639,Work is Awful,work is absolutely terrible   i hate it so much  my job is work from home and i'm still miserable  i could never go back to an office  i try to do all sorts of other stuff while doing my job but it's still torture  the days are damn long and i couldn't give a single shit about anyone who wants and feels entitled to my help  my irritation and anger level is off the charts and it stays there all fucking day   fuck corporate america  it's clear they couldn't give any less of a shit about their employees  they pay you half what you really should get and use and abuse you for your labor  labor is used for profit  that's all it is  the people who profit are the ones up top  how little can we pay them to make them have to keep coming back endlessly  this is all about using people at the bottom to make the wealthy richer who don't want to share any of it  i can't even contain how bored and utterly crushed my soul is from doing this the last 5 years  i'm not even 30 yet   my attitude is terrible and i don't care  sick and tired of slaving away to benefit other people  8 hours a day everyday  life's a joke    and i thought school sucked ,japfu0
640,Do you guys use drugs?,i know it s kinda a weird question but i constantly feel like one of my biggest motivations to  keep working hard everyday  is essentially  well  drugs  i work 60-80 hours a week  don t really dread my life when i wake up because i know my next day off will be great  i take usually two days off every three months just to trip balls and i feel like it recharges my battery in a way  i get to meditate about what i ve been through the past few months since my last hippy break  i recently took such a break and had a great time but it dawned on me that my lifestyle is super unhealthy  working just to afford to live in an expensive area  never taking a day off  always picking up shifts so i can get extra hours in  and when i do take a day off it s usually to do drugs   but on the other hand these breaks have been my motivation in a way  i don t think everyday that i m doing this to take a break  well not most days  and i just feel like a junky sometimes  chemicals are really the only thing that make me truly happy  the everyday experiences i have at work aren t enough to live a fulfilling life so i can eat a stamp and live the longest  most fun  and happiest 14 hours with the people i love    idk what the goal of this post besides me just wondering how you guys make it through the year because i sometimes feel like the only way i do it without k wording myself by december is keeping my self  sane  with substances ,j9aaxv

642,"I don't hate Capitalism because I hate life, I hate Capitalism because I LOVE life and want to be allowed to live it.",i want freedom from a mass of humans that thinks giving up all but 2 days a week counts as living in a free country  i want to be able to be alive without other humans demanding things of me at threat of death  i don't hate life  i love it  but under the circumstances given to us  we're not allowed to live it to even close to it's fullest potential    i'm not asking for permission to be myself  i'm not thankful for the people who provide just enough of my needs to not let me literally die  not asking to die isn't asking for anything  if you reproduce under this system then you did the asking  you asked for another human to have needs  not me  i would never under any circumstance reproduce under a system where my child's lifestyle has already been predetermined for them  and i don't feel bad for those that do  telling me that it's unfair makes no sense  it's your fucking system  yours  not mine  i would never worship money the way the people around me do   it's like capitalists forget that we're doing is their way  they're  winning  so why are you telling me that unfair situations happen under your system  that it's unfair for anyone to have to take care of anyone else  we fucking know  that's entire reason for opting out in the first place  we know your system values human life so little that families are forced to take care of their own  we know you value human life so little that you think a system that has homeless people in it is functioning  stop trying to make me feel bad that your system is a complete failure  i don't fucking care  i want to see it die and be replaced by something functioning  telling me about all the unfair situations capitalism creates and how i should be on board with helping to negate them makes no sense     i'm  not  a  capitalist    what you decide to do with us is up to you  it's your system  stop telling me i should feel bad that it's a piece of shit  i know  that's why i'm not taking part in it  and i advise everyone who can opt out and live off of capitalists to do the same  it's their system  it's their idea  it's their problem  every time they whine about your existence  they prove our point   it's not faiiiiiiiiir for people to have to take care of you   yeah  no fucking god damn shit  your system is a failure and can't even come to terms with the fact that humans shouldn't be starved to death  and if we do let people starve to death  many  many  many  unfair  situations are going to arise  again as a non-capitalist  i loooove hearing them whine about their failure of a system  keep crying  keep complaining about us  because the number of people opting out is increasing  your system is only going to get more and more unfair until even the most selfish of capitalists will have to admit it's a failure that has overstayed it's welcome    until then  i'm gonna be smoking weed  playing videos  and laughing at crying capitalist ,j8qqka
643,I hate college so far,i'm not sure if this fits the sub so let me know if it doesn't and i'll take it down  for a little over a month now i've been taking online classes at the local community college  i'm taking 4 classes and the work has been pretty easy  but it has completely taken over my life    i struggle with an autoimmune disease that makes me tired all the time so i need more sleep than most people  and my days have turned into waking up  doing school work and chores  eating and then going back to sleep  the fact that people can go to school full time and still work 1 or 2 jobs blows my mind  especially since i'm not working and school feels like a whole ass job in itself   i was excited at the beginning of the semester  but my enthusiasm is dread now and i dread every due date and zoom meeting days before they're even required  i was determined not to procrastinate this semester but my anxiety and depression have been eating me alive  at this point i'm convinced college might not be for me  but i'm terrified by what that would mean for my future  college has always been a part of my plan  and every shitty retail slave job i've had has sucked the life out of me   i've been trying to keep my frustrations on the dl because i don't want my family to know how much i hate my life right now  because i'm not even working so it shouldn't be this difficult for me  i especially hate thinking about doing this for the next few years just to get a shitty degree then go waste the rest of my life working a job i hate so that i can be financially stable ,j8ouxs

646,I actually cried sitting in my car in a Walmart parking lot.,i haven t cried since my grandpa died a couple year ago  it s just not something i regularly do  even if i m extremely upset  however  today i was early for work  i parked and sat staring out the window at the freeway and the world   welcome to the machine  by pink floyd starting playing    the cars continue endlessly zooming by  i shift my eyes towards walmart s stiff tan walls then towards the cart pushers running around the parking lot  i actually started to fucking tear up  for my entire life  all around me  i see people stressing and groveling  for what    we follow  success  like ants blinding following a pheromone trail  however  that success is never enough  work harder  hustle  make money  get ahead  everyone tells me this  but nobody tells me fucking why   there s just something so cold about it all  something so lifeless and metallic  purposeless and self perpetuating  why can t i  just live a modest and content life  why do i have to step on others  sell all my precious time  and brag about doing so  why is this so widely accepted   as kids  we always talked about how we couldn t wait to grow up and get a job  adults would always warn us to  enjoy your time now  and  wait until you see the real world  why does it have to be like this  why do people have to spend every ounce of their energy  willpower  dreams just to scrape by   maybe i m a bit naive  but the more i look around  it all just seems like a big fucking waste  i worked my ass off in high-school to get into college  now  i m working endless hours with low wage to pay off ridiculous college costs  there  i learn how to work  then  i work until i die  or until i m too old to enjoy life    i m not saying i don t want to work at all  i m just saying that this society seems so fucked  everyone always seems to treat everything like it s normal  absurd health bills  student debt  pointless hours  low wages  toxic cultures  ignorant politicians  brainwashed masses  hoarded wealth  poverty  obesity  ignorance  etc  i m only 18 and i m already so sick of it all ,j8z4wl
647,Increasing Abstraction of Work,work is becoming more and more meaningless  we are in a time where we should be beyond it  but are still stuck in it   our souls were created for play  not work   here's an example of where we are currently at   so we have a virtual widget  let's call it a shape   the company in charge of the shape employs many people   each one has a task   refine the shape  plan the shape  analyze the shape  program and maintain the shape  create new shapes  have countless meetings about such shape  compete with competitors and their shapes  and of course  market the shape to consumers   the question must be asked  do we really need the shape  do we honestly need more shapes  can we live without it   if we can  how can we say that each person employed is doing any semblance of meaningful work   it is all abstraction  we are creating work for the sake of work  instead of simplification   employees are not growing food  they are hacking a shape to consumers  telling them that they need the shape when they can easily do without   the shape may even be harmful in the long run  but of course  the company doesn't care  profit above all   thus we are more and more having a great disconnect between work and reality   we are creating more work when we should be creating less   work for the sake of work   we need to move beyond somehow and do without ,j9qkfv

650,Burnt out from a job I don’t yet have *mini rant*,i m new to this sub  but have to say i have agreed with most of y all s ideas for quite a while  i am a student at a top university and will be graduating this fall with a ba  my peers around me are insanely intelligent  but so money driven and barely take care of themselves just to maintain a perfect social image  grades  and work  volunteer  research experience  etc  i just can t keep up anymore  my physical and mental health has deteriorated and for what  on all accounts  the job market is dismal right now  i switched majors from a much more lucrative bs program to a program that i truly love as a ba  and i know that i m going to take a major l in my vocational life for that switch  the worst part is  people around me  including friends  are getting rewarded for their shitty behaviours in research programs or in the workplace  and it s so toxic    i m so fucking burned out already and i haven t even started full-time work yet  on paper  i have decent qualifications  but nothing stellar compared to those around me  and not only that  but in applying for jobs i have to sell myself at an even higher level than i currently am at  as if i haven t done enough in my undergraduate career  ive been screwed over by summer employment bosses and my university for so long and yet i have to pay for that experience  it all feels like a god damn game and you have to cheat to win   tldr  getting passed up for jobs by my peers that sacrifice their physical and mental health and cheat the system to work their way to the top  i see no promising jobs opening up in my field anytime soon  and no matter what experience i ve acquired it never seems to be enough  i have dealt with enough shitty bosses and research supervisors for one lifetime and i m not even 23 ,ja4fz2

652,Just got fired,well  i just got off the phone with my boss about 15 minutes ago and i've been terminated due to too many absences  unfortunately  i struggle a lot with my mental health and a lot of days i have a very difficult time functioning and quite frankly  absolutely no will to live  i have been dealing with this since i was 10 years old  and i'm now about to turn 26  so  not having a will to live does make it difficult to get out of bed somedays and i've been dealing with this for more than half of my life thus far  and i likely always will    thankfully  my boss said i will be eligible for re-hire and i told him about my mental health issues and i was told that once i get things figured out am doing better mentally  i can be re-hired   still  it really fucking sucks and i have no idea what i'm going to do with myself ,jail70
653,a quick vent yet again,i really just need to get this off my chest   as you know  i ve posted here before about being 16 and having a shitty convenience store job  well i ve just about had it with the mistreatment from my boss    yesterday was supposed to be my day off to catch up on schoolwork and such  but she called me in and i truthfully dont have the backbone to say no  mondays are one of our busiest days  which is why i tend to take that off    i went to work  4 50 am  and there were people there at the door waiting for me  i tell them we arent open yet  and to please wait  they say ok  i unlock the doors and go in to shut off the alarm and they follow me in  so im like whatever  and get going    later that morning a creep that comes in and sees me on my normal shift for solely just to hit on me comes in and i already know how the day will be  he talks to me for like 20 minutes while i try to shake him off  even as customers come and go  he doesnt leave    finally when he leaves  my fucking boss shows up  once again telling me to do a million things at once while simultaneously watching the front  i dont know if she thinks i can divide myself into two people or what  then she leaves  comes back about an hour later and asks why i didnt hole-punch the papers for her binder  im like you didnt ask me to  and she was like i left the binder open it was pretty self explanatory im like   then  while im ringing beers our cooler guy comes in  hes probably like 17 and nasty as fuck  so his job is literally to do our coolers and make sure theyre stocked  well i have to carry my beers ive finished to the coolers and i dont want to be running back and forth  so i try to make it in one trip  yeah  that didnt happen  i drop almost all of them on the floor  coming undone from their ring  that s probably 24 beers ive finished that just came apart  and that fucking cooler kid saw it happen and didnt help me  im like 5 2 trying to carry 4 six packs of beers and he thought id make it    so then the highlight was about 30 minutes to finishing my shift  the cappuccino machine starts pouring hot water  like its a swamp  so my boss sticks a bucket under it at an odd angle  and makes me mop it even though i have a line of customers  at this point im so overwhelmed that im about to just walk  i stick a wet floor sign and go to help customers  and im nearing the last one when i hear a loud thud and a splash  the fucking bucket full of water fell over  theres water everywhere  our mop is awful because my boss refuses to get a new one because shes fucking cheap as shit  she ll do anything to save a dime  i fucking hate my greedy cunt boss and the fucking nasty losers who come in   tldr  i hate my fucking boss,ja90on
654,Interested in the different types of people that frequent this subreddit,hey guys  so for a while now i've been curious about the backgrounds of people on this thread   for example  what drew you to antiwork as a concept   did you used to be a workaholic or were you always antiwork   and what field s  have you worked in before   i will admit to an ulterior motive in asking this question  i want to gauge how easily the idea of antiwork can spread among people with diverse work histories ,j9g76q

667,Am I The Problem?,firstly  this is a rant open discussion  i am struggling quite a bit right now so appreciate anyone who reads and offers their view   i see a lot of people on here talking about how they d be fine if they could just work 20 hours a week and get paid a reasonable wage   i live in the uk  and i know that reddit is heavily usa dominated so i m aware that your laws around vacation days  sick days etc  are much worse than ours  this gives further weight to the stuff i m about to say  up until december last year i was working a job which had the following features   is in the public sector  so not a soulless corporation making money for someone else  5 days a week  but with flexi-time and i wasn t encourage to work more than my hours  reasonable wage  23 000 or  28 000   i wouldn t call it interesting or fulfilling  but i also wouldn t say it was stressful   in short  i had it pretty good relative to most people  certainly a lot of people i read about on this subreddit  now  this subreddit has always resonated with my view of work  i find it cathartic coming here because it s so nice to not feel like i m going crazy when i voice my opinions to other people only to be told  well what s your solution  you have to work  or  that s the way it is   then  in december  my boss tells me she s so happy with how i m doing  i don t work especially hard  it s just a job  i have no passion for it  that she wants me to go for a promotion which has just opened up  now  this position is a promotion  it is a big  big step-up  and it is part-time  it s a considerable raise  even with my hours being slashed  it s a lot more responsibility  and i am woefully underqualified   i tell my friends and family about this  and they seem confused angry that i m not particularly enthused by it  to me  it just seemed like inviting a lot of pressure and anxiety  and while part-time work for a good wage has always been my goal  i didn t know if i was ready for the step-up   sidenote but relevant  i have struggled with my mental health for the past few years and went through a prolonged period of dealing with suicidal ideation 2 years ago  i went to therapy  went on meds  came off meds  i m doing better now  i still have issues but it s a lot better  however that period really knocked my self confidence and left me with a lot of anxiety   anyway  i decided to go for the job and just see how the application interview goes as i can always say no if they offer it to me and i decide not to do it  so i do the application  i get an interview  the whole time i m thinking  what the hell is happening  i am underqualified  inexperienced  if i get this job  i m going to be found out  i feel like i m in some horrible social experiment where i will walk into the interview and they will laugh at me for thinking i would be suitable  this may sound irrational  but it is what i was thinking   anyway  i do the interview  it goes very well and they offer me the job  i tell my friends and family and they re ecstatic for me  i feel  strange  i m proud of myself  also very scared  i feel ungrateful  and a bit numb  i take the job  it s fixed term for 1 year  i tell myself if i hate it i can quit  i always have that option   so now i am 3 months into this job  this job which is   public sector  22 5 hours a week  i mostly do this  sometimes a couple hours over  most of the time i get a 4-day weekend  thurs - sun   29 000 or  37 000   it s stressful  i have a lot of work and i m almost constantly operating in fear that i will be found out as underqualified and a ridiculous appointment to the role  i have a lot of meetings with very experienced people who are highly qualified in their field  and i am supposedly providing  expert advice  to these people  i get asked a lot of questions i don t know how to answer but somehow make it through  it s very stressful   i hate the 3 days i work  but what i hate even more is that now where i used to not think about work on the weekend  i m now thinking about work all of the time on my days off  i try not to  i really try not to  but it s difficult  a note about this job  i find it no more fulfilling than my last job  only more stressful and busy  i still have no interest in this line of work  i am just sort of falling into it   thursday is relief  followed by anger at how much relief i m feeling  it seems that the more stressed i get  the more angry i get at how stressed i am being made   friday is dread  that i am getting through my weekend and already gearing up to the thought that i will be back on monday   saturday is the same as friday  only i am enjoying my time even less   sunday is horrible  i hate sunday   essentially  my weekend is somehow worse than before  despite having 2 days longer  i feel like all of it is compromised now  rather than just sunday evening where previously i would ve just felt a bit bummed out    you may be reading this and feeling at best jealous  and at worst angry at how ungrateful i sound  i get that  i have attained what so many of you say that you want  and i think i actually feel worse   it begs me to ask - am i the problem  do i just want whatever i don t have  now that i m working less and being paid more  suddenly i kind of want to go back to my old job  the old job  where i would work and then on the weekend complain to people about how work sucks and i wish i didn t have to spend 40 hours there   if only i could work less  well  now i ve got that and i m also miserable  what s that about  surely that isn t healthy  is there something wrong with me   you might say  well you re unhappy because your job is stressful  find a new one  what other job  the one where i work 3 days  earn good money but also have no responsibility or pressures  it doesn t exist  if we re honest  i am incredibly lucky to have the deal that i do have  again  i say lucky as a relative term  i know i don t have to tell you guys that the working world is an absolute sham  and that none of us are lucky to be working   am i just mentally configured to be an unhappy  ungrateful person  no matter what my situation is  that s what it s beginning to feel like   update  i wrote all that 3 months ago but never posted it  i'm now 6 months into the job and i've moved up to full time hours  i'm now earning  49 000 or  63 000  despite not having a degree and no experience at this level  it is a farce how i have got here and as a result i am constantly stressed beyond belief  but i'm making more money than i thought i ever would in my whole life  i don't know what to do   as i said before  i feel like i'm not destined to be a happy person  so i may as well be unhappy and get paid   i don't know what my point is  i'm not happy and i feel like i never will be  and i feel ungrateful   tl dr  guy lucks out on a promotion to a decent money part time role  isn't happy  lucks out further to get paid a lot more  and is arguably even less happy than before  is there  something wrong with him ,j70f87

669,I have come to realize that any job I work at I am always going to be bored,every job i've ever had it doesn't matter if i have a lot of things to do i just always find that i'm bored  my mind wanders and i end up fucking around on my phone or online shopping  i was always bored at my minimum wage retail job but i thought maybe this would go away once i finished college and got an adult job  nope  still bored  i do have adhd so maybe that contributes to it bit does anybody else feel this way ,j7e5r7

672,Just started a new job and I'm getting my ass kicked.,just started a new job about 3 weeks ago  i hit the floor this monday and i'm supposed to have a trainer for a whole month  my trainer took pto for the rest of the month so i'm literally all alone after only 3 days of training  our store is also incredibly short staffed so today when i worked it was me  one other full timer and my store manager  my store manager was in conference calls all day so he was never available to help me and because of that i got yelled at by him   i went to the back to ask for help with a customer  when i did that the other full timer was in the bathroom so my manager yelled at me for that  didnt know that rule  but i understand the rule  i apologized   i brought out two high dollar items for a customer to look at  apparently i'm only supposed to bring out one at a time  i understand but didnt know  i got yelled at  i apologized   i went to the back to ask for my manager to unlock the safe because our register was short  when doing so i brought  3 back with me  cus that was the customers change and i was a dollar short  i just had it in my hand so i brought it with  not allowed to have cash back there cus theres no camera  then he really let me have it  not for just breaking that rule  but for all the rules i broke today    this store is so short staffed that theyre literally closed two days a week to give the employees days off  they closed every store in our district but ours so literally without me this store would have closed too   the training is shit and i'm getting yelled at for everything  fuck this  took a lot for me not to just rage out  and i get to look forward to this for the rest of the month cus i dont have a trainer and fuck me if i ask for help   no wonder all their employees quit  i'll probably remove this post from fear of someone i work with finding it and tracing it back to me  then get yelled at for that too ,j73o5b

677,I have an idea. (Bit of a rant),this system worked significantly better when there were less people in it  now we're trying to make more meaningless jobs  and taking value away from  less desirable  trades  like creative jobs  while people are staying in the workforce longer  so that as many people as possible can have a job to afford to survive   people aren't given a choice anymore  and the jobs that are available are being paid less and less comparatively  families and children are suffering because we don't live in a world were a family can be supported on a single income anymore   no i am not saying women shouldn't work  i'm saying children develop better with either parent at home   i'm sure almost everyone would agree that they are more than willing to contribute  if they actually got to choose how they contributed  and if contributing didn't involve working under pressure  8 hours a day  5 days a week  under the threat of not being able to eat or having a home to go home to   the best thing we could do to fix the current system we have would be to essentially get rid of full time positions    every employee gets the same benefits  and wages increase so you can make a living on part time work  then you can hire more people to do the jobs that are currently available    you'd effectively end unemployment because there would be a surplus of jobs available  and the work life ballance would get much better because people would only be working 20-30 hours a week instead of 40-60    it's already been proven that people are less productive the longer their workday week is  people get burnt-out  we aren't designed to be worker drones    so doing this would have less unemployment  more productivity  happier people as a whole  and more time and money to be put back into the economy    for those who are shortsighted  yes it would mean a significant number of businesses  small ones especially  would go out of business because of the change in financial responsibilities  but the ones that do fail wouldn't have been sustainable in the long run anyway  and we could implement short term government funding to businesses to help them transition   cheaper than supporting everyone who is unemployed due to lack of available work indefinitely  they would also most likely shorten their hours to compensate initially  but supply and demand is still a thing  and we would see businesses reopen and expand hours again with the growing demand for it  the only difference is that now everyone is benefiting from it   unfortunately  i doubt we would ever see this happen because it would mean companies having to actually pay workers a reasonable wage and provide benefits to all of their employees ,j6r372

687,Does anyone else just happen to almost always get fired from jobs for refusing to put up with people’s shit?,i also have aspergers  so it seems like i m almost always the target of mistreatment even by folks who don t even know that i m autistic  upon having met folks in the work places in my past i have been talked down to like i m an incompetent child  which offends me and then makes me wary of that person which thus causes tension between me and that person because i don t say good morning anymore and i start to be a smartass with them   i was fried from work today because of this bullshit   some new girl was hired today and i've been there for only 6 months and they are threw her to me for me to train  the job entails  statusing  subpoena packets all day  and you  status  the packets by entering in on the compex legal services website that you served the subpoena  in this dialogue box on the website  you have to put in a code for the specific type of subpoena packet  and the type of packet i was showing her how to  status  was a  counsel packet  you also have to type in the box the name of the place that it is going to  so i show this girl how to do it  i point at the name of the place on the counsel packet that the packet is being mailed to that she has to type in the dialogue box  and then i tell her the code for the packet that she has to enter in the drop down menu inside the box  and i tell her that's all she has to do  so i'm trying to train her while i have hundreds of priority counsel packets that i have 2 and a half hours to  status  myself so they can be out of the door to the post office by 11 30am while i'm trying to train her at the same time  so i go to my desk to start  statusing  the priority counsel packets quickly  and i ask her does is she okay and does she think she can remember how to do the task i just showed her  she said yes and rolled her eyes  immediately i knew this girl had a funky attitude  but i brushed it off   my other coworker sophia comes in at 8 30am and she asks the girl what was she doing and why was she putting the wrong status code in for the counsel packet  mind you this sophia has been rude to me too  she talked down to me like i'm an idiot if i disn t do something she said  like one morning when i came in to work  i didn't put this new brand of printer paper in the printer that the supervisor wanted us to put in the printer to  test out  to see if it would make the printer stop jamming  and she said   why didn't you put this paper in  i already told you yesterday that frieda wanted us to test this paper out    anyway  so after sophia asked the new girl why she put the wrong status code in  the new girl told her   i don't know that's what she told me to put in  and then sophia got on my case and asked me why did i tell her to put that code in  i didn't tell the new girl the wrong code  she just forgot the code i told her  i told her the status code for the counsel packets was a02 and she was putting in a20  so sophia tells her that she can put in  205  in the drop down menu and the same status code a02 will pop up in the drop down menu in this box  but i noticed that when you put in  205  two different codes for the counsel packets show up in the drop down menu which are a02 and a03  the purpose of us statusing these counsel packets is to let customer service know that we served the subpoena  so when the lawyers call the office to see if the counsel packet was mailed out then customer service will see the status on their website  a02 tells customer service that the packet was mailed out by usps and a03 tells customer service that the packet was sent out to be completed by someone else  so i was trying to tell the new girl this and i was asking her to make sure she was selecting the correct code which was a02 in the drop down menu and i told her it would be easy to mistakenly select the wrong code that pops up when you type in  205  she said   okay now you two are confusing me where is someone that can help me out here  she was ignoring me and talking to sophia  all i was doing was just letting her know that it would be easy to make a mistake and select a03 for the counsel packets when you type in  205   the number 205 is the id number and the id number helps you identify if it is for a client packet  location packet or counsel packet  and 205 is the id number for counsel packet  so i go back to my desk and i take some of the counsel packets that she already completed to make sure she was going them right  i come back to her desk to let her know that she did some of them wrong  i told her that she did not enter in the name of the place that the counsel packet was going to  and she said   okay whatever  you did not tell me that that was what i was supposed to type in the box  i said   yes i did i specifically pointed at the top of the address the name of the place that the counsel packet is being mailed to  and she said   where is the supervisor lady that brought me in here  i went back to my desk and started talking to myself about how i have to train people with bad attitudes early in the morning  and she said   oh excuse me what did you say i didn't hear you    and this girl went to go tell on me to the head supervisor  when i got to the supervisor's office  these dingbats excuse her behavior and say   well i can see why she would ask you were you talking smack about her if you two had just gotten into an argument  we didn't even get into an argument  me talking to myself doesn't excuse her to tell me to  speak up so i can hear you  like she is threatening me for saying something about her under my breath  one of the supervisors said   you don't seem to understand that she has only been here for 1 hour and you expect her to be perfect and not get anything wrong  i'm like to myself  now when did i say she is wrong for not doing the counsel packets correctly  i have an issue with how she responded to me for telling her that she did the counsel packet incorrectly  i don't have an issue that she did them incorrectly  and all i said to her was that she did them incorrectly  and she dismissed me and disrespected me  the supervisor told me   maybe it was wrong for us to have you train a new person when you re still relatively new yourself  i don t know  fucking idiots   this isn t the first time this has happened  this has happened to me at least 5 times where some fucking asswipe at work is rude to me and i treat them with the same respect they show me and i am the one who gets fired  like wtf  it s like these fuckers can sense i m aspergers or something and they say   well let s fire her because she isn t the normal one anyway  i have noticed that some folks in the workplace can be very fake  they try to act all holier than thou while stabbing other folks in the back both in their personal lives and in the workplace    the manager at the job i was fired at today calls the workers there  idiots  and the r-word for  mentally disable people  yet that piece of shit gets to keep his job  he doesn t even know shit about the job that he calls himself managing       i try to talk to people in my life about this and all they say is   well if that keeps happening to you then maybe you are the one who is the problem  which is bullshit because i don t hate people at all  what i hate are assholes who are rude to me for no reason ,j7tnwi
688,Today made me really feel for those in customer service,today  i had an interaction with a real karen  so  i have been temping with a charity company- taking donations  clothes  shoes  household items  etc  how bad can that be  right  there shouldn t be any problems when people are doing such a good act like charity  well  i was wrong  there are so many karen s and chads that come through daily  they give the attendants so much sh t because they are giving away their junk  junk they are dying to get rid or junk that they want to cash out on for tax purposes  not because they are indeed charitable people    well  anyway a karen comes in the wrong way which can potentially cause an accident and definitely will cause a hassle for the donors coming in the right way  i politely told her to come through the right way as the sign clearly stated to do not enter  in addition  i told her the other stuff about accidents  etc  all politely  i then stepped away so she can correct her mistake  she sat there and then all of a sudden put the metal to the medal and sped around a cone and came to a screeching halt  she then started yelling  i tried to explain myself and asked her to stop yelling  she continued to yell and then i told her i was going to walk away since she could stop yelling  karen then proceeds to yell some more and tell me i was going to get her donations from her car  how in the hell are you going to tell me what i m going to do in a manner like that  i then went off on her as i was going back to the  office  area  as i was about to go inside  she screams   and guess what  white lives matter too  out of nowhere  i thought at that next moment  she was going to call me the n- word so i threatened to whip her ass as i got my backpack and left  i never been so disrespected in my life ,j84hdm
689,The job description was a lie and I don't think I've ever been this angry,it was described as a light  easy job  i was interested in that  since i'm 150cm tall with pretty much no muscle  well imagine my surprise when it turned out that  putting light bulbs into boxes  includes getting huge boxes of light bulbs and carrying them to your station  there isn't even a way to grab them comfortably  you have to either grab the open flabby bits  or just lift it up  today's light bulbs were just too heavy for me and the entire thing fell out of my hands  i don't know how many fell out and broke  i'm sad and angry  not because they broke  i don't really care about a fucking light bulb factory  i'm just pissed that they never mentioned this in any way  don't tell me a job is easy  and then act surprised when i can't pick up something bigger than my upper body  friday is my last day at this place  i need money  but i'm not desperate enough to keep doing this shit and risk feeling like god's mistake every time i can't pick up a box ,j6y92i

696,"Corporate Slave for 20 Years, Intentionally Not Working in 2020",yes  it's as good as you imagine   i'd been working from home for over a decade  where the fantasy is that it allows for more work life balance  but  in my experience  that just means you're expected to always be available and pull longer hours  since you're always at work  ceo-to-worker pay ratio is one of the highest in the country   but  sorry  no bonuses again this year  no meaningful pay increases  and  due to poor executive decision-making  we have to cut staff  so you're just going to have to do more with less    reached the breaking point  i quit my job at the end of last year   there was a lot of paranoia with the thought of having no income  a  strong work ethic  was ingrained in me at an early age  i've had a job since i was 14  working full-time since 20  even though i'm in the extremely fortunate position of having some savings and not needing income for a period of time  it felt as though i was going to cut off my ability to breathe  but after stepping away  it's had the opposite effect   now  instead of being a button pushing screen manipulator for a giant corporation all day  wondering why i'm mad at the world  i've been able to focus on gaining homesteading skills i would otherwise not have the time or energy to pursue  i feel like a useful human being now  wake up when i naturally want to  which ends up being 6 am  energized to meet the day  instead of laying in bed  trying to stretch the minutes for as long as possible before having to sign in and look at my inbox   most of my free time was spent hiking camping  on artistic expression and trying to force myself to relax  the safety valves required to release the pressure of dreading most of my days alive  i've been able to fit in all of this skill-building and continue to enjoy hobbies  i've hiked so damn much i've lost over 50 pounds since february and feel incredible   an unknown future seemed terrifying  but on the other side  it's a lot less scarier than the idea of spending another 25  years as a slave  i'm no baller  this current situation can only last for a short time  but i now have the energy to pursue a future of passion that could also feed and pay the bills    my heart goes out to those who would like to at least take a sabbatical but are unable to  if you have the means to stop working for some time  but are petrified with trepidation  i'm here to tell you to just fucking do it ,j6ub1y
697,I can’t believe this is what adult life is like,the pain of being a wage slave is unbearable  since i started paying all these bills  and working so many hours i ve had the nagging urge to kill myself    i ve given up on anything changing because most people are just centrist who are just ok with neoliberal bullshit  this life ducking sucks and there s no way out  life will never be fulfilling  we are all just pawns for the elite ,j81gv9
698,I hate how the relentless drive for profit ruins jobs I'd otherwise like.,at an old job i had  one of the project i once really liked was destructive testing  it's what it sounds like  subjecting equipment to tests to see how well it stands up  which includes literal explosions and depth charges   the thing is  most people didn't like doing this because these tests had to be done in special labs  these special labs charged rent to use their facilities  so it required long hours  and they existed all over the country  so it required travel  people who had families or just had a life outside of work hated these  but i loved it because you got to go outside the office  chill with strange technicians  and do a lot of messy blue collar work  and during the weekend  i got to faff around in another city   so it was pretty fun for me and the company had a willing volunteer  until some dipshit project manager noted that there were long stretches of time where i wasn't doing anything while the depth charges were getting readied   the transformers were being charged up and inspected   the cells were being cleaned of debris   etc  so even though i was working 12-14 hour days out of the office  there's no reason i couldn't be doing paperwork or training in my downtime  right  riiiight   i no longer have that job ,j6qdxr
699,Alternative Economic Systems,so  i'm a big fan of post-scarcity economics  but the versions i'm familiar with all require extreme automation  can anyone point me to sources discussing alternative economic systems which would plausibly work with what we have now - in particular systems which could be implemented by one of more governments in order to get us out of the economic crash covid-19 is likely to cause  i know they won't  btw  but it's fun to dream  thanks ,j6r063

701,"I care less and less, and struggling to find my 'on' button at work.",i'm also struggling to find this a problem beyond not even working full time and needing money to live  sometimes i think it's the depression  sometimes i think it's just serene awareness that i don't care for this way of living  lazyness  well true  i am lazy  i don't even have a great interest in food lately  though i was very content to enjoy my delicious lunch slowly yesterday  i'm over everything  i think i just want to be free  to break my life and build it up again   i think we get taught from a very young age to accept authority figures telling us how to live and what to do  to obey them simply because  first it's our parents then it's our teachers  and boy howdy if you don't obey your teachers your in trouble  and if not you your parents  then you obey your boss and fear intrinsically their disapproval  there removal of those bare necessities for living they make available and tell you to say thank you for  i feel like i'm just aware of this 'matrix' and tired of it  i don't feel particularly sad  just disinterested ,j7qezy

703,(Update) I finally asked for a raise,  so the next day at work my boss just totally ignored me  avoided me like the plauge  walked right by me and didn't even look at me  next day  still nothing  as i mentioned before  i have bad social anxiety and hardly talk to people unless they initiate the conversation first  after spending all day trying to work up the courage  i finally asked if we could sit down an talk in private  but it was close to the end of the day and they said we would tomorrow  next day  still nothing  they continue to act as nothing has happened  once again  i spent the entire day working up the courage to ask to speak privately again  and once i did we finally got to talk  best they could offer me was  16 50 hr  blah blah blah coronavirus  blah blah blah nobody else here makes that kind of money  blah blah blah   i'm worth way more than  16 50  i recently moved back in with my parents and can't afford to move back closer to work  and the 40 min to and 40 min back commute would be too dangerous during the winter  i figured i would blow through my savings a lot slower by staying home and doing nothing all winter rather than moving back and paying for rent  groceries and internet while still working  so i emailed my resignation in on friday evening saying the 16th will be my last day   come monday  again  nothing  they still acted as if nothing has happened  then today we had our weekly meeting and i thought me leaving might get mentioned there  nope  nothing all day once again  now i'm wondering if they've been fucking with me or didn't get the email   later this evening  my position was listed online  so i know they received my resignation  they've been fucking me around and i don't have the time or energy to deal with this anymore  i've already checked out mentally from work and i'm letting projects pile up which someone else can deal with  i'm done being treated like a stupid child and a door mat for minimum wage   i've had an interview today for a part time job which went ok  but i figured some money is better than no money coming in  i'm currently cuddled up in bed with my soft little kitty counting down the days while writing this at 2am  so please forgive me if i have a bunch of errors in this  i just also wanted to say thank you for all the encouragement on my last post  i feel much more confident after having gone through this all  i hope things work out well for all of us ,j6n8zu
704,"""find your passion""", this is just a rant reply if you feel like it  this is also my first post here tell me if it's appropriate and i'll remove it    i literally can't hear that sentence anymore  my family tells me that stupid sentence atleast 4 times a day  im a professional chef i went through 4 years of torture   getting screamed at if i only drop a knife being yelled at every day being forced to do stuff like cleaning the restaurant for no reason which has nothing to do with my actual job buying my boss cigarettes etc  but with all the circumstances  overtime stressed out co-workers alot of cursing asshole customers  i decided to pick a new career  i was hired by a company from my country and soon figured out i was just a  lend-worker  where im basically working at a company for about 1-2 weeks then get the location for a new company per sms  which was my mistake  should've read the contract more clearly  you know what that means   new co-workers every 2 weeks new tasks every 2 weeks new way to get to work every 2 weeks  i only have my bicycle  and in my country cars honk at you like you shot someone once you ride your bike on the road    so i decided to quit at that comapny and applied for that company i sort of liked  9 hours a day way to work is 40mins and i get 1300  a month but hey im able to pay my bills  and i'll wait on it while looking for other jobs    what i'd like to know is  is there anything such as passion for a job  people tell me to  find your passion and you will love work  but i don't like the idea of the whole work concept so i can't build a passion to something that involves working 9 hours a day  6 days a week doing mindless things that are unnecessary to your life  i know i won't get paid for reading stoicism books playing video games and getting drunk all day long  but no matter what i do there is no such thing as passion to me when it comes to work    im jobless at the moment since i quit at that company iv'e talked about above and im forced to find a job in the next 2 weeks or else i'll land on the streets  the thing here is though i have no trouble getting the job  the problem is finding a job that suits me  but i can't find a job that suits me since every job is slavery ,j8aksu
705,I barely work at all and I earn a significant passive income. AMA,i was born into a poor family so i did have to work very hard early in life to set this up  it wasn t easy  in fact it was very hard  i know many people who have tried to set up this lifestyle and very few people succeed  the people i know who have succeeded followed a few simple rules  there was a lot of trial and error involved  obviously there are many ways to get into this position so my way is just what i did    what is it like to not work  it s awesome  it is every bit as good as you think it would be  but you get used to it  it just becomes your new normal  not having to work for money does actually have some downsides as well  you lose motivation  you need to be careful not to gain weight or drink too much booze  i know that sounds like small problems  and they are but most people think that not working is like a ticket to heaven  not quite in my experience,j8dm8p

723,About to lose my mind and give up,   second time posting on reddit regarding my job because i feel like i need the advices   long post ahead    i m 24 this year and am currently on my second job which i joined in feb 2019   i started working remotely because of the virus  and my company s currently on the 5th going to 6th month working from home  while i understand the stress and frustrations to getting used to this  my boss has been way harsher on me than before  she started micro-managing me and even calling after office hours and during weekends   even when i m on sick leave for 2 days  she called me without warning and even questioned why i did not pick up her call the first time  i was then asked to work and reply to emails despite being unwell  she would text after working hours and criticizing on my work even at 9pm  i feel anxious and tensed even seeing her name pop up on my screen and this made me fear her  during weekly meetings  i am afraid to speak up or give ideas because i m afraid of her criticism  her words and attitude had my confidence level at an all time low and it s taking a toll on my health both mentally and physically  i have been dropping many hairs because of the stress and haven t been able to eat well for weeks now because she has been constantly texting during lunch time   i did talk to her about my condition but she brushed it off and mocked quite sarcastically that i was just too young  she said that people with mental health issue wouldn t want to tell people about their conditions  implying that i was lying to her by speaking to her about this  did she really not have any empathy   i feel like i couldn t breathe at all  i spent my nights awake because i m so stressed out about the next day  wondering if she will call and scream at me  i cried while working and even when i wanted to take a day off  she starts questioning me like it's a crime to take a break  my weekends was also not spared as i constantly think about work and dreading monday to come  i ve been thinking to quit for about a month now without a job lined up because i felt like i needed a break to heal from my anxiety and stress before i start a new job    she says i'm too weak and needs to be stronger to survive in the working world which i agrees  but her constant yelling and criticism is making my anxiety worse and more mistakes were made due to the stress  i really want to finish up my 2 years and quit next year but her attitude towards me is really driving me crazy  should i quit without another job lined up ,j6mxuv

725,Would it be possible to get people to collectively reject the system?,hi everyone   i'm new to the sub  but i've devoured so much of the material referenced on here and i really feel like my eyes have been opened   i don't have a lot of time to write since i need to get back to my assignment  but i've been thinking a lot about how we could reject the system in the most peaceful way possible  yes  i'm a pacifist  because i think history has shown that violence only builds resentment in survivors and perpetuates itself over time   honestly  the only way i can see it happening is by spreading the message to as many people as possible  hopefully waking them up to the realities of the world we live in   these people could then be encouraged to join together in small communities where we would have people with a variety of skills that could help each other and slowly decrease their participation in the system by becoming self-sufficient   eventually  in these communities  people could stop buying anything from large companies - or at least as little as possible - and quit their jobs   as these communities become successful  now their message becomes more feasible to implement for the vast majority of people who hear about and are interested in them   then  as everyone drops out of the system  suddenly profits dry up for the wealthy  and likely will not return since much less people want to buy into them   sorry if this is all over the place  haven't had enough sleep over the past few days unfortunately   i know that this idea would be extremely difficult to spread considering how people are so embedded in the system  and obviously it would be difficult in the early stages to divvy up responsibilities and tasks within the communes   but i feel if the motivation is there - like hey  i actually would rather live in a more egalitarian society in which people give a damn about each other  and maybe i do want to care about other people more than i care about pleasing our overlords - then people will be driven to make it work   i would love to hear all your thoughts about this   i in no way believe my ideas are perfect and encourage criticism and dialogue ,j83ulo

805,I'm educated yet preffer to do simpler jobs,i studied computer engineering and did a couple of courses in web developing  it was really interesting when i was just learning it  but programming as a job can't suck more       most of the job you do is going to be used for unmoral unethical porpuses  which makes me feel constantly bad  and since you have to build these abstract structures  you have them in your head all the time  is not like other jobs that you just works for 8 hours and then go home and relax  this stays in your head forever  you always think of ways to change the programs or do new ones  for me is impossible to stop thinking about it even if i hate it      many companies don't want to employ me for simple jobs because they think im overqualified and will find a  better  job in no time and just leave  plus the fact that is hard to get any kind of work ,j5uyrj

819,We live in a democracy except we don’t really,i m posting this as someone from the us  so that s my perspective   but i ve always thought about this  how can we claim to live in a democratic society when we spend most of our day where we don t have the powers of democracy    we spend our days working for a corporation where we are unable to vote for who the manager should be or ceo or anything like that  we cannot vote for more policies we would like to see in the workplace or in production of things  only management has control of that  the  legal  system of hr only works to protect the company  not the employee  management can simply be placed into management because former management knows them  they don t have to appeal or get the public  workers  to vote them in  no debates  no campaigning for our approval  they just rule over us   in the us   at will employment  means that we can fired at anytime  we have no right to contest it within the workplace  and don t get me started on outside of it  lobbying groups  unions  of the workplace have been stomped out  and of course  protesting our treatment of our conditions is  bad   which we know why  we have no freedom of speech in our workplace as we must be  representatives  for the corporation  even outside of it  there is no individual freedom of expression within the workplace  something that is hailed in a  democracy    if we spend so much of our time in these types of institutions  then can we really say we live in a democracy    thoughts  i m hoping to write an article about this and spread the word about this ,j5ru91

821,I can never stay alert at work,during college i was a very enthusiastic and curious student  i could study for hours and stay motivated  since i joined my full time job my attention span has gone for a toss    now whenever i begin my day i am not focussed and take an enormous amount of time in getting to grips with understanding and answering emails let alone doing the actual work  it s impossible to stay challenged and look forward to another day so much so that my regular outlook towards life has become dull and always in confusion anxiety   it s not normal to be anxious most of the waking hours of your life  it s not normal spending 10-12 hours a day on your laptop working on mind numbing spreadsheets and getting email notifications every few minutes  it s not normal making it your life and not being engaged with other beautiful aspects of living and spending less time with family    but this is how they have designed the system and if you are not capable of risking your livelihood to chart another path because you have a mortgage bills food to pay i genuinely feel for you  i am guilty of falling into this trap and not being able to get myself out of it but i realise there are scores of us who are in the same situation and sharing our angst with each other can help lighten the load a bit ,j5147c
822,Today I got fired after TWO DAYS OF JOB! (long post),if there are any colleagues who lurk on this sub or whatever  i just want to say thank you for cooperation   ok  so here we go   i got landed into a temporary contract with a company that pays relatively decently per hour  and it's a desk job mostly  what i do is to introduce different numbers in databases and that's it for the most part   so yesterday  i was presented by the manager to my colleagues  it is predominated by women mostly  so i thought there are no issues  since i am the only man in the room  all things went well until today when the manager  who told to the lady who hired me  saw me texting and looking at the window   now  don't get me wrong  i had to text to my mom who asked me how i am and if the things are ok  but looking at the window when my desk is right next to the wall and there is nothing outside interesting to see  i think that was quite a bullshit  i mostly use my phone during the short breaks that we use to take and that's it    i got a call from the lady who hired me to tell me that the manager saw me doing this and that and that my contract is terminated right on the spot  no warnings  no nothing  simple and that   from the morning to the evening  yesterday i did over 1500 lines in excel  and today i did 1700  and it was very tedious since i had to copy this and paste that and click and click more and then paste in excel  it took a while to do that for the inventory  and there are like 40000 names for each product  the inventory started from the line 1500 and i reached to the 4700 in two days  i think it's quite an accomplishment from someone who actually never did that sort of thing  plus that i had to spend at least eight hours in front of a computer  i have myopia and my eyes are quite sensitive to the bright light  but i did  and i'm proud of the work that i did   but for my contract to be terminated like that  that really sucked for me  i would never go back to that place ,j6fub0

825,"So, what do we... do?",like  how does this happen    i've been totally absorbed by this school of thought for about a year now  basically since graduating college  and in that time i've had countless conversations with people who agree with me and with those who don't  finding this sub was great because heres a group of like minded people that really get it  but like  what do we do about it  how do we turn this into a reality    most people that i talk to about this just dont really get it  it doesnt click for them  they still have that good ol american protestant work ethic that says they have to justify their existence through labor  or they want to grind to get rich  or they just think that this whole thing is unrealistic  and i suppose in a sense it is  when you look at it through the neoliberal lense that america has  theres this perception that the economy is this all mighty thing that's an end unto itself  and that improving it justifies all things  frankly that's just horse shit  we invented the idea of economy to begin with    i just dont see how we get other people to really back any changes that would actually make things better  imo we really just need to start all over  but that's not gonna change hearts and minds  do we all just fuck off somewhere and do our own thing  is that what has to happen  cause honestly i look at the prospect of spending the next 40 years of my life slaving away on a dying planet for our corporate overlords  and i cant even bear to think about it  that's not a life  that's just existence  and it's not worth it if that's the price to pay    so what's the move ,j4kta7

834,Wtf,so we are born in the system with given boundaries that we seemingly cant go over them  but we can and in order to break the system we have to learn the system first so we know the holes in it  but the one who gives his energy in this rat race will say fk it i have the money iam free and i can make something which will get unconscious people to slave for me and i will get even more money while doing almost nothing  what a great deal of fairness  why not just get bunch of money give it to the people who care about others  medical staff and with the rest of the money just to fk off somewhere and overdose on drugs like a champ and continue in the infinite birth circle just to realize this is not the way but its a god way to realize that poverty is useless and u will die and be born again just to get enlightened and not live this dream anymore   allright and how will i get enlightened  well if u really wish for this  opportunity will surely show itself and u will find a way with god  but careful its not easy even in this time   just remember how jesus ended  started  it was not easy  it was full of pain and misery and the  christianity  was collecting those poisoned fruits long after the christ rebirth   so in this bigger picture tell me  anybody somebody  what is the reason behind this to realize that you are god but still powerless because you are in the form of human which hardly can surpass mind and its material world while being born in this rat race of continues growth and positivity rainbows and dandalions   i think that positivity has its place  but real positivity not the one which says  you look nice today  lets get perfect product on the market with idea i got from meditation to conquer the world with it and profit from it and slave thousand of peoples in china cause they are cheap   what a fair deal of being a god creation in the system where your life honestly means nothing  just another number to get something from or he might give us some so we can make more  this not only applies to humans but also to animals  oh what a cute dog yet people slaughter and eat more meat than ever existed even for their lunch   fk positivity there is none  only positive is that this is all matrix which we experience together and one beautiful day we will die in apocalypse of huge proportions just to start another jerk circle after it settle down so rest of the soul can wake up to its true nature   what a beautiful life was given upon us to enjoy as rats ,j5k8hb

836,Working a full time job is so awful I had to be put on medication,i have a mood disorder  it already requires me to take a medication twice daily ever since i was a teenager  i have been unemployed for a long time and have generally been happy  recently  july  i got my first full time job  i was happy with it for about two weeks until i fell into a deep depression  waking up at 7 30 am every day and spending all of my time getting ready  working  or commuting until 6 00 pm every day has been a fucking nightmare  10 5 hours given to the benefit of a corporation and only 5 hours - less than half - to myself to cook  clean  improve myself or work on hobbies  spend with my s o  and relax  i found it impossible to relax knowing i was going to have to force myself to sleep at 11 00 pm and do it all again the next day  it made me legitimately hate my life for the first time since i was a teenager  knowing i have at least 44 more years of this to look forward to if i'm lucky  it made me wish i were never born in the first place  i told all this to my psychiatrist  the only apparent fix to this is to increase the dosage of my medication and put me on another medication    amp x200b   i feel a lot better now  but  the amount of work that's expected of you in modern day society is so beyond awful that it requires you to take mind altering pills to be okay with it    amp x200b   this is what made me anti-work ,j4rl6n
837,Capitalism punishes hard work,if you care for disabled or elderly relatives not only you don't get paid for it but you are actively penalised in your career because of it  you're literally punished for keeping people alive  same thing if you have children    meanwhile the financial industry gives millions to smart people to create useless high-frequency trading algorithms when they could be working on actually advancing science    and of course all it takes to live a paid-for life of luxury is being born into a wealthy family      it boggles the mind that there are still so many people who are convinced that capitalism is all about hard work that benefits society ,j5gjll

869,The tale of hard work and loyalty,i ve been holding onto this one for a while  but i figured this is the right place to tell it   i used to work at a recognizable chain of banks as a business banker  i d mostly handle new accounts  loans  title transfers  estate accounts  you know  the fun stuff  anyhow  they began training some of us on teller duty to help out when needed  eventually it became a  just work as a teller as often as we tell you while we stick top sellers in the offices  kind of deal  no biggie  i worked hard  did my job  got to reach out to my community more  it was all grand  a promotion was up for grabs  as one of our best and brightest was about to retire  so i put in effort to get that position even more so    two months into my newer teller duties  and i got a different type of customer than i had before  asking for certain types of transactions  i ll skip the details  for privacy and apparent reasons to be seen  but following my on-screen instructions led me to to believe it wasn t possible  my supervisor came over  told me how to get around these restrictions  and complete the transaction  soon the branch manager showed up  asking what the hold up was  and i explained the situation and what my supervisor instructed  and he understood  he then talked to the customer about opening a line of credit  gave his card  chatted  etc  as i finished the work  when all was said and done  it was an unremarkable day   a month later  i was called into the manager s office  with the assistant manager and branch manager  they began asking questions about that day  i retold it all to the best of my memory  but it was odd because the branch manager was right there with me that afternoon  so i was confused  the questions turned aggressive  they began clearly grilling me in a good cop bad cop style  and were adamant that i admit some wrongdoing that i took part in  apparently  reviews of this transaction made it to corporate  they were none too pleased  and came down hard on management  said managers were definitely not looking to take the heat for this  and set out to pin it on me  even though i received instruction straight from my supervisor  teller manager  and approval from the branch manager  they accused me of helping the customer avoid taxes  as if i were in league with him or something  they needed me to take the blame of my own free will   that night  i wrote a lengthy letter to hr about the situation and my side of the events  a week later  i was brought into the office  with the two managers and corporate on the line  they asked a few base questions  and then told me  lying to us means immediate termination  i assured them i was truthful and continued  i was told the entire situation needs investigated  because my account of events differed from my manager and supervisor s  i was escorted off the premises like a criminal  and told i m now on mandatory leave  luckily it was paid  whoo  i was devastated still  i was being thrown under the bus  and scared my career was over  all my hard work  long hours  overtime  and training gone  a month of paid vacation later and i was cleared of the wrongdoing corporate accused me of  twist surprise   so  happy ending  right  nope  not at all  i may have been cleared of a fucking crime by corporate  but i still received a major infraction on my record  because when all was said and done  even though my managers instructed me on what to do that day  a fraudulent transaction was completed at my station  i got the excuse that this type of fraud was covered in my training and available for review in our lexicon  as if i had time for a 10 minute search at a busy teller counter  so i was immediately put on  final warning  my managers got no punishment for lying to corporate  even though the investigation proved my innocence  i desperately wanted transferred out of that location  i was surrounded by selfish assholes who tried to get me fired  but my manager smugly told me that  no location will want you with such a spotty record   welp  it was over  i was one mistake from being fired  i lost the promotion  and they were actively trying to build a case to get me fired   as luck or unluck would have it  i injured myself on the job  and was put on short term disability through the company  i milked it for every second  until i could move on from there to a better job  loyalty is for suckers  and hard work will get you nothing unless you re willing to obliterate everyone and everything around you ,j49vaz

886,I used to want to be the employee of the month at my job. Not anymore.,the more i think about it  the more i feel like superlatives like that at work don t matter  they don t want your true personality  they want your customer service personality  that s not to say a lot of people who work in retail aren t genuinely nice people  they are  but we re meant to handle difficult and unpleasant customers with an unnecessary level of tact and patience  even though if we treated them how they treated us  we d be out of a job  just another way your job doesn t actually care about you  because they don t want  the real you  but even beyond that  they ll talk about how they treat their employees well money and benefits wise  as if that s all that matters in the world  most companies repeat some bullshit about how  the customer is always right  they don t care about the customer  they care about the customer s coins  if you did care  you d call them out for the complete and utter lack of accountability  you know  like how your parents are supposed to teach you ideal traits like that  but those same entitled  inconsiderate  irresponsible  lazy  asshole customers likely come from wealthy parents just like them where they never have to hold themselves accountable in the first place    i feel like  employee of the month  could genuinely be a hardworking  team player who s enthusiastic and wants to help people but i also think that same employee might be a bootlicker who brown noses more than he or she should  because of how they ve been groomed to fit the  company image  some places you can get fired from and it d be like a badge of honor because it said you didn t sell your soul and kiss the ass of employees or customers who wouldn t piss on you if you were on fire  they keep you hostage for the good benefits and pay  if you even get those  even if it s taking a noticeable toll on your life in every other aspect    fuck the system ,j5u9ig

889,I'm so tired...,i lost my job at sears in february when the store closed just as the pandemic started    i have spent the past 9 months desperately searching for a retail position job to no avail   i honestly don't know what to do at this point  i'm 20  i have no income and i still live with my mother and that is a very bad look for me   it's likely that i keep getting rejected or ignored because sears is was the only work experience i have  my resume is only a single page and i guess that doesn't satisfy job recruiters who want college essay long resumes regardless of your age  after the first several rejections or ignores  i decided to give my resume a cover but that hasn't improved anything  i've also considered lying about how long i worked at sears but i doubt that will work    i've been told by multiple people that ''i'm not trying hard enough'' but i literally am  there are virtually no jobs where i am and my car can't make long commutes because it fucking sucks     amp x200b   i am so sick of this endless war for jobs   i am mentally and physically depleted of all hope for a good future ,j5vhbs
890,I realized that I'm antiwork. This sucks.,hello all    it finally occurred to me that i'm in the same boat as many of you  all i've done starting junior year of high school is work for someone else and make them richer  i was raised on the idea of being loyal to a job  but my resume is a mix of places that weren't loyal to me  i've been lied to about promotions  had my hours cut to nearly nothing  had my hours pushed to the limit  worked for bad pay  worked in awful conditions  etc  earlier this week  as i drove hours out of state for my job  i realized all of this  i hate working for someone else  i hate making them rich while i live paycheck to paycheck despite years of experience  i hate bending over backwards and breaking my back for someone that is happy to push me out the door without warning    how the hell do you all do it  how do you live with this knowledge and keep going  i'm far from depressed  but even so  this epiphany is a major downer  in a world where your value is often set by your job  how do you keep your head above the water without hating yourself or your life ,j5a9d2

901,Does r/antiwork have potential similar interests to life extension/related research?,21 year old  with a soon-degree of a subject i don't personally enjoy anymore  about to enter my first job in the workforce  retail most likely  following graduation  i've been plagued with existential crises of familial deaths  my own death and wasting my life  i consider the perfect life for myself to be very low key - go to work  get paid a livable wage  go home to a roomate  play games  i choose not to work in a position higher than necessary as i don't feel obliged to own flashy garbage to impress peers  or start a family  or anything of the sort  but if i do want something luxurious for personal benefit  saving up to pay for it is ideal   however it is clearly ingrained in me that i have guilt feeling this is wasting my life  that i have no purpose  which illicits such huge waves of dread and guilt that i'll die poor and with no eventful memories because i want to live minimalist - all because i didnt bust my ass early to get money to afford turbo luxuries so i can spend that extra time busting my ass to get more - all for everything i do to become nought in the end   so i propose  if you had the opportunity to work part time comfortably  as futurists like me are cautiously optimistic for the future  and that you felt happy in life or you're retired and want to just enjoy life  why not continue such prospects and get back to what life is - enjoyment  not work   im a futurist  i want to believe that i will live knowing everything will be ok  and suffering in old age does not sound fun to me  so i follow subs like r longevity r transhumanism and r singularity for the day i get to break the shackles of aging and not feel as if i have to consistently race against time to not be poor and sad   these subs follow a vaguely similar idea of not having to work for a living all the time  as our time is mostly limitless and can be better organized without dreading the claws of death  i would love to be 1 000 000  in good health  playing video games in my spare time just like i do now  i do hope anti work  transhumanism  longevity and singularity all comes into fruition soon  so we can all enjoy lives in what we like to do rather than a pathetic rat race driven by ceos,j6gixh

913,Working has been detrimental to my mental health,first off i want to say hi i just discovered this sub and i can't say how much of a relief it is to find like minded people  and for the first time find others who can understand exactly what i have been going through  i want to apologize for this super long post but i just wanted to vent and talk about something that i never felt comfortable talking about with others for fear of being judged and looked down upon   i'm 27 and i have only had 2 jobs since graduating college  both of them i lasted less than a year  and both jobs made me so incredibly depressed and gave me anxiety i never had before  it really damaged my feelings of self worth and i often felt like a total loser and failure to society  i dont think i will ever feel comfortable in a normal job again  i also feel like most of my 20s was wasted because these jobs really made me sacrifice my time and my mental well being   since i was young i've had the idea that you should work at a job you love because it won't feel like work and to pursue your passions  so i went to college following my passion and got jobs in my field doing the thing i love but i soon learned that the industry is horrible and i hate it  i really enjoy what i do but really hate the people and the industry  i guess younger me was looking at things through rose colored glasses and thought that i could change things and it would be different but of course i was defeated by the machine  and it shouldn't be like that  i don't understand why we have to slave away for a big chunk of the day just to earn a meager living while those at the top reap the benefits of our hard work    my first job i quit on my own because it was way too stressful and the boss really loved playing mental games with everyone and was very mentally abusive  i was also fresh out of college so i agreed to very shit pay  i worked my ass off  sometimes working from 9am to 9pm with only a 30 min lunch break  i was soo mentally messed up i would routinely cry in the morning when i wake up before getting out of bed  sometimes i would cry in the bathroom  some of my coworkers would do this too  i quit 10 months in  i only lasted this long because i convinced myself the experience will be worth it  for 2 years i looked for another job but it was hard for me because i was severely depressed and anxious as a result of my previous job    when i felt mentally better i found a new job and it was so amazing to be working again and not be considered lazy  this time the company was much smaller than the previous and they welcomed me and strongly emphasized how they are basically family  but they would use that family bullshit excuse to take advantage of me and again play mental games and take advantage of me and again abusive mentally  but still i worked hard even though i was starting to grow anxious and depressed again  i did a lot of work but it was never appreciated  my boss didn't seem to like me because i wasn't a kiss up like the rest of the employees  my coworkers would tell me that i had to clean the bosses office and run errands for him and make coffee for the entire office in the morning because i was a newbie and i flat out told them no  i wasn't hired as a maid or assistant so i didn't see why i would have to do these tasks  they obviously didn't like that but let it go seeing as how i was a millennial and we have different ways of thinking  i didn't dislike my coworkers but i know my coworkers didn't really care for me even though they would smile at me and call me their sister    one day they hired a new person saying that this person would work with me to help with the work and of course i thought that was amazing because i was always swamped and i actually became close with the new hire  i taught her everything i knew and i thought things were finally turning around for me in the company  until of course about a month later i was fired  i was told that they were firing me because of money issues but that made no sense to me because they just hired 2 new people  i knew right away that they fired me because they wanted a doormat employee and had me train this new girl who probably was being paid less than i was   i was heartbroken and this was the straw that broke the camels back for me  it felt like i was stabbed by my so called  work family  and i felt betrayed  i worked so hard and i helped the company in a lot of different ways but to just be fired like that really broke me  i was super depressed and again could not find a job  i was fine financially since i still lived at home and had a good amount of money saved  i went the beer money route and did a lot of little things here and there online to earn a little extra spending money and i'm lucky to have a very supportive family but honestly my past experiences in the working industry has left such a sour taste in my mouth and idk if i can go back   i've always been a strong supporter of not working too hard at work because they probably don't give a shit about you and if you are unhappy in your job to quit because your mental and physical health is way more important  i feel conflicted because i'm thinking of my future and i can't be jobless forever  but the thought of working in an office again gives me such anxiety  i would ideally love to work for myself doing things i love and honestly above it all i just want to live life happy and uncomplicated  i just hope one day peoples attitudes about work change and that there will be more people standing up to the horrible bosses and unfair treatment of employees and that we can be seen as people and not just replaceable pieces that feed the machine of the wealthy ,j4bugd
914,Serious question: what non-soul sucking job can I get with a masters in Communication?,i am working on my thesis in communication and realizing that a masters might actually overqualify me for some jobs  at the same time  i ve worked hard to keep a good grades and finish on time  and i m being rewarded with absolutely depressing job options  i can t bring myself to work in marketing or corporate communication  even if i had the resume for it  my work background is in journalism  but you have to fight tooth and nail for good journalism jobs  and even then they expect you to work hard  weird hours for bad pay   i posted in another sub that i d like to work in libraries  because those jobs seem stable  enriching  not stressful  and there are libraries everywhere  well i was told that even circulation desk jobs are impossible to get and i m probably over qualified  but that if i went back to get an mls that i d be overqualified for the entry level jobs but wouldn t be able to get full librarian positions without experience   what can i do  there must be some jobs out there for people with masters in communication that are reasonable to get and aren t horrible  i don t need great pay  i m even willing to go back for a second masters if it gets me a decent job afterward   to top it all off  in a year i get kicked off my parents  insurance and i have an expensive chronic illness  so gig economy work isn t an option  i need a job with benefits  i just don t want to work somewhere where i ll hate the job and not have any free time  obviously this the point of the sub  but i feel like there should be better options after 7 years of hard work ,j6dt83

Ever.,the fact that my boss tried to call me 15  times in 10 minutes all while i was on another phone call with another manager regarding a work matter  phone line ringing busy  i sent him a text explaining the situation  then he still proceeded on giving me a shite lecture about how   you need to be reachable at all times  it's not acceptable that you were not answering me  and all that   knowing i was already on the phone with a manager that sits in the same room as him  so  which i reminded him of but no  different lecture this time  about   they waited like 3 minutes for you to pick up by the way   that's unacceptable   wish i was joking  give it up psycho   so yeah all that to say  no matter what you do they won't be happy because it's not even about the work getting done a lot of the times  it's about control   better get shit for doing bare minimum then shit for doing a good job  slack today slack everyday ,j3bv6f
930,"Technical abstract. The literal shade of life, a specter living in the past and guiding the future. An antiwork ideology.",whisper with me    whisper with me and hear your story in your own breath  there is a creature  there is a creature whose existence they will deny     they are the detractors  those unbelievers  they are either a component of the workings of the thing itself or others who have fallen to it  you stand frozen in fear  surrounded by statues in the garden of medusa  and you are slowly becoming one of them  your eyes are caught in the gaze of the stories it tells you  the dreams it looms with lies that will never come to be  things that will never come to pass  and hopes that will turn to ash  a vampiric aura falls over you and you are lulling into the final sleep    you hear me now only because you choose to do so    again  whisper with me    let the most quiet voice ring the loudest and deafen yourself with almost silent words    let me show you    there is something happening here  everything in its design will tell you to look away from these words  urging you so gently  softer than a warm kiss of the cheek goodbye  more gently than heavy eyelids coming to you in the evening  so soft of an urge that it will feel as if it's your own idea  return the gaze of your minds eye to the story that has been built for you  do you feel it urging you back  longing for your return to the web it weaves  wanting you free from the distractions of thought    you are a captive under its aura and are not able to escape  challenged by something you can only see in periphery of your mind      beginning anywhere is a mistake if you don't first look to where you've come from  where you are  where you want to be going  history is where you should start  there are deceivers among us  intentional behavior to hide what is  but they can't hear our gentle voice  i often hear discussion of topics central to freedom  just saying the word can send vibrations into the darkness  words stirring whatever it is out there  something very real  do not think that simply because you have access to the internet that you have moved an inch forward from when the romans built the roads  when the wind carried ships across the sea  the answers sought by those who journeyed were never answered  there is only ever more questions    the story has not changed     your circumstances have not changed    the course of humanity is as true on its path as ever  and the ruts of life are well worn  like game trails in the spring we can see the paths of so many who have come before us  we peer up from the canyon of these highways we have cut into the earth  these ruts of life  and the sky is no longer visible    each generation marching before the other  leading us forward  we march forward following those who have come before us  the crowd ahead leads us  but they were only following the followers ahead of them  we are marching off the cliff and those behind us are just arriving with their adventurous spirits and soft feet  they still can question  that is the key  the road is not this way by accident  it gets deeper as you go by design  slowly like the frog in the pot we find out only too late  and only when the canyon walls are past the clouds  the destination has been chosen for us and the masses march forward  we are not alone here  there is something else with us    each generation rips through their existence and slams into the grave  an ember soaring bright one moment and having never existed the next  their eyes only braving to open towards the end  and often with just enough time to see the grave stone above them and plot filling in      we are born with our eyes open to the world and all the creation here  from the hatch we are dulled  we are blunted with intention  or by accident  or by a greater design  we are told to ignore our feelings  our intuition  our hearts  we are overwhelmed by distractions disguised as stimulation  subversion disguised as media  division disguised as discourse  and conscription disguised as citizenship    many do not remember their first time seeing the true nature of the world  repressed memory is as real and relatable as the ground you tread on  do you remember fear  remember it is often as you can  it is hidden behind misunderstanding  not knowing  having felt the monster in the room  the mind cannot comprehend it and explains it otherwise  the caveman sees a meteorite and witnesses god in flight  you see an elegantly crafted and everchanging mobile above your head and you see your life  we are deceived   we catch a glimpse of a shadow behind the curtain and we are blinded again by the challenges of life  ever unfolding and convenient distractions are infinitely available  have you never noticed  we fight for survival in economic systems masterfully designed to retain their slaves  no time to think  no reflection here  keep moving  do you ever remember peace  many avert their gaze when they see it never to look again  once was enough  a sight to literally load the pants of hardened people  they look away and lose themselves in the trappings laid for them  they obey and feast knowing now what this place is  knowing undoubtedly that they are meant to be silent  to work  to walk forward  and to die    they march with the knowledge that something is wrong  smelling smoke but never looking for fire  not lifting their heads for the kiss of the whip  or worse seeing whatever that was again  the cruelty of humanity   behind a million distractions dancing  behind a million noises piercing  behind a chaotic orgy chorus of war  blood  and arguments  every screaming match on the planet in your mind at one moment  there is a shadow moving  we can see signs of it throughout the timeline  we can see it's workings in the happenings of history  we can hear others speak of it and call it by many names  the stories of the past are not for entertainment  observe the mechanical nature of humanity  witness their patterns  recognize repeat characters  see what others do not   its shape is vague  it's forms many  a predatory movement only ever caught in the corner of your eye  it rolls quickly like a thick hot smoke across the ground  never fully in view  always just past the envelope of darkness and seated comfortably just out of perception    plants and animals    oceans  mountains  and valleys    and it    only ever in the background noise of chaos  in the shadows of tragedy and in the dart of an eye to see its shape it is gone    let me introduce you to an old friend  one that used to visit you   it is a thing that follows you though time but that you've never seen standing before you  a presence  a feeling  an inkling  many claim to have never seen it  it have never felt its gaze  only later realize or recall those moments in early youth  peering into the darkness  only then do they realize that they've never been alone  it is in the void at the end of the stairs  looking back at you from the closet door  the greatest deception is deception itself  you've felt it's breath  the pressure that you've explained away  you've been told to accept  to ignore  to repress  lights on  look  nothing's in there  go to bed  your doubt it what is needed  your compliance with being uncomfortable  your acceptance  you must lull the flock before you cull the flock  believe that is isn't real  it needs you to repress organic feeling that wells up  that something is wrong but you don't know what  the urge to scream out  to fight  to standup  for yourself and others  that 'wake you in the night' feeling from the darkness is the first surrender you learn to give into   we are raised to listen to the lies  lies are what is important  the goal  this didn't sneak up on you  you didn't miss it  you didn't walk by it it was something that came from the time before  from the past  we have spawned acceptance and groomed it into the very behavior of the youth    horror    visceral  violent  persistent  omnipresent  ethereal but someone still very real    complete and total  horror   there is a virus somewhere in the coding of human sociology  it exists deeply inside of us  it is the splinter in the mind  a root defect in the psychology of the human animal and it's interactions with others and its own environment  it is contagious and aggressively infectious  it is the murder that ruins serenity  the hunger in times of plenty  the well of lust that is never filled or emptied  it is the snake  the garden  the apple  and the tree  it is the problem  the answer  and the formula for solution  proverbial literally  lessons and stories of humanity throughout time have illustrated the failings of human beings  there is something more going on here     our buildings are physical manifestations of our merits and ambitions  the systems contained within them are something entirely different  metaphysical creations  entities as businesses that no longer are controlled by us   how many journeys start without a destination  your life might be an example    death    let's set the mood to a serious note of contemplation  let's surrender our perspectives and pause efforts towards anything other than gaining a better understand  there is a human problem that crosses race  gender  creed  everything  there is an organic evil root defect that is not only self replicating but assures an environment for reproduction later  it creates environments of suffering and enslavement and where none exist it creates them  there is a specter of oppression living inside of the human creature that has been ever evolving since we came down from the trees  it has filled trench graves with children  train cars with persecuted people  and the scale of that suffering and the scope of its suffocating breadth will only grow as human influence expands    in all biomes there is an absolute balance  when there is too much or too little life adjusts violently to circumstance  the creature with us is the mechanical behavior of error correction in the creation of a species not destined for long term survival within the biome it exists in  it is the shade  it is the great filter  is is the great deceiver  it is what must be overcome     it is time to stop marching forward  there is something among us  we have been waiting for a change but the change will never arrive  we must create it   how ,j3nfku

935,Remember that we're dealing with people who believe that pieces of paper should determine if children get food or not., schemes for a living  but everyone thinks it's okay because everybody else does it  capitalism is the same thing  it's clearly a complete scam and a horrible  unhealthy and unintelligent way to spend a life  but everyone is doing it  so it's okay  right   instead of kicking sand at the waves  i think we should focus our energy on the upcoming generations  and show them that not all of us adults are completely delusional about the value of paper  show them that it's okay to sacrifice and fight for what is right  show them that some of us  did fight  for their future and did not take part in a system that let people die everyday unnecessarily  some of us absolutely said 100   no  were our lives less than comfortable because of it  sure  but if you're on the side of truth  discomfort is a small price to pay to fight against a system that plans on ruining the mental and physical health of your species indefinitely    you do not need to feel bad for not working  we can easily fill grocery stores with food without you  we know how to build homes without you  you do not need to make up a  job  in order to deserve life  the second a store is filled with food or a home is built the work is  done  the concept that you then need to make up another job to do in order to earn something that has already been worked for is a horrible system  nature is asking us to build  grow  create  deliver and think  notice how  selling  isn't on that list  because it's literally not a part of nature  nor is it important or necessary to make sure human needs are met  in fact all it does is create a extra step that denies some people from life    don't take part in systems that think denying people life is okay  don't take part in systems where homelessness is even one of the options  that clearly isn't a system that is defendable or smart  don't let any human who thinks a piece of paper should determine if a child eats or not tell you right from wrong  they lost their privilege to be taken even remotely seriously     opt out  sit down  be yourself completely ,j3s3fj
936,Unpopular opinion here,so i m gonna get a lot of grief for this  i m not an idiot  but i have an unpopular opinion here   i think that in my personal opinion  the people in this subreddit do not understand that no matter what you do  rich or poor you re still working  and statistically speaking a very large majority of the rich either got more qualifications to get higher paying jobs or studied the stock market purchased shares or got adspace etc  my point is the people you are talking of are at the top of the societal scale and most rich are regular people who thought out plans or got lucky  for example if you studied egyptology in university you can get an opening salary as a museum curator of  40 000 and  100 000 after less that 6 years    and the managers that boss you around normally have actually worked their way up after years of experience  my father used to be a trucker and after countless years he slowly made his way up to the top but he was still respected  i think it depends more on the person than the actual status they are in  this isn t to say all are like that but i m sure many have been through it too   and even if you re in a bad place financially if you could afford to have a phone to go on reddit you can invest in a lot of worthwhile things   i m not going to list all the things you can do that i m aware of because i don t want to make this too long   my point isn t to get at anyone here aggressively it s to say that working a 9-5 in retail is useless because you ll never move up yes  but you should try looking out of the box and you be surprised how easily you can make money  work isn t inherently bad it s what keeps everything afloat  you just need to find the right work sometimes  i hope you don t take this personally as i don t intend it to be i just needed to speak my mind after seeing all the posts here ,j3kjc5

941,"Believing consciousness needs to ""earn it's value"" puts you behind many ancient cultures metaphysically.",many ancient cultures both eastern and western understood the metaphysics of consciousness and it's inherit value  capitalists think that consciousness has no value by default  this means are behind guys like plotinus who died in 270 ad  lol    can you imagine being  that  far behind   i honestly wonder what it would be like to believe pieces of paper should determine if little kids eat or not  i don't believe that someone can hold that belief without at least some form of hatred for their own species  if you can really look at another human as a number value  you clearly have 0 understanding of the the nature of reality or metaphysics    i think part of this is because many capitalists view themselves as  not successful  or at least not where they would like to be  this leads them to self loathing  which is then projected onto the world around them  if they don't even think they themselves have default value  how would they possibly think the people around them do   they are fully convinced that value comes from money  they failed to recognize that consciousness is vastly more valuable than a piece of paper can or ever will be  this really does put them very far behind in terms of understanding the fundamental nature of reality  there's no chance they can see the truth so long as they believe pieces of paper have more value than a consciousness ,j35tia

947,"With how much “anti-science” is being used to shame people during Covid, perhaps we should also acknowledge how anti-science our view of labour is", ugh  the robots are taking our jobs   the year is 1879  the man is looking at a light bulb     what will the lamplighters do to earn a living now  how will they prove to me that they deserve to have food and shelter   with covid  i ve been seeing  anti-science  frequently thrown around as an insult  with good reason  mind you  the covid hoaxers are a bunch of dumbasses  firmly planted against a mountain of research and innovation in the medical field that has allowed us to understand viruses and disease as well as we do today    we have a similar mountain of research and innovation in the fields of robotics and automation  and so too are an even larger subset of people firmly planted against it  so too  are they grossly anti-science    i understand that innovation always has its opposition  despite the obviously dramatic start to this post  i m sure people did oppose things like the light bulb on similar principles when they were brand spanking new  and we got over it  and our lives and happiness collectively improved as a result  i don t  however  think we ve seen such a widespread  intentional  and concerted effort against labour innovation as we do today  perhaps it is because we are more interconnected than ever before  but it seems like everyone is suddenly scared of innovation obsoleting miserable tasks  automation making it so that human beings don t need to damage their bodies or their minds performing menial tasks is nothing new  and it s far from a bad thing    i m not sure if this is meant to be a rant  or a conversation starter  perhaps just an observation  it seems like being  anti-science  is a cardinal sin right now  but perhaps being anti-science involves more than thinking a virus is a chinese hoax  maybe we should all take a step back  and acknowledge our own anti-science ignorance ,j3ybm2

952,What finally pushed me over the edge.,i had been working at my small local bank as a personal banker for 3 years  still with the same company  unfortunately  4 and a half years now  been in banking for nearly 10 years  always received stellar yearly reviews  and in the time i worked there i received a 21  increase on my pay due to great performance which is a 7  increase each year  i also was responsible for training literally everyone who is currently in retail  managers came to me if they got stuck  i volunteered for weekend events constantly and switched shifts or covered other branches any time i was asked  ffs i dressed up in an easter bunny costume and let people toss their kids on my lap and take pictures for an event   an assistant manager position opened  i was going to apply for a different position  but my current manager encouraged me to apply for the am position where i would be directly working under her  aka  she had the final say in who got the job  i applied with one other woman  they decided to do an  on the job  interview where me and the other woman had to be the am for 2 weeks to see who would do a better job  my coworkers told me that the manager asked them who would be best and all of them said me  no contest  weeks went by and i heard nothing  finally after about a month or so and several follow ups  my boss asked me to stay after to talk about the position   i sit down in her office and she tells me that i'm not ready for the position of am  their reason was because i didn't walk around the lobby enough  our lobby is open  customers can literally see every employee from the front door  i came back from lunch early  hopped on the teller line when it backed up  which was often because we are always short staffed  i didn't have time  nor was it necessary  to wander aimlessly around our open lobby because i was running the branch  this was also not a requirement of the job  i asked if the other girl who applied had gotten the job and she said no  i was perplexed  nobody else had applied  turns out  they offered the position to a woman who got hired as a banker less than 3 months ago  that i trained  and she didn't even have to apply  they just gave it to her  i danced like a monkey for 2 weeks and they gave the job to a brand new hire  our employee handbook says you can't apply for a promotion until you've been with the company at least 6 months  i cried for days  the other girl quit 2 months later and got a job as an am at another bank  i always disliked working but told myself that if i work hard and did everything right  i'd get promoted and i could work my way up the ladder  that has never  and will never be the case  you just have to be lucky  which is why i will never give a job 100  again ,j3bcuw

963,The reason why we hate Mondays,you spend 3 4 of your day working for someone born richer than you so that they can get even richer  8 hours a day    2 hours commuting to work and then back home from work  then you have to do household chores or children to take care of  and you don't even have time to play with them or to talk to your wife  almost everything you do  from age 25 to age 60 is dedicated to making sure someone else is getting richer through your own efforts when you're not even passionate about   you want to convince yourself that you love your job  but you don't  you either hate it  or simply tolerate it  the only people who enjoy their jobs are artists  athletes  and scientists who are very specialized into a specific field  the rest of the world is rarely ever passionate  let's be real here  who do you think loves their job more  the average joe who is locked in an office threatened with starvation of they leave for 40 - 50 years of their life until they're finally old and physically unable to do all the things they wanted to do when they were young but work prevented them from doing that or a competitive artistic gymnast  who flips over themselves  tumbles on beams and spins on bars for 3 - 6 hours a day and then goes home to their family or whatever they have that they love  i'm actually surprised at what a healthy work life schedule some sports have  who is more happy and satisfied with life  the average joe  or simone biles  whose job is to literally to get better and better at the things she delights in doing and get rewarded with gold meals for doing it well  sure  it's hard work  but it's enjoyable work  it's fueled by passion  not the threat of starving to death  it's fun  it's exciting  it's pleasurable  it just proves that humans were not put on this earth to use microsoft excel until they're too old to do that and then die   your purpose in this society is to make the rich richer  and to stay at the low social class that you are in if you are one  unless you're rich  a millionaire  then your purpose is to get even richer  you're even richer  a billionaire  it doesn't matter  you need to be even richer according to our system  jeff bezos might be the first trilllionaire  we don't choose the lives we're given in this world  you could be the son or daughter of jeff bezos or bill gates or a borderline starving child in india work mining in dark dangerous caves without your parents from morning to night  you might have private jets  a thousand butlers  a house with 25 bathrooms  and an indoor pool or you might be on the verge of starvation in some rural area of africa  having to force yourself out of bed every morning to go walk miles and miles to find water  that's not even clean and you'll probably get diseases of you drink it   we live in a capitalistic  elitist  matrix  the government and democracy in the western world are only there to make you feel like someone is in power or like you have rights and the ability to choose the laws of your country  but the real ones in power are the ones who have the money and most importantly the capital  cause there are people who own 5 mansions in exotic private islands in the pacific ocean and there are those who live in cardboard boxes on the streets wearing the same clothes every day for years or pacific islanders who have to build walls around their houses so that the sea won't rise up and tear everything they have been building for them and their children for years in pieces  in this matrix the real power isn't the government  it isn't the president  it isn't the prime minister  it isn't even the king or the dictator  it's the billionaire  it's the billionaire and the ceo  the capital owner  the stock investor  the businessman  it's not even the ceo billionaire that works hard and has passion for what they're doing  even if you got 1000 whatever your currency is every day for the rest of your life  you still wouldn't have earned a billion dollars  in this system you're not a worker  you're not a worker  you're not an artist  you're not an athlete to feel passion for what you bring to life with the world of your hands  you're not an athlete  to feel ecstasy when your feet leave the ground or when your hands leave the bar  you're not a musician  to feel the rhythm  the rhythm written in passion by the great musicians of old that has been played by millions before you and will be played after you  as you touch the strings of your violin  you're not a dancer  to get chained to the piano every time you spin on your tiptoes  feeling like a swan  only with feet instead of wings  you're not a scientist  fascinated and burning in curiosity and the urge to explore the unknown every time you get even a millimeter closer to making a new discovery that will improve the lives of billions for the better  you're not an author  getting lost in imaginary worlds  with princesses  dragons  kings and knights  with you being a knight and your pen being your sword  knowing that you don't want to tell the world that dragons are real with your stories  but that dragons can be defeated     you're a fucking wage slave     you heard me right  you're a fucking wage slave  let's be real here  no one says  yes  my life passion is shipping packages for amazon  or  yes  my dream was to work in a warehouse ever since i was 4   yeah  end of rant  if you're not simone biles or something  in this system  sweetie  99  chances is that you don't love your job  the closest you'll ever get to loving your job will be simply tolerating it  or accepting it  or being so consumed by it to a point where you can't imagine yourself not slaving your days away 8  hours every day  and that leads you to saying stuff like  work is a fundamental part of hijab nature  i can't imagine not working   i should have been born as a ballet dancer or an olympic gymnast  not a fucking wage slave ,j3thos
