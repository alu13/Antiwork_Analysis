The world may never know,ty kurapikawithagun follow  the abolition of psychiatric does not mean that no one is allowed to identify with psychiatric diagnosis that they feel serve them  or that no one is allowed to continue taking psychiatric meditations they find effective  it does mean  however  that the notion of  mental illness  was invented to pathologist logical responses to the stress and trauma that are omnipresent in a world brutalized by colonialism and capitalism  psychiatry has been described as a  medicalized colonizing of lands  peoples  bodies  and minds  a notable example of psychiatric s colonial intentions was the diagnosis of  drapetomania  the mental  disease  that explained why enslaved black people in the antebellum south ran away from their death camps  the  treatment  for which was to treat them more  like children  is china hills states in globalizing mental health   distress caused by soil-economic conditions  and often neoliberal economic reforms  comes to be reticulated as  mental illness  readable using technique that draw upon similar rational to those that led to distress initially      such abolition means that the intended and realized outcome of he advent of  mental illness  as a signifies is to make folks feel like they will never get better and that their distress is inherent to their brain chemistry rather than a reaction to external stimuli  his logic is essentially victim-blaming and shifts responsibility away from cycle of violence that create the conditions for psychological suffering   not to mention that the  chemical balance  theory has been numerous debunked  it means  too  hat psychiatric was built with a core desire to dehumanize  drug  and discard those whose behavior and ways of being diverged from the status que  his status que was and is white  patriarch  and absolutely clamored with respectability and compliance with he state s self-serving notions of  normally         any psychiatric survivor have made incredible strides in pursuit of justice  reform  and sometimes abolition  but the current nature of such wards  which  for the most part  have remained violent  degrading prisons at which a majority of ex- inmates assert that they were not helped and were further dramatized  arguably indicates that the asylum never died  why  because it was never supposed to  psychiatry of the ethics of the asylum  and it will not fall until psychiatry falls      tell ku mensah and stefanie in kaufman-mthimkhulu  abolition must include psychiatry     posted in r tumbler   credit    ,lszv8x

33,2018-2019 British perspective of work,hello readers  this is an incomplete collection of notes and poems compiled in a talking word script that i hope people can relate too  i am not a writer and i consider this work incomplete and at worst a topical ramble  i have been through some exceptional hard times and i needed to express intense emotions when work induced isolation was ruining my life   for context i am a young adult with learning difficulties since birth   i live in the north of england  in a region often ignored by the london centric spending government  apologies if my grammar is awful           lips whisper  pockets empty  the north forgotten to those with plenty  a region where our t s are lost in water  furthest from the south  looked upon as paupers   thought is a gift to which we paint a broader picture  bristles dipped with colour from my hearts own literature  tedium is endemic  moods are low  will tomorrow's brexit be the killing blow  to the essential collars soaked in workmans blue  austerity drains them as the one percenters grew   like you  i am stuck in the cycle of 9 to 5  what is a man s life worth when it takes a nosedive   concrete ledges beckon an escape  to stand upon the railings  is prevention  too late  where my desire to pass to the other side  is as equal as the shame that wants me to hide  seeking a remedy from the daily torments i face  i've turned against myself with the blame i continue to lay   our culture born from capitalistic greed   we hoard our belongings from the desperate and thieves   we are told to want  the allure of possession   a shackle we voluntarily apply   i don't believe that my future is bright  i see exploitation in my ceaseless fight  i yearn for social mobility  stuck in place  trapped in a self-made cage  most of us are destined for the scurrying we make  tiresome hedonistic treadmills  in the familiar rat race   who else tells themselves that they are better than this  where is the solidarity  competition is fierce  sweat expelled  tears swell  bleeding hands our freedoms knell  we build a society with no thought of the game  a system that forgets the forgotten  if you want to see reality  look about you and see who is suffering   our country is held together from those shouldering pain  it s structure and history wrought from colonial gains     why are we this blind   cannot see the outcome  selected rhetoric stifles our view  the economy ablaze with the fires of consumption  we must perform our systemic patterns of survival for momentary rewards   our bodies have become their machines until we are left in sterilised wards  no room for defects you must fit the mould or you are cast aside   what is the purpose of being alive  when profits grow but our share is the same  pushed to give our time for what seems like a handful of grain  it's unforgiving  unrelenting  inside this imprisonment we ignore the outside worlds  thinking we are above the delicate ecosystem that delivered us  we cannot out compete the sun no matter how hungry we get we are all destined to burn out   him  her  you and you  no matter creed  religion  race  we threw away our humanity for individuality  immigration  assimilation  some believe our country should be a british born nation of like-minded caucasians  look toward the businesses who criminally devour our resources  so why do we bicker about people  just like us  who have a different pigmentation   our culture is twisted  we have become divided  look to the corporations who need to be reminded  to value us  for all that we do  they feed and gorge off our labour so choose between the two  the options before me are all i can see  a life of uncertainty or wage slavery   in the hands of the extremely wealthy we slowly delve  harvesting our data they will adapt with a well-played move  the gap between class is chasm that may not improve  into a world where none of us matter  plastic  oil  trinkets manufactured served on a consumerist silver platter   a number we are  packaged and designed  grasping for opportunities before our class is outlined  betrayed by our eyes  hair and hands  the clothes that we wear let them know what we are worth  we need to talk  all of us have got to listen  learn to say i love you before the only smile we know is on the next-day deliveries that turn up to your door   every brother and sister  simple pawns in their game  to remove yourself will bring societal shame  whatever they want us to do we must do the opposite  collectively we have power  vote with your wallets   can you feel it  pressure is about you  this never seems to change  rent is climbing higher  the weekly shopping list is looking rather dire  that pain you are hiding from which there is no freedom until you retire  you keep it to yourself because the smokescreen is easier to maintain  wrapped around the cigarettes you light  it's just a short break from the train of thought that each and every step there is always something you have got to do  the present seems like a luxury gifted to the few  stress is what we know  stress is where we go  pressure applied  wasted time standing in lines  relying on our system consumed by white-collar crimes   hidden movements flowing at the top  paper has a price and panama was the plot  money laundered  tax evaded  the loops to which they thread will always  leave us jaded  as long as their numbers are in the green  we have to live in the red  we are in this together  i want to leave this place but where can we go   there are no alternatives  so i ask  why must i work so hard for so very little  why am i punished for being born the way i am  where my fall from grace is only respected when i am no more  judgements cast upon me when my heart was still beating  questions get you killed or they strip you of your credibility  watch not what they say but why it is being said  my words here will be misconstrued to avoid the truth that have left so many dead   turmoil is brewing  politicians hold the ladle  they stir the pot to feed themselves and leave us at the table  they need us  they hate us  they force us to live like this  what options are there when you are tied to loans and debts  mistakes from your past when we didn t know any better  the promises of a future  our bones will break under the pressure  mental health is in decline  nhs is on the line  is that another parking fine   rules  structure  bureaucracy  the ideological prisons and rigid tram lines that keep us in our place  all i need  is food and water  a roof and a progressive pace  every single one of us is equal in the capacity to understand the struggles of each other  take the time in this moment to think of how toxic it has become  my hands are like yours and they offer a sympathetic touch  my eyes hold an empathy for anyone finding it too much  are you willing to stare back at yourself when you see this familiar pain i m in  the tears i feel  are just like the ones that fall passed your chin  those lips that sit above are staying fairly silent  the truth is often said to hurt as we gaze upon its violence    right in this moment  detached from our own woes someone  is fighting with survival  drip  drip  droplets miss the rim  they are left to sink or swim  parasitic infections no strength to their limbs  can you face it  that not everyone has clean water  overflowing rubbish in our bins and all we seem to care about is our precious little daughters  young men are killing themselves  one to many  if you have lost someone  here have a penny  the homeless clutch their cups they beg because they don t house them  we pass them like they re nothing  desensitised how do i arouse you  to care more about each other  its built within ourselves to turn our backs on the hungry and the blind  we mimic the very creatures that push us to merely survive   consume  possession  collection  things are all we are ever after  knock  knock  a cardboard smile is at your door  shareholders riches bloating some of us are barely floating  will we make it to the next chapter  where we can raise the living standard  so the pavement is not someone s bed  where education guarantees a life where you get fed  we are in this together  let go of that ego that resides in your head   pacing between the roles we fit  is a shared humanity  we are not all that different  invite humility    i sit sometimes  lost in my own thoughts  i feel lonely amongst it all  have you ever felt like that    abrupt end  change of pace  swiftly moving on with haste  like our lives it never seems to stop   money fuels corruption  but our subscription is to blame  the market forces power  wealth and greed a grotesque relation to fame  it s all pretty tantalising for those who have access  if we could have but a small taste would we fall victim to its poison  look at history  it has always been about us  the people who haul the burden  carry the foundations of those in the seat of power  your decisions  our decisions will incite change if we stand with one another  sadly  we are being used  daily we sink our time into things we should refuse  tax is inevitable  necessary to be exact  but surplus profits seems to avoid the cut so it is taken from our cheque  spent on things beyond us in a global game of chess   life for most of us is a living debt to servitude to a system designed for those who steer it   how many of you who cannot understand me are willing to try and hear this   my voice but a murmur below the ivory tower  hidden from our sadness  they know who really holds the power   what do they have to hide from  our unsightly struggles  sickness and abuse  do they  think any of us want to lose   is it too much to want just enough  to be without destitution and the intimidation of danger   i ponder  where does the time go on the ticking clock  think about every pot you have ever washed  there are people who look down on us  even when the cards dealt are not always fair  who here does not have a safety net to catch them when you fall  the pit below is endless  and the climb upwards equally tall  addiction is a drug healing whilst it hurts  depression hangs across my shoulders like ill fitting shirts  of which i wear to try and seem like i belong  buttons come undone  threads bare and free  what happens now when i don't know who i want to be    who even said we must play with these cards  i long for something simple  i am now at the table  nervous and feel like i don t belong  outside this casino where i gamble with my life  i once believed there was a world free from my inner strife  the dice is in my hands  do i roll and hope for 6  the lighting here is dimming and i cannot find the fix   i look ahead to see trials  long and ever winding  self-perceived horrors ever present that remind me of projections that chase me just before i sleep  my imagination running with the wolves and i am the defenceless sheep  through a corridor immeasurable filled with doors that never seemed to open  a story with no middle and an ending abruptly boring  a journey i m ill prepared for  a tragedy in the making  i am reaching out for help  someone please answer   i am scared   so very  intimately scared   you think this is just an art piece but all of it is very real  in the coming moment brings with it a silence of which i want to wield  hanging somewhere from these words is my bare and naked thought on a life i no longer want to live  a battle that continues being fought  ignore me as the writer and align this to your will  think towards our collective future and fight them until we have our freedom from their exploitation ,lt4kff

38,"I feel down, and I wanted to vent about the way I have been feeling lately.",i feel depressed  angry  and frustrated that life is the way it is for the average human being  this world is structured in such a way that causes endless suffering for the majority of humans    we are very lucky to have been born into this universe through the complex evolution of life on earth  we are lucky enough to have won the lottery of life and have been born in a planet that supports life in such a vast and mysterious universe  just as carl sagan once said   most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born  the potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of sahara  certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than keats  scientists greater than newton  we know this because the set of possible people allowed by our dna so massively exceeds the set of actual people  in the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and i  in our ordinariness  that are here    unfortunately  humans have been conditioned so that they have to slave away for a company that mostly doesn't give a shit about them in order to survive and put food on the table  we trade 80  of our day for less than adequate income for the majority of our lives until we are too old to do any of the things we aspired to do while we are young such as traveling  enjoying hobbies  spending time with family etc  4 hours after work is not enough time to do anything we want to actually do  after work  people are generally too tired to do anything but eat and rest before going to bed and repeating the same shit    some people will say that i'm lazy and don't have a hustle or motivation  fuck what you think  i have worked my ass off to get to where i am  i spent my life so far in school just like everyone else studying and doing homework and chasing a very difficult degree in the stem field just to end up making less than 40k a year   and you may say  that's just how life is  people have to work  that is very depressing  that just proves that life is filled with suffering and humans do not live how they want to live  they are slaves to their employers    i feel like i am in a prison  i am not a free human  if i don't show up to work bc i'm tired or i'm feeling down  i'm most likely going to be punished for that and will be considered lazy   i am tired  i wake up every morning with no motivation to go give away 8-12 hours of my day to an employer   how can i be happy with that   how can i be happy when i spend 80  of my time doing something i don't want to do   how can i break away from this way of thinking    i'm too scared to leave my job with a decent pay to pursue something else that may not be as monetarily rewarding bc i have bills to pay   i'm tired of being fake at work  i'm tired of playing politics to move up in a company  i'm tired of playing the game of life   i'm tired of living in a money-hungry society that values capitol over human life   i need a break  and the moment i take a break i will be seen as someone that is unreliable at work and someone that can be replaced   i feel like i am i'm a prison   i feel helpless  i feel depressed ,lszjun

84,A Retail Nightmare,this will be a long one so brace yourselves  this is the first time i have posted on reddit and i am doing it because this a very important topic for me  let me start out by saying that i work for one of the world's largest kitchenware companies  i chose this job mostly because it was one the highest paying local job's i could find outside of highschool  i knew before i chose it that i had only three options out of highschool  which was the military  college or manual labor  and of course calculating the risks i chose to do more laborious work  my mind was set on having no college debt  and not feeding the military industrial complex  which even at a younger age  i knew a fair bit about  well here i am now 21 years old and drowning in more anxiety and depression  this being one of the worst lows i have felt in a long time  and it's all due to this corperation  i worked a job before here it was a small parts warehouse for a giant boomlift manufacturer  it was a terrible warehouse and luckily i was only there for nine or so months  i was hired as a temp and got terminated whenever i questioned my boss about being told do his job as a temp  this was my first realisation of how unfair workplace treatment was  i was being used and being severely underpaid to do many tasks that was supposed to be done by supervision  this caused many discussions with my father who is a union worker  he was the one to introduce me to cruelty of the workforce  he recommended finding a union job as well and so i did  the corperation i work for now has a fully established union  but it is blatantly corrupt  not only my union but this corperation  to set the tone here my union president is the father of the corperate supervisor that watches over me  which is a blatant example of conflict of interest  i have done a better job representing myself than my union has done for me  and i believe it's because our union and company are working together  after months of failed  negotiations  the company and union had finally reached an agreement  the problem i have now is that we were not given enough time to read it and decide on a vote  our union not only did not show us a printed copy as an exampe to read but failed to tell us the worst parts of it  the union president and his circle had forced in a non strike agreement which is the only weapon we have against my corperations current abuse  we have been working exploitive overtime six to seven days a week at ten hours a day for over a year  the company is continuing to over order and schedule shipments while we are stuck suffering  we are so far behind that truck drivers are refusing to pick up product here  because they are sometimes waiting over night to be loaded  which has created little to no space in the warehouse  making product harder to get to and hindering production as all completed shipments have to be staged  everyday we get further behind  we have lost most of our staff and the management show no urgency to fix the situation  they keep threatening more overtime which in return is causing more people to leave  and it makes it more stressful for those who stay  they have attempted to hire more but it is failing  last group they hired 30 people but only two stayed for a few days and quit  especially as new hires have to work 90 days in a row at 10 hours before given union protection and vacation  the pathetic thing is they pay union dues at the hire date  which is illegal however the union is working with the company  several high level management personnel are related to our union president  they have put in a policy that  union  employees give up their right to representation until probation is over  which is a loophole because you agree upon it from hiring date  by the way vacation is only three days for the first year  people are literally being asked to work everyday 10 hours with no days off  it is no wonder everyone is quitting  the job was okay but since covid our company is taking advantage of the pandemic for disgusting profits  we weren't even entitled to hazard pay despite being essential  we have had 50 infections in a 400 man workplace so far  they still do not enforce safety rules  and everytime they are reported they do the bare minimum to make it look like they are doing something  equiptment isn't cleaned people aren't wearing masks and they are forcing us to work close together as we are running out of space  within the year we have lost over 100 employees and over 5 this week alone  our contract says we are supposed to be at 400  union employees at all time  but we are falling below 300  i truly believe our president of the union is working with the company to get rid of the union and is doing the bare minimum as an illusion to show he cares  and these problems just scratch the surface  i can't take it here anymore it has made me utterly depressed  i am trying to survive till june  i don't know if i will make it  this new world is just so broken  and people like us are suffering ,lstybr

87,I'm not sure if I can go back.,i did everything i was supposed to  my resume is packed to the gills from all the stuff i did to  get ahead  in both highschool and undergrad  i kicked ass in school  got a bach and the perfect job title right after graduating  relocated across the country without help  grew into my role within 6 months  i worked hard  became a power player   covid hits  and i'm an introverted guy  right  who cares  i'll sit at home and focus on work and vidya  didn't get sick  my family miraculously made it out without any trouble too    work decides that they like how much we are able to push out now that nobody can go anywhere  executives decide to purposely  stress test  everyone by artificially inflating our workload  for 3 months straight  50  billable hours a week minimum  no expectation of non-working weekends  we are forced to burn all our accrued pto time with less than 40 minutes' notice to plan it out   things start falling apart  i essentially lose agency of my entire life  i don't see the sun  unless it's towards at the end of another insomnia night  i abandon my hobbies because it's impossible to do any of them anymore  i get a panic impulse whenever my phone goes off  i gain weight  then i stop eating  then i binge eat   i try to tell my management that i deserve more respect  and get told i will never make it in the professional world  i try to tell hr my mental health has severely deteriorated  they tell me that perhaps i'm in the wrong industry  they give me eap resources to look into but none of them have capacity for new patients besides 24-hour crisis suicide prevention hotlines    so here i am  20 months into my professional life  and i quit my job  i did not pull any punches or keep things polite  i was angry and afraid for my future  i told them exactly what they needed to hear  maybe that was useless and served only to limit my future career prospects  i just don't fucking care anymore    my network is strong and i had many leads to follow  and i was essentially doing the jobs of 4 different people at once for a year  i have an authoritative amount experience  but nobody cares how many names i drop or how many tech interviews i pass  they just keep scheduling more at higher and higher levels of competency until i can't answer with complete precision  then they drop me  none of my old colleagues could help me find a new position  i've been rejected from around 24 companies in a month    suddenly all those things i did during my adolescence are useless to recruiters   you shouldn't even still be advertising this  my academic experience appears to no longer have value  less than 2 years after graduating  and the professional experience i do have  which is an insane amount compared to the year-and-so i was working  is constantly invalidated for ridiculous reasons  i am laughed at and ghosted constantly  my colleagues keep telling me i'll push past this wall eventually  but   i can't stop looking around  i don't believe i had a future even if i still had that terrible job  i might have crawled out of my starting debt  but that only clears the way for more debt  i'll never own property  my career trajectory will never promise me working conditions different from what i left    i have an amazing girlfriend who is going through the same abuse but still thinks she likes her job  she's helped me through crisis after crisis for years  i've had a ring hidden away that i can't bear to show her  i feel like i have no use or plan to be useful any longer  and i almost feel compelled to create an exit plan that would allow her to leave before my life spirals into nothing and takes her down with me   i wake up every day covered in sweat with my heart beating out of my chest  even after quitting  i have no confidence that the world can be saved or that i have any reason to plan ahead  my therapist does stupid shit like telling me to  stop worrying about the news  or  join the fucking peace corps if you feel like things are so bad   the last year has destroyed any optimism or faith i had in others  i want to love this country but i have never been given a good reason to  i want to belong to something but every option just feels like a way to sell my soul and waste my life    i don't even know where to go from here  nor do i know how to end this post ,ltxpfu
88,I hate my job more than I ever thought possible.,i didn t think i could hate something this much   i feel this sense of overwhelming dread every time i think about having to go to work  i m crying right now just thinking about having to go to work soon   i had to work 3-11pm today  in this workweek i m scheduled to work 52 hours  i had some hope this job might be a bit better than my last one  but so far it s been much  much worse   why did i work so hard  and follow all the rules  and take on 6 figures worth of student loans  to end up more miserable than i ever thought i could possibly be  i did everything right  how did i end up here   i wish there was any way out of this  i m not getting paid nearly what i m worth  and i don t have any options to do anything that would pay me anything close to what i m worth  this degree is functionally worthless outside of this field   i honestly feel like the universe is punishing me for something someone i wronged  and i don t know what i did to deserve such a punishment ,lsrt8x
89,School trains us to be corrupt slaves.,in school we are rewarded for hard work  school is long hours  then we have homework  overall it is worse than a 9-5 job  by the time university comes you must study nearly 12 hours a day to get a decent mark and complete your assignments  this trains us to do as we are told  or else we suffer the consequences of failure which usually is to redo a class  no where in school are we taught to explore our passions  or to explore ourselves  we are told that exercise is good  but that doesn't even count towards any credits in university  you have 1 chance  if you pick the wrong subject and realize you don't enjoy it  too bad  switching costs money and now you are an adult  trying to do anything leads to pain  but being a slave and just doing what you're told leads to money  we are studying subjects we don't like  which primes us to accept the jobs we won't like  trying to escape in anyway to find what you truly like is painful   because we already don't enjoy what we are doing  the next best thing is to optimize what we like  and we all like money  gamblers get a high every time they win  much like this we get a high when we get paid   when you cheat in school and not get caught  you are pleasantly rewarded with a good grade  there is no reward for hard work but failing to understand  there is little reward for understanding but getting a question wrong  at university level mostly right is near 0 mark for that question  multiple choice is just right or wrong  you get rewarded for getting the correct answer  whether through understanding  or a cheating technique  students are being taught purely not to get caught which is corruption  true understanding of the subject is near pure torture  students are learning more creative ways to cheat  better analysis of which person around you if any has same answer order as you  or perhaps working together with a group of cheaters sitting in a bubble utilizing hand signals  sometimes as simple as paying someone that looks like you to do the test   we want ethics  but fail to make it more rewarding than corruption at the school level  just like the general world we are in  corruption is deep  and it's within us all  it starts as early as school  we need to find ways to eradicate corruption from ourselves  and our society  i'm sure you know of cheaters getting higher marks than you  just seeing such practices can corrupt our hearts  even if it is a little bit  to fight it  we must identify corruption  in the system  within ourselves  within others and educate each other ,ltb1v8

91,Too many people,so this is just my opinion on how our system came to be the way it is now   i believe one of the major contributing factors of our current system of under paid over worked employees is the simple fact there are too many people  with a large enough pool of potential employees who are desperate to find work to make ends meet  large companies can under pay employees because they know someone will be willing to work that shitty job at that shitty pay  there is no incentive for companies to pay more when they can easily find someone to do the job   the population has increased without a similar increase in available jobs thus leading to an increase of potential employees  so they have been able to increase the required education and skill level needed for so called every level jobs  making it harder for people to get that job without increasing the amount of debt they owe in order to hopefully obtain stable income and comfortable living   our grandparents had it easier and better due to the fact there was less competition in the job market    i believe if there was a drastic enough decrease in potential employees  working conditions and quality of life would drastically improve   edit  typo  edit2  i'm sorry if this post comes off as i mean there needs to be a reduced population  i'm actually advocating for less of us needing to work in general  so those who chose to work can improve working conditions ,ltlajo
92,Nothing Matters More Than Busines,an angry dog attacked my car in the middle of the night and ripped a chunk of it off and i've spent the entire night freaking out  thinking about how i'm gonna pay for the damages  messaged my boss about it and she said she can't come in today due to previous obligations and wants to pay the uber fee for me to come in  i live half an hour away   i haven't even responded yet because it's so absurd to me  i'm literally hysterical and you still want me to come in  i work in retail  i have to pretend i care about the customers which is hard enough on a normal day  but you want me to do that after i've been crying all night  and the best part is that she was actually supposed to work with me today but decided she wouldn't come  so i was supposed to handle everything alone for 10 hours on a day she knows is going to be busy  and now i have to do it while fighting against a mental breakdown  i'm so over it ,lsxj16

96,I miss weekends... No one tells you you're going to lose them when you enter the workforce and I hate it.,god one thing that's been eating away at me since i graduated college two years ago is how i don't get weekends anymore  i thought by busting my ass in school i could get a a nice cushy office job i'd get to put in my 9 to 5 and go enjoy the rest of my life  in reality work hours are for handeling the emergencies and your time off is just for catching up on the long term projects and whatever chores you can manage to squeeze in between it  the closest thing i've had to a long weekend was when i had to use my paid leave to get a cyst removed  at least in college i had some peace and quiet to study without being interrupted for 5 hours and then could go out with friends instead of being constantly bombarded with fucking teams messages either about work or mandatory  social events    i haven't been on a vacation  hell i haven't left my state in two years and if i ever have the audacity to complain i'm just an entitled millennial with no work ethic  i actually work in my dream industry  i like my coworkers and i like what i do but christ i don't want work to be my entire life  this can't be all there is ,lto7sh

100,Work related rant,hey all  so i'm kinda fuming  i was scheduled to work an 11 and a half hour shift today  which isn't too abnormal  except today  wasn't given a break until i got in a argument with a coworker and mentioned how it was against federal  u s  law for this to happen  which would have been avoided if they had just let me go home early  i had asked for a break several hours before i was scheduled to get off  however i was not allowed anything but a 5 min sit   which btw is not the required time for working 8  hours  so considering i didn't get my break  i asked to go home 30 min early  which was again denied  so i was starting to get exhausted  emotional  and reactive  one of my coworkers said something close to  if you had been more caught up faster then you would have been able to get a break  which is just not true  and irrelevant   federal law  which trumps my states' law  says that a 30 min break must be provided if an employee has worked 8 or more hours  and another 15 min for every 4 hours past that  edit  i looked in to it more and i was wrong about the federal laws  unfortunately  however casey's does have a policy regarding employee breaks  that definitely was not followed by my managers  so i stated that it was illegal for me to not receive a break and someone should have covered for that time  which would have been doable  there were others who could cover my break  this apparently startled my management  as i soon had a chat with my store manager and a 2nd assistant  they basically said that kansas  my state  has no such laws  and i should have communicated my needs better  i asked several times and made it clear how i had not been allowed my break  and that  these days happen  bull  shit  it is immoral and illegal to force someone to work 11 and a half hours with no break  there is no  it happens  i ended up spending the last 30 min of my shift writing this post  probably only because they were scared hr or a lawyer might get involved  if only i had the money to hire a lawyer  tl dr corporate america is cancer  fuck this shit i want to be an artist ,ltyy90

A rant!,ok let me start off by saying i m an immigrant working in the states  amp  that i have sadly worked 20 years in retail  amp  only 3 years have been here in the states  my current job is the worst job i have ever worked in retail  everyone who works here feels it is absolutely shitty  especially this last year i have never worked for a company so money hungry  so void of empathy  amp  compassion not just for the employees but for the shoppers too  during a pandemic  i have personally had 4 anxiety panic attacks at work 2 by my now ex boss  amp  then by her boss  who apologized for causing the attack and then followed it with but it s just how i am  which negates the fucking apology  the rest by guests who frequent this establishment  i have literally had things physically thrown at me by bosses in other jobs  amp  been denied higher positions because of the color of my skin  amp  still i d rather work there  than spend another day dealing with this shit  maybe i m just done working in retail this is not my path in life  it brings me no joy it brings me no fulfillment i just find it weird that people here push the notion that a job like this is honorable  amp  good  when all i have seen is how fucking disgusting people are to retail employees  you have no right to treat anyone behind a counter like shit  ever  the customer is always right is an antiquated term that should not be used anymore because 9 10 times they are wrong  nobody dreams of working as an assistant manager of a retail store all their lives nobody  only people who dream of owning their own businesses have those kinds of dreams  look this turned more into a rant  but i think we gotta stop putting certain jobs on pedestals  amp  instead treat them as they are stepping stones  for people to focus on the things they want to do with their lives ,lrqa1c

124,It's Quarterly Performance Review Day...,these loathsome conversations with managers about 'what went well' and 'challenges i faced this quarter' and what i'm going to do to be an even better employee   are such an incredible hassle    amp x200b   can't wait to be told that despite being in a historic pandemic  we still have to meet our ridiculous targets and that failure to do so reflects badly on each of us individually  despite the fact that this organization does everything in its power to make our jobs as difficult as possible - and instead of hiring more people to replace those that left  we just have to pick up the slack by doing more work  but even bringing that up is pointless as everyone is too powerless within the structure to affect any meaningful change    amp x200b   i'm going to smile  read my script  and get it over with while throwing out two or three stupid 'action items' that will never be completed or followed up on  just venting but i'm sure there are people who can relate to this silly dance routine we're forced to perform every three months ,lrhsl6

126,Is it wrong to do as little work as possible?,obviously  i have not made it  until retirement  to the point of not having to work  i really hate my job  i do assigned duties with initiative and my tasks are done efficiently with quality  nevertheless  i fucking hate work and will avoid any new tasks that are not in my description as much as possible  people say   don't you want to be promoted  you have to  prove  yourself  take on additional work to so you have more experience and can take it to another job   if i am doing my job satisfactorily and customers are happy  why not give me a raise then  i do work for the government  and it sometimes seems that once you do your job well and are  reliable   your supervisor will not let you go  meaning your current sup  will bad mouth you to keep in you in the dept   while i see some validity of the last point   being able to acquire new skills to take to another job with higher pay  but not the others  anytime i have taken on additional duties not in my job description  it ends up permanently becoming my job  then people dump all types of shit on me  yes  i am an administrative assistant  but just because i am a jack of all trades does not mean i want to do higher level work without an increase in pay  i really want to find a job where i can  mostly  work alone  like a skill trade  of course  i would still be working  but i wont be in the office around the political bull shit   my coworkers look at me funny because i leave at my assigned time every day and i decline ot   although not mandatory  the previous person in my position took it on because she really needed the money   why do people try to shame a person for my mentality  i already know i am not getting out of work until retirement  so why should i take on additional duties that are not in my description and a paint in the ass ,lre9ov
127,Last week I worked 3/5 work days due to a snowstorm and I had never felt so good in YEARS!,i have been working m-f for lord knows how many years now  the whole never ending 9-5 cycle  i had adequate time for hobbies  exercise  care and maintenance of my home  etc  but i was also very  rushed   last week we had a really bad snowstorm and i only worked tuesday  wednesday  and friday    i cannot even begin to tell you guys how much better everything was  i got caught up on so many things but not even just that  mentally and physically i was in another league  i felt much younger and i had so much energy  i was happy and in a great mood  all of this while i was stuck inside but i was able to accomplish so much for myself  i could only imagine what i could have accomplished if i was able to leave my home and do other things for me   it got me thinking that this whole 9-5  m-f cycle is literally vicious and is just a modern version of slavery  after last week my eyes were really opened to how we are all part of this horrible facade and every single one of us is being taken advantage of    and  for what  for me to make somebody more money by selling their product  what will they do with this money  use it to buy other stuff that feeds more and more into this cycle   so much of our lives is all just made up and we would all be 100  fine and live our lives happily without this crazy cycle of work that we are all forced to participate in    who else thinks that 3 days work and 4 days to yourself is a good idea ,lrxd1z

132,Capitalist entitlement rant,all too often i see something like this    we will confirm receipt of your application  however  only candidates shortlisted for an interview will be further contacted and will receive notice of the outcome of the selection process   or in other words   thank you for investing at least 1h  into adapting your cv and writing a customized motivation letter referring to the company and the position  but we will not take the 2 minutes to send you a rejection in case you aren't selected   the funny thing is  it wouldn't even take so long  it's not like someone has to sit down and independently answer hundreds of candidates  pinging out a template email to unsuccessful candidates would take less than 5 minutes  but of course they don't do it  just because  well  they can ,lrh9q0

137,"I don't know where else to talk about this, I feel so isolated right now...",i gave my current workplace my letter of resignation and 3 weeks notice  this was meant to be my last week  tomorrow was meant to be my last day  i had plans for it with friends at work   earlier today  i was pulled into an office and told that i needed to leave the workplace immediately and not come back due to social media posts  the posts  reposting some of the images from this subreddit to my instagram stories    my workplace doesn't have a social media policy  or anything like that  they don't even have a resignation policy  i didn't mention anything about my current workplace  not their name or anything  didn't mention any workplace  literally just reposted some comics and tweets with no additional text    i wasn't even given time to think  wasn't told i had to leave by the end of the day  i was told i needed to leave straight away  i was told it would be preferred not to take my personal belongings as it would cause suspicion  just to take my bag and leave  i went to the bathroom to gather my thoughts for a moment but i was followed in there   how ironic  i was told i was a  valuable employee  today  i don't think you treat valuable employees like that  i feel so sad and empty  so discarded  not once did anyone ask me for my feedback on why i was leaving or anything  even today no one asked why i posted those things to my stories and if it was about work    literally what the hell    update  i saw my friends later that day when they came to drop off my stuff  right after i was escorted out  it was announced in the office that i wouldn't be coming back into work  so much for not wanting to make a scene  they singled out my friends  took them into a room  and questioned them about me  i feel so disgusted  i can't believe they did that to my friends  they had nothing to do with this  i feel so guilty that they'll be targeted now   i still don't know how to process what happened yesterday  i feel awful ,lryd5o

139,I remember when I nearly got fired for mishearing something on a phone call because the entire office was singing Happy Birthday.,man  not long since found this sub  and i love it  the stories of cesspit employers are interesting  so i thought i d chime in with one of the worst places i ve worked at  warning  it s fairly long   several years back  i worked collections in a loan company  the fraud team at the time was literally just 1 guy  it was a start-up that got too big for its boots really fast  so  this guy literally just couldn t take holiday  course  they d never have said that to him  but it was implied  we were mates  so i said if he trained me  i d cover for him for 5 days    on the day he was meant to train me  the day before his holiday  his manager made him join in a forced lunch - one of those cliquey cult-like meetings where they all ate in their shitty little work canteen and did nothing  he ended up having 45 minutes to show me the ropes   because of this  amp  trying to catch up on the afternoon s work - approving loan applications  meaning they were all building up in a backlog - he had to rush a bit  he ended up paying out 2 fraudulent loans that day and they told him not to bother coming back from holiday  they then forced me to take the job as the only  qualified  person to do it in the building  thanks to my extensive training    for 2 years  i sweat bullets  i never made a single mistake in 10 000 applications because doing so meant the chopping block  during this time  they offered a job to a 5-year employee who was great at his job in collections  he made a mistake in his first week and got tossed out - of the company  not just the team    anyway  onto the title of the post  one day  as the company just loved fucking making noise  there was the usual weekly occurrence of the entire office signing happy birthday loudly to a colleague who sat nearby  who cares if i m on an important call to the bank   cifas   cause fuck me  right    i misheard a viral piece of information  paid out a fraudulent loan into a brand new bank account  set up by a fraudster  10 000 flawless applications  but fuck me  right  pulled into a meeting within the hour    manager - who was the antichrist - kept asking me why i did it  i said it was a mistake     is it because you don t care about your job    no  it was genuinely a mistake   but would you say you didn t care about your job   it sounds like you want me to say i don t care   i don t want you to say anything  i just want to know if you care    i m paraphrasing  but this was the really weird exchange  it was an odd place  they were all super obsessed with the job  most of them were fucking  most senior managers who eventually moved on always came back because they couldn t hack it elsewhere when they saw what an actual job is like    anyway   fortunately  i have had a hearing impairment since i was younger  it s not severe and doesn t impact my life  i turned around and basically said that everybody was fucking singing happy birthday in my one decent ear and my disability made it impossible to hear properly    her tune changed immediately and i was let off  after that  i fucking bolted within the month - into another job that eventually fired me because the job  it turned out  didn t exist  and i wasn t needed    fuck work  am i right ,lsf5eb

153,A reminder that self employment is not the solution anti-workers are looking for,i often get the feeling that people who want to understand our movement want to counter by saying that we should just all be self-employed  while self-employment would fix a lot of the problems many people have with traditional work it wouldn't solve the main problem which is the idea that you are a slave to the market  the idea that your worth is directly tied to your productivity is a terrible idea and anti-workers want to get rid of that   in her episode  burning yourself out  the closest feeling to death that isn't death https youtu be mt-yuvhsvpy  jaiden animation who is self-employed talks about her typical day of her work  she talks about how every time she isn't working she feels like she should be even though she's doing something like eating  pooping  or even working because if she's working she could be working harder  this video perfectly illustrates how self employment isn't the solution to anti-work people's problems  and in fact it's possible to work even harder and longer in self-employment than in traditional work because there's no one telling you to stop working  getting rid of the market's desire to always turn a profit and the constant need to make money in order to survive is what's going to help us  not self employment  if you are self-employed that's great  there are plenty of reasons to be self-employed but to escape anti-work problems is not one of them ,lru530

159,Consent v. Control,reading through people's experiences for me has brought up the question of what things we consent to  whether that consent is genuine and what that means for our society    under u s  law the basis for american employment is contract   in order to create a contract you must have a manifestation of agreement by all sides  and a meeting of the minds--i e  consent from both parties to the same thing  or the same general thing   therefore  the legal basis of employment is at odds fundamentally with the theory espoused by some marxists and often reflected in sentiments here that employment can be analogized to slavery   to be clear at the outset i don't agree with this sentiment  and from a historical perspective find the argument offensive   but i think examining the distinction can reveal areas where modern society at best manufactures consent from its members   the legal distinction between undesirable work and slavery is easy to make--an individual employed for minimum wage is not a slave because they cannot be compelled to work by force  or to put it another way they can always technically chose to quit any job at any time   there is no threat of violence or  as a general matter  governmental authority compelling work by force   there are of course a raft of other distinctions between a modern employee and a slave most succinctly invoked by the concepts of life  liberty and property--but which are really a whole list of things which if examined closely set out in stark detail why a job you detest is not analogous to the total loss of rights and freedoms that were experienced legally by individuals in the past and illegally today   that said  there are situations in which contracts may be voidable or unenforceable because we do not believe consent can be adequately given   and the line between those concepts  and the circumstances which undergird everyday employment for a huge segment of americans is  at least in terms of intellectual underpinnings  unclear   there is a concept called unconscionability  which is the idea that where a contract is extremely unfavorable to one side  both in its terms  and in the circumstances in which it is negotiated  it cannot be enforced   the central question as to circumstances is what is relevant here   because what bargaining power can an unemployed individual be said to have when they are dependent upon future employment for shelter  food  and healthcare   where on the other side sits either a far wealthier person  or an entity whose needs are nonexistent save the unyielding course for profit  were there any fair way to negotiate between the two we would have no need of a minimum wage   yet without this law the average person's salary would never increase  it seems   which is to say that if we are concerned with the circumstances under which a contract is negotiated  we cannot give our blessing to the vast majority of contracts an employee signs   this is not to say that employees possess no leverage  but it is to say that the bargaining power employees possess is largely not enough to ensure terms we as a society would deem equitable   this suggests that consent to employment may be analogous to the concept of social compact theory   social compact theory holds that a government governs by the consent of those it governs   i e  governments are  or should be  created and developed through the consent of their citizens   this concept  while influential in crafting democratic policies is obviously aspirational   no child  any more than they choose to be born  chooses the rules their parents place on them  and so too no man  woman or other the mesh of laws that they must abide by or sacrifice what rights had been set aside for them   society may value particular freedoms  but it cannot value choice   because where an individual has the choice to leave a society  there can be no authority and no rule   therefore every society creates fictions like these--which imitate consent and curtsy to our desires--all while keeping us firmly within the track we are told to keep upon   this is all to say that our consent is a formality and a ritual so long as our choices are prescribed   free is an exaggeration ,lsh3b1

173,Mom is yelling at me about not having a job despite telling me she would be ok with me doing online classes,all right so basically i stopped working at mcdonald s a few months ago because it s a really hostile work environment i didn t get breaks there and she knew it she knew it was a hostile work environment and i didn t get brakes there and also they stop testing for fevers or corona two weeks into working there  anyways we also just recovered from corona a few days ago and i don t want it again  i m currently taking online classes and she told me she would be ok if i was taking online classes or had a job but now she s yelling at me because i m just doing online classes and don t have a job    i m currently home from college but she keeps yelling at me despite the fact that i m in online classes and she told me she drop it and i really don t want another child that s just gonna be a fucking shit hole ass job during a pandemic and possibly give me corona again  she just started yelling and banging on my door earlier like a few minutes ago like wendy s is hiring and shit and she s been doing stuff like that occasionally and it s so fucking annoying  like i m doing online classes and we just recovered from corona and i brought this up to her and she doesn t seem to care    and one of her main points is always comparing me to other fucking people my age like so-and-so has this job or so-and-so has a kid and a job  i really hate this shit  we currently live in alabama in this hell hole is pretty fucking eat it with coronavirus right now  it seems like all of my closest friends have had it at some point  like i don t want to go get a shitty fast food job just because she yells at me and wants to compare me to other people my age like i m doing good in my online classes and have good grades but apparently that s not good enough and she wants to yell at me about getting a job at fucking wendy s and i don t wanna catch corona again just to do that ,lscnx0

177,Too much information?,lately  even though i'm broke af and jobless  i've been ghosting companies that want 50  additional things for an application process   a few examples of what said things are   -making an account on a website you will likely never come back to  -leaving a preliminary phone message as requested asking you to repeat info and perform a certain task  -indeed com tests  -preliminary phone interviews  -preliminary zoom interviews  - putting everything you just put into your resume  put into their job website  -being tasked to perform a computer test in person for an interview  -being lured in with an interview  then asked to fill out 10 pages of things already on my resume while the interviewer sits there   this kind of stuff absolutely infuriates me  i very much understand that a corporation wants the right person for the job  but if i'm going to be treated like a hamster they put in a wheel to see if it can run  then i'll just hide in the little log house until i'm taken seriously   tl dr i'm done wasting my time for nothing and i'd like to know  has the job-hunt process got you by the balls like this too ,lsmo87

179,Job is likely going to make us go back into the office,my job as a social worker with this organization is the following   - try and make calls to residents in nursing homes to offer services - paperwork - whole lot of meetings  i actually don t mind    amp  that s pretty much it   i ve been working at this role 100  remotely since october and while the organization is a massive mess and i am actively looking to find something else    but  waking up at 8 25 am and starting my day at 8 30 am has been a luxury that i feel grateful to have   now  management wants us to  transition back to the office    like many companies  and my question is   why   my commute would turn into an hour both ways  at minimum  i expressed my concerns to my supervisor and said what i said above in a more professional way    covid has proven that a lot of work can be done 100  remotely  amp  have much happier employees    i know the decision isn t up to me  but i m livid at the idea of working in an office just so management can rekindle a  close knit family   end of my rant- has anyone experienced this too ,ls97pt
180,I wish I could automate more of my job to have more free time but I work in government so I can‚Äôt,we use google suite and mainframe emulators for almost everything so i can t automate any of it  google automation requires google api and they have all of that blocked out for us  idk man  i m just tired this morning after six hours of sleep    i m trying to learn some computer science to get a higher paying job but if i m working eight hours every day  because we have always had more work than people in government  then i have no time to study professional development stuff  even though they offer free online class videos as a benefit and encourage it  i m too exhausted after work and have no time after cooking or other chores to do it  i feel trapped and i m just tired of being tired    i m having to finance a  500 nightguard for supposedly clenching my teeth at night and causing tooth damage  i was just off for 9 days and never woke up with my teeth and jaw hurting  i ll be damn if i haven t woken up every day this week after getting back with my teeth and jaw sore and hurting  i don t consciously feel stressed but it s obvious that my body does     people think working in government is cushy and government workers ride the gravy train  i will say that every stereotype has some truth to it that comes from somewhere  but everyone that i ve worked with works harder than anyone i ve seen in the private sector jobs i ve had  the main reason is because year after year our work load demand increases while budgets stay stagnant    we ve been understaffed since i started because budgets have stayed the same each year or even been slightly cut  on my team there are 3 of us that split about 215 000 accounts  but it s more like 2 25 because the third person is our team lead that works on other stuff as well  for simplicity let s just split in half and say my coworker and i each own 107 500  accounts at most and let me preface this by saying that we work through only accounts that come in with flagged errors  i even have the data of how many accounts there are each quarter and i ll use 1q20 so that the increase from covid doesn t throw off what s normal for us    so for 1q20 there were 1 952 error accounts  divided out that s 976  well the average number of business days in a week is 21 give or take  so in a quarter that s around 63 days which means each working day i am expected to work through  15 accounts  that doesn t seem like much right  but that s one aspect of my jobs    i also have to do 1000s of lines of data entry  hundreds of lines of account coding  etc  now  i know the private sector is known for cracking the whip and having either too much or too little work to do each day  they don t crack the whip on us but i don t know anyone in government that has one of those  i only have 3 hours of work to do each day  jobs  i empathize because those jobs are boring but i never get days where i have nothing due or that i should be working on for eight hours  i would have to work 10-12 hours just to get all of this done but can t because the government doesn t give over time except in rare cases    it s unreal and it s government so we aren t even for profit  we aren t working for billionaires  we are public servants working on important things to make sure people have ui benefits  businesses pay their taxes into ui  people have food benefits etc  and we don t have enough people to do what we should be able to do  imagine if we had more funding  we could have more people and be even more efficient in program management  idk y all  i m just tired and venting  i m not downplaying anyone s job  we all either work too much or work too little for employers that are running inefficient businesses  i know this sub focuses a lot on the billionaires and corporations but here s the other side of the seesaw  up and down  boom and bust ,lrg584

208,Just worked 42 hours in 3 days,started my first  prestigious  corporate job out of university 3 months ago  i never thought that it would be easy  but after the hours i put in  and having my line manager tell me that she  can tell that i'm trying but it's still not good enough  i think i'm done  we don't get paid overtime or so much as praise for working 16 fucking hour days  because i'm only in training  there is no maximum cap for mandated work hours  i was told this by a government official    in town halls  they love to tout that the company values work life balance and constantly encourages us to  draw boundaries  with work  if you try doing that you'll just get berated and told that to survive in this industry you need to make sacrifices    everyone around me has been telling me to quit  my mum witnessed me wailing at 2am standing in the shower with my clothes on  in 3 months i've lost 2kg of weight  and i'm already underweight to begin with  and with my medical history  there's just no way i can work like this  i'm getting increasingly frustrated and i want to overdose just so i can stop going in just to be berated by my line manager    help ,lso187

212,Management sent out an email telling us we'll be working 11 hour days through April 15th and led to the most beautiful mutiny in the Teams chat.,i am a technical support rep for a company that produces a major tax program  i honestly have no idea of the market share  but there is definitely an infinite supply of asshole cpas who call in and expect tax advice from people who aren't even required to have a college degree  i accepted the job as a recent college grad with a worthless degree thinking i'd struck gold making  20 hr  although i was hesitant about a call center environment  i thought surely it couldn't be so bad they're professionals after all  right  lmao   the program is absolute trash  especially this year  the irs already made things difficult with delaying the start of efiling  and people constantly call bitching about forms not being ready in our program yet but other programs have them  the developers are in their ivory tower and don't provide information so trivial as a future release date  as if they could meet a deadline anyway  the gui looks like it's straight out of windows 95  and almost every single call i take is something that's already been documented and  will be fixed on a future release    because it's a tax program  our hours are already extended for tax season to help our dear cpa patrons  january through april is hell  then we get another busy season when extensions are due in september and october  last year  it was like busy season never ended after the deadline was extended until july  they still waited until the last damn minute    we've been working 10 hour days most of this month  which after a lunch break is pretty much 11 hours of my day anyway  despite this being a relatively high paying position for little required skill in my area  people keep quitting and management pretends to understand the mental health aspect  but just makes the rest of us work more  everyone's tensions boiled over in the department-wide teams chat at the end of my shift after management sent out an email saying the first week of march will be 10 5 hours schedule shift  then through april 15th will be 11 hours - essentially 12hr days  they also scheduled people for this saturday with just a few days' notice after failing to incentivize enough people to volunteer and receive points that can be used in this ridiculous market place the company teamed up with to buy random shit  that's not gonna pay the bills    all it took was one person to bravely post how the email attributes the recent attrition to the need to schedule more hours  yet they continue pushing people out the door  the responses in solidarity flooded in  my favorite response in the whole thread was a gif of tituss burgess with the caption  me reading the email  if you wanted me to quit  just say so  i'm just picturing the managers getting a call tonight warning them to brace themselves for the shitstorm they're gonna face tomorrow ,lsp0jm

225,"No matter how many articles suggest that working less increases productivity, employers will never get it",for those who have ever felt burnt out or overwhelmed at work  i believe that many of you have searched for and read articles about the negative effects of burnout  how productivity falls down a cliff when people work 50 60 hours a week  and the benefits of working less  however  despite these things being absolutely true from our experiences and in most studies  employers seem to never get it- or get it  but refuse to acknowledge it  even if it benefits both the worker and the company    this week i ve been overloaded at work and have been putting in minimum effort on each project because anything more means that i won t be able to finish my assignments  or will have to use my non-existent free time and risk burnout  my work quality has been suffering  but i couldn t care less  because this is a result of bad scheduling on the company s side    no amount of productivity hack or time management skills will make the situation better   talking to a overworked employee about time management is just like taking to a homeless person about asset allocation and the importance of a diversified investment portfolio  sometimes the only solution is rest  and to reduce the workload  employers and managers are just too arrogant to admit that ,lrtl8y

273,Have any of you guys seen the anime Golden Boy? After lurking this sub It made me think about this show,this 90s anime is a goofy and extremely perverted comedy but it has a message that i think relates in one way or another to this sub      kintaro  main character  is a freeter  and has done various jobs as he quests around japan in pursuit of knowledge  his ventures include computer programming  housekeeping  teaching  the culinary arts  and most of all  studying  kintaro is also often seen demonstrating the skills he's learned in previous chapters to overcome challenges faced in the current one    so the show goes to explain every episode that he is what is called a  freeter  and i always found that interesting  apparently young people were living this life style in japan for one or more reasons  ill go back to this   a freeter is a japanese expression for people who lack full-time employment or are unemployed   in golden boy the main character jumps from job to job not being tied down to one thing and taking the experience he learned over to the next job  jobs including computer programming  housekeeping  teaching  the culinary arts  they also mention that the main character went to law school and is very intelligent but intentionally dropped out right before getting his last credits to get a degree to live this life style of being a  freeter   so in real life japan people chose this life style for multiple reasons including         to enjoy life  and deliberately chooses not to join the rat race of the   japanese work environment     having specific dreams incompatible with a standard japanese career      not finding a decent job before high school or university graduation in the system called  simultaneous recruiting of new graduates  which is unique to japanese society  those left behind are forced to take low paying irregular jobs  this usually has to do with their   dropout   status from previous educational institutes  those who dropped out of high school have the worst prospects   so i naturally drew parallels to this sub  people not wanting to get caught up in this lifestyle of soul sucking corporate lifestyle but to live life to the fullest  the main character realized that he'd be happier going to job to job  meeting and helping new people instead of finishing his law degree and living a mundane monotonous life behind a desk   i've always wondered if anyone actually took inspiration from this show and traveled and lived the freeter lifestyle even for a little and how it effected their life  positive or negative  it always made me think about life  even if the show is not that deep on the surface and is just a silly comedy ,lr3p9m

298,"Thoughts on ""Dirty and Dangerous"" jobs in an anti-work society.",i think one of the main reservations a lot of people have with an anti-work society is the  removal of incentive  for dirty and dangerous jobs  like dealing with sewage  building infrastructure  etc   to this point  if we think logically we can actually imagine a much better  scheme  even if some form of dirty or dangerous labor is still necessary   1  many dirty and dangerous jobs are only necessary because of capitalism   sweatshops are only  necessary  because of a consumer culture predicated on consumption meant to ease the stress of work life  for example  and wouldn't need to be done under a more civilized social order   when thinking of the  necessity  of dirty and dangerous jobs  we must remember that many jobs we think of as dangerous are not actually necessary   2  capitalism adds to the dangers of jobs by cutting corners on protective equipment  healthcare  and will abandon workers who are  broken  by their jobs   3  capitalism necessitates the expansion of dangerous jobs  such as updating infrastructure  by diverting resources away from what is good for society in the long term  for example  roads that last 50 years vs roads they can service yearly    so we can logically assume that a more sophisticated social order can exist where we accept the destruction of useless dirty and dangerous jobs and the non work of people in these jobs   by ensuring everyone a livelihood and care regardless of work ability  dangerous jobs that are still necessary are made less dangerous since a society with the goal of improving human life would definitely provide as much protection to these types of workers as possible   healthcare for these workers would not be something left solely up to their responsibility  and people would be cared for even in the horrible scenario that they are crippled while doing dangerous jobs for society   furthermore  if society adopts a  long term  sustainable  approach to design and infrastructure  there will be less and less of a need for  dirty  dangerous  and necessary  jobs   moreover  actual dirty and dangerous jobs that are still necessary would no longer be alienated from their work  and would see the fruits of their labor in the direct benefit to a society that actually values them   a society with different values might find people tripping over themselves to assist those doing dangerous jobs  by taking care of their families and residences when their work is necessary ,lqf0f0

319,The positive psychological changes I experienced after working for myself,in an attempt to maybe one day escape the 9-5 grind  i started working on a project that i ve always had in mind  but never put to action- opening an e-commerce shop that imports and sells things from my country   to my surprise  the sales have exceeded my expectations  people who came from the same country as me have been buying things from me like crazy  and locals are interested in the unique things i sell as well  i made about  500 in profit in my first week  and a consistent  600- 1000 every week since  but that s not the main point  because this business made my life so much better in other ways besides money    here i m going to share the positive psychological changes i experienced after starting my side business  1 i found out that i m not as lazy as i had imagined   though i m always seen as a pretty solid employee  the truth is that there has never been a job where i felt motivated to do my best  i maintain a slightly above average performance to keep my job  but i also fuck around on reddit and facebook whenever i can  and is just better at hiding the corners i cut  i try to never arrive a minute early or leave a minute late  and absolutely hate it when anyone from work sends me a work related message when i m not at work for many years  i thought of myself as a lazy person who lacks drive and the determination to succeed    however  with this business  i m always thinking about ways to grow it  i make sure to maintain a high quality standard for everything i sell  and when a buyer sends me a message to ask about a product at 1am saturday night  i m answering that mofo with great joy  though it may just be due to the honeymoon stage  this has never happened in any job i had it s like i ve turned into a different person as soon as i started working for myself    2 my self confidence is improving   i think this has to do with the fact that in a job  you re inherently inferior to your manager and superiors especially if you re young  however  if you own 100  of a small business  you re the king of it  you can do whatever the hell you want with it as long as it works and it s legal  you don t report to anyone  and have the power to choose who you want to do business with  on your own terms  even though i do need to satisfy customers  the power dynamic is much more balanced compared with that of a boss and an employee    amp x200b   3 less stressed about money and my job   though a couple of thousand dollars a month isn t enough to make me rich  it allows me to spend money on wants without compromising my long term financial plans  in addition  the diversified sources of income relieves the stress of losing all income  like i did last year when i got laid off from my last job   my job is okay now  but if it starts to suck and i decide to quit  i can always do so and rely on this income  this option gives me more negotiating power on work related issues  and reduces the feeling of powerlessness       4 boosted creativity   since i started this business  i m always thinking about how i can make it stand out against competition  this resulted in me coming up with creative solutions to unique problems  and the learning skills  such as graphic design  which i wouldn t have learned in jobs within my field       5 a sense of purpose   there s something special about working on something every day and seeing sales instagram followers number of loyal customers grow little by little  whatever i do for this business accumulates over time if i keep working on it  and whatever content i create will forever be mine this aspect seems to be lacking in most jobs  where you sit in your desk doing the exact same thing every day  the only thing that accumulates is years of experience  but whatever is produced still belongs to the company  and could be taken away at any time  leaving people with nothing to show for their years of hard work other than a new column of experience on the resume    at first  i started this business only to earn a few extra bucks  however  it has improved my quality of life in so many other surprising ways  if there is a project you have in the back of your mind that you haven t taken action towards  i would encourage you to do the same  if it turns out to be a success and you need to hire employees  always remember to be the type of boss that you dreamed of working for ,lph15a

322,A Suggestion,so i've stumbled across this group and although i agree with most of these arguments  i think you guys really need to evaluate the actual meaning of the word 'work'  see 'work'  as defined by oxford dictionary  is  activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to achieve a purpose or result  in other words  it simply means doing something  either physical or mental  to reach a desired result  and once you grasp this definiton  you'll realize that just about everything we do involves work  for example  writing takes work  cooking takes work  cleaning takes work  exercise playing a sport takes work  making music singing takes work  and if you want to apply it to the basic necessities of life  growing producing food takes work  buiding shelters and buildings takes work  to produce clothing takes work  traveling takes work  generating electricty takes work etc  etc  etc  even animals in nature work to obtain their necessities  for instance  a bear isn't just given all the food it needs for its entire lifetime  it has to travel or hunt to find their next meal  hell  even plants trees have to work  by science  in order to grow  and a lot of you advocate being self employed running a buisness but fail to realize that you'll still be working  point being  it is absolutely unnatural and impossible to thrive or survive without doing any sort of physical or mental activity  no human being  even in agarian ancient times survived by doing nothing  nor any species for that matter  therefore  your aversion should not be directed at the idea of 'work'  but more so at 'job' or 'employment' as these are more specific and are what you're referring to anyway  while i am against employment as a form of working  to claim that human beings shouldn't do any work at all is absolutely absurd  we need to differentiate between 'work' and 'job' as they are two separate terms  so i suggest renaming this group to 'antijobs' to avoid such confusion  any thoughts,lqugg9

360,"Burnt out at work, exhausted but financially trapped to stay",throwaway account for semi-obvious reasons   just needed somewhere to get this obvious reasons - just feel like i want to quit my job as a doctor  it's maddening and frustrating when you go to work at 6am on weekdays and work continuously until 7 30pm - any sort of lunch break you have is taken up by meeting and tutorials  half of which you don't attend because you are busy with patients in the ward - which gets you into serious trouble with your department  on weekdays you will work from 6am until 2pm   the overnights are bad - when you work shifts from 6am till 2pm the next day without a fucking break or more than 1 hour of sleep - and get called the next day by another team to be told they think you've been over cautious and done too much for a supposedly straight forward case   amazingly you must declare when clocking in your workplace hours that you work from 8am to 5pm on weekdays  and 8am to 12noon next day for night shift days  so you don't get called up and accused by your department of violating working hours - thus you do not get paid for any over time work  however you will get screwed if you go into work the same time as your boss  8am  and have not prepared adequately for ward rounds  and you will be screwed if you haven't finished your work and left at 5pm or 12 noon on the dot   the days are bad - when families and patients complain continuously about not being updated often enough or early enough in the day  it is frustrating when you are tired  burnt out but need to be constantly  on  and paying attention to every little detail in a patient's charts   in a history  you need to be  on  when you communicate with your patients and their families  you need to be  on  when you sit in a meeting less you get shamed for lack of participation   you find yourself denied leave or having been  missed out  in an email for leave requests and being told you are not allowed to have a break although its been 6 months since your last day of leave   you are told by your department  your patients  and their families  your superiors that you are never enough  you are never caring enough  never meticulous enough  never concise enough  never detailed enough  never clever enough  never as skilled as enough  never as hardworking enough  never enough   it's not that we work for appreciation or we even need the acknowledgement   just a fucking break from the hate and constant criticism over small things would be nice   am trying so fucking hard and giving every ounce of my being to my patients  to my work - and it is fucking enough on my end to be told that i need to be doing more  am sick of the passive aggressive conversations from nurses seniors patients  oh sorry to be disturbing you now - i know you are probably on a lunch break  - no i am not because i have not been on a lunch break in months - if you would like to know i once wet myself in the ward because i was so busy i could not even fucking pee   i do my best to be polite and respect to those around me but am reaching a point where i'd like to shoot myself in the head after all the shit that happens   am tired of my own family implying i don't come home early enough  don't reply texts early enough  am not mentally present enough when i'm home   every single minute of every fucking day - people are bitching about something or another and in all honesty - i would say this is the main job of a doctor  to be bitched to and make sense of things and coordinate things while enduring a barrage of bitching from everyone   would change speciality but have heard from other juniors elsewhere they are similar drowning and flailing  would quit but am financially bound to this for life - all for a job i once upon a time loved before it chewed me up and spat me out ,lqhsun

So happy I found this group,i m new to reddit  amp  i m so happy i have found this thread  i m a 23f  i joined the work force in 2019 after being hired at a cooperate firm    i had worked since i was 15 but  as i was in school it was always part-time  amp  this meant i never fully grasped the realities of working full time  it took me around 5 months of full time work to know that i hated it    none of it made sense to me  i instantly felt like they wanted me to work at a capacity that wasn t just or fair  then i realised this wasn t a unique problem and was pretty standard   a few things  that shocked me included  but not limited to     - the work hours  - i wasn t paid for my break  - only 21 days of holiday  it felt  and still does feel  like a huge scam    i remember i got sick once during my probation  i had tonsillitis and literally couldn t talk  eat  or swallow  i lost  120 in pay those 2 days i was off because i was on probation and apparently hadn t earned the right to be sick yet  wtf  i was still sick when i came back but literally couldn t afford to lose more money   in addition i feel that in order for me to  succeed  in my job i have to put in overtime constantly  i m never on-top of my tasks because  frankly i m not willing to work over the weekend nor am i willing to work till 8pm most nights nor work at an inhuman like pace during my work day  some days are productive some aren t  i m not a machine  this is created issues around my anxiety levels  amp  stress  i don t like to feel like i m not doing my job well or be behind  especially when i m surrounded by people burning the midnight oil regularly and  going the extra mile  i constantly feel like i m lacking but i don t like the path i have to take to reach success    also  my corporate job pays but the pay is one of the only good thing i get out of this job  i hate that we put money in front of joy  fulfilment  amp  money is one of the biggest indicators of  success  that is very backwards to me  yes money is an aid  yes i would love to be rich but i m am not willing to give up most of my waking life to have it  i m  more than willing to work hard when i work on something i enjoy or find it meaningful  i think this is true for most people but why do so many meaningful jobs pay so low  it all feels so unbalanced and exploitive - i hate participating in it but what s the alternative    arghhh  thanks for giving me a space to rant ,lpwmtt
367,Essential vs Non Essential,i think the pandemic forced a very interesting idea to the main stream  the idea that some people work essential jobs but the vast majority work non essential jobs  i'm sure most of us here knew this to some degree already    i think it's even more interesting that many people who work non essential work are almost forcing the majority to believe that the non essential is actually essential when it is not  people trying to find meaning in something where there clearly isnt any meaning  like a physchopath trying to convince his victims that he loves them before he kills them   in case some of you dont know of this man  david graeber  please check him out  he discusses a lot of the non essential vs essential and possibly where we might be headed ,lqkedh

399,Exploited for free labor at 16,this might get kinda long cuz the more i write the more i remember hahah  scroll down for tldr  this happened over ten years ago but it s only just struck me how fucked up this was   i was homeschooled at 16 and wanted some spending money so i started looking for a job  i was a pretty edgy teen  so i didn t want some boring mcdonald s job or something i wanted something cool and unique  i picked up some weird jobs due to this attitude  including making file trees filled with images stolen from the home depot website  no idea why someone posted me to do that but they paid me  so     i eventually stumbled onto something i thought would be perfect  it was to work security part time at haunted attractions  now  i don t think it s legal for a 16 year old to be a security guard in ca  but i figured myself for something of a badass and applied anyway and they told me to come in for an interview    when i got there  the place was absolutely packed  there were no joke at easy 20-30 people there  eventually i get called in  and there s these 3 guys sitting at a desk in the middle of a large dance room  the kind with floor to ceiling mirrors along all the walls    they told me they knew i wanted to work security  but they had everyone audition for the role of maze monster first anyway  i thought that was weird  but whatever  they gave me a few different roles you re a clown in a straight jacket  and you ve for an itch on your nose  is the one i remember most clearly  they were all like that    it was tons of fun  and they seemed like really cool guys  they told me a little about the company  said that it s spent xx years doing this and that they re opening a new location in  home town  and yadda yadda  they told me the hours  thurs-sun  something like 6pm-12am or whatever  and the pay 10 hr  for a high school student  that s perfect    i get an email a few days later saying not only was i hired  they were so impressed with my acting skills that they re making me part of the  elite team much cooler than the average maze monster  i d be working in front of the haunt to encourage people to come buy tickets and keeping people in line entertained  i was unbelievably flattered  because i d never acted a day in my life and here were professionals who wanted me as part of their elite team     some time goes by and they announce when training will begin  it ll go on for about a month and a half before the scare season starts  3 times a week for 6 weeks  we re to meet up at the local sports park for 3 hours    wear exercise clothes    kind of weird  but ok    the next six weeks are hellish  there s about 20 of us  all varying ages  and health status  they make us run laps to start  push ups  sit ups  all sorts of other things  a bunch of people quit on the first day  they announce one day that we re going to be making our characters for the haunt the way they do this is line us up and tell us to  get in character  and they ll come up and ask questions  if we hesitate  they make us do push ups  mind you i d never created a character in my life  let alone a fully developed horror character that i can also act out  i did a lot of push ups  they also berated us  made fun of our characters  all of your characters suck   they all just have daddy issues  come up with something unique   unique  these guys also had characters  btw  and one of them was literally just  killer clown    i made some friends with the other  employees  one of whom was a man more than twice my age  we d run the laps together  joke around  etc  he eventually made a facebook group for the employees where we would bitch and complain about the bosses  he in particular would imply that they were gay in pretty derogatory ways  as a closeted gay guy  i mostly didn t interact   hilarious side note  this guy would also call me at weird hours and hit on me saying my voice was sexy  so there s that    fast forward a bit  and the season is about to start  they gather all of us monsters  along with all the other workers construction workers that are going to build the maze  concession workers  security  etc etc  in front of the building we re going to work at  they pump us the hell up about this    a week later  they fire everyone except the elite monster team  because they couldn t secure a seasonal contract to rent the building  seems like a pretty big damn oversight for such an experienced team    but as i said  they didn t fire the elite team  we were given a time and a place and by now  there were only like  6 of us  they had work for us  we were going to work at various haunts throughout socal  in mazes that  needed help  because we were  so well trained  and elite    we worked at i think a total of three different haunts  each night everyone would pile into my car  as i had access to a big van that would fit all of us  and drive to the haunt we d be working at    this was when i learned that i wasn t going to have the costume i thought i was going to have  i wanted to be kind of a zombie in a straight jacket  instead  they had a purple frilly dress for me to wear  i was actually pretty down with that  and it was fine until one of the original workers at the maze we were at started harassing me about it  trying to figure out if i was  a chick or a tr nny  another night  the bosses would come in like every few hours and berate my performance and say it sucked    at one point  i had to basically move to la for like the whole month of october to work at a haunt  we stayed in a warehouse full of old movie props  which was actually pretty cool  but at this point i had no money because we hadn t actually been paid for any of our work yet  i was eating those 99 cent bread loaves from walmart and free tea from the concessions stand  sometimes at the end of the night  the owner of this haunt would buy everyone pizza  so that s what i ate for weeks    the season ends  and there s no word from the bosses for a few weeks  then  finally  i get a call  i have to go meet up with them to get my paycheck    i get there  and it s a lot like my audition was  three guys sitting at a table  i sit down  and they slide across the table not a check  but a print out of a bunch of postings from the facebook group  on top is the only post i interacted with  my friend  implying the bosses are gay  and my comment lol  or whatever it was  something noncommittal and innocuous  they say that this facebook group counted as defamation  and so they were only going to pay me the gas they used to get to the haunts  they gave me a check for something like  23  not nearly enough to cover a huge chevy suburban s gas driving all around southern california    but  i was 16  it was my first  real  job  i thought i was in serious legal trouble  i took the paycheck  said sorry for calling them gay  and left in tears    the worst part is  i d really liked these guys  i d wanted their approval so much  and i d worked harder than i d worked in anything to get it  and it didn t work     finally tldr   company makes me do months of unpaid training that consisted of hard physical exercise  then used me for my car to get around to jobs through socal  then only paid me  23 because i was in a facebook group that called them gay,lobdlf

415,Work hard and you will succeed?,i want to start by saying that i absolutely hate working  however have always seen it as a necessary means to an end  i've often worked 2 or 3 jobs simultaneously to make ends meet  as i've lived in my own place since i was 21 and always had a car  so wage slavery has had me hooked for a while now  i worked 6 days a week over two jobs for a year and a half until the pandemic hit and had no life   i'm 27  based in scotland and work for local government  or council as it would be called here  within their hr services department  prior to the pandemic i had an hour commute to the office 9-5 and then same again on the way back - now i work from my bedroom  i grew up in a deprived area  living with my non-working single mother and siblings  although my dad has always been in the picture  like any working-class person my age  i was brought up to believe that if i work hard  i'll get on in life  this idea of social mobility is what's sold to you throughout your youth and what ultimately pushed me towards university  where i spent a number of years achieving a 2 1 in business  hons  and an msc in human resource management while sacrificing a lot in my personal life  i do not like hr   i have worked in my organisation's hr services department since summer 2018 and in my current role for almost 2 years now  for the most part  local government workers have a bad reputation here in the uk  as they're very safe jobs  although not paid very well  which are great for lazy people  i knew this before starting but figured i'd be able to get on in the organisation with my education once i'd gained some experience  as they don't typically recruit graduates  my understanding was that if i work to a high standard  take on extra reponsibilities and show that i'm keen then i'd be able to progress after a year or two   this week though  i've been unsuccessful for a job that i am very familiar with  and one that i do a lot of already  in favour of a colleague who's worked for the organisation for 30 years or so without progressing  while i'd agree they are capable of doing the job  this person does not have the education i have and is not nearly as outgoing as i have shown since i joined the team - i've been a tremendous yes-man and always the first to take on extra responsibilities  to air my thoughts in team meetings and to find solutions to the issues we face  in fact  after their retirement plans were announced  the postholder inferred on several occasions that their job would be mines before interview  when looking at it  it was hard to imagine how it couldn't be - after all  that old mantra is what i've been assured all my life  i'd worked hard  done well on the job and gone above and beyond regularly and always understood i'd be rewarded accordingly   on learning that i hadn't got the job  my manager advised i gave a strong interview but was  pipped at the post  they didn't offer much meaningful feedback beyond the old  work on your interviewing skills  there is an implication i am supposed to take the knock  continue with my head down and continue to work towards getting the promotion  it just wasn't my turn  my conclusion is that i simply have not occupied a seat for long enough to warrant a move up the ladder - there is an unspoken queue and i need to serve my time first  my experience to date has also shown me that my education is of no value here at all - which is ironic as i was recently asked by my manager to host an online recruitment event at my old university  my eager  people-pleasing self obviously agreed   the last few days have obviously now given me plenty of food for thought about the way forward  i don't doubt that if i carry on i'll get a promotion eventually  but now i'm not sure i'm willing to  if i don't show i'm willing to and stop offering to take on extra responsibilities etc  it'll be held against me as i've set such a high standard for myself since i started  never mind feeling like a dick for going above and beyond  i've actually shot myself in the foot a bit going forward   i have a colleague who has got incompetence down to an art form and they earn more money than i do purely as they've worked there longer  let's call them steve  i always find myself picking up after steve's mistakes and i suppose you could say i've looked down on them for their laziness  now i'm beginning to look at this in a different light - steve just wants his bills paid  shows up to the mind-numbing 9-5 doing bare minimum and lives a reasonably comfortable life    maybe steve has it all figured out and i've been too naive to realise  there is quite an uncomfortable realisation there   while i haven't read david graeber's book  i've listened to a good bit of his stuff and can comfortably say this is a bullshit job and the work is brutally unfulfilling  however in my pursuit for promotion and better pay  i've tricked myself into enjoying it as a challenge  even going back to university - i told myself i'd put up with it as long as i'm paid well  while i'm not exactly paid well  i have now been working from my bedroom since march 2020 and will likely continue until the end of the year  at least  as before  there aren't many safer jobs to have in this pandemic and economic climate  and this allows me to save a decent amount of money per month and so i'm left in quite a fortunate position going forward   i am completely disillusioned and have told myself i'll take a few weeks to figure out my future plans  i have a feeling that moving organisation won't be any better though  i could also change career - for example  i've always thought about doing teaching  which i suppose would be more fulfilling work  i'd also like to work for myself but i don't have any skills etc to make this a reality  in a way  i'd be far more content cruising at the minimum in my comfortable job for the next year or 2 and saving my energy for my free time    i understand this sub is against the concept of work altogether  but what's the alternative or the best compromise in the current system  do you still believe that hard work gets you places or have you abandoned this mantra altogether  i'd be interested to hear from other people who have had similar realisations or any podcast book recommendations etc ,lp5dyt

442,Feel like I can‚Äôt function in normal society,no judgement please  just need to vent  i m 25 now and been on my own since i was in highschool  my relationship with my parents had gotten better but they can t do much to help me financially and i can t live with them  i have a mood disorder that makes maintaining a job difficult  i can do it for a while but i always screw up somehow by taking too much time off  being late too much  having an outburst or forgetting to show up     im in college because i can get grants and loans  and i am interested in my degree but as the classes get harder i m struggling and have dropped quite a few over the years  now i m in student debt with not much hope of being able to pay it back if i can t maintain a job  i wish there was an opt out but there just isn t  i know people who train hop and travel and busk and live out of a backpack but that life can be really rough and a lot of them are on opiates  it doesn t seem like how i want to live personally  paying rent is sucking me dry and i just feel like i m constantly spinning my tires to get nowhere  landlords can eat a d ck  my city is full of homeless people and empty houses and condos  the winters are brutal     when i have time to focus on being healthy i can feel ok and because i was self employed when the pandemic started i was able to get unemployment since my contractors shut down  i m terrified of what my life will be like when unemployment is over  i have my rent paid in advance until september  after that i don t know what will happen     i often fantasize about living in a tent in the woods  life makes more sense that way  it just seems easier  i know how to get food and water  but living in a tent even remotely close to a city is dangerous so that makes getting resources too hard  it s not realistic   also just a note i m not opposed to working for a purpose  if i had a farm  garden  kids  stuff like that i d gladly work hard to care for them  but it s this weird bureaucratic nonsense job kinda stuff that baffles me and drains my life  if i m 5 minutes late to feed a goat  the goat doesn t fire me  if i skip one day of tending to corn  it likely won t die  it feels like i have no freedom to be imperfect ,lnyzi5

447,You CAN'T be yourself during a job interview,i recently read an interview on how to successfully apply for a job  in the comments  there was an opinion that above all at a job interview you have to be yourself and that is the key to success   unfortunately  you cannot be yourself during a job interview  you have to say what they want to hear   i  can't say i left my previous job because i was a victim of mobbing and had diarrhea from stress - i have to lie to  not speak unfavorably about my former employer  because it's unprofessional and say that this position was  not exactly what i was looking for  instead  i can't say that my hiatus on my resume is because i was depressed and ill  i have to say that i was working illegally at the time for my uncle's company so i wouldn't come off as a slacker or someone who's going to take a  sick leave every week  i can't say that i changed my job on average every 2 years because i have neurosis  anxiety and it's hard for me to find a good job for people with my ailments - i have to say that i want  to grow in many areas and try new things because i am feisty  when asked  about my education  i have to say that i plan to go to college because i  wanted to gain experience at work before  but the truth is that i could not afford to go to college and my parents did not pay any attention to my education and all i heard was that i should stop being weird and go to work  preferably as a cashier or cleaning lady at walmart   do you think they would hire me if i said things like that   of course  if your life is a success story  why would you lie  unfortunately  not every life is like that  but everyone has to take part in this theater called the  recruitment process ,lp7q2q

450,"Why should I bother trying to get a high-paying, full-time job when my country (the U.S.A.) disincentivizes it?",i went to school to get my degree  getting myself into a decent amount of debt  not terrible but a significant amount   as such  i was able to land a decent job  making a few more dollars an hour than i had been previously   in a way  this seemed worth it  as over time this added income should  in theory  eliminate the debt   additionally  i should have  again  in theory  been able to increase my income even further with hard work and pay increases promotions   however  i was laid off when the pandemic hit and collected unemployment for ten months before finding a similar opportunity just this past week   during that time  my income remained the same and i received both stimulus checks   so now i can't help but think  what's the point   why should i bother working 40  hours weeks  feeling exhausted and miserable  when i can do just as well  if not better  not working or working shorter hours   during those ten months  i was much happier and healthier and my income actually went up thanks to the stimulus payments   working harder and moving up the proverbial  corporate ladder  would simply force me to pay more taxes and miss out on stimulus money   this is in addition to the aforementioned happy healthy hits i would take   furthermore  the minimum wage is also set to be bumped up to essentially what i was making then anyway   at that point  the hard work and money spent to earn my degree will have provided me nothing   it seems like there is a disincentive to  better  yourself and work harder   the best strategy seems to be keeping a modest paying job for around a year  getting laid-off fired  and collecting unemployment until it runs out   doing more just doesn't seem worth it   making more money and working harder just makes you miss out on government assistance and forces you to pay more in taxes   and even if you run out of unemployment  you can always go on welfare   so where is the incentive to work long hours  get the promotion  etc   where is the incentive not to get fired from your job or laid off after a certain amount of time   i realize that the u s a  though moving in a socialist direction  is far less so than many other countries but they almost seem to be discouraging hard work and high achievement  the importance of and value of which was stressed to us our entire lives   what are your thoughts on this   am i crazy or off-base in noticing this ,lo15z3

478,I turned 28 on Tuesday. First thought I had waking up today was that so many years of my life have sped by while working full time,good morning  existential crisis  i ve had them since i was 23 when a friend committed suicide  and they ve at least gotten better  sometimes i still get so sad  though  especially when i think about getting older and seeing my parents age and pass away  me passing away    but this morning i realized that i m 28 now  i m almost 30  and when i look back at how fast 18 - 28 went  i feel basically 40  like 40 will be here in a year and me being old and dying is close enough to feel it following me year after year    this is melodramatic  i realize  but i started thinking that college went by at a steady pace  it wasn t until i started working full time that the years sped by  you spend so much time waiting for two dats each week to try to cram in things you need to do  then a handful of hours for hobbies  i just don t have time to do the things i want to do or used to do  i have to choose  do i devote time to computer stuff to potentially change careers and better myself or do i play video games  learn languages  etc    i read once about some theory that said that time only seems to go by faster when you re older because you ve had more stretches of time to compare against  a 7 year old feels like a summer lasts a lifetime because they haven t experience many summers yet    while that may be true i think the reason time goes by so fast is because of work  toiling day in and day out waiting for the weekend  waiting for the major holiday  waiting for another vacation  you blink and before you know it another year is gone  i go back to work tomorrow after taking 9 days off and i didn t want to go back 72 hours ago  it feels like i just barely had enough time to let my hair down for once and have freedom  it was just enough time to put the house back in order and feel okay with that  but i didn t spend much time on hobbies  just recuperating or trying to    i m privileged  i have a relatively good job with some minor flaws  i make enough money to be comfortable  pay rent  pay car payment  pay utilities  pay groceries  etc  but little left over and barely save  i ve got medical bills up the wazoo i m trying to pay off and each month i wonder where my money goes  but i m housed  clothed  and fed  i m privileged where income is concerned compare to many  but i m poor in time  and the older i get the more loss i feel over time ,lp5tka

531,Exploitation: An Antiwork Math Class,what is exploitation   it is not just the conditions of laborers in the developing world  it is merely the utilization of a resource in more and more expansive ways   oil is exploited as fuel  silicon is exploited as computer components  and humans are exploited as labor   the simplest exploitation of people as a resource under capitalism is profit   imagine you are in a simple fast food chain where you are the only employee   you work for a wage to produce hamburgers which your boss sells for a profit   this simple exchange is exploitative  since by the nature of it you are adding a certain amount of value to a product but only receiving a percentage of that value back as a wage   you may be okay with this relationship   although you are not able to retain all of the value you add to the hamburger  your job offers you a certain amount of stability   you would not  after all  be able to create the hamburger without the resources your capitalists owns  their industry connections also may provide you with a certain piece of mind that your job is more secure than it would be if you were managing the resources needed to produce the hamburger on your own   this is exploitative  but it is not that bad   one day your boss hires a second worker and installs a drive thru window   you don't think much of it  having an extra pair of hands is helpful  and the extra business makes you feel like your job is more secure   conservatively  the job can handle 2x the business now  and both you and your coworker are 2x more efficient than you were on your own   however  your pay does not increase   you are doing the same work  at a more efficient rate  and putting out twice the value  and your boss offers you  as the senior employee  a healthy 10  raise   however  this is already getting screwy  because you are now working twice as hard but getting an even smaller portion of what you are creating despite your raise   the boss hires another two workers with the profits in the business and now the restaurant  and each worker with it  is able to put out 4x of what you  as an individual  were originally creating   you  individually are given another 10  raise   you are now working 4x harder for 1 2x the pay    and this can be extrapolated out into the entire working class   this is basically the math behind that commonly shared  wages stagnation  graph https aflcio org sites default files migrate files five-causes-of-wage-stagnation-in-the-united-states jpg     every year the capotalist class is able to double or triple the amount of resources and money they are under control  while we  in comparison  are given a smaller and smaller share   this doesn't stop at wages either   employers used to include a decent amount of job training  even for basic things like professional writing   these days   they don't have to do that  you pay for it now with your higher education  saving them money on the clock for when they train you   the pandemic is another example   can't stop the growth of businesses  so instead we'll force nurses and other healthcare workers to work 5x harder so we don't have to close anything   exploitation makes it a mathematical certainty that the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer   unless you are doubling or tripling your income and resource acquisition  you aren't even keeping up pace  so save your fantasies of  escaping the system by working inside of it  if you still have any   every year you are doing more and more work for less  and that is why work fucking sucks ,lmtogq

537,Being unemployed won't be positive until the Culture changes,the majority of people have yet to accept the idea that jobs working aren't inherently positive or that not necessarily everybody needs to be working  it's basically a culture where if you don't have a job  there are many negative assumptions made about you - and it will hold you back   there's also the fact that certain jobs are better for everyone if they continue to exist  like doctors etc  but i think where the cognitive dissonance comes in is when people don't realise the amount of people necessary to fill those roles would probably be closer to 50  of the population    a lot of people are just mindlessly working at aimless jobs because we fetishise the idea of work as some sort of 'valid human citizen' card  it's very pathological and kind of malevolent  serves the rich though  can't have everybody realising that they're borderline enslaving people   or literally  in some cases ,lmshpf

554,"Punishing or giving ""points"" for calling in sick is archaic and needs to go away already.",i could literally write 10 pages on this  but i will keep it brief as possible  it's something that really gets under my skin   why do we supposedly punish employees for calling in sick  or give them points  ask any business  and their response 99  of the time will be  so people are encouraged to come to work and not staying home all the time   this has to be the most dumb as fuck argument ever    for starters  if you completely got rid of the punishment  points  or any negativity  at all  for calling in sick  i doubt very few would abuse this   why  because people need money  employers seem to think without points or other systems for calling in sick  people would just call in all the time     bull shit    the point of a job is to work for money to pay you rent  car payment  bills  etc  the only people who might be breaking the rules is either teens living at home and thus little or no bills  or people who are so filthy rich  they work  out of boredom   yes  these people exist   so if someone is fired  they make no money  if someone stays home  playing hooky  then they aren't making money either    it also is a highly discriminatory practice  some people have poor immune systems and thus get sick more more often than others  i've seen people rarely get a cold or flu   people also have chronic illnesses and managing that while being berated at work for being  sick too much  only adds stress which is highly unhealthy for someone already in that position    i can't help if i'm sick  i do not make myself purposely sick or go around licking doorknobs     why the fuck should i be punished for this   in what fucking world does that make sense    on top of this  if people were not goaded  guilt tripped or had their job and financial security dangled in front of them like a god damn carrot  i surmise many people would actually get less sick  as i've observed all too often people coming to work sick   especially when companies give out awards and other bullshit for  perfect attendance  or adjust your bonuses if you miss any days   i'm currently at the precipice of losing my job for calling in to much  i have a myriad of health issues  sleep apnea  adhd  chronic fatigue  chronic pain  etc   some nights i get 1 hour or no sleep    work would think it would be better if i drove into work on no sleep and risk crashing into a car and killing myself and possibly others then take the day off ,ln2qws

I hate work as much as you but we need to start asking the important questions - and start taking actions.,content on this sub should focus on  how do we lead a work free life  or at the very least  how do we lead a life in which work does not play a significant role in   and no  i am not talking about huge revolutionary cultural changes on a national or global level - i have long given up on that  greed will always win the hearts of the majority of people - that's the driving motivation for many of the people in power  so things will never change   i am talking about how we  as individuals  can lead a work free life  or something as close to as a work free life  this sub should be us - the community  fostering and cultivating that vision  by helping each other lead a work free life   so i will start - has anyone figured out how to do this yet  please share your valuable knowledge and leave your advice in the comments down below   thank you for reading my post  ,lmot4c

589,My Pandemic Workplace Meltdown,this is just a vent   rant meant to get this off my chest  i made this account to post here after lurking for a while  writing this at work because my employer doesn't deserve any better  the pandemic has absolutely ruined my perception of my workplace  for context  i work for a small business that employs a handful of people  maybe 10-20  i actually know the owner  for the most part i enjoyed working here  the coworkers are nice and not too uptight  of course  heading into the pandemic the owner sat all of us down and gave us the classic  we have to be a team and help each other out  speech  i reel every time i think of it and how little help anyone here has gotten  everyone since then aside from myself and one coworker  who take care of the actual day to day tasks  had been reduced to half the amount of hours they used to work and some were let go entirely  did i received hazard pay for showing up to work  no  but at least they will give me the dollar raise i requested to help me stay afloat right  nope  not in the budget  but i know the budget isn't as tight as the owner claims  how do i know this  well apparently it's still in the budget to continue to send their kids to european private schools  apparently it's still in the budget to take frequent international flights  apparently having 3  antique furnished houses in different states is still in the budget  meanwhile unemployment benefits for my coworkers is near an end and there is no talk of returning people to full time   so as a consequence of this pandemic i have learned that  work as a team and help each other  means that i have more responsibilities  less help  and stagnant pay  while my bosses life is  exactly the same  what's the cherry on top of it  i now question why i had a manager at all  clearly if i take care of the daily operations and my manager isn't required full time because i take care of the responsibilities here  then i don't need someone to tell me what to do  yet i don't get help or pay to match  what's worse is that the nepotism in this company is rampant  one of my coworkers is the bosses relative  this relative is not a manager  just a coworker  however they feel the need to report to the owner that somehow my one other full time worker and i don't work hard enough  despite us working harder than ever now  so on top of all my other grievances  i have been putting up with slander  at this point  why don't i just find another job  there's so many possibilities around  which reprehensible corporation do i want to work for  amazon  walmart  grub hub  doordash  ooooh  what about one of the many other small business around  ah  of course  they don't cover the cost of rent  silly me  guess i'll just bootstraps myself until something comes along  i hate this all so much  watching my coworkers struggle while the owner walks around as if nothing is happening  i guess this end my rant  sorry for the long post and probably bad format  hope everyone else is sticking it to their boss somehow  tl dr  owner of the company is completely unaffected by the pandemic while their employees suffer and i'm overloaded with work without help and feel like there is no recourse ,lmpk1e
590,Thinking about quitting my job but I'm nervous.,warning  this is basically just a rant  i'm sorry  i'm just looking for validation i think  i don't know  i've been at my job for a bit over 8 months and it is my first real job  i'm 19 and in college as well  when i first started i was full time in college with 5 classes  a combination of online classes and work not listening to me needing less hours resulted in me dropping 4 out of my 5 classes  when i first started we had 7 employees if you include me  now we have 4  i am now only taking 2 classes but i keep asking for 20-25 hours  my manager will put me on the schedule for that originally  but then scratch out my hours and tack more on without telling me  this results in me working 28-35 hours a week  i enjoy the money but it's affecting my mental health very severely and i often cry in the cooler at work when i'm alone  i also work nights now  i never ever wanted to be the person to close the cafe  never  i've been doing it alone for nearly 3 months now ever since the new manager came  not only this but she constantly talks shit about me behind my back even though others have said i'm the hardest worker there  i get out of work at midnight most nights and this combined with my depression causes me to sleep around 9-10 hours a night and limits the time i can study or even relax  even getting a concussion a week ago was not enough to get less hours  my manager added even more actually and then called off her own shifts twice in a week but guilt tripped me the two times i've called off in the 5 months she's been there  i hate her  i do not mind my job one bit when i'm working with coworkers and not alone  i work 7 hour shifts alone often and it stresses me out beyond belief  i have to cook all of the orders that come in  prep  put away truck all by myself on days it comes  clean  make the 200 donuts we make every night  and clean the store all by myself almost every night  i want to quit but only working somewhere for 8 months looks bad on a resume and the anxiety of finding a new job also makes me feel sick  i like the comfort of knowing how to do my job and my family would be incredibly disappointed in me for quitting  plus  i have an apartment with my boyfriend who also has a part time job and it would be so unfair of me to quit  i hate my life so much and the only good thing about working so much is that i'm so stressed about my job and such that i can't even worry too much about killing myself or my mental health  another thing i'm worried about is that since it's my first job that i must be blowing this out of proportion and that everywhere is like this  people have said  at least you're not at a factory  i just feel so worthless at my job and i feel like it's not worth the  8 25 an hour i make  it feels unfair that my manager make more than double the amount i make even though she works less and calls off more  i just hate my life so much and i think quitting would only make me feel more hopeless and starting a new job is too stressful and scary  i just wish i could exist without working  i want time to make art and do crafts without people pressuring me to do it for a career or to sell my art  everything feels hopeless ,lm5fe7
591,I hate that I‚Äôm expected to put my job over my life,i work at a nursing home  i m a receptionist  and i live in texas  texas has just had the worst snow storm i have ever seen in my life we got about 7 inches of snow and sleet over the last few days  the roads are a mess and everyone has been advised to stay home  a lot of people lost power  and our water isn t even safe to drink right now  i am 21 and i haven t seen snow since i got my drivers licence  i ve called in the past 4 days  since the beginning of the snowstorm  i have a small car and im terrified of driving in snow  obviously i would not do this if i was a cna or a nurse  but everything will be fine without me there and i texted my boss and offered to do what i can from home  he never texted me back and no one has reached out to me at all  i just checked the facebook page and it seems like everyone is there except me and i just feel so panicked and guilty  i m scared they ll be mad at me when i go back and i ll be in trouble or that they ll fire me  i think i m a good employee  and i plan to quit soon anyway  but i hate confrontation and just the thought that they might be mad at me when i go back scares me  but also  i think it s ridiculous that i have to be worried about this and that so many employers around here are making people come in despite the weather conditions  despite the fact that i haven t heard from them at all  i m torturing myself with anxiety  i hate this shitty world that values work so much that i feel bad about calling in when it s not safe to drive ,ln62te
592,"Texas Winter storms, asshole management &amp; coworkers",like the majority of texans  the last four days have been very exhausting  scary  and shitty  my house dropped below freezing  i still have no running water  and i had to brave the icy roads to get my pets somewhere warmer   thankfully  i finally got power back today and unfortunately had to get back online for my job  with our two main offices in ca and tx  i half expected some message from our ceo or upper management making sure the tx employees were doing ok  nope  in fact  i came in to messages and unreasonable requests about projects being behind schedule  do they not watch the news  or do these people in upper management positions really lack empathy that much  or is it that they simply not get it  even some weirdos in the texas office straight up asked me for stuff without asking how i was doing  like i legitimately want to know that they and their family are ok  but do they seriously only care about pointless work   absolutely over working for assholes who don't care about you or your well being  what's the alternative though  this was more of a rant than anything  thanks for reading ,ln7727

594,It‚Äôs Okay To Be Angry,i have a lot of people come at me  sometimes in person  but especially online  say that me getting mad at managers and owners is only because i m envious and want what they have   nothing could be further from the truth  i m angry at the injustice of a global economic system that forces people to participate in laboring for others against their will just to obtain the barest necessities of life   and oftentimes not even that   i m not envious of the workaholic bosses who have sorry excuses for relationships with other people and rub it in others faces  i m even less envious of leeches like jeff bezos who work a few hours a day  and still sleep like a baby while knowingly pushing workers to inhumane limits  no thanks  i ll maintain my dignity against all the incentives the system throws our way to sell each other out for a little more cheddar   it s okay to be angry about all this  a lack of anger probably means you re one of the people profiteering off this fucked up system  even if it s commonly perceived as a  negative  emotion  our anger is different from their selfish gaslighting    our anger can lead to bonds being formed  first in mutual passion against something  then out of love and respect for one another and our positions in society  all their sneering does is leave them alone to sit on a pile of money  our money  off our work  we might get it back someday if we fight for it  who knows ,lmcf9x

606,My Work Experience,i recently started a new job for a company in a low cost of living state making 'items'  intentionally being vague for several reasons  my previous employment includes an engineer role at a major corporation   i am paid  12 00 an hour with no benefits  yet  i work 10 hour days every day  there are 10 of us on a single 'item' and other teams working on different lines for different products but the 10 of us make up our entire production for that product 'item'   these items sell for approximately  50 00 each and we produce about 6-7 of them per minute  for 10 hours each day  that means that in the first two minutes of i have paid for my hour worth of labor   or in the first 20 minutes i have paid for my entire 10 hour days salary cost with my labor alone   these items are also very inexpensive to make and don't require any expensive equipment you couldn't afford to put in your home garage  they purchase wires  glue and the other stuff in bulk and very very cheaply   in the break room there are several anti-union posters and we live in a right to work state anyways so they are doubling down there  they also placed all of the losses on a bulletin in the middle of the room that shows how much we lost to warranty and several external issues    it annoys me so much that people see the 0 36  of items were warrantied and cost us  80 000 00 dollars and go 'wow we need to work harder to make up that money  i only make 24k per month and that is 4x my annual salary  yikes'  slightly edited real conversation i overheard  edited with the 24k part  instead of realizing that 0 36  is out of 99 64  of items that made it and produced a massive profit for the semi-quarter  2 months   the product we make is a requirement under osha as well  there are no demand or outlook issues  this company has us working like slave labor  while criticizing us for 0 36  and telling us unions are evil and will steal our rightfully earned peanuts   what the fuck ,lmb1op

634,A thank you to this sub,i was fired from my job 7 weeks ago today in part thanks to this sub    i was working 45-50 hours a week for the last 7 managing a medium sized office  yes i was getting paid decently well for my area but everything fell on my shoulders  it was as if i owned the business from a burden standpoint but didn t get the perks of making millions of dollars  it wasn t my business yet i felt like i could never escape work  i might have only worked 45-50 hours a week but my mind was on the job for at least another 15 hours planning things out  it was like i couldn t get away from work  i was always thinking about the next thing that needed done because if it wasn t done right it fell on me no matter who s fault it was my weekends were never spent care free i was always concerned about what would need done the next monday so that i could get though the week without even more work  most of the other people that worked with me were barely making minimum wage and on assistants  while the owner worked less than 5 hours a week and spent a month in europe ever year plus many other things   he acted like we owed him something for being allowed to work there and him said he was doing the commodity a favor having his business here  while we were all paid a salary the potential commission were a joke compared to how much harder anyone would have to work  we d get 5  of what he made off it and it isn t like any other expenses he had to worry about    my previous employer was also very prideful in the fact that he had non competes in his employee contract  last december i d had enough  he refused to allow us to work remotely  i could do this job completely from my phone should i need to  and had a general belief the pandemic was a conspiracy theory  i started to formulated a plan that would allow me to smoothly transition to starting my own business doing the exact same thing  my employer always said we were  friends  and he said felt like i was a son to him  so believing we were friends i went to the owner with my proposal for me to leave in the coming months to start my own business while also not negatively impacting him or going after his clients and training a replacement  he practically spit in my face and said i had no morals for wanting to start my own company off of things i d learned working for him  when he threw the non-compete in my face i simply handed him the law that prevented the non compete from being valid or binding  on the spot i was fired    distraught and hurt i went home to tell my wife  over the next few days while i worked to set up of my company my now ex employer sent me quite a few texts that ranged from him saying firing me was his best decision in years to i was risking my families well being and then finally he stated he would sue me  i filed for unemployment and even that he contested until i sent the state the text messages he d sent to me   it hasn t been an easy or unstressful transition at times but i couldn t be happier  the  biggest change is i no longer have the contestant and unrelenting cloud of stress and worry over my head about what needed done  the first two weeks after leaving my previous job i would lay in bed at night and start trying to plan everything that would need done for the next day or week until i d realize i didn t work there anymore  i get to work from my own home and not worry about things outside my control  i m now working less than 30 hours a week and when i want to  there s a lot less of that sunday dread when i think about working on monday   i m not yet making half of what i made before but in a short time i should make significantly more then before while still being able to pay those i hire a good wage plus 75  of any commission   as i plan things out i hope to only have my employees working 32 hours a week maximum while still being paid full time    nothing is guaranteed but now that i have some time i just wanted to say thank you  while my thoughts have always aligned with those in this sub being on here really woke me up from the regular 9-5 grind and made me realize i was worth more and i needed a change  i was always worried about leaving the safety net of having a job but now i wish i d have done it years ago  i hope that through my new business i show others the same ,lm0nug

651,"Care workers, social workers, nurses: Why are you anti-work?",i've seen a lot of posts here by people who work in offices  in the service industry  manual labor etc  i'm curious if there are more people like me here in the anti-work sphere  who work in what could be called a  caring  profession  most of us choose these jobs because we enjoy helping people and because we feel our work is meaningful  at the same time  the work can be physically and mentally exhausting  working conditions are often shit  so my question is  why are you anti-work     my own background is in social work and i have worked in several different group homes for people with mental physical disabilities over the years  i have found that even though i love what i do and i care deeply about my clients  i still hate work  i think the  pressure to join the workforce and be a functional adult  was what really made my depression and anxiety spiral out of control when i finished school  i'm almost thirty years old now and i still haven't adjusted to the pressure of work  my social anxiety makes it that i'm terrified of conflict and i'm scared to make any kind of mistake at work because i'm so scared of my co-workers thinking badly of me  it consumes me  and i can't switch off after my shift is over    i like working with the clients and i feel like i'm doing something meaningful  but everything around it  the employer employee-relationship  the stupid in-fighting and gossiping in teams of co-workers  the time constraints  it all sucks  i never take a break at work  maybe one or two quick smoke breaks a shift  the rest of the time i'm on my feet  trying to finish my list of tasks  i almost never finish on time  almost nobody finishes on time  i would claim that it's impossible to finish on time if you actually do your work properly   its exhausting  being so directly responsible for the well-being of other humans and being so under-staffed that you will never have enough time in your shift to actually give every client the attention they need ,lmr03n

654,I‚Äôm not depressed but I seriously would rather die than waste the rest of my life doing what I‚Äôm doing right now (badly need advice),so i started a new job in my field today and i came to this realization   after all the time  effort  and money it took to get my degree and get to this point  i ve realized that i hate my pointless career choice and it feels like nothing more than a complete waste of my life   quickly  i d like to explain how i got here though   all my childhood  up through high school  i felt motivated to be a high achiever  i always got straights a s  i was on sports teams  in a bunch of school clubs  etc  for whatever reason  i felt purpose and enjoyed being a high achiever  i graduated near the top of my class and though i wasn t necessarily always happy  starting around 11 when my parents split  we moved  etc  but i was doing pretty well   then  when i got to college  everything changed  i went through a few phases of pretty deep depression  my anxiety and ocd worsened as well and a lot of my time was filled with simply feeling a decent level of pain and anguish  it was difficult and i felt like quitting a lot but eventually i got through it  it took me about twice as long as everyone else  8 years  due to a combination of not knowing what i wanted to do my first two years  my mental issues  and simply struggling to adjust to the speed and difficulty of college classes  but in the end  i got through it and got my accounting degree  with a good gpa  granted with many drops audits  from a good school   so everything seemed great but for some reason i just had little motivation to find an accounting job  i don t know why but i just felt more comfortable at my menial  fast food job  with a few good friends  sure  the restaurant was horribly run  they had me on the night shift  i worked 40-45 hours a week  and i traveled about an hour there and an hour back every day but that just seemed okay and i didn t really want to leave  i was well liked  got a bit of ot  and i did really well handling customers and honing my customer service skills    living with my mom again  however  she forced me to get an accounting job  so i applied and got one pretty easily for last tax season  jan-april 2020  the job was okay but it was often boring and tedious  i once again traveled an hour each way a day and worked 40  hours  i did fine but it just wasn t appealing  i was also always tired  being that i only got a few hours of sleep a night  i m a night owl  who hates mornings  i will legit stay up until the sun rises and sleep into the afternoon  if i can  i had hoped they would keep me on once tax season ended but  due to the pandemic and the fact that they didn t have enough work after tax season ended  i was let go   so  over the next ten months  until today  i was unemployed and i finally felt truly happy and fulfilled  to some that might sound crazy  i m 27 and i was unemployed living with my mom  but to me it was such a refreshing time  i felt free and got to learn about myself  educate myself on what i wanted to learn about  spend time on hobbies  and work toward the things i was passionate about  most of my friends are also online  so i got to talk to them and play games online with them a lot and just relax  having much less stress and feeling content  truly  those 10 months felt like actually living  they felt meaningful  and hell  the craziest part is that ordinarily those 10 months would have seemed horrible  and there were small periods of times when they were  for example  the two worst things in my life happened  i lost my dog and my grandfather  both whom i loved dearly  there were some very difficult days but thanks to overcoming my depression in the past  i was able to continue moving forward and was able to regain my happiness  honestly  i feel like beating truly dark depression and being able to move forward no matter what comes at me is my biggest triumph   but now i have a job again and i hate everything about it  i hate getting up so early to go in  i hate going in and being around strangers  i hate having to feel  on  for people  i hate the stress and time pressure that i am will be put under  i hate feeling judged for my germaphobia  which has only been amplified thanks to the pandemic  even though i don t even fear covid that much  and other small quirks  frankly  i hate it all  i m the type of person who needs a pretty significant amount of alone time and when i work  i obviously am unable to have it  though it s obviously much different around family  friends  etc  even being around them too long takes its toll on me a bit   i simply like my alone time  i don t need much at all  just the basics and maybe a computer with a few friends to talk to and play games with  that s my dream lol  not working or working very little  having a modest lifestyle  and having a lot of free and alone time to do what i want as i choose  do i enjoy going out and doing things  do i enjoy trips  do i enjoy visiting family  watching sports games  shows together  etc  absolutely  but if i m working a lot of hours  i simply don t want to do very much of that  i go crazy without my down time lol   i used to think i wanted to get married  have children  etc but i don t think i do anymore  maybe if i found a woman who feels similarly to me but as far as having kids  i don t know  i feel like my life will always be run by them and other than caring for them  which obviously holds a lot of value  the rest of my life will be pointless  i ll never get to do the things i like to do and feel happy and or at peace  just thinking about the permanence of it and potential for being constantly stressed and unhappy gives me a small feeling of anxiousness   i don t know if anyone can relate to any of this but it s how i feel  i don t have a motivation problem at all and my depression isn t much of a factor either  i get myself insanely motivated and excited to pursue my hobbies and the causes i feel are important  it s just unfortunate that a  i can t make money through them and b  i m not particularly efficient  though i m thorough and accurate  it s not even that i dislike accounting  i like messing with numbers  it s just the going into work  the time pressure  the early and long hours  etc  i tried looking into some independent contracting  where i could work remotely and get paid by the return or document  not by the hour  that honestly sounds great bc i can take my time and won t have to start so early  unfortunately  i got hired instead lol   i know this is a very long-winded post and might even seem like a stupid post to some people but it s how i feel  maybe i just haven t found my passion that can make me money but i m not sure i ll ever get that opportunity  i can do what i m doing for awhile  i can suck it up through the tax season even  but doing it my entire life just seems unbearable  hell  i m sure i could even eventually pass all four parts of the cpa exam  i did spend  2 400 on a course  but the traditional career just seems horrible to me   thank you in advance to anyone who actually read some or all of this and is kind enough to respond  i figure i m not the only person in the entire world feeling a bit this way   p s  i m not helped by the fact that my family  even though they are great people  are big on working long hours  even if you hate your job  most of them waste their lives doing it  even if they aren t compensated for their efforts ,lmext0

658,"Introverts, extroverts, social skills and ""office politics""",just following up on another post about this   i don't see it as so much of an introvert extrovert issue   what i have seen in my 30  years of working is that it's much more about how much you are willing to be used by your boss and co-workers to meet their emotional needs   if they want you to be their therapist  best friend  son daughter  mother father  sidekick  drinking buddy  emotional chew toy  or just join in when they are trashing or gossiping about other people  you better do it   having healthy boundaries can actually hurt you in the workplace   now  of course  no one ever talks about it like this   most people probably don't even know they are doing this   they just think they like and get along with one person  and not so much another  without ever thinking about why that is   i think it falls along a spectrum with stuff like sexual or racial harassment at the more extreme end   notice how many stories involve the target feeling like they couldn't do anything about it because it would risk their job or their entire careers   the boss has the power  whether their agenda is to make jokes about your tits or tell you all the gory details of their divorce   it's just as difficult for an extrovert to set boundaries as for an introvert  because in both cases it is about challenging power dynamics ,ljcroq

700,And the system keeps chugging along...,i realized that the reason people leave is because of two things  1  your pay is stifled the second you accept and offer  it will stagnate from that moment on  2  simultaneously  the employers' demands and expectations of you will increase from that moment on  they want more  while not giving you better pay  marginal amendments  if that   thus  when you start a new job  it's worth it --- its a lot of new work  but you're being paid really well   however  there will come a time  likely in 2-3 years of your start date where the effort required no longer is worth the income  this is because your pay hasn't really increased to match your new workload  this is when you leave the job   i am an idiot and have been here for too long  i hate them and they don't like me  they're trying to make me do more  when i know new hires junior to me are making 20  more than me   and thus this is the 2-3 year career switch churn cycle  and the system chugs along   i can't wait to leave my job  i started interviewing a month ago  and can't wait to land something good  i studied all weekend for interviews ,lk136z

719,is anyone else on this sub genuinely poor?,i've seen a lot of  what do you do and how much do you make  posts on here and the majority of people have been on high salaries  some on more than 100k even that i've seen    and i completely understand and accept that you can still hate your situation and work when you're earning more  and that it can be incredibly stressful and that of course there are different costs of living in each area  but there's a huge disconnect between someone saying they hate going to work when they make 80k and who have opportunities and funds to fall back on if they did decide to quit  and someone who also hates their job or working but who is living paycheck to paycheck on low income with no savings or potential future    i work what's considered a low skilled job and many would say it's my own fault for being in this situation  maybe if i'd worked harder i could have done better and i wouldn't be having anxiety attacks every night  but i work for my local council in a library and that's fine i enjoy parts of the job even  although working your entire life is a concept i am completely against as a whole  but i'm payed so little that i had to take the cheapest place i could find in my town which means i'm living with 4 other people who hate me for being trans  and so i dread coming home each day too but can't afford to move anywhere else    every month i have to put something else off  this month i had to put off my eye test and glasses so i have another month of intense headaches due to fucked up eyes  and next month to be able to afford new glasses i'll have to put off going to the dentist which means i'll have to live with these tooth pains for another 2 months and it just carries on and on  i cant afford my medications most months  and by the end of the month i'm always rubbing two pennies together and have nothing i can put into my savings so when my job goes tits up  and it will because funding is always being cut for community services even though we're also considered essential support  i will have maybe a week to hopefully find a new job before i would end up homeless again  if my landlord puts the rent up by even  50 i'd have to stop eating altogether to be able to pay it    i can't afford a hobby or self care  i don't have the time to just relax at the end of each day before going in again tomorrow  the single day off i get a week is spent doing all my laundry and cleaning and cooking for the week as by the time i get back from work i have maybe an hour at most before i have to sleep as taking the cheapest place available also means i'm an hour away from work  my entire life is just working and worrying about money and i cry every single day knowing this is my life    i'm just so tired of everything  i genuinely have no hope for the future anymore  i do feel like i'm going to work myself into an early grave not because the job itself is stressful but because i cant afford to survive for much longer and i'm 22  how can i carry on like this until i'm 50   this probably comes across as just plain whining but i genuinely would like to know if there are others on here who are properly poor too,ljsl1t

733,I hate working. **rant...sorry **,i know this is not the right subreddit but i think you guys would understand  my bosses are awful  i was hired as a manager  but really i'm just an associate  i've run far bigger wineries than this one  single handedly  the husband sits in the office all day  watching tv  just so that when i lock up he can check that i've locked every door  i'm salary  and he insists i come in at 9 am  but we don't even open until 11  and i'm finished with my morning tasks by 915  i just stand around looking busy  he blames me for everything  it was an ice storm yesterday  so after a few hours  the wife sent me home  i said i'd stay on top of social media and emails  at around 3 i checked my email again   i was checking every 30-45 minutes  and i had like 10 emails within a 30 minute span scolding me because they were  slammed and the customers said the roads were fine  and asking me  are you even there  people are asking us questions on facebook and you aren't answering  the message on facebook they were referring to was from the husband  he had messaged the business page  saying  do you have a question  and i had responded to it  so the wife tells me to drive back in  i get there an hour before we close  the wife is in her snowsuit going sledding with their grandson  he has a newspaper open on the bar   i check sales  and it was not busy  the husband has terrible time management skills  and can't adjust his service speed when it's busy  he starts telling me how crazy busy it was  but how he can handle it  and then pulls up the reports  i know he thought it would be much better than it was  but i just stood there  i can see the moment he realizes his numbers weren't great  and then he starts scolding me for  refunding all the reservations instead of rescheduling them  and asked if i even tried  he was trying to find a reason his numbers sucked  problem is  i only refunded 1 reservation  and rescheduled the rest  i told him this and he tried pulling up different dates to like  trick me into thinking i refunded more  i don't know  it was insane   they don't let managers send out basic emails without getting approval  seriously  last week  i sent an email out  that the wife had literally written and emailed to me for me to send out  apparently that wasn't approval enough  i was somehow supposed to know it wasn't ready to send  it contained a link to the website of a nearby bnb  they were angry i sent the email  that they wrote and sent me  without getting approval  and said that because of that email  that i had redirected the bnb facebook page to our facebook page  there was literally nothing about facebook in the email  no link whatsoever to any facebook  i said it wasn't possible  but they maintain that i did this by sending the email   i got scolded for not checking to see if he used the correct gate code  didn't know that was a thing   we switched software  to one i've used extensively  and he knows that  and he's never used it  and he is insisting that i'm doing it wrong  and it won't look good  i know exactly what i'm doing  and he's not even seen what it will look like  that's all after the fact that i told him for the first 3 months i was here that our software was compromised and not secure  and he would get sooooo angry at me about it  i was right  100s of people had their cc info stolen    fedex picks up on friday  an order came in on sunday  i told the customer it would go out the next week  the wife asked me on sunday if i needed anything from town over our weekend  monday and tuesday  and i told her that i had a package  she said she didn't want to go to fedex  i said ok  friday comes  so does fedex  and i get scolded by the husband because we didn't get the package out earlier  i told him what his wife said  but it was still my fault   i just am wasting my life here  i think all day about what i'd rather be doing  all the projects i could do  classes i could take  but instead i stand here  pretending to be busy  it's winter and covid  we are slow af  my 30s are just disappearing ,ljr6ak
734,Newcomer with a few questions.,i recently found this sub and i'm confused about the general consensus on labor here  i've seen many comments and posts that have phrases like  abolish all labor  and such  does this mean abolish labor as we know it by getting rid of exploitative and unfair labor practices and reforming the way we work  or is  official  position on labor in this sub that labor is inherently exploitative and needs to be abolished in all forms permanently  if it's the latter  i don't see how human society can survive like that  people need different services and products to survive and labor provides that ,lk3h70

742,do you feel like your job actually matters? does it provide something for society?,i've worked a lot of bullshit jobs  admin for private companies that do nothing but steal from people  canvassing for companies to sell their useless products  interviews for deciding if people deserved to have housing  cashier in stores that sell a single candle for  75 etc    now im working in a library which i do think is an important job  we're a community space free for anyone to come in with no purchase necessary or expectation of them to do anything and so we do get lots of people spending all day here just for the shelter and warmthz we are often the only people available for certain members of the community to come in and talk to just for the chance to not be alone and to be listened to  we are a place that offers free help and support and allows people to read and learn and use the internet to access more services also  before covid we also did lots of fun author events and kids groups and random classes for people which again provided a way for people to get out and socialise and also give them the chance to learn something new or have fun with no purchase needed  i met a wonderful group of russian grandmothers through this who would bring in some baked goods each time the group met    through the library i also work with a local homeless org that provides emergency housing and mental health support for homeless people in and around my area too  i've been homeless myself before so feel very empathetic towards the people i meet this way  and whilst i dont think your work has to be the meaning of your life i do find it fulfilling to be able to help people in this way  much as i also wish it wasnt necessary and we were provided for already just because we are alive and deserve to live our lives comfortably without worry    do you think your jobs do anything worthwhile for society  do they provide anything  if society collapsed is your job one of the ones we'd be rushing to reinstate ,ljzuem

768,The interview I had the other day really re-established my loathing for corporate America,last month i was fired from my assistant manager position at the local united post savages retail store when i came back from quarantining testing after a covid-19 exposure  negative test result  thank god  under the pretense of  not being a good fit  despite my work history in the position with stellar feedback from customers and praise from two out of three co-workers  in reality  the store manager didn't like me  didn't like the fact that i learned my job quickly and did it well  and hated the fact that the two associates liked me better than her  however  that's a story for another day   naturally  i was back on an exhaustive job search because  you know  i need to live and whatever  fortunately  my former employer didn't fight my unemployment claim so now i'm making more money not working than i did putting in 40 hours plus overtime in retail hell  thanks covid bonus money   i'd applied for an administrative position and  being a guy  this has always been a difficult task since apparently in my state  it's weird for men to work in an office unless they're somewhere at the top of the food chain  but since no employers were hiring ceos without 85 years of experience and three college degrees  i had to start somewhere   i ended up getting a call regarding the position and we scheduled a zoom interview  i left my pajama pants on  put on a good dress shirt  and positioned myself awkwardly in front of the camera waiting for the interviewer to begin the meeting   just by looking at this disheveled carcass of a once-human  i already knew this interview was going to be filled to the brim with buzzwords  gross expectations  and the importance of it being a  family company  i'll jump to the sweet part of the interview   interviewer  so  walk me through your work history   me   explains what's listed in broad daylight on my resume   i  why did you leave your last position   m  it was a mutual agreement that my departure would allow me to pursue a position more aligned with my goals and desire for growth   i  okay  we'll circle back to that later   interviewer then proceeds to tell me her experience with the company and how she's dedicated the last 30 years of her life to this place  etc  in short  i'm looking for someone dedicated that wants to grow with the company   m  understandable   i  i'm not getting the impression that that person is you  however  your work history shows that the last time you worked in the same position for more than a year was back in 2017 and most of which were entry level positions  it doesn't seem like you've really moved the needle in your career journey   m   visibly taken aback and mildly annoyed  well  when one has had a rough work history of holding positions in toxic environments  under concrete ceilings  unrecognized achievements  supervisor plagiarism  and other growth-stifling situations  one doesn't exactly stick around  with that being said  having no college experience due to personal reasons and despite having a collective 5 years in administration  i haven't been able to secure any positions in a higher tier than entry level   i  what reasons do you have for not going to college   m  may i ask why you're keen to know   i  well  it just seems peculiar that someone of your age has no college degree and only has experience in entry level positions   m  with all due respect  is this an interview or target practice  quite frankly for the past few moments  all i've received from you are insults and i find your demeanor to be highly unprofessional and inappropriate   i  i beg your pardon   m  you asked me to walk you through my work history  all of which i've said is visible on my resume  and you subsequently stated that you don't believe i'm the dedicated candidate you're looking for and criticized my work history and lack of college experience  which raises the question of why you'd even schedule this interview with me in the first place   i  well  i wanted to give you the consideration of explaining yourself and convince me that you are  in fact  an ideal candidate   m  you mean beg  that's not going to happen  and the  consideration of explaining myself  i don't have to explain myself to you nor do i need any consideration from someone who would raise their nose at another individual without the same occupational background  i'll be withdrawing my application from this position  please do not contact me further   i then ended the zoom call  maybe i overreacted  but i felt very insulted and my work history was nowhere near as bad as she made it sound  the buzzwords  circle back  and  move the needle  made my eyes twitch  and the audacity of her judgement was just disgusting to me  i ve never been so offended in an interview before ,ljpuge

770,a comment made by my assistant manager on Friday,so i'm working for a swedish hardware retailer and during the first 4 hours my assistant manager was the cashier  during the day she made a comment to the store manager stating that she loved sitting there as she could hear her pay coming in   after hearing that i thought to myself    gt do you know how much you're getting ripped off  1 day would be enough to pay you for a whole month and 2 days is enough to pay everyone here for 1 month  knowing how capitalism works really makes me irrationally angry at the managers for not seeing the forest for the trees when they complain about a lack of work-life balance or complain about pressure from above,ljqfs9
771,I worked at Petsmart in the beginning of the pandemic,workers didn't get raises or bonuses  but managers did and those bonuses got cut  they fired half the staff  didn't change our hours  and opened online ordering while not even placing any safety procedures  we were the only store in town  including walmart for fucks sakes  that still had our regular hours   people flooded to our store  profits were doubled  almost trippled tbh  while they had usually just 1 cashier and 1 manager working  and that cashier had to clean and still talk to every single customer that came in   if you don't know anything about petsmart  they have a policy of giving a   disneyland experience  meaning  we had to talk and be cheerful to every  single  customer  probably suck their cocks if they asked for it    anyways  so we're still open till 9pm and don't have any precautions  no masks required  no hand sanitizer  no 6 foot rule  we have hundreds of online orders needing filled weekly  along with our store being well over the 10 person limit constantly  there's talk of cutting our wages  barely above minimum  down to minimum  we didn't get covid pay  the government gave petsmart the money to do covid pay  but it never went out    not only did they not care about the safety of their staff and treated us like absolute dog shit  they treated the animals horribly  animals were still shipped to us before knowing if they could spread the virus  and we had to handle customers above all else so these poor animals wouldn't get the care they needed cause we were just run ragged    don't give your money to petsmart  they're a horrible greedy company that doesn't care about their employees or the animals ,ljjsdr

774,"Erosion of Worker Compensation, Unlimited PTO, and Demoralizing Situation",so my company recently switched me to salaried  exempt from overtime pay  froze my accrued pto  and instead gave me  unlimited pto  i will still get paid my accrued pto upon termination or when i leave the company  but the payout dollar value is frozen  my accrued pto hours will be reduced by the same   as any future raises  so they can still say that they're paying you out at your  final rate  but the final pto payout amount will still be the same as at the end of 2020  regardless of how much longer i stay at the company   its obvious no matter how hr try to spin unlimited pto  that its a scam  and companies are just trying to minimize the amount of pto employees take every year  and reduce the amount of money they have to pay when employees leave  i searched for unlimited pto posts on reddit  and it seems widespread across industries and being increasingly implemented at more and more companies  i know my company's policy is at least better than those people that completely lost their accrued pto after their companies switched to unlimited pto  but it still seems dirty   looking through my employee handbook  apparently this pto payout policy doesn't apply to california  colorado     illinois  louisiana  montana  and nebraska which require employers to pay the remainder of unused accrued pto at the employee's final pay rate  my state of new york  and  many other states https www paycor com resource-center pto-payout-laws-by-state text does 20your 20state 20require 20employers 20to 20payout 20pto 3f employee 20contrac 20 20 2010 20more 20rows 20  just defers pto payout requirements to employer policies  so we're just at the mercy of our employers   i reached out to my state assemblyman to see if ny labor laws could be amended to be similar to those other states  and they told me that the ny assembly labor committee responded back saying the  committee staff have concerns that this type of legislation may discourage employers from voluntarily instituting a paid time off program   this is just demoralizing  we're powerless as our employers continuing eroding worker compensation and conveniently using the pandemic to justify these  policy changes  despite record profits and our government is too scared  or corrupt  to act and look out for the regular people which they're supposed to do  i think in the upcoming future  once a majority of employers have implemented unlimited pto  earned pto will just be another worker benefit lost to history just like pensions  severance  right to disconnect  and probably the 40-hour work week   thanks for reading my rant  and what policy changes erosion have you seen at your employer ,ljzuq9

777,"What options are there for making money, but with the least amount of time and effort involved?",i've spent my adult life  and even most of my adolescent years  thinking about and working towards the career i'm currently in  and i'm now in a place that i should be very happy about  the problem is  i'm neither content or fulfilled  i've come to realise that the industry i work in is very exploitative  relatively poorly paid  and i think much of the work is very monotonous and there is little room for creativity    most people would probably think i'm emotionally unwell to be questioning whether i should continue in a career i have spent my life focused on     but what i've come to realise is that i don't particularly enjoy working  before finding the job i'm currently in  i was out of work for a couple of months  and i found that i was comparatively happy in this situation  i had a better feeling of self-worth  i was much less anxious  less miserable  and i spent the wealth of my time reading and writing  for some people a job gives them confidence and strength  but for me it seems to be the opposite  i feel stronger when i am completely in control of my life  and when i feel that i'm using the precious time i've been given to improving my understanding of the world or being creative  i'm not someone who slips into inertia  i'm never bored because i always enjoy learning  and books are cheap and the most extraordinary resource is at my fingertips  it seems quite sad to me that some people are completely lost if they don't have a job  surely you can find satisfaction in life without being forced to turn your waking hours into profits   when i speak to people about my concerns  the usual response is along the lines of  ah  well  what you need is just another career  or that old hackneyed quote   find a job that you love and you'll never work a day in your life  it's a bit like being a heroin junky and people suggesting other drugs you could choose to become addicted with instead    the other stock response i hear is  well  you have to work hard if want to make money  or  there's no easy way to become rich  as if the only possible aim i could have in future is to become wealthy  i've realised i'm not that bothered about having money  so long as i have enough to pay the rent on a little flat  keep me stocked up on food and books  and very occasionally go travelling on a shoestring budget  i don't want a car  nor am i interested in gadgets or expensive clothes  i'm happy to live a frugal existence if it means i'm able to spend more time doing the things i enjoy   is this possible  what options are there for making money  but with the least amount of time and effort involved ,lkplyj

He begged me, ""Please don't attempt a coup.""", since when is two individuals clocking out on time according to their employment contract a 'coup'   tl dr  this coworker begged me to stay late and tried to guilt-trip me into doing so because he'd 'get in trouble' for not stopping me and 'i always stay late  so you should  too ' i shut down the bullshit and left anyway    i was in a lot of pain yesterday  so i told my manager before the shift even started that i volunteered to be sent home if the opportunity presented itself  she said she'd check on my department at some point to see if she could send me home  spoiler  she never did  and i gave the other guy who works in my area a heads up that if i was given the option to go home early  i was going to take it because i wasn't feeling well    he seemed disappointed by the prospect of me potentially getting sent home  but said   well  if you get to go home  i hope you enjoy it  which is a rather kind and empathetic thing for him to say  so i responded with a   thank you  but then he finished his sentence   because i never ever get to leave early    oh  cool  so it was going to be one of those 'suffering olympics' kinds of shifts  nice  i don't like playing that game  so i just put my earplugs in and didn't talk to him for a few hours    anyway  because my pain never subsided and it was my friday  i made the decision to do the self-compassionate thing and clock out at the designated end time for the shift instead of staying the extra 25 minutes the company has come to expect from me  my mistake was making the friendly suggestion to my coworker to maybe do the same  because we were both having a bad day and screw being taken advantage of by this job   he got irrationally frustrated at me and made the 'please don't attempt a coup ' comment above  it was everything i could do not to facepalm as he started blathering about how he would be the one to get in trouble for me 'walking out' and pulling another suffering olympics card like   i work twice as many hours as you do and i always stay until they tell me i can leave   because i was in pain and consequently a bit pissy  i told him   if management decides to lay into you because i'm deciding to clock out on time for once  then you need to call them out on it on it and tell them to talk to me if they have a problem with it  i already talked to my manager about wanting to go home  and now that i can go home  i'm going to    he looked really dejected after that and said   well  i'm not going to stop you if you want to leave     i do want to leave  have a good night  and i left   jobs suck ,lirt04

807,Does anyone else get really annoyed when people talk proudly about their boring office jobs,i mean the typical types of convo where someone is boasting about how proud they are of their work or when someone is talking in detail about work projects  i feel like most of my friends from school talk non stop about their jobs  coworkers and projects with nothing but happiness and blissful ignorance  i never discuss work it feels like a chore to talk about it on top of having to do it  i talk mainly about my interests and relationships  but never work    all i hear when someone talks about their work or projects with joy is that they are happy making some corporation money  there is no personal advancement in this  yet they have been tricked into thinking there is  the main goal as an individual logically should be to make enough money to be able to stop working yes  not to keep making a corporation millions  if not billions  through their output to  maybe  see a low six figure salary for all that effort  stress and effects on their health  i had an economics teacher who put it perfectly- to work is to literally trade your time for money  if you make 40 an hour you are comfortable trading an hour of your life for 40 dollars  if you make 150k a year you are selling away a year of your life for 150k    seriously  all the old school friends i have who are like this look so much older than their age  working so hard for essentially no return has aged them  meanwhile  there is me who doesn t  care at all about my job who passes for much younger than my age consistently  born in the 90s and yet consistently assumed to be from 00s  they also have developed serious  as well as minor  health conditions brought on by long hours and stress   i m stuck in a job i hate as well at the moment but i m taking steps to get out of this type of life  i save everything  i keep a very low cost of living and make extra income so hopefully i can soon switch to part time work or retire in my 30s-40s  i can t deal with this type of environment  life much longer  i m just so sick of hearing people proud of wasting their lives away  and for what  to be able to take out a bunch of debt for a house they can t afford  to be able to drive an expensive car and have a high payment for years until they own it  to be able to afford kids  gross  i m all good  just had to vent  anyone else ,liinfp
808,Jobs for people with no problem-solving skills,i have a bachelors in computer science and a masters in business analytics  i landed my first full-time job as an analyst in november and i absolutely hate it  whenever i run into a problem  which could be super simple  it just stresses me out  i will drag myself all day but i don't have to motivation to actually think about the problem and solve it   this might sound silly because most people look for challenging careers but are there any high-paying jobs that are pretty much no-brainers for someone with my qualification  it can be super boring too  i'd prefer that over something that stresses me out ,lhomd4

813,Doing something you love,i had a discussion with my parents recently about my current position i'm in and how much they hate that i'm doing it    for reference  i'm a research technician with a university  i have my bachelors and am currently doing a masters while working the job is not permenant  as are many academic jobs  and it is grueling work  but i have a very flexible work schedule and i'm loving the big picture of being part of moving knowledge forward and doing applied research   the discussion with parents started with them asking when me and my wife were going to move into a house together  i explained to them that i am currently doing a masters while working and hope to pursue a phd after and even after that there may be post-doc positions  so it could be a relatively long time before we settle into something permanent like a house  ive discussed these plans with my wife and we are happy with where our future is headed  they scowled and said something along the lines of  you are too smart to go down the career path you've chosen  you could get a job anywhere in industry and make so much more money  i told them i'd rather do something i love doing and live rental to rental than hate my life for 40 hours per week just to live for the other little bit of time in each day   they think i have some sort of mental illness for thinking like that  but it is the absolute truth  i'd rather stay where i am now heping to make impactful discoveries than move to industry where my labor makes more money for some company   maybe this doesn't necessarily fit into the theme of r antiwork  but it is just an experience that i thought would spark some good discussion in this subreddit ,li35rs

826,Convince me,so  i have a job  i m sympathetic to some of the ideas i ve seen while lurking here  but a lot of them seem to be from people who have meaningless bullshit office jobs and i feel like i remain unconvinced  no offense to office workers in general  i m sure lots of it isn t bullshit     i agree low wages are bullshit  i m not paid enough for what i do when i directly know people who will brag about how they do fuck all every day on their computer at home and their salary has an extra figure on mine  good for them  but a system that values them more than me is bullshit  so okay  sure     governments shouldn t be facilitating things for billionaires and millionaires  definitely when lots of normal people are straight up living crisis to crisis  absolutely       but blue collar work feels sort of different  like yeah  my boss makes more money than me  but i guess i can at least be comfortable with that since he had to bet everything he had on his business succeeding  and at least the difference isn t in orders of magnitudes like it would be at a huge corporation  i don t want to take that kind of risk  so i get a smaller reward  that doesn t bother me        i work in an industry with often troubling health and safety issues  and protection of labourer rights is virtually nonexistent  i knew that before i signed up for trade school  and frankly it doesn t bother me that much  i have a threshold of acceptable risk i won t cross and my boss respects that  at least healthcare here is free  you americans are absolutely living in a hellscape on that front       40 hours a week doesn t bother me since i used to work almost 80 at a shitty company  so that s fine by me  i like almost all the people i work with and i m about as okay with having a day i work as a day i don t work  i made sure to live close enough to work that commuting isn t too bad  i think my free time is fine  though idk how the fuck i would have kids like this  so there is that  i m not sure i really want kids though     automation won t be coming for my job for a long  long time  way too many one-offs  random chaos  totally unpredictable things  people wouldn t trust a robot  not worried on that front        i guess the only thing that pisses me off is i probably won t be able to afford a house in my city in my lifetime  haha  but i m not so sure that s an issue with work so much as capitalism  our real estate market has fuck all protections so foreigners just jack up prices to infinity        anyways  i don t think i m a unicorn in that i ve found a decent hands on job  i don t think jobs like these are particularly rare and i think they genuinely contribute value to society in a way you can feel good about  hell you can even have loads of fun doing it if you re the right kind of person  it s not for everyone and i m actually very much pro-ubi because no one should work a job they hate and still struggle  but not all work is bullshit  in fact a lot of it isn t  it s underpaid though  i don t think work is the problem  i think the way we assign value to work is completely fucked  tell me how i m wrong ,lig1cr

832,Crazy crazy,so i commented a story about my old work last night and a few people thought it was crazy  it wasn't the craziest story from there  amp  i said i'd post  the  crazy story    tl dr version  poison and intrigue   i took a job working as tech support at a large telco in australia  i won't say which but most australians will probably work it out  if you work it out  amp  don't believe the story you can google the name of the company  amp  the main aspect of the story  amp  you will find a new article confirming it   so anyway  went through the training  made a few friends through the training  one guy in particular i got along with pretty well as he had a dark sense of humour like me  i also made made my first enemy i guess  a drone with pink hair that decided her path to power was to take it upon herself to police the milk honor system for tea  amp  coffee  20c for those that used milk  hardly anyone at the company would pay  amp  i don't drink milk  but that never stopped her from confronting us over it  amp  chairing stupid meetings about it at least once a week  which was especially frustrating as it wasn't her job and as a low level employee  she had no kind of authority   at the end of the training someone high up from corporate came along for what would be the first of many corporate wank sessions  she asked us how many of us had our internet with them  no one raised their hand  she laughed  amp  said  well our standout feature isn't our price nor our speed  it's our support  so it makes sense that tech support wouldn't need that  my buddy raised his hand and said  well actually  it's because paying to have internet with you is like paying to go down on a hooker   buddy was fired on the spot  it's a perfect line that still haunts me on the nights i can't sleep   anyway the next morning we were all called into the meeting room again  we all got in there and one of the managers asks the question  who hear drinks tea or coffee  everyone in the room groaned  expecting it to be one of the usual honor system witch hunts  she actually looked pretty nervous and said  come on guys we need to know  pretty much everyone raised their hands  the next question was   keep your hands up if you drink milk  there was a groan again  but the manager persisted   so  ugh  how are you all feeling  ugh  no one's um coughing up blood or anything   this led to puzzlement so she spilled the beans   we found rat poison in the milk   anyway the whole thing went mental from there  the homicide squad were called up from the state capital  turns out that particular rat poison a fully grown person would have to eat about 1kg worth to kill someone  but had a pretty good chance of causing bleeding from the gums and a few other areas  we all got interviewed personally by the homicide squad  i was talked to a lot about my buddy  as he had been fired the day before  so he was suspect number one    i did not believe that it was him  as he wasn't that kind of person  that i could see him possibly punching someone in the heat of the moment after being fired  but not forming a plan  coming back  amp  poisoning his coworkers  amp  told the detectives that  they asked who i'd suspect  i said pink hair  amp  explained the history  anyway nothing ever came of it  they eliminated my friend through security cameras  timing etc said it couldn't possibly be him  this was after months of borderline harassments mind you  they did narrow it down to the worksite though  it was a poisoning attempt from someone that worked at the building   the corporate environment is the unhealthiest kind of workplace i've ever worked in and i believe this story is a perfect example of that environment ,li144p

879,What can they do if we all stop working?,okay to start i understand that a mass strike isn t feasible for everyone  folks have kids to feed  family to take care off  etc  but what about the rest of us  those who can afford it  ultimately the power rests on us  as things stand now  the system will never be fit us  it s too old  archaic  based in tradition  the constitution was never written to instill a free democracy but rather to shift the power from the monarchs to a  democratically  elected government  but time and time the republic has shown that it won t  can t  support the voice of the people  the only thing keeping the rich rich us our money  our labor  if we take that from them  what do they have  stacks of rotting paper  this past year has shown just how incompetent the government is  how distanced it is  how corporations and those in power will blatantly spread a dangerous narrative to maintain their hold on the general population  how whenever we have a hope of a minor victory they ll quickly change the rule book in their favor  why the hell do we keep letting them  2   2 will always equal fucking 4 ,livpvo

881,my goals towards antiwork,hi everyone  so for years i've hated the idea of working 9 to 5 for the rest of my life until retirement where all my youth is gone  plus no guarantees  i may never make it to that age because you never know   i also make only like 35 k a year  so now i've been investing  started with 15k  now have 62k as it has grown  will be adding a few thousand to that and moving it all into accounts that grow on average 10 percent a year rather than the 7 percent a year average interest my current investments provide   my goal is to hit 100 k  and buy a couple tiny houses  look up tiny houses  and buy each for about 25k to 30k  that way i have two homes in different parts of the country as my home bases  they'll be paid off meaning i won't have to worry about rent or a mortgage and they'll fit my minimalist lifestyle  then from there my shit paying job will enable me much more freedom even though it pays shit because my earnings mostly can be saved  then each year i'll be able to put a good 23k plus away  since i also do a few thousand in under the table work each year  at that point by my mid thirties i should have another 80k or so  which i can use to travel on the cheap  living in places like thailand  doing workaways or woofing  and just enjoying a mild life where a lot of my time is spend relaxing and doing music    anyway it may bit be glamorous but it'll make me happy  at all times i will funnel more money into my mutual funds account investments so i'm making an average of a few thousand dollars a year in passive income too  i'm so excited,lj86sh
882,Curious about the anti-work philosophy,completely stumbled in here through the suggested subs in the app   never even heard of anti work before  but reading the comments  i definitely don t get it    i understand the aversion to what seem like unfair work conditions for some  but it seems like from a philosophical perspective there is a belief that somehow we shouldn t have to work at all   if that s the case  how do things get made  delivered  etc   my job is in the marine industry  where yes  there are mariners doing the hard work onboard the ship  dock workers doing the hard work of transferring cargo  sales and logistics workers trying to keep the ships busy and efficient  and all kinds of office staff  it  and hr to support the industrial operations   at face value  some of the jobs probably do suck  or some of the jobs report to a person that s an a-hole   some of the jobs though  the people love it   but from the perspective of whether the people should have to work  i guess i don t understand how the cargo we want as consumers gets to us   how does the cargo that other countries want from us get to them   without work what happens     is anti work due more to a disdain for unfulfilling jobs  or a belief that there is another way to do things ,liavdy

911,A question for the antiwork community,tl dr as an outsider to this community  i'm just interesting in what you all think about some questions i have    so   while i wouldn't identify myself as a part of this community  i understand where you guys are coming from  i am lucky enough to enjoy the work i do  but i get how many people are fed up with capitalism and believe that life should be less about work   but what i ask is  what is your solution  nothing will happen unless the laws are changed  do you argue for a universal basic income like andrew yang  democratic socialism like bernie sanders  do some of you identify as socialists or communists  i guess i just want to know what you guys think the solution to this is  i know many people would combat many of these ideas and say that socialism will never actually work  i think it's interesting  although i don't like to take sides in this debate    another question  are any of you former supporters of donald trump  whether you like it or not  he has appealed to the populist movement in the us  although maybe you're not from the us  i could see someone being angry with the system  angry with being given an unlivable wage  and turning to donald trump for answers  just a question  though    last question  do any of you enjoy work  i find it sad to see this community because i personally believe that fulfillment comes from having a meaningful life  and that often comes from one's life work  i am not saying that i think you all are sad  i am saying i think the conditions that have lead people to become anti work are sad  i just want to say that work can be fun  it can be the best part of your life  so i want to know if any of you enjoy work  or maybe you don't enjoy what you call work  but you enjoy the art you make on the side   for anyone that's interested  my ideas about having a meaningful life come from a book called man's search for meaning by victor frankl  the author was a psychologist who survived multiple concentration camps in the holocaust  finding a will to live even in the bleakest of situations  he talks about the meaning of life  the book changed my life  and i don't doubt that it could change yours   you can look up a free pdf of it ,lirw3r

941,How do you guys do it?,context   i usually work 9-5 30 in chemistry but because i'm multi-skilled  have lots of previous experience and have worked at this particular company for 2 years now  i got roped into doing a night shift packing boxes in our warehouse and shipping orders from 11 00pm-7 00am for the next 2 or so weeks in order to clear huge amounts of backed up orders due to postal courier going nuts over brexit  this was with a day's notice and has fucked up my body clock attempting to adjust my sleep pattern to fit  this was thursday last week and i've been doing these shifts through until early this week  after finishing at 7 and driving home at 8 30 tuesday morning i get a message telling me that we had in fact finished whatever task we were needed for and to resume normal hours the following day  so naturally pissed off i went back to bed and slept  the entire day   all the way through from around 9 30 tuesday morning till about 10 00 this morning  and obviously i overslept and was late for my shift  i woke up to no less than 6 missed calls asking me where i was etc and i panicked so i tried to collect myself and get my story straight but my head was pounding and i felt awful so i called in  explained myself and was honest about the situation and how my body clock wasn't used to such rapid changes in shift patterns and it has caught up with me   i proceeded to get chewed out on the phone and lost a day's worth of holiday to cover my absence and honestly i'm pissed off   i could have lied  i could have made something up or made an excuse but i was honest  and the way my manager spoke to me made me feel so worthless  i called up my parents and just asked for advice on what to do and essentially they reminded me that  oh in today's working landscape you are more replaceable than ever because c19  amp  layoffs etc  and it just further frustrated me   it's now around 11 00 and as i'm typing this i'm just wondering what is the fucking point man  like why is it so deplorable for me to be honest and admit my mistakes but when the company screws me around and asks so much of me that i have to keep bending myself to fit their mould or else i risk losing my job  house etc   like wtf man  how do you guys put up with this     i'm going back to bed ,lgrkln

955,The problem isnt the wage you get per hour. Its that your wage is per hour and not per work.,this is the real problem  most of us are assigned jobs that we go to to work x hours for x wages    for example  a lumber mill worker goes into work and works his shift for 8 hours  if in that time he creates 100 boards ready for sale  the day is done and he goes home    now if he is a boardmaking genius or works super hard and makes 200 boards  he receives no extra money    if he likewise makes 100 boards in 4 hours  he will be told to continue making boards for another 4 hours    it is established that 100 boards per 8 hours is acceptable  yet neither if the other two outcomes is deemed a success    the call center employee making 10 dollars an hour is expected to clear 10 calls an hour  making the value of the call 1 00 a piece  yet clearing calls faster or better yields no bonus or benefit for working better  80 calls is the expected workday  yet the employee clearing 80 calls doesnt get to wrap it up and say  okay i did my part and my job   this is why work is so oppressive  because we are designed to never be done with our work and can never be satisfied with the work we have done    the worst statement in the modern world   if you've got time to lean  you've got time to clean   cleaning isnt my job  general labor isnt my job  being a miscellaneous task robot isnt job  making widgets is  i have made my widgets and you have made your profit  and why cant that just be that ,lgynwy
956,You know the system is broken when...,so i've been struggling with my job for about a year now  recently i started a mandatory  temporary  six-month assignment to a different project  new employees are required to do two of these  and holy shit it's gotten worse  i cannot handle a 40 hour week like this anymore  especially when it requires a 40 minute commute to the office again like it does right now   today i remembered there are sanctions in place for converting to part time  it would be the perfect compromise for me  honestly  i'd probably be more productive even   but when i actually read the rules for it it was so depressing     you have to pay more for your health insurance  because you're working less hours     you earn less time off    your  experience  accrues half as fast  so one year of work counts to the organization as six months experience     they explicitly state  working part time is a privilege that can be taken away at management's discretion   so i looked into the organization's work life balance resources  and found two powerpoints about work life balance  and dealing with burnout   some choice concepts from those   work life     you have five buckets to put your life tasks into  don't overfill one bucket at the expense of others      be sure to exercise  get enough sleep  eat healthy  save all your money for the future  and teach your kids to do this too   but don't forget you have to be here 40  hours a week     the us is one of the lowest happiness ranked countries in the world  and only has 12 weeks maternity leave in some companies  but  your  time management is the problem   burnout     relax  take breaks  do things differently   like wear a silly tie to the office     when in doubt  work as hard as possible so you have something to achieve and get you through it   literally  one of their suggested distractions was  work as hard as possible     plan for the future  open a 401k  make a bucket list  write your retirement speech  or your eulogy   ---  why the fuck is it an either or situation here  i want to have a job that pays enough to live  but i also have mental health issues  and capitalism issues  that make it very unhealthy for me to be forcing myself to work full time  part time would be perfect  but i already barely can afford to live cutting my salary  my leave  and my mandatoryretirement contributions significantly are the opposite of what i need  not to mention the whole  working less is a privilege only for the best employees who have proved they earn it    tl dr  my company treats part time work like an alien golden goose hybrid  while simultaneously encouraging impossible standards and somehow working  through  burnout,lh9in1

1016,The obsessiveness with productivity and performance,i feel i am at a new breaking point due to facing another and new highly stressful work environment i am in  i always try to comply with my co-workers' expectations of how they want me to be as i am afraid of getting into verbal dispute confrontations with colleagues who just don't accept no for an answer and keep on accusing and blaming me for having a different opinion than theirs and threatening me that i'll lose my job if i continue to let them down for being assertive   i expect a lot of myself and often feel apathetic and harbor subconscious regrets about waiting long to act in an environment that is very competitive and therefore wish i could confidently present myself instead in such surroundings  blend in easily  and be quick to respond and answer without hesitation and waiting for turns and just stand up for what i believe in as if it's no big deal but the stress of negative looks and responses just gets to me that i can hardly breathe normally   the truth is i can no longer bear being mocked  humiliated  and rivaled with by other workers and being told that i am slow  stuck-up  even weak  too soft  too modest  lacking vigor  and impaired in level of professional skills or even timid for processing stimuli deeply and introvertedly and so i am judged as half-hearted and absentminded and unfit to take center of things fearlessly   i feel hurt and upset by the constant commandings and argumentativeness in the workplace and so i have become adjusted to just tolerate it as if 'numb' from seeing how aggressive co-workers successfully dominate colleagues with a more sensitive nature and i therefore feel no inspiration and added value to go to work anymore as i want to do only good unto others and not feel guilty and ashamed anymore for not being able to always do this hence i feel burned out with all this anger boiling inside of me in response to constant unnecessary conflicts at work just because everyone wants to exceed everyone else   i cannot deny how emotionally trapped and remote i feel within as if i am hiding or walking away from work incidents and positions with the highest resistance and the biggest responsibilities despite knowing that only making efforts to contribute is what matters and not how big or small it is or wanting to be in control  i wish i could take the front lead without spurting or stammering and handle negative and unfair criticism  hostility and rudeness steadily without going red of embarrassment   i feel despicable because i am an open and easy-going person and talk frankly about my shortcomings and honest views and colleagues just seem to take it as a means to manipulate me on it so i get to serve them in whatever they order me to  i just don't want to be condescended on when i set my boundaries  while it is self-absorbed to want to escape the every day hassle of social struggles  it doesn't mean i am lazy or irresponsible but to face new episodes of mental anguish for being misjudged and not be approved as an equal member of the so maniest company in my career is frightful and humiliating   i feel hesitant and afraid of how to say no sometimes at this stage  knowing exactly how my co-workers will argue bluntly why not and act as if not convinced  finding me rather odd  until i give up and just tell them that they are right  i feel aggravated with myself for opting out last minute at times now instead of to continue giving my full potential  i just don't want co-workers to push me to do more until i snap and that i might not be able to handle it as they want me to and so i keep dimmed at the background  i am tired of the insolences of getting criticized as unsure  not showing myself enough  not daring enough to take on new initiatives and for saying too little   all the bullying has led me to become so self-conscious when speaking in front of my co-workers that it is nerve breaking and i'd rather take the day off or work alone without any supervision which also doesn't help in the long run because the lack of connectivity with other colleagues leads me to become aggravated  i try to be amongst the firsts to try something new or offer help but may just stand frozen busy with analyzing everything while i am expected to act on the spot   it pains me how not just i but also other people in the workplace face so much strain on their shoulders to always overperform and not being appreciated as valid and worthy real individuals but rather be treated as objects that are replaceable anytime  it is traumatizing how stepping up to the wicked ways of any company's policies only worsens the situation because of the hierarchical order of the senior positioned having all the might to have the last word even if it is so nonsensical what it concludes  i don't know and understand where such highly egotistical attitudes are leading the nations of the world to but it is worrisome ,lfpfci

1071,The restaurant where I work is literally stealing my tips,there s kind a lot to explain here but i m really pissed  so i work at a pizza place and a few months ago they put in these security cameras  they have a computer in the managers office where they can literally sit there and watch our every move  super creepy  they said the put them in so people don t steal from the register  which is a problem we ve had before    so i just work the drive thru window and i get tons of tips  like  20 during a 4 hour shift  which is a lot considering they only pay me  8 and hour  so around the same time they put in the cameras they decided they would split the tips between everyone who worked that night  i was kinda mad about that since i m the one getting all the tips by being all jive and polite  but whatever   so lately i management hasn t been giving me my tips at all  i asked my boss why and he said he thinks someone s been stealing from the registers because there s been money missing  and he s been using the tips to cover the losses  i asked him why he doesn t just check the security cameras to see who is stealing and he said he doesn t have time to go through all that footage    then why tf did tou buy the cameras jn the first place    and the kicker is that they aren t even supposed to have me working the window  only managers are supposed to do that  know why  because if they let everyone do it someone is probably gonna steal  so they re gonna make that series of dumbass decisions and then use my tips to cover it  unbelievable,lf0lgh

1108,There is nothing wrong with not caring about being an ‚Äúintellectual.‚Äù,humanity has always received value from all areas  art  science  literature  sports  entertainment and especially straight manual labor  there are clearly many valuable traits in humans beyond their iq or studiousness  roles that were once accepted as a noble part of society are now condescendingly referred to as  dead end jobs  by out-of-touch middle class assholes  stripping away any dignity that working class people may feel for their work  so they re already underappreciated by their employers and now they work hard serving people all day only to have their customers think less of them too  there is no reason that you can t appreciate your maid as much as your doctor    did people ridicule all the  non-intellectuals  before modern society and stem got a chokehold on human perception  nope  because then they would ve had to ridicule the majority of society  nowadays  there seems to be this narrative that once you re deemed one of the  dumb  ones  people can go open season on your character and you don t deserve boundaries  it s even worse with millennials and gen z imo  a race to see who s smartest in every single social interaction  i blame the toxic  hypercompetitive school work environments and the myth of an intellect-based meritocracy being anything but dehumanizing  if we really want to reduce the increasing suffering in this world  eq matters way more than iq or creating the latest gadget  we re getting to a point where science and technology are becoming invasive parts of our lives  i felt this way as soon as things like amazon alexa came out  and no i m not a boomer  i m 21   what s sad is that people just eat it up and think  more technology is good  no matter what  there is no room for nuance  as a society we are willingly giving the keys of the future to a bunch of out-of-touch privileged techies and hackers  and we rationalize it by saying  they are geniuses for inventing this tech  they deserve to be the ones driving us forward indefinitely  never mind that post-2000 tech has arguably created more problems than solutions  social media was a mistake and the greatest cause of increasing mental health issues  if tech was really as flawless as commonly perceived  we d be a lot further along in fighting climate change than where we are  just starting to truly care on a global level  it s time to pump the brakes and see if  stagnation  might actually be a good thing  progress for the sake of progress is a path straight to ai taking everyone s jobs  and with how religiously many worship capitalism and the illusion of meritocracy  it s hard to imagine the majority agreeing to a post-work society  the point of technology is to reduce the amount of work done by humans while improving their livelihoods  and yet here we are  more tech than ever  mini-computers in all of our pockets  still working 40 hour weeks like 100 years ago and wages  relative to purchasing power and productivity  continuing to decrease    not sure how many here have read  the war on stupid people  but it was an eye-opener for me on how the world is becoming more and more elitist by default  there is a certain level of entitlement people in this era seem to have when it comes to disrespecting flat earthers  anti-vaxxers  religious people  antinatalists  autistics  so-called losers underachievers  antiwork-supporters  and anyone else not perfectly in tune with the values of society s out-of-touch  leaders  or  smart people  people are allowed to believe what they want and each person has their reasons  they re also allowed to be content with lifestyles deemed  unsuccessful  by the neoliberal masses as long as they re not harming anyone  the false belief in  meritocracy  is often used to mistreat those perceived to be on the lower end of it  a lot of people have stopped playing the game because they see it s pointless and putting in more labor than necessary serves the corrupt capitalist system more than the individual in the end  better to live frugally and work less than the  strive for more status symbols  culture that fuels consumerism  screw the arbitrary social hierarchy and people who define others by their place on it    as long as they re not trying to tell you how to live your life or effect public policy  you shouldn t ridicule someone for their beliefs  no matter how  anti-intellectual  you perceive them to be  being an intrusive  nitpicky asshole who wants to suck them into debates and try to make them look  stupid  doesn t accomplish anything and just makes people want to avoid you ,lcbagp

1112,The more I consider what laziness is the less insulting it sounds,for context i ve been noticing more and more how lazy and laziness are often used in an  insulting  way  but i ve never felt ashamed of being lazy  and i don t think anyone really should    a lot of people view laziness as a negative of a person s personality  when its just the opposite of the desire to work  we cant work forever at all times without literally dying  so everyone is inevitably lazy at some point  but we cant be lazy forever either for the same reason  at some point we ll have to put in some sort of effort to accomplish some task  like making breakfast or reading a book  whatever makes us feel good  because we want to  this obviously doesn t work in a capitalist society though  and so in choosing to follow our desires in what work we wish to do  it is labeled lazy and unproductive  its a demonization of people who don t make money  and its an immoral way of disrespecting another person s use of energy and time  this is why i just cant see laziness as a negative trait anymore  its like putting someone down for their expression of free will    i know in posting here im going to get a biased response but this is just something thats been on my mind for a while and id love to hear from people who feel similarly  i also know that opinions like this and this sub in general are often viewed as entitled  but if someone sees taking control of their time and energy as entitled then honestly what a miserable life they must live ,lces1k

1124,She Quit After One Day,hey everybody  i'm currently feeling that deep sunday night dread for the coming work week  and before i get high to try not to think about it  i just wanted to vent   i work as a production assistant for a tv series  12 hours a day  minimum  5 days a week   i feel so fucking lost  i wanted a life in the film industry  i didn't want my life to  be  the film industry  but here i am    the thing that's pissing me off most is when i complain about the 60-hour workweek  my family and friends don't seem like they're on the same page as me  they tell me i'd enjoy it if my boss wasn't so shitty  i find it hard to believe anyone could enjoy signing their life and identity away to a minimum wage job  but here i am    i worked my ass off in college to graduate a semester early  ended off my time there at the top of most of my classes  i had two professors giving me gifts  telling me i was their favorite student and that they see me going places in the future    and now  here i am  getting chewed out daily by my boss for not restocking the chips in the breakroom to her liking    and i'm aware my boss is fucking toxic  hell  we hired a new pa last week  and she left after one day  as we were leaving the office she asked if it's always this toxic here  and i gave her an honest answer  the next day i find her name placard in the trash  she never came back  boss never said anything    but the thing that's crazy to me is that when i complain about this job  everyone's just like  you'd like it if you had a better boss   like  what  i can't even wrap my brain around it  how can anyone enjoy having their entire life be meaningless tasks around an office    the other reply i get a lot is  well  you'll work your way up the ladder and it'll get better   everyone works 10 - 15 hour shifts  the only people who don't are the accounting department and the fucking showrunner  we're expected to work through our lunchbreak  so the only time i get a break is when i'm on the fucking toilet    and it just crushes me  i have no time to play videogames with the friends i've spent years getting to know  i've had to cut people out of my life  i don't even make dinner most nights  i just crawl into bed and cry  i'm exhausted at all times  i don't have time to work on personal projects or visit my family  when the weekend hits  i spend most of it asleep or doing the chores i couldn't do during the week   and i'm really young  i'm only 22  and this is my first job out of college  and i'm just sitting here wondering if this is all my life will ever be  are the next 40 years of my life really just going to be me working  sleeping  working  sleeping  working    i don't even have the time or energy to look for other jobs  i mean  with covid going on it's not like the jobs i'd find would be good anyway  i just really don't know what to do or say  i feel alone ,lezpwu
1125,Dear antiwork community: how does a disenfranchised young adult with only a small amount of savings escape the work world?,for context  i need to quit my job  stat  my mental health is deteriorating because of it  i can't do this job  i'm having a breakdown right now  at work  and i want to just walk away    for some context  i work at a lumber mill in rural montana  i commute 2 hours total in a day to get there  and get paid 16  an hour with no benefits yet   i ve worked here for 3 months   i'm so pissed  the company just went bankrupt two years ago  and was bought out by another company to assume all their assets  the place is a massive dump  dirty  disorganized  generally chaotic and grimy  their equipment doesn't work properly because the boss doesn't prioritize proper maintenance  and because machines are falling apart  that means orders are way behind  so  naturally  the boss is stressing us out by putting insane amounts of pressure on his two production employees  me  and another guy  to run 4  massive machines that are constantly breaking down  with unrealistic deadlines  not to mention each machine should have two dedicated employees and a maintenance employee    i'm not happy here and it's deteriorating my mental health significantly    the company is on the verge of going bankrupt  again  and i want to get out    i feel like i might be in an irrational state right now- but it's triggered by the shitty conditions here at work    they treat their employees and customers like shit  the boss literally told me that i'm expected to do overtime and stay late frequently  he's pressuring me into not taking two 10 minute breaks and a full 30 minute break  which i m told is just a  hard work culture  my coworker simply doesn t take breaks if there is too much to do  i'm exhausted mentally and physically at the end of every day    my question to you  is how can i immediately leave and opt out of the work world  i want to make art  grow food  and spend time with the people i care about  but there is this constant gap between saving and paying bills  groceries  and gas  that i can t seem to save enough to make it for a short season  before i can start staying home and making food and starting my own business    what has worked for you  is there anything legally i can pursue for compensation for unsafe conditions and pressure to buy into the company dreams  idk i just feel stuck in this and would love any and all insight ,lbsjq4

1141,I am currently in a debate over the ethics of capitalism as seen here anyone got a good rebuttals because when I try the points are getting confused,be    search  - oh d to quote the owl house  capitalism  where everyone wins  except for you' i 26 reply   side 3 replies  i       late the kate 19 hours ago  well tell that to all the people who can afford a phone  computer  microwave  car etc  these things could only be enjoyed by the rich  but now almost everyone has a couple of these  i 9 reply  j park 6 hours ago   late the kate and yet what are they used for to sustain your vanity long enough to continue being a wage slave as the profits of your work gets stolen by your employer and even after successfully seeing your boss you are never getting your money back  besides you act like those aren't essential items a communication device that needs to be constantly purged to the labors system so they can get you to do stuff outside of work  a computer to do the drone work of management filling out spread sheets and constantly having someone looking over your shoulder  not to mention the fact a programme is expected to create a system in their free time for no pay just so they can get higher     microwave fair enough that just a heating machine primarily used by lower income houses due to a lack of unfordable option due to low wages and no time due to overfilled schedules that may include 2 jobs to sustain their meager existence so they dont have time to make substance food and are forced to live off meal deals how less    he  he highlighted reply  late the kate 1 hour ago  edited    j park first  so you are saying you don't win when you have luxuries  really  are you saying you are the looking party in capitalism  oh sure  you have lost because you can work when and where you want  you have lost in being the most economically prosperous country in the world  you have lost by being able to afford luxuries that most people around the world can only dream of  you have lost by having rights that  once again  many people only dream of  freedom of speech  freedom to work where you want  freedom to own a forearm  good  samaritan laws  these laws prevent you from being sued for trying to save a life  this happens in china and is why a small girl was ran over  and no one tried to save her as she slowly died  freedom to start a business  the list goes on      your profits aren't stolen  first of all  if you want a higher wage  bargain for it or get a different job  to one is forcing you to stay in that particular job  one reason we have competition is so that business can not only compete for customers by making better and cheaper products  but they compete for you  they offer better benefits and higher wages so they can attract you away from their rivals   the machines  has to pay to maintain machines  bought the wood  bought the eager from some foreign country   he the metal etc  or the person who can put graphics into a piece of wood  those people risked millions of dollars to try to make a profit while you risked nothing  you don't risk anything by taking the job  so who deserves more  the person who potentially  risked everything they owned  or the person who risked only his time  and when the factory doesn't do well  do the business owners say  we aren't going to pay you until we start making money  no they don't  they do that to themselves  you are still making money when they are looking it   were's more proof that your profits aren't stolen  imagine for me that you work in a pencil factory  who deserves more money  the people who leased the land  bought the factory  bought  are you really complaining that machines make your jobs easier  are you really saying  well they bless my life  but people use them to make working easier  to you really want to fete  down that road   tea  poor people exist  it isn't because of capitalism  how less    ,lbqovr

1150,Found out my work cancelled the employee rewards program...,  more than a fucking year ago  without fucking telling me    we used to accrue points at a rate of one point per hour worked per year of service without a serious safety incident  lost time injury  and redeem them on random stuff from a website  rewards included stuff like camping gear  golf clubs  electronics  kitchen gear  etc  a lot of the cheaper things were just trash but you could get decent stuff after a while   last time i'd checked  i was sitting around 35 000 points  approaching the bottom end of stuff i'd actually consider   for context  we could also get fire retardant coveralls for about 15 000 points  and the same ones are available for employees to purchase for about  130  so at the time i would've been sitting at a  gift  worth around  300  and probably closer to  400 today if they'd kept accruing   objectively speaking  not really all that significant  but still more meaningful than getting an  atta boy  and a company branded ball cap     and the fuckers took it away as a cost saving measure  and did it sneakily to prevent those of us who'd been saving up from cashing out ,lbyh0m
1151,Capitalism and the automation of the work force. The realistic reasons we will need to tax the rich and implement UBI.,we need to tax the productivity produced by workers or machines  here's why   when a worker produces something  money goes three places  first  it goes to the owners  who then pay some money to the worker who produced it  and finally the worker pays taxes to the government to keep society functioning   the problem with this model is the removal of the worker from the equation through automation  we all see it  things that should be reducing the workload on all of us and making life better are instead being used to throw workers in the street and put more pressure on everyone  when production is automated and the worker is removed  the owner gets to pocket all of the money  and none goes to the worker or the government   so when the rich don't have to pay taxes thanks to their bought-and-paid-for politicians and the workers aren't paying taxes because they have no income  who funds the services that keep america alive  roads  education  emergency services  the rich  from the kindness of their sweatshop-owning hearts   as less and less work becomes available to people due to automation  which should be a good thing  less and less money is going to the citizens  and even  fuck you  got mine  people will dislike that because hey  gdp relies on citizens spending our money  and even after that  the government is receiving less in taxes to keep society together   so what do  ubi is what do   when people against ubi imagine it  they see it as a money in  money out problem between citizens and the government - people receive money   lazy  people stop working  income tax dries up and the government has no income    this is not how ubi would be implemented   first  it's important to understand the money in  money out problem is already underway  fewer people have income as jobs dry up  so less money goes to the government in taxes    ubi would involve the government directly taxing the capital  then paying to the citizens what we lose from the elimination of jobs and  cutting labor costs   the ubi would likely not be enough to survive on alone  however  it would provide security  and reduce the amount of work needed by one person to survive  by reducing the number of  work units  each person needs to survive  we would have enough jobs for everyone because what constitutes one job now could become two under the new system   the same amount of work gets done  but everyone gets to eat   what's more  elimination of jobs would be good for society  because as jobs become fewer  the money saved there increases the ubi  if we ever reached a point no one had to work  the ubi would still deliver to us the same amount of money as if we had been producing by hand and making wages   tl dr  tax the productivty and distribute ubi to make up for job losses due to automation  ensure citizens  owners and government each get a slice or it all goes to shit ,lbsmpn
1152,Had my first group interview today...,and i could only describe it as the most dystopian thing i've ever had happen to me   so the group interview is what it sounds like  there were four applicants and we all sat in the same room and the interviewer would do  popcorn  questions for each of us  group consisted of 3 young guys and a middle aged man   i was a one of the 3 young guys  i have experience with public speaking and its no problem for me and i react fairly well to questions i'm not prepared for  so the actual interview wasn't a problem  but it freaked me out as we went along and learned more about the other applicants   so the vast majority of people do not react well to being put on the spot in a group of strangers  hell  i'm only decent at it because my time in the military forced me to  and the middle aged gentleman struggled a bit with it  i don't want to give away too much info but the man was asked the question  if you could have any super power  what would it be  he struggled a bit and finally decided on  the power to take any pain away from my children if they have any from my divorce   and i realized i absolutely hated this kind of interview  i really hope that guy gets the job   tl dr  a group of poor  downtrodden people have to 1-up each other so they can get money for food,lc4dhq

distribution i've been posting it in parts all over the internet  below is my solution to construction and housing   now that we know what must be done  and why it must be done  we can finally focus on how we can start to do it  this society is contingent upon a few axioms   1  the axiom of choice free association  if someone decides to join this society it s completely a free choice of theirs   this axiom means that we have to locate this society in a place that has little to no current population  this also means that people born in this society must retain the citizenship of the parents and that there will be no native citizens of the society   2  the axiom of explicitness  there are no agreements that have not been made explicitly clear   this axiom means that any social contracts are actual contracts signed by all whom they pertain to   3  the axiom of self-reliance  all basic necessities for the whole population must be provided by production in the society  were this not to be the case then foreign powers would hold the real power   these axioms when they interact limit the scope of possibilities  to several lightly to uninhabited locations  because of axiom 1  that are either geothermal active or  near a geothermal hotspot because of axiom 3 applied to energy  when mapping all the remaining locations out this is what it looks like with somewhat loose criteria    amp

1224,Existential rot from the inside out,at the beginning of the pandemic  i enjoyed the solitude and peace of no social engagements no pressure to perform in front of other people  no stress  none of the typical bullshit where we wear unnecessary masks just to keep everyone else happy in their illusion of freedom  i was working at home  i have a bullshit office job that is certainly not  essential  by any means  which makes it worse  going day-by-day  and blocking out all of the apocalyptic media about the virus just to cope and enjoy the break the clear skies  the halt of pollution  you know  the ideal  slower world we probably should live in anyway  i d crack a white claw at 3 00pm  listen to podcasts while working on spreadsheets  or whatever pointless tasks my job wanted me to do  which seemed to change week-by-week as our executive folks tried to keep everyone  busy  whatever the fuck that s supposed to mean  and just relax on the couch  doing work while lounging  not too bad  right   a few months in  i realized that every single day during the pandemic i was dying inside a little bit more  have you seen office space  like when peter gibbons tells the hypnotherapist every day he works is the worst day of his life-- wow  that's messed up  i missed playing shows with my band the catharsis  the relief of playing something musically intense and extreme that could connect to other people and release the intensity and rage i feel when i think about the extreme inequality of the world  injustice  and victimization of billions so a couple of pieces of shit who are convinced they are saving the world  fuck off  can get richer  i play in punk and metal bands  loud  fast  pissed  and intense--it s wonderful and incredibly good for my mental health to get all of my negativity out in performance  which in turn essentially turns the seemingly infinite negative energy i have into community and appreciation of one another's art  it's a beautiful  beautiful  weird fucking community and i miss it so much   but it was silent  there was no intensity anymore  just silence  every single day  my significant other  who is a wonderful woman and incredibly patient with me  would watch her endless stream of television shows  i couldn t enjoy any of them  during the george floyd protests i turned off my social media  sickened by all of the  well-intentioned  but annoying  egoistic posturing of  white  people i actually like  but were performing like they were martyrs  it s not about you  people  it s about justice and ending racism--not posting on social media  i was so  so  so tired of it all  a fragmented pandemic response  endless police brutality  structural racism  endless brutal inequality i'm reminded of every time i go to the gas station to buy beer  living in 2020 united states is like living in a god damn developing country despite the fact  we  have the most wealth in the entire history of the world  of course most of that is hoarded in offshore accounts to avoid taxes  ugh   my partner and i bought a super nice house in june in the height of the pandemic great price and interest rate  capitalism rules all  fucking apparently  due to the viral apocalypse going on around us and we moved in  once we were in  i found myself just retreating to sitting outside  drinking beers  smoking cigarettes  and listening to podcasts just like i did during the pandemic  what else was i going to do  i couldn t go to shows  i couldn t play shows  i couldn t go out of town to watch wrestling  my cult obsession  don't knock it 'til you try it  aew and njpw are fantastic  i couldn t just go to a bar for no reason  remember when you could just go to a bar for no reason  bars were open but i m not trying to become a carrier and kill my dad  who essentially has every preexisting risk for covid complications   so this is what i do now i work a pointless fucking administrative job that is certainly not essential four days in a week in my office  one day mid-week at home  some bizarre semi-work-from-home fantasy that assumes we are somehow reducing everyone s risk by doing this one day a week  whatever man going to enjoy it  but sounds like a load of bootlicking administrative bullshit  every single day i feel completely dead inside  there just feels like there s nothing left  i used to love the rush of live music whether aggressive  fast  slow  sad  happy whatever it made me feel alive  the only joy i get is band practice  and fortunately  i do have two bands and great guys  and their partners  to socialize with  which is probably the only thing keeping me from losing it  i drink as much as possible with them and listen to metal and punk to get the negative energy out   while it s fun  i long for the days where i can share the music we play and energy live with other people  i feel like my soul is rotting from the inside out and all that s left is a guy trying to bury his feelings with booze  cigarettes  endless podcasts  so  so tired of looking at fucking screens  and the occasional pro wrestling event on my tv that gives me a little shot of dopamine to keep me alive enough to wake up tomorrow and do it all over again   i know this isn t a permanent condition  fucking hopefully  but jesus fucking christ  how does anyone want to live in this world  what s the fucking point  endless exploitation and no time for joy  and people have the nerve to tell me to do yoga and meditate  what a fucking joke  i would never  ever do it  but i understand why people want to kill themselves  is this all there is ,lavxga

1283,"Anyone else have a ""good"" job that's just... not worth it?",i've been working on off since i was 14  but for the most part i was always stuck with shit jobs  washing dishes  sweeping floors  cleaning bathrooms  all the  starter  jobs you're expected to take at a young age   now i'm 19  and on paper  i have a charmed life  i moved out of my parents house at 17  and have been living on my own since then  last year  i got my first  real  job  and upgraded from a shoebox studio apartment to a more luxurious 1-bedroom   the only reason i'm able to have all of my freedoms though  is because i just never stop working  i show up every day  sit in front of a computer for 7 hours  then go about my merry way  even though i  rarely  do more than the bare minimum  i sit there and put in the hours so i can pay rent at the end of the month  it sucks   but here's the thing   it's a good job   like  aside from the fact that i  have  to be there  there aren't many problems with it  the work is simple enough  my coworkers are all great  i get paid well  there are endless reasons for me to keep my job  plus  i work for a non-profit organization  meaning that i feel rewarded for doing at least  some  good for my community   but regardless of all the benefits  or the friendly atmosphere  i don't want to be there because of 2 things   1  i just don't want to work 2  the guilt that results from that  there's just something about the daily  grind routine that exhausts me to no end  getting up and doing the same thing every day  rarely having enough time or energy to pursue any hobbies outside of tv and video games  living paycheck to paycheck because even though you get paid  more  than enough  you spend it all on takeout  booze and drugs just to trick your brain into thinking life is worth it at the end of the day   that feeling fucking sucks  i hate feeling like i'm caught in an endless loop  and so  i've just lost interest in the work  i work remotely  so it's not like my boss can waltz into my apartment to see if i'm on task  so  90  of the time  i'm getting high and browsing twitter  or watching a youtube video  or making frustrated posts like this   and of course   that  makes me feel guilty  if i were working almost anywhere else  it wouldn't be a problem  if i slacked off as a frycook or a busboy  the worst thing that would happen is my boss would lose some money  if i slacked off at a call center  the worst thing that would happen is i'd get yelled at a little   but now  it's different  when i slack off and try to enjoy myself  i just can't  because i  know  i could be doing some actual good  i could be helping out my teammates  who are  very clearly  overworked all the time  i could be volunteering for a more important part of the job that would take up more of my time  but no  the only thing that feels right to me is sitting on the couch and procrastinating  and on top of all of that  i know there's some kid down the street who works 1000x harder than me  and gets paid less  and that makes me feel like shit   so what am i supposed to do  i can't quit  because i'll get evicted and have to move back in with my parents  i can't continue to slack off  because eventually the guilt will build up too much  or i'll get fired  and i can't  actually  start working hard  because i'll probably fucking kill myself after a month of real  intense work   why do i even have to be in this position in the first place ,laxlol
1284,Intuitively Abolishing Work,hello all  since the last time  crohn's disease https en wikipedia org wiki crohn 27s disease  nearly killed me in dec 2017 i've been working on a way to abolish work in a stupidly simple way out of necessity  sorry for the wall-o-text  abolishing work while easy  is still complex   tl dr  creating a crazy video game via voluntary global collaboration  in 2016 crohn's rendered me bedridden  had to stop attending helicopter school  all my previous work experience became useless  with no money  being bedridden  just returning home from emergency surgery after a week in the hospital on iv antibiotics  i needed a way to live a life i could be proud of   thus began  project universe https shaostoul com 's closed development on 24 dec 2017   on 29 january 2019 freely open community development began https www youtube com watch v af6z4puacse   historical context     in 1992 i began gaming on the nes with the mario duck hunt combo cartridge    in 1994 i began teaching myself game development modding with a few different games on my dad's amiga 500  amp  4000    in 2006 i began teaching game dev modding as a fun international hobby    in 2014 i began modding teaching it for  space engineers https steamcommunity com id shaostoul myworkshopfiles appid 244850 amp p 1 amp numperpage 30    in 2018 i spoke at emerald city comic con about  the benefits of video game modding on individuals  communities  amp  developers https www youtube com watch v qpb8-ttziia  with fellow space engineers modders   essentially i'm a huge nerd that loves video games more than most  with the community  knowledge  amp  resources gained from my history  we're creating a free space-ready open-source school disguised as a sci-fi video game  through it we're preparing humanity for our future as a united interplanetary civilization   from 2017 to late 2019 i couldn't use my computer without crohn's symptoms worsening  so i spent most of my time r amp ding the plan from my cellphone  in oct 2019 we received a  30 000 donation which paid for a powered adjustable bed frame  super soft bed  amp  cheap 55  tv allowing me to safely use my computer in bed  in nov 2020 we  submitted project universe https www youtube com watch v jo1ce2vckr0  to the  unity for humanity program https unity com humanity   today development is going well thanks to a growing team of volunteers from across the globe  you can meet most of them in  our discord https discord gg 9xxmmeqnwc  every volunteer submits an  application  as an introduction to the team  amp  as an agreement to a  2 000 month salary for 10ish hours of work week plus benefits as soon as our teamwork makes it happen  at least until humanity transitions to a unified decentralized form of self-government without a pyramid scheme leadership   funding comes from multiple sources     crowdfunding  via  patreon https www patreon com shaostoul  until our account system is operational  is the best way of accelerating development  every penny goes to project universe  no   cut for venture capitalists seed investors bank loans etc    investors ideally provide at minimum  300 000 for 1 year of dev with 10 essential devs  every  30 000 is another dev for 1 year  this is the least preferred method as investors require a   cut  which prevents me from hiring more community members    self-funding is our primary method of permanent funding once the game is sufficiently operational  amp  the community is large enough  project universe consists of 3 components  the game  school  amp  virtual mall  the mall is filled with  business affiliates https shaostoul com partners  providing tracking links   the mall is the best method of funding as it indefinitely funds development without having to charge users for access to the game school mall  players purchase products services from irl businesses in-game at  touch-screen kiosks  in a centralized area linked to via affiliate tracking links  think of it as orgrimmar with irl businesses  amp  in-game shops   currently we nearly have everything required for development from today to release  most of the software is free  for the stuff that isn't  crowdfunding covers what it can  ie  the website  amp  dev tools like substance painter  hardware wise we use  playfab https playfab com  for the base account system   spatialos https www improbable io multiplayer-networking  for mmo stuff  a community member is providing a dedicated server   amp  so forth   all we need now is help increasing global advocacy as it exponentially accelerates development  a larger community   more volunteers   faster dev   more funding   more business partners  it's one hell of a push-to-start infinitely scalable  positive feedback loop https en wikipedia org wiki positive feedback  additionally a larger community makes it easier for us to work with governments to get the school accepted globally  with  starlink https www starlink com  bringing global internet access we're able to bring high-quality education to even the most remote places  interplanetary latency is a problem until we have a ftl method of communication    but shaostoul  how does it abolish work   humanity has a knack for over complicating things  amp  being frustratingly stubborn when it comes to change  ie  if it ain't broke  don't fix it  but we can see where that got us   fortunately we're not doing it alone  ai by itself is ending most jobs  some requires streamlining our way of life  unifying humanity takes care of a bunch  many businesses are creating solutions to problems project universe doesn't need to solve  we're just connecting it all together through a video game   the school teaches irl skills through gameplay  with ai  ar  amp  vr it's capable of teaching anyone anything anywhere on  amp  off earth with an applicable smart device  console  pc  tv  etc  the account system records what you learn  never fill out a resume ever again   amp  the game keeps that knowledge fresh by forcing you to use it for gameplay  ie  learn welding in-game to weld doors shut to block hostile aliens  once you're good enough in-game you qualify for a drastically shortened irl apprenticeship   with ai ar vr robotics many jobs are permanently disappearing leading to increased permanent unemployment  however we still want to teach people  amp  keep those skills fresh for when humanity begins colonizing space in 2024  amp  beyond  think of the ai as your best friend  doctor  guide  teacher  mentor  etc  should you find yourself completely isolated  because of an accident leaving you trapped on mars with help 6  months away the ai can help you build fix everything   the game combats cabin fever  provides social interaction  gives a virtual testing ground for designing irl spacecraft habitats maintaining maximum morale  etc   instead of hiring everyone we'll be building free-to-live-in self-sufficient housing complexes with on-site aquaponics  hospital  3d printers  waste disposal  recycling  entertainment  solar wind hydro gen  etc   alright  i could continue writing about project universe for a long time  any questions so far   i'm working on new videos to succinctly describe every aspect  i'm still bedridden  amp  if i use my computer long enough crohn's symptoms return worsen  as a result i have to take things slow so i don't almost die again   i live in kitsap county  wa  usa  i'm in the pacific time zone  i'm typically active from noon to midnight working on project universe in some way  you're free to message me any time  you never have to ask permission to speak with me  i'll respond asap  discord is the best place to reach me ,l9y4au
