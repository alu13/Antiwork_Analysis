0,"Jerome K. Jerome on work, from “Three Men in a Boat”",gt it always does seem to me that i am doing more work than i should do it is not that i object to the work mind you i like work it fascinates me i can sit and look at it for hours i love to keep it by me the idea of getting rid of it nearly breaks my heart  gtyou cannot give me too much work to accumulate work has almost become a passion with me my study is so full of it now that there is hardly an inch of room for any more i shall have to throw out a wing soon  gtand i am careful of my work too why some of the work that i have by me now has been in my possession for years and years and there isnt a fingermark on it i take a great pride in my work i take it down now and then and dust it no man keeps his work in a better state of preservation than i do but though i crave for work i still like to be fair i do not ask for more than my proper share  gt but i get it without asking for it  at least so it appears to me  and this worries me,8jyj4i

4,Trying to find an article about ‘hard work’.,there was an anarchist website online i want to suggest bash back for some reason saying that in reality people are working too hard that its causing them serious health issues or that hard work doesnt bring wealth as common wisdom suggests eventually the owners closed down their website but im sure that the article is available somewhere on archiveorg the trouble is i have no clue what its name was does anybody know what im talking about  if its of any help i think that maybe some of the websites background was pink or purple later it was yellow until the site disappeared i think that it shut down in 2017,8lq5xd
