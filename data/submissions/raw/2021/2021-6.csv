7,The Bee Movie is antiwork,"I was thinking about the Bee Movie the other day. It shows how the bees' labor is necessary for the entire planet's ecosystem to function, but the culty hypercapitalist system that they live in is exploitative. As one of the human villains says, ""they make the honey and we make the money."" And it also shows how bees are arbitrarily assigned a single job that they have zero passion for. They're brainwashed into thinking working that job for their whole lives is their purpose of living. They work until they die and get easily replaced by newly graduated bees, and many of them aren't paid enough. In the end, they solve problems by collectively working together, not with a profit motive for a large monopoly, but with the motive to make the world a better place, because their labor makes a real difference.

One scene goes like this:

""And you'll be happy to know that bees as a species haven't had one day off in 27 million years!""

""So you'll just work us to death?""

I was worried I'd be excommunicating myself from this entire industry the world over.

I told my boss in great detail every single thing that frustrated me. Whether things my coworkers did, things she did, things doctors did, admin, you name it. We spoke for ~2 hours. I shit all over this place/office/school/hospital. She was surprisingly understanding and said I could reach out for a recommendation letter any time. She worked me to my breaking point, but i'm shocked I went out like I did without seemingly burning bridges.

IDK what's next. I've got some 2nd and 3rd interviews lined up in the coming days, but nothing guaranteed. I've got ~3-4 months of living expenses saved up.

After almost 5 years of working technical, I really want to change my job to become "" IT - business facing"" type of role. (aka middle man)  I don't mind about the title, It could be anything like SCRUM master, product owner / manager, business analyst, non technical consultant, release management, IT service delivery / management, technical account manager., project manager... whatever !

 I really stop working as software engineer / developer. I have been already wearing multiple hats than ""software engineer / developer"" I just want to do less stressful job which could pay same or slightly less than technical job. I don't want to deal with endless requests from business which don't make any sense but they need to keep requesting things to meet with their targets and surely ""I need to deliver them because It is business decision"" 

The technical jobs causes more stress and I want to avoid this in my life in my 30ies. I simply don't care about getting paid couple hundreds less. I want to perform a job which is more than easy to me. Why would I spend so much effort to have more or less same life standard?

15,Help me build the support networks for a general strike:,"Look, I know, I know, you've all grown tired of hearing about unactualized general strikes. So have I. 

However, I think most of us believe in the need for such an action. If not only to raise our depressed wages, then also for healthcare, our environment, our kids, for the members of our extended families in, not only the first world but also, the third.

For the immigrant children who've experienced prison even before puberty. For the untold numbers of adults who have and still are wasting away in prison. For those who've been prayed upon by rehabs and insurance companies and those who've needlessly suffered the world over for some oligarch's profits.....

...I could write a book but it wouldn't bring to light anything you don't already know...

Specifically, what is it we know? We know that behind this myriad of issues lays one relatively small group of people. And this is true for not just one country but the world over.

Our issues may be so numerous that it seems too daunting to tackle the issues. Fair enough. Let's treat the cause not the symptoms. 

Eventually we strike, we demand justice and equality. We demand accountability for those who've let our loved ones die with treatable diseases, who let us suffer mental health issues while we toil away for unlivable wages and we demand accountability to those who've suppressed science and who've worked to corrupt our governments!

But to begin I propose we start crunching the numbers: 

How many people can a certain population (Nashville, TN for instance) expect to participate in a general strike? 

How long might we expect that to last? 

How much money would we need to support ourselves throughout such an event? 

How long might we expect it to take to raise those funds in advance? 

I want to begin working this out. By labor day, and with your help, I hope to begin opening individual Kickstarter accounts for each participating area. So a kickstart for Nashville, for Birmingham, for Omaha for Denver, for LA, etc and that's only here in the U.S.

We need to extrapolate on this idea and implement it world wide. For if we only strike in the U.S., these multinationals will only redirect profits from the rest of the world to subvert our efforts. 

We need to stand with Honk Kong again, we need to support Chile, Peru and Iran and we need them to support us. Not so much support us with money but with solidarity and we need to support them.

I've been feeling like there's something wrong with me for a few months because I don't want to work anymore. It's not about my company, coworkers, salary or career. Is just that I really don't want to work, I don't feel like life should be this way of working 9-5 for 50 years or more just to pay bills and buy shit.  I already suffer from anxiety and this is giving me a lot lately. 

I didn't work for most of 2020 because of covid and I was happy, but since I couldn't do anything at all I kind of felt like yeah, working would be good. But it's been completely the opposite. And I changed careers to a better one, got a better job and better pay but I still feel so unhappy every single day that I don't know what I'm going to do with my life but I am 100% sure that working is not what I want to do.  Everyday and more and more unmotivated, I procrastinate a lot, have problems focusing myself... Those things I had them before but now I feel them even more.

And I know that a new job, or more money won't make happy. If anything less miserable, and I can't find the mental energy to do anything to make a change in my life.

I want to throw the fat cats sitting on top off their thrones, not make them more money while my body withers away. I suppose that's ultimately the point of work in the world we live in, isn't it?

51,What I realized recently about my life,"**This is my story of working life**

*Since I left school I worked in different jobs like retail and call centers for some years now.*

*I had motivation for my first call center job and tried hard to show my best for my girlfriends sake since she demanded more money. At some point I didnt feel like myself anymore, I felt like some kind of robot who would do and say the same things every day without an ending in sight.*

*The stress of the job by dealing with customers who would insult, scream and threaten me was really bad for my health: my heart beat quickly, my body was stinging so much that I thought I would die and my hands were sweating so much that my clothes would be all wet where my hands were placed. I even went to a doctor regarding that pain, but he didnt care about it much and didnt seem to want to even take time for me, he only said that Im young and thats normal.*

&amp;#x200B;

*Some time went by and I ended the relationship with my girlfriend &amp; with my job when i finally realized that it was the same as my parents relationship where my mother is only together with my father because of money. Never understood why people are in relationships when its only for having an advantage and not about love.*

*- Dad was working the whole time for money, was rarely at home and missed seeing his children growing up completely.*

*- Mother was buying much unnecessary stuff with the money and instead of love there was verbal &amp; physical abuse at home.*

  *At that time I didnt know what was right or wrong since noone told me; i was new to this world and I just thought ""what did I do wrong; why am I so bad"" all the time when I was crying myself to sleep or had suicide thoughts after experiencing abuse.*

*When I grew a little older I realized I NEVER want to end up like ""adults"" who are causing pain and are two faced. \[Once I visited my grandmas house and found randomly a piece of paper which said ""human rights"": Opened the paper and read the articles, where I started smiling and just thought what kind of world is that? I was sure its not the world I experienced so far.\]*

&amp;#x200B;

*I was completely alone again, searched for another job since I had no money for paying rent and landed in retail. Didnt have much motivation (when u got noone the motivation is really bad) but I still tried to do a good job. People were complaining like usual about things I cant change and sometimes they were expecting me to do things where I thought ""im not getting paid for doing that"".*

*After some time in this job I realized no matter how hard I try to do a good job it actually doesnt matter and started thinking: Every time I tried hard to do something the best I can in the past it always ended really bad for myself.*

*Without a single break time and being up on my feet the whole time at a eight to ten hour shift in the job my feet got really painful and it got worse over time. Decided this isnt worth it, that my health is more important and I quit this job who only paid minimum wage anyways.*

&amp;#x200B;

*On the advice of my colleague from the retail job, I applied for unemployment benefits. To get it, however, you had to write applications on job advertisements. So I applied for jobs that are possible where I meet the requirements (retail &amp; call center) with hope to get a job without experiencing pain. The unemployment benefit I received was below the poverty line but it was enough to survive.*

&amp;#x200B;

*Got a new job in a call center, which I only did for a month before quitting. Every single day that month I had severe headaches and could hardly concentrate; i thought the whole time while at work ""why am I doing this?"". Going to the doctor was no option for me from my past experience so I quit after a month. And with the day of the termination of the job, the headaches have disappeared.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*I decided to take a few months off with my savings now (without an income) since I don't know what to do anymore. Somehow I dont care much about money or a job, mostly giving the money I earned to charitys to help abuse victims. If I had to decide between a job which causes me pain and unemplyoment benefits without pain I would always choose the latter though.*",False,oalpds,Nuculi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oalpds/what_i_realized_recently_about_my_life/,0,1
52,Occupation as a privilege,"Someone has to have started a discussion on it before, but I just saw a heated exchange on LinkedIn about occupation as a privilege. The unspoken, but very often due to luck of the draw, benefits that white-collar professionals get. Flexible work hours. Quality healthcare and retirement options. Option to WFH. Resources for mental health. The ability to even ask for these kinds of NEEDS when they arise. 

Thinking about conversations I’ve had with friends in corporate positions and the awkward moments we’ve had — when I can’t rework my schedule like them for lunch or take a spontaneous weekend trip because I have to accrue PTO — I feel like this is a privilege that needs a TON more attention.

65,Work Vent (review and “raise”),"Hi there, I’m just posting this to vent so if that isn’t your style, move along. I just got out of my first annual review (annual according to the company’s review schedule, not how long I have personally been at the job) at my company and it was disappointing to say the least. I performed “above and beyond” in all categories and was fully expecting a promotion (which I brought up with my boss beforehand and they hinted at me getting) and appropriate raise to match. Instead I got no promotion and a measley 3% raise (which I don’t even think is at pace with inflation). Apparently I’m ineligible for a promotion because I’m just shy of a year with said company - even though others have been promoted in less than a year. Was told I wouldn’t get another review for another year. 


Oh and I’m the only one on my team who has been forced to go back into the office even though I can do my job 100% remote (and have proved I’m responsible and capable while working fully remote during the pandemic) just because I didn’t up and move during the pandemic - which really demotivates me and makes me want to up and move. Also found out my boss lied about what they could do and pinned it on HR (for example, people on other teams who still live in state haven’t had to go into the office as much as I have, and people have been promoted in other teams in under a year). Boss told me 3% raise was the absolute biggest they could give but idk if they’re being honest about that.

86,Gen Xer here with a few ideas for ya'll,"Hi I just bumped into this sub and wanted to throw out a few ideas for those who feel like cogs, meaningless under paid workers. 

Apologies for the length of this post (and lack of links) but I hope someone out there finds this useful. 

Have you heard of "" Intentional Living"" , and ""alternative"" things like co-housing?  Google Intentional Living. 
In these arrangements, you can trade, say 20 hours of work a week on a communal project (whatever your talent might be) from gardening to help prepare meals to planning...and then n return for being part a community all housing and other basic  needs are taken care of (but goes beyond just basic needs...).  

I like the ecological communities built around sustainable living - I'm looking into a few of them now. 

These communities exist all over the world, including two in NYC. 

I'm assuming a younger crowd here, so this is what I tell my 16 year old nephew who's working part time at Subway. He's a talented drummer and wants to be a jazz musician. I tell him to go for it but there's things that pay a lot of money that don't involve Korporate America that can pay the bills until he reaches Carnegie Hall (heh). 

#1. painting interiors and/or exteriors. I needed a painter a few years ago and couldn't find an affordable one that did decent work and didn't whine about doing some drywall. This wasn't a huge job but the prices were surreal. If you live in or near a city make up cards and get to know management companies that manage condos, co-ops, apartment buildings, and building Supers. The management of our 5 story condo paid something like $40k to have the freakin halls painted.  Hard to believe isn't it? Two 5 story sister buildings just the halls.  

#2. Electrician - interesting work and no one's going to outsource electricians. I need a kitchen monorail light fixed and the going rate to troubleshoot it is $175/hr.  From past experiences it's really hard to find a good electrician  so when word gets out these guys are all booked. I can't afford to have it looked at so I'm just  going to replace this light. 

My brother's a small time builder. He's had projects on hold for weeks waiting for the electrician to have time to show up. 

#3. Farrier/someone who shoes horses. - don't laugh.
About 20 years ago I was assigned a land line number that had belonged to a local farrier. My phone rang all day long 7 days a week.  All these people were scrambling to find another Farrier. There's a real shortage and Farriers make a lot of money. Sure it's hard work but not any harder than working for a General Contractor. Besides, horse people are generally nice, very appreciative of the farrier. and working around horses beats working in retail. Overhead is low, just have to learn the trade. 

#4. It you're a creative type open an Etsy store. 

Back in the day I knew this couple who sold sporting memorabilia on ebay. It started as a hobby. They got so busy they had to both quit their Korporate jobs. I don't know where they sourced the products I think they had to drive around a bit, but they had fun and made more money than their old jobs. 

#5. Many of you probably live in areas where you can find deals on mid century modern furniture and related items. Teach yourself about mid century  modern design, drive around to wherever it's found in your area, then haul it to a city flea market. The prices this stuff goes for boggles my mind.  Example &gt; I knew these two guys living the beach life in Ft Lauderdale, FL. Apparently South Florida is loaded with mid century modern furniture. They started buying it for cheap, then they'd make runs about 3 times a year and unload this stuff at the Clelsea Flea market in NYC.  I don't know how much they made but they sure weren't slumming it and had loads of time.  This hot trend doesn't show signs of going anywhere even after 20 years. 

#6. Grow mosses for the aquarium trade. Look up the prices of various mosses on any site that sells plants for fish tanks. A little 3"" x 3"" piece of moss goes for a fortune and the biggest joke is, it's not hard to cultivate. If I had an extra room that's what I'd be doing. Speaking of the aquarium trade, look at how much driftwood and various rocks sell for. Some woods can't be used in fish tanks but plenty can. Look at the prices  of pieces of wood and rocks used in aqua scaping. You won't believe how much money people pay for rocks and wood. Read up how to treat wood yourself it's not hard.  If I had an extra room that's what I'd be doing. 

Especially smaller pieces like for 10 gallon Betta tanks. A couple of small pieces of spider wood at the pet store or aquarium shop are probably around $30.00 (haven't looked in a while). 
I know some States have laws against taking rocks from streams so pay attention to local ordinances. Look on ebay if you want to get an idea of how much rocks are worth LoL. 

Just a few ideas for housing and getting off the treadmill - all the best ☮️😊.   

 I really want to move and get into the moss business lol.",False,oan7zg,nycaquagal2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oan7zg/gen_xer_here_with_a_few_ideas_for_yall/,24,1

88,I just started a new job last month and I already am fucking miserable,Is there a job that exists that is ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE?? Or is there any job that exists that is ACTUALLY FUN??

90,FMLA is going to make things interesting at my job,"Specifically me going on FMLA for a chronic health condition.  I work at a retail store where we are pretty much always short one person.  That's how they like to run it.  Now I've gone on FMLA before when I was younger but it was at a big call center so it didn't make much difference if I was there or not.  However, at this job it will hit them hard if they don't hire another person. 
For those not familiar with FMLA, it gives 60 days off a year.  These days are without pay, but it makes sure someone doesn't lose their job because of a health condition they're dealing with or taking care of a loved one and a couple other scenarios.  I've been able to work there so far without much trouble of having to call in sick etc..  I'm planning to go off a specific medication and i know there will be withdrawal and there could even be weeks where i don't come in.  The interesting thing about FMLA is i don't have to give notice really.  And i can even show up late and leave early at my discretion, as I'm doing my best with a chronic condition.  

The reason I'm making this post is because I have a feeling i am going to be the one to blame when the store is short handed.  Certain coworkers won't like it, and management won't like it either if the company decides to not hire another person.  We have a store manager but in many ways he doesn't make decisions for the store, he doesn't decide how many people work there, he doesn't advocate for his employees to the higher ups.  He is seen as doing a good job by keeping the least amount of employees with the least amount of pay and keeping the store running.  It's a pathetic way to live your life in my opinion.  

Various coworkers won't understand what FMLA is and I'm definitely going to be somewhat hated on.  As far as I know the store management has never had an employee on FMLA and it will be new for them too.  I can come in every other day,  give myself three or four day weekends, pretty much anything I want and they can't do a thing about it.   I'm not being paid for when I'm not working so it's not like they're losing money.  But with how they designed the work schedule and amount of employees it's going to kill them if they don't hire another person at least part time.  There will be more pressure on staff to not take their vacation days etc..  i know the simplest solution will be to hire another person full time, and there's room for another person with me working there full time right now.  But I know how things work there and they would rather everyone suffer for as long as possible before they decide to bring someone else on.

I'll definitely post an update when this all goes down.  Now remember I'm not doing this to fuck with them.  I need money I need to work, i just don't want to be in danger of losing my job because I ran out of sick days or endanger myself and others by trying to work while in withdrawal or without having slept.  But I bet you I'm going to be looked at as the bad guy.  The guy with the chronic health conditions, that works when he can, yeah that's the guy who is making it so hard on everyone else.",False,oaoqmi,Islasuncle,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oaoqmi/fmla_is_going_to_make_things_interesting_at_my_job/,0,1

94,Eager to quit the job that’s forcing me to return to in-person. Mistake?,"While some might argue I have a good job and that I am “lucky” to hold, I am very eager to find a new one. I did a calculation today that if I come in at the number of hours they want me to after they force us to return to the office (4 days per week minimum), I would spend 384 hours every year commuting. And it makes me really mad. Despite the security and fairly good salary, and decent benefits, this does not seem to be worth it to me. 

I have two options:

1) I tell my supervisors that coming in 4-days a week is a deal-breaker, and that  I will need to look for another job. This will undoubtedly piss them off. 

2) I do it behind their back, which will piss them off even more (loyalty is a big thing in their view) and I also run the risk of finding something with less benefits, potentially less stimulating for my brain, and also likely less secure in terms of job security long-term. 

What experience are people having looking for remote jobs currently? Is the market for those actually as abundant as the internet makes it seem? I’ve been doing a bit of digging, and it seems like a lot of the good remote jobs are in engineering and IT. Am I just looking in the wrong places?

98,Never give two weeks.,"Story of my last job.
We needed a degree.
Experience using software.
Quick skills.

They paid 15/he. No sick days. No time off. No benefits. Managers were bosses friends and family. All making $400k a year to just check emails. Basically took commissions off of our artwork. All we got was hourly.

Anyways each Christmas break, last two weeks of the year. The company closed down. Unpaid.
So December we would work two weeks. Get paid then have to take off two weeks, no pay and then come back Jan first. And then work two weeks before getting paid.

So we had to go a month Without pay. And due to the noncompete we couldn't really work another job.

In Orlando Fl. Rent isn't cheap.

The company really liked to fire people on Jan first.
So you would come back after no paycheck for two weeks, and then get let go on the day rent is due. They would even make you drive to the office as well. Just let you sit at your desk. Call you outside to talk. Fire you and not even let you go back in.

Imagine driving 30 miles on the highway at 7am. To a job that hasn't paid you in two weeks. Just to be fired.

I personally quit. Didn't like the attitude I was getting. And walked out right then and there.
I was the lead and the quickest. Took them hiring 4+ people to replace me and still never really caught back up.",False,oajssu,Giogiogio2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oajssu/never_give_two_weeks/,11,1
99,Why does everything about the human race have to be so complicated? Hear me out...,"I have to go back to a job soon, sadly, and I feel completely empty. I don't feel like a human. I feel like an empty shell full of dread and despair. ""I am a robot whose sole existence is to provide labor for his employer, and I will do so until the day I die, sacrificing family time, holidays, and my time and passions and interests and my very soul, in exchange for slips of paper and be happy for the opportunity to do so.""

I always get told that I have a god complex or that I think I'm better than anyone else whenever I suggest that humans are inherently evil and stupid. Or, even better, their response is ""you're human too"", yeah, obviously I am. What, do you expect me to slowly turn to you, look at you with wide eyes, and realize in that moment that ""holy shit... I am human!!!111"" No, I realize I'm a human, and that I'm no better than anyone else. That doesn't mean I shouldn't be able to have an opinion about the human race as a whole. It's possible to step away from yourself and look around and see just why they're stupid.

Well, for starters, we're the only living species that passes around green slips of paper that at some point was collectively agreed upon to be a method of trade although it's value is completely imaginary. We pass around these green slips of paper to be able to have shelter, food, and water, which are basic human necessities. ***We essentially decided to be the only living species to pay to live on their planet.***

1. We, in a greatly exaggerated sense, at some point decided to pass around green slips of paper to be able to drink out of a lake after watching deer drinking out of it freely.
2. We, in a greatly exaggerated sense, decided to watch dolphins swim around in the water happily, living a simple, enjoyable life, and decided to make our lives about worrying over numbers on a computer screen in a thing called a ""bank account"" dropping below a value of zero.
3. We, in a greatly exaggerated sense, saw the beauty in nature, and decided to tear it all down, destroying and murdering for the sake of a system valuing infinite profit over human life on a planet with finite resources. Earth was essentially a paradise, and we tore it down, making asphalt roads, pollution machines of all kinds, and treating it like a giant trash can.

 A green slip of paper that we call a ""bill"" is not going to stop a bear from attacking you. 

A green slip of paper that we call a ""bill"" is not going to magically make the water stop drowning you.

A green slip of paper that we call a ""bill"" is not going to stop that tornado from changing course and barreling over your house. Why does money matter?

Money makes things soulless. ""Get a job doing what you love"" is capitalist bullshit. You should not have to monetize and profit off of the few things that make you wholeheartedly happy. When you apply money to something, you will soon hate it. You may love to have sex a lot, but once you're stuck on a strict schedule of sex 8 hours a day, you may only want to have sex for 4 hours a day, but have to continue doing it for 8, and if you don't you get kicked out. You may love to bake cakes, but once you're doing it 10 hours a day on a strict schedule for an ungodly amount of customers every single day, you'll soon dread it. Work is a neverending vicious cycle. It feels like you're being drowned 5 days a week, and your two days off are your attempts to gasp for breath as your head is temporarily pulled out of the water bucket. For 40 years, until you die, or if you survive, MAYBE you'll get 12 years of freedom, but you won't have the youth or energy to truly enjoy it. And with the way things are going, my generation can't retire. My generation's retirement plan, as a general rule, is to just wait for societal collapse.

And politics? Fuck them. I hate politics. I've started to realize more and more that there is no ""left VS right"". It's a tactic to make citizens break apart and fight against each other rather than uniting their minds and realizing the true problems. Each side just wants to brainwash you into accepting their ideals and beliefs instead of being independent and seeing the world's biggest problems. Originally, it was supposed to be one side having different ways of tackling issues as opposed to the other side. Nowadays, it's ""oh, fuck the right, they're so brainwashed!"" ""the left are so brainwashed and nobody wants to go back to work!"". Politics are rigged. The people in power stay in power. There's a whole system they've created to keep the general population brainwashed, or at the very least distracted or chained down, to keep them from overthrowing them. We could have a world that's fair and just, with no chance of corrupt individuals rising to power, and instead we have a world where everyone has been brainwashed to believe slavery no longer exists. Stop limiting yourself to thinking of chatel slavery - it's what they want. Slavery still exists, it's just been sugarcoated and the rules have changed. It's better than what we had before, but it's still there. ***Capitalism runs on the threat of poverty, and the man who bakes a loaf of bread to earn the money to buy a slice of bread is not free.***

Why does everything have to be so complicated? We look at dolphins and think we're more intelligent than them because we've achieved the wheel, New York, wars, and so on, while all the dolphins ever do is swim in the water having a good time. Conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man for precisely the same reasons. Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.

How am I supposed to be hopeful and cheerful looking towards my future? Besides my girlfriend, all I see in the future are terrible bosses, low wages, rising inflation, a worsening housing market, criminalizing the homeless, rich getting richer, poor getting poorer, and a world *not* on the brink of collapse, but rather already *in the midst* of collapse. **I see wars coming.

104,Working is Pain - gonna take a Break now,"Since I left school I worked in different jobs like retail and call centers for some years now.

I had motivation for my first call center job and tried hard to show my best for my girlfriends sake since she demanded more money. At some point I didnt feel like myself anymore, I felt like some kind of robot who would do and say the same things every day without an ending in sight.

The stress of the job by dealing with customers who would insult, scream and threaten me was really bad for my health: my heart beat quickly, my body was stinging so much that I thought I would die and my hands were sweating so much that my clothes would be all wet where my hands were placed. I even went to a doctor regarding that pain, but he didnt care about it much and didnt seem to want to even take time for me, he only said that Im young and thats normal.

Some time went by and I ended the relationship with my girlfriend &amp; with my job when i finally realized that it was the same as my parents relationship where my mother is only together with my father because of money. Never understood why people are in relationships when its only for having an advantage and not about love.

\- Dad was working the whole time for money, was rarely at home and missed seeing his children growing up completely.

\- Mother was buying much unnecessary stuff with the money and instead of love there was verbal &amp; physical abuse at home.

At that time I didnt know what was right or wrong since noone told me; i was new to this world and I just thought ""what did I do wrong; why am I so bad"" all the time when I was crying myself to sleep or had suicide thoughts after experiencing abuse.

When I grew a little older I realized I NEVER want to end up like ""adults"" who are causing pain and are two faced. \[Once I visited my grandmas house and found randomly a piece of paper which said ""human rights"": Opened the paper and read the articles, where I started smiling and just thought what kind of world is that? I was sure its not the world I experienced so far.\]

I was completely alone again, searched for another job since I had no money for paying rent and landed in retail. Didnt have much motivation (when u got noone the motivation is really bad) but I still tried to do a good job. People were complaining like usual about things I cant change and sometimes they were expecting me to do things where I thought ""im not getting paid for doing that"". After some time in this job I realized no matter how hard I try to do a good job it actually doesnt matter and started thinking: Every time I tried hard to do something the best I can in the past it always ended really bad for myself. Without a single break time and being up on my feet the whole time at a eight to ten hour shift in the job my feet got really painful and it got worse over time. Decided this isnt worth it, that my health is more important and I quit this job who only paid minimum wage anyways.

On the advice of my colleague from the retail job, I applied for unemployment benefits. To get it, however, you had to write applications on job advertisements. So I applied for jobs that are possible where I meet the requirements (retail &amp; call center) with hope to get a job without experiencing pain. The unemployment benefit I received was below the poverty line but it was enough to survive.

Got a new job in a call center, which I only did for a month before quitting. Every single day that month I had severe headaches and could hardly concentrate; i thought the whole time while at work ""why am I doing this?"". Going to the doctor was no option for me from my past experience so I quit after a month. And with the day of the termination of the job, the headaches have disappeared.

I decided to take a few months off with my savings now (without an income) since I don't know what to do anymore. Somehow I dont care much about money or a job, mostly giving the money I earned to charitys to help abuse victims. **If I had to decide between a job which causes me pain and unemplyoment benefits without pain I would always choose the latter though.**",False,oatpgf,Kusul,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oatpgf/working_is_pain_gonna_take_a_break_now/,1,1

116,"Opinion: Older generations simply don't understand how much work affects your mental health and the type of work we do today is nothing like what was available 20,30,40,50 years ago.","I'm 24, nearly 25 in a couple of months and I'm literally at the worst point in my life when I'm being told by everyone 'your 20's are the best years of your life enjoy 'em while you can'. 

No one payed attention to me during school, college or work. I was being abused at home daily and didn't even know, just taking it to be the norm and coming from a family that has 0 communication, made me talk and open up to no one even to this day.

No one knows what's really happened to me, no one knows how deep the past 20 years of my life has been affecting me, my first visual memory of my parents I can still remember is them fighting with my 4 year old brother in the middle being tossed around. We were underfed, unclothed, unclean and had to support ourselves from a very young age, stealing food and money to get by and fit in with friends and peers to appear normal.

There were times that I would try and open up and explain just how I'm feeling inside, which is nothing. I feel empty and unmotivated and lacking any sense of self worth. My parents, school, college all knew I have various degrees of mental difficultly but no one really wanted to help. A family that's disconnected, a history of violence, a Christian school that I don't remember once even mentioning mental health through the 5 years I was there and an underfunded college treating adults like children still, put your hand up to go to the toilet! Put your phone in a box at the start of class! Like I'm 18 fucking years old when will this stop?

I was then told at the ripe age of 'adulthood' I need to get a job or get out. I hit the age where college funding of £30 a week or whatever wasn't paid to students now, and since the child benefits stopped, I was no longer 'paying my way'. I dropped college, left home, moved in with someone that turned into a 4 year relationship of lies, cheating and a whole other slurry of issues, and worked my ass off trying to earn money to get by. 

I had no one showing me what to do growing up. All I had was boomers spewing capitalist nonsense and everyone everywhere telling me work will sort me out. TV shows? Throws themselves into work and fixes every life problem. I'd grown up on the idea that work leads to a better life, so I did.

I took any work I could get, just proud to go out and earn. I started cleaning at a cinema chain which I loved as growing up in a dirty household led to many OCD issues as well! I was getting up at 4am and going to work, cleaning doing my thing and would be home by 12pm having the time of my life, feeling shit but feeling motivated. Then I got into retail. Fucked me up ever since. I was used by management, had no mental health support, quit education and never dealt with any of my childhood issues. They told me I didn't matter and was replaceable within a week, that I should be lucky to have a job as it 'wasn't so easy back in the day'. 

They think now we can sit on our arse through education and university, get a degree and a high paying job without lifting a finger while they all cry about coal mines and factories and landlines. I'm sorry I was born into a generation of technology and things are different but it wasn't our generation that built what we have today or asked for it in the first place! Were used as punching bags for the failure our families before have caused and as we're just newer extensions of them we should be able to have the same capacity they did when the world has changed completely.

Boomers posting about how we don't work hard anymore, we play on our phones and videos games, and sit of social media all day gossiping. We watch Netflix instead of the stock market and we watch YouTube instead of reading scientific publications. They make us feel like we're worthless and unuseful from the start so we keep turning the cogs with low paying, unmotivating and grueling work, not telling us about their failures and how they did pretty much every we did but we're a mistake where they are a lesson. You worked physically for 8 hours a day or pushed papers, walked into work as demand wasn't so much higher than supply, any overtime or extra work that was done was for your personal benefit and success, where our extra work and overtime is another £21 in the wage with 40% taken off and being screamed at on the phone/in person by entitled Karen's and Ian's. 

Were treated like slaves and told differently because we now have 'basic human rights'. I don't have a basic right to any land or property, I don't have basic human rights to water as I need a property to get the water, I don't have access to the healthcare I so desperately need, I don't have access to any work that will get me out of a horrendous situation because of a situation I had no control over. There are thousands of homeless people literally entitled to nothing and people walk by everyday without a care in the world. 

Our world is at a fine breaking point where a while generation is just going to be taken down by mental health, suicide, self harm, A&amp;E admissions, hotlines, charities are all on the brink unable to cope with the huge demand of all walks of life and ages being treated so unworthy and inhumane. There's so much evil in the world hidden behind a silver veil that is soon going to fall when the generations running no longer can. No one lives forever, and the horrors will be revealed very shortly. Seeing nearly 3 generations banding together saying 'this world isn't right this isn't what a perfect life we need change' is the only thing keeping me going right now, and I'm sure it's the same for a lot of others.

117,Had an interesting day today.,"I don't align with EVERYTHING in this sub, but I get most of it, I really do. I do understand that there's a lot of our work ways that need to be changed. I've worked in the same mechanic shop through the pandemic, we never once stopped, never got hazard pay, none of that.

Long story short, I've heard my boss say multiple times ""That's the way we've done it for 75years, we're not gonna change it to suit you."" this has ALWAYS irked me when he's said it.

I recently went from flat rate to hourly pay. For those that don't know, flat rate means I get paid by a fixed time per job. If I can get it done faster great, I make more money. I've had 80+ hr weeks while only working 40. But ran into the issue of getting fed up with them wasting my time demanding I'm in the shop open to close even when we were slow. I make less now, but they pay me to waste my time, or send me home so they don't pay for me doing nothing. 

Got into it with the boss today about a repair that can be done MANY ways, but because I didn't do it ""the way they have done it for 75 years"" I was wrong. Got pulled into the office and got told to go home before my attitude got me fired. Dared him to fire me on the spot, no go. Just got sent home.... I really hate anal retentive managers...

I am not advancing past 12.5 hours a week right now. In fact, I received slightly more in my first two weeks. I cannot afford to live like this, I barely have any money.

158,in bad country there are shortages,"New Work (CNN Business) — When tens of millions of Americans hit the road this holiday weekend,
they're going to find the highest prices for gasoline in nearly seven years. But many will also find
‘stations that don't have any gas at all.

The national average price for a gallon of regular stands at $3.10, the highest since October
2014. The average is up just 2% since Memorial May, but 42% from a year ago, when anaemic
restrictions brought demand to a near halt and sent oil and gas prices plunging.

But stations running dry has nothing to do with the price — or even the supply — of gasoline. It's
the shortage of tank truck drivers coupled with rising demand that is causing supply chain
bottlenecks and shortage. Experts say a growing number of stations are reporting that they are
simply not able to get gas delivered — at any price.

Right now the outrages are scattered across the country, said Tom Flora, global head of energy
analysis for the Oil Price Information Service, which tracks prices for AAA. He said there have
been outrages reported in the Pacific Northwest, Northern California, Colorado and low. There
are also outrages reported in Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio, said Patrick DeHaan,

164,Anyone want to join me to quit my horrible job?,"I have this idea, so how do web developers work?

Their boss finds clients, boss gives work to web developer, web developer makes the website, web developed gives website to boss, boss gives website to client, client pays boss, boss pays web developer.

Where I live, websites can go as high as the web developer's monthly salary, mind you that a website takes around 2 days.(I am talking about websites made with wordpress, it's my field)

So every 2 days, the boss makes what a single developer makes in a whole month, and mind you that the boss doesn't have only one client and one web developer, they have many! And all these web developers work simultaneously for the respective clients!

If i can only find my own clients, I can make a fortune, all i need is like 1website per week, that's like 2 days work per week, 8 days per month and i'll make four times what i am making now!!!

So i am writing here to find someone who is able to find clients, i mean many people want to make websites! I can make the website and then split 50/50 everything, all you have to do is find clients, that's it!

Hard work pays what? Sure, some cash, but you've lost out on some time and health.

I'm tired of capitalism. The name even shows, it's all focused on someone's ""capital"" while commun-ism, regardless of how its been instilled in history, is at its core focused in ""community"".

So yeah, I'd rather be broke, poor, and be perceived as a slacker than give in to that game. I don't want to be a pawn laboror helping to line a billionaires pocket.

After sitting for roughly three minutes while actively watching the machine and having nothing to do a supervisor walked up and said “We don’t sit here, work on other things if you’re caught up” and when I explained that I had finished everything I could think to do she said “There’s cleaning supplies over there, if you have time to THINK of sitting you have time to clean!”",False,oa1a7n,Lawboithegreat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oa1a7n/we_dont_sit_here/,12,1

199,Some good news! And some advice needed.,"Hey all!
Since my last post, my job has FINALLY reallocated the phones in such a way that I am, in theory, no longer required to be tethered to the headset. I get maybe 1 call a day now.
I've figured out that I can get enough work done to be in the second top tier(and intend to stay there), in about 2 hours or so. Now that I've got that all set up, I've noticed another hitch in trying to step away from the computer. The screen auto-sleeps and then locks every 15 minutes. I don't want to have to keep running back to the computer every 15 minutes as that defeats literally the entire purpose of trying to reclaim my time. 
I cannot change the settings, I cannot open YouTube nor download any mouse movement things.
What can I do to keep the computer awake? (I've searched the whole house to try the analog watch trick and of course I don't have one, and something on the ctrl key doesn't work). I'm so close to having almost my whole days to myself and I'm going nuts trying to find a way over this last hurdle.",False,oa9tc5,Hannibal5545,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oa9tc5/some_good_news_and_some_advice_needed/,11,1

210,how should i call off work,"So, this weekend my friends are having a huge party at their lake house for 4th of july. my roommate and myself work together at a bar where we are both scheduled to work friday/saturday from 3-12/1am however all of our friends are going down on thursday morning so we will have to miss 3 days of the trip. two days ago i felt super sick and thought i had covid (despite being vaccinated and previously diagnosed with covid) so i got a test and it was negative, turns out it was just sinus infection. i am trying to figure out the best way to call off this weekend so i thought i could just tell my boss i was diagnosed with covid and then my roommate could get off too since she lives with me BUT my boss turns out to be my mothers best friend who i’ve known my entire life. to set more context the bar is an outdoor bar and is only open when the weather is nice and closes for rain however the past 2 weekends stayed open even though it rained. my boss calls people off almost every night as well because there are always too many people scheduled but due to the fact that my boss is like a second mother to me, she never calls of me or my roommate bc she doesn’t want it to come across as favoritism. she also has previously told me that we (my roommate and myself) will not be called of from her unless her boss says to. i really don’t want to miss 3 out of the 4 days of our mini vacation we have taken every year for the past 4 years. we have been looking forward to it since the moment we left last year! should i go through with the lie of having covid or be honest with my boss and ask for the weekend off even though it’s a mandatory weekend with no call offs and risk her saying no. i don’t know what to do give me advice!!!!!!",False,oa14yz,ChampionshipShoddy28,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oa14yz/how_should_i_call_off_work/,5,1
211,What is happening?,"  

Is anyone tired of not being paid their worth? I graduated and worked myself to the absolute bone to be the best in computer science. I got my first job at a fortune 25 company and I am basically monkey that no longer codes. I am constantly barraged with after hours calls and emails. I maintain a major system of distribution that maintains the company yet none of it is difficult. I work 10 hours a week while pretending to work 45-50. I've come to realize all the hard work I've put in is pointless. I've seen nepotism push people who know zero go on to make 3-10x my salary. With productivity decoupling from pay since the 70's it’s clear my work has no value. I personally consider it corporate welfare. I pretend to work, and they pretend to pay me. Statistics show in real purchasing power the generations before me made 3x as much presumably doing 33% of the work. I cannot afford a home. I cannot afford a family and yet I must smile. I must go to work acting as if it is a good thing to be ""busy"" yet even if I were to make myself busy I would reap NONE of the benefits and follow NONE of my passions. I cannot fathom the absolute euphoria the generations that proceeded me must have felt (unknowingly). I understand not everyone has the same opportunity and even regardless of the generational differences we all for the most part should feel scammed. I am so tired of pretending that all my hard work was worth living in a box alone scrimping pennies to save for a retirement that continuously gets pushed further and further out with each passing generation. Why is it in real purchasing power generations before me made 3x as much. Why does 40% of my salary go to RENT when generations before me spent &lt;10%. Everyone thinks because we live in the age of advanced technology were blessed. We live in an age where automation is RIGHT around the corner. The Jones Act destroying national commerce for the benefit of one singular big business via lobbying(bribery). Why do we live in an age where this is acceptable? Why are people so HEAVILY indoctrinated to believe we are a country for the people? It is clear lobbying is to keep corporatism in the forefront of all governmental progress because it boosts GDP. Look at every nation outside the US, the party is quickly coming to an end. Every single generation borrows from the success of the next one. Look at the diminishing returns on generational wealth amongst boomers,millennials,zooomers and tell me we aren't flat lining in prosperity. How long can this torment go on where corporate welfare continues to make useless jobs out of explosive productivity pay less and less? Why is it that things get harder every generation yet when critical thinking says it should be the opposite? We live in a post scarcity society and yet we have zero autonomy. I was excited that the pandemic gave individual autonomy to work from home yet big business wants to hold us down to protect their bottom line, god forbid we didn't have to pretend to work. Why is it that me sitting in a cubicle doing nothing makes more than the average tradesman in my city? Why is it that time and time again we see movements to in-fight rather than form a front against what is this corporate slavery. I do not understand why human productivity skyrockets and yet we are stunted by greed. What giant is behind the curtain utilizing us as cattle? What happened to the days where people were not worked 24 hours a day without due compensation? I constantly see so much infighting distract us from what really matters. Has nobody thought about the fact that all of the world’s major guidelines are utilized to keep the poor, poor? Everyone thinks platforms such as RobinHood are some form of an escape from the working class yet 99% of traders fail? Why is it that individuals EN MASS are throwing their life savings at IOU's on a coupon for a dog coin? We are so desperate as a society to escape the chains that bind us that we forget most fail by design. Look at the statistics and the whole market shut down over GME? YOU are a vehicle to be taxed by the government and YOU enter into a casino unknowingly to change your life while 99.9% fail thinking you'll be the exception? All of these structures are in place to separate the haves from the have not's and 99.9 percent of everyone reading this will be able to agree in some case. Do you not want freedom? Why has everything become so unattainable in real terms? Why is the success of one generation extracted from the next? How is it that we statistically as the 99% become so abysmally poor? Look at the FED statistics and who owns 50% of all assets, the 99% have PLUMMETED and we are siphoned ever more through every catastrophe. When will it end? Once everything is mostly automated and corporate welfare willingly comes to an end due to a mass influx of population what is left?

218,"I wish I could work from home and never have to leave the house, but hard to do living with parents.","I’m sick of fucking retail/grocery, and being written up for stupid shit like “not greeting customers by the script”.

My dad criticized me for every little goddamn thing growing up, I don’t need to be treated that way at 25 fucking years old!

Working for these corporations, is just not true independence, especially when even fulltime hours is less than a basic living income.

And of course I had to be born with medical conditions, locked in a facility and forced to take medications at 16, and just recently learn how serious and debilitating withdraw can be, and without health insurance these medications cost hundreds of dollars a month. I wish I at least didn’t need medications, so I wouldn’t have such an urgent need to work for health insurance at least. Although a fulltime job of some sort would still be neccessary to afford the cost of living ANYWHERE IN THE US.

I wish I could be self-employed, and make a decent living right off the bat, no stupid BS surveys that pay a few cents or a dollar here and there, $1,000 a year isn’t enough to survive FFS. But neither is $20,000 a year even.

And I’m just sick of being around people all the time, I AM NOT AND NEVER HAVE BEEN ON THE SAME SOCIAL LEVEL AS MOST PEOPLE!!!!!!! I PROBABLY NEVER WILL BE!!!!!

I HATE SOCIETY! Forced to be even more miserable than I already was, and not even fairly compensated for all this BULLSHIT!!!!

I wish I had a million dollar idea, or that my brain had been able to process advanced math concepts like math and geometry so I could learn to code and program, BEHIND A COMPUTER, IN MY OWN HOME, AND MOST PREFERABLY AS MY OWN BOSS WITH MY OWN HOURS!!!!!!

I’m sick of this fast paced work culture, and having to be “the best of the best” for even the shittiest of jobs.

I’m sick of being and feeling like a victim, I want to fight back, but I don’t want to end up in prison and/or eternally shamed on YouTube. 

I don’t want to be homeless either, if I end up homeless, I’ll officially have literally nothing to live and work for, no reason to fight for survival, and nothing left to lose.

I was born different, in a way that has harmed my development by preventing me from having normal and healthy experiences. But I’m not supposed to care about missing out on my youth, I’m supposed to ignore it and get over it, because I’m 25 now, screw my youth, I missed out on it, it’s a joke! HAHA!!!!! That’s nothing important!!!!!!!! 

I feel like such a goddamn idiot for failing, especially when I’m told that I was a genuinely hard worker, because that means I must have a learning or intellectual disability or something.

I don’t belong in society, but I don’t even like your chaotic society! It was broken long before THE VIRUS!!!!!!!

To be told that we don’t even deserve medical help if we can’t compete in the job market for the health insurance to pay for it, or maybe we can get on disability, but then we’re unworthy of dignity and deserve to be controlled like Britney Spears, or simply in jeopardy of losing benefits if we do get a job or more hours, even a disability income can be less than minimum wage fulltime (which is already less than a living wage)!

Minimum wage is pointless. Minimum wage paying jobs are overwhelmingly meaningless. At-will employment enables discrimination that is too hard to prove, especially with the corporations having the best lawyers available.

I didn’t expect this to turn into a rant and criticism on modern society, but here we are.

I’m socially doomed anyway, I was born that way. Romantic and sexual prospects with women? I’m a guy who doesn’t even deserve the right to have such desires. I lack the stability (financial and mental) to be in a serious relationship anyway.

Small places that are more “peaceful”, tend to consist of a tight-nit, rude-ass gossiping reputation ruining community, and those places lack a lot of resources, sometimes even internet access that’s fast and stable enough for work from home jobs.

223,"There Is No Such Thing As ""Lazy""","I think its time for us as a society to get rid of the word ""lazy"" or any related vocabulary with the same concept. 

What makes you not do something? The feeling of being blocked. This can be for many reasons, like lack of physical or emotional energy, lack of enthusiasm (motivation), anxiety or fear, mental illness, physical incapabilities and others. 

The word ""lazy"" comes prepackaged with shame, and shame hurts us psychologically, causing us to blame ourselves for the lack of progression. This word turns us away from the real answers of the source. So lets call being ""lazy"", being ""blocked"" instead. 

For example, you work 40 hours, 5 days a week, and can't keep up with house chores. Sure, on the surface, you have enough time to clean while not working, but you don't, because of feeling blocked.  What is causing this feeling? I don't personally believe anybody wants to live in a messy household, so its most likely the absence of emotional or physical energy. Why are you feeling drained? Probably emotional and physical stress of working. So why is it that we come home tired, and not do the dishes? You aren't ""lazy"" for working, and not being able to keep everything else up.

The same goes for the rich, they aren't being ""lazy"" about helping society getting better, or doing any internal work to change, they just straight up don't do that, because they don't want to. They are sociopaths who actively avoid any betterment of society. They are exploitative. We need to start calling things as they really are. 


We all come prepackaged with different energy levels, that change due to circumstance. The work culture in this society wants us to internalize that we are either achievers or lazy, nothing in between, and that is simply not the truth. We are organisms just trying to get by with what we can. 

I'd really like to hear everyone else's opinions on this, and help me expand this thought more. Also, if you think any other word is just false, and just product of this exploitative society to shame us, please comment.",False,oacoz4,Automatic-Wing-6581,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oacoz4/there_is_no_such_thing_as_lazy/,66,1

I thought, ""There are so many things that I *could* be doing right now, but I am enjoying myself just *being*.""

In our day to day lives, particularly if we are employed, so much of our time is spent doing things for other people. Even in those moments before and after work we tend to be clock-watching and mindful of time passing. Before work, you're monitoring how much time you have left to enjoy your pre-work rituals; after work, you're monitoring how much ""free time"" you have to enjoy yourself before needing to go to bed so you can repeat the process the next morning.

""We live in a society..."" that is inclined to encourage us to be busy with something, even in our downtime. Feeling productive, for many of us, is an achievement and lends us a temporary rush of serotonin. So if we continue to be productive, we will continue to feel some form of fulfillment. This is how many people live. This is how I lived for most of my life up until recently.

If you are employed as I am, what are your **days off** for? Many will answer, ""For *doing* the things that you *don't have time* to do on a workday."" They aren't wrong - who is going to do the grocery shopping and clean around the house? These hideous tasks are a reality we all face. However, we can do these things in a relatively small amount of time.

So, what happens with the rest of your free time? Some have hobbies or similar to occupy themselves with, alot of us don't. So, what do *we* do?

I choose to do whatever is making me happy at any given moment. For the last couple of hours, it has been browsing Reddit, snuggled up in a blanket with coffee and vape on hand. This has enabled a slither of creativity, so I thought I would spend some more time thinking up and creating this post. Why not? When do I have the time and mind to create, otherwise?

Allow yourself to simply *exist* for a while, at least once a week. You **don't** always have to be doing something. Who knows what will happen if you indulge in some downtime? Priorities could change, something that seemed so urgent and important could suddenly become pointless busy-work. If you have made it this far in, thank you for reading and you've already treated yourself to some ""me time"". Why stop now? Have a while longer and enjoy the serenity.  

Have a fantastic week ahead, fellow Redditors and remember - nothing is so important to allow it to take away your quality of life. Spread peace and love by minding your own business.",False,oa0l1q,N-K-91,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oa0l1q/dont_let_anyone_make_you_feel_bad_for_doing/,23,1

Property, whether private or communal, separates the individual from the world, creating a situation in which, rather than simply taking what one wants or needs, one is supposed to ask permission, a permission generally only granted in the form of economic exchange. In this way, different levels of poverty are guaranteed to everyone, even the rich, because under the rule of social property what one is not permitted to have far exceeds what one is permitted to have. The domination of survival over life is maintained.
 
Those of us who desire to create our lives as our own recognize that this domination, so essential to the maintenance of society, is an enemy we must attack and destroy. With this understanding, theft and squatting can take on significance as part of an insurgent life project. Welfare scamming, eating at charity feeds, dumpster diving and begging may allow one to survive without a regular job, but they do not in any way attack the economy; they are within the economy. Theft and squatting are also often merely survival tactics. Squatters who demand the “right to a home” or try to legalize their squats, thieves who work their “jobs” like any other worker, only in order to accumulate more worthless commodities — these people have no interest in destroying the economy...they merely want a fair share of its goods. But those who squat and steal as part of an insurgent life, do so in defiance of the logic of economic property. Refusing to accept the scarcity imposed by this logic or to bow to the demands of a world they did not create, such insurgents take what they desire without asking anyone’s permission whenever the possibility arises. In this defiance of society’s economic rule, one takes back the abundance of the world as one’s own — and this is an act of insurrection. In order to maintain social control, the lives of individuals have to be stolen away. In their place, we received economic survival, the tedious existence of work and pay. We cannot buy our lives back, nor can we beg them back. Our lives will only be our own when we steal them back — and that means taking what we want without asking permission.

234,Technology and Class Struggle,"The developments in technology over the past sixty years — the nuclear industry, cybernetics and related information techniques, biotechnology and genetic engineering — have produced fundamental changes in the social terrain. The methods of exploitation and domination have changed, and for this reason old ideas about the nature of class and class struggle are not adequate for understanding the present situation. The workerism of the marxists and syndicalists can no longer even be imagined to offer anything useful in developing a revolutionary practise. But simply rejecting the concept of class is not a useful response to this situation either, because in so doing one loses an essential tool for understanding the present reality and how to attack it.
 
Exploitation not only continues, but has *intensified* sharply in the wake of the new technology. Cybernetics has permitted the decentralization of production, spreading small units of production across the social terrain. Automation has drastically reduced the number of production workers necessary for any particular manufacturing process. Cybernetics further creates methods for making money without producing anything real, thus allowing capital to expand itself without the expense of labor.
 
Furthermore, the new technology demands a specialized knowledge that is not available for most people. This knowledge has come to be the real wealth of the ruling class in the present era. Under the old industrial system, one could look at class struggle as the struggle between workers and owners over the means of production. This no longer makes sense. As the new technology advances, the exploited find themselves driven into increasingly precarious positions. The old life-long skilled factory position has been replaced by day labor, service sector jobs, temporary work, unemployment, the black market, illegality, homelessness and prison. This precariousness guarantees that the wall created by the new technology between the exploiters and the exploited remains unbreachable.
 
But the nature of the technology itself places it beyond the reach of the exploited. Earlier industrial development had as its primary focus the invention of techniques for the mass manufacturing of standardized goods at low cost for high profit. These new technological developments are not so much aimed at the manufacturing of goods as at the development of means for increasingly thorough and widespread social control and for freeing profit from production. The nuclear industry requires not only specialized knowledge, but also high levels of security that place its development squarely under the control of the state and lead to a military structuring in keeping with its extreme usefulness to the military. Cybernetic technology’s ability to process, record, gather and send information nearly instantaneously serves the needs of the state to document and monitor its subjects as well as its need to reduce the real knowledge of those it rules to bits of information-data-hoping, thus, to reduce the real capabilities for understanding of the exploited. Biotechnology gives the state and capital control over the most fundamental processes of life itself — allowing them to decide what sort of plants, animals and — in time — even human beings can exist.
 
Because these technologies require specialized knowledge and are developed for the purpose of increasing the control of the masters over the rest of humanity even in our daily lives, the exploited class can now best be understood as those excluded from this specialized knowledge and thus from real participation in the functioning of power. The master class is, thus, made up of those included in participation in the functioning of power and the real use of the specialized technological knowledge. Of course these are processes in course, and the borderlines between the included and excluded can, in some cases, be elusive as increasing numbers of people are proletarianized — losing whatever decision-making power over their own conditions of existence they may have had.
 
It is important to point out that although these new technologies are intended to give the masters control over the excluded and over the material wealth of the earth, they are themselves beyond any human beings control. Their vastness and the specialization they require combine with the unpredictability of the materials they act upon atomic and sub-atomic particles, light waves, genes and chromosomes, etc. — to guarantee that no single human being can actually understand completely how they work. This adds a technological aspect to the already existing economic precariousness that most of us suffer from. However, this threat of technological disaster beyond any one’s control also serves power in controlling the exploited — the fear of more Chernobyls, genetically engineered monsters or escaped laboratory — made diseases and the like move people to accept the rule of so-called experts who have proven their own limits over and over again. Furthermore, the state — that is responsible for every one of these technological developments through its military — is able to present itself as a check against rampant corporate “abuse” of this technology.
 
So this monstrous, lumbering, uncontrollable juggernaut serves the exploiters very well in maintaining their control over the rest of the population. And what need have they to worry about the possible disasters when their wealth and power has most certainly provided them with contingency plans for their own protection? Thus, the new technology and the new conditions of exclusion and precariousness it imposes on the exploited undermine the old dream of expropriation of the means of production. This technology — controlling and out of control — cannot serve any truly human purpose and has no place in the development of a world of individuals free to create their lives as they desire. So the illusory utopias of the syndicalists and marxists are of no use to us now. But were they ever? The new technological developments specifically center around control, but all industrial development has taken the necessity of controlling the exploited into account. The factory was created in order to bring producers under one roof to better regulate their activities; the production line mechanized this regulation; every new technological advance in the workings of the factory brought the time and motions of the worker further under control. Thus, the idea that workers could liberate themselves by taking over the means of production has always been a delusion. It was an understandable delusion when technological processes had the manufacture of goods as their primary aim.
 
Now that their primary aim is so clearly social control, the nature of our real struggle should be clear: the destruction of all systems of control — thus of the state, capital and their technological system, the end of our proletarianized condition and the creation of ourselves as free individuals capable of determining how we will live ourselves. Against this technology our best weapon is that which the exploited have used since the beginning of the industrial era: sabotage.

Since we met, we never saw each other enough. And I graduated and struggled with my jobs, because the frustrations of our relationship ruined my health.

We broke up several times. Yet, in 2019, he called me and said he regretted having put work first and that he wanted to marry me and have a family.

Yet the months after I still felt so alone, him  giving exams at his uni, me struggling to make some money. All while he has no care in the world when it comes to money. Let's just say he can afford to invest in stocks for six figures.

Meanwhile all I wanted so badly was becoming a mother, a wife, and having a little family with him. I love him so much.

Us being together would be perfect. He can finally have a family and won't die alone, and he has his friend back, because we always had a great time together (when the anxiety of our few time together didn't make me go insane...). I finally get some peace of mine knowing that we have enough money and can do any job in peace, whether full time, part time, stay at home mom, or volunteer. 

It's a win win and since my ex recently wrote me long emails feeling desperate about his burnout and how badly one of the unis treat him, I see this as my final and biggest chance to convince him to drop one of these unis, make more time, and get married.

251,Against the unfulfilling nature of work,"
I’m not against work. Work is energy moving, getting up, stretching, attending to the people who need you, the animals, your own body, your food, your life. Life is work. Life is suffering. 

I’m not against work. What I’m against is the unfulfilling nature of work. As I see it, this is how America literally operates: Wake up every day, go to school for 5 days a week, 8 hours a day EVERY DAY (except summers) until you graduate. If you question this, you get told by your parents that you would be taken away from your family if you didn’t attend school. Ok. So far so good. I’m not complaining yet. 

That’s all fine and good because maybe some parents don’t actually raise their children well, right? They SHOULD all be indoctrinated. Idk. Anyway, that’s the way it is. NEXT, upon graduation from school, you are EXPECTED by the ENTIRE WORLD to continue the rigorous schedule that you’ve waited your ENTIRE childhood to upend, and VOLUNTARILY continue wasting your time away until you are SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD. 

And in my view, it is an utter waste of time, and life. It has no positive impact on the planet whether 80% of us are working, or 4% of us. In other words, it is *plain to see* that what is happening in America looks like this: If you don’t prove that you have the social skills to mostly “seduce” the bosses (who hold the money from you), you don’t deserve to be given any money, therefore you don’t deserve to eat to remain alive. 

I’m sorry. I cannot see it in any other light. This is the exact truth to me and I don’t know how you can change my mind. (Also, come at me for using the word seduce. That’s what you have to do to get a job, pretend like you enjoy it, and you have to MEAN IT).

Food comes out of dirt, money is printed on cotton that grows from dirt, and the rich are clearly only in existence because they are riding on the backs of the poor. If you’d like to argue with that (factual) statement, please start by telling me why, then, is money barred off from people like us, who have tried their hardest to make the world and our personal lives as good as we can, yet have been given nothing in return but a promise of the American dream? 

What is the moral reason to bar money off from us? There clearly isn’t one. Universal basic income is a necessity and should be a basic human right.",False,oa9vly,blackandwhiteenvelop,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oa9vly/against_the_unfulfilling_nature_of_work/,6,1

268,I quit today,"Pardon the formatting and the rant.
I’ve been going back and forth about quitting my job since mid april. I was being trained for my new job and about two months in they switched trainers. Shouldn’t be a big deal right? Wrong. We went from having the sweetest lady as our training, to having an insecure narcissist who mostly just bullied us. My training classes started out with 13 people and with my departure there are 6 left. Everyone started dropping like flies when this rancid douch took over.
The final straw for me was a “coaching” session, the day i got back from vacation. They spent 40 minutes ripping apart a call i took the day before i left for vacation. No sugar coating, no constructive criticism, no compliment sandwhiches. Just “now why did you do this thing wrong?” For 40 minutes. That same day i took 47 other calls, i consistently get good surveys from customer, my handle time is good. I’m over all good at my job. But all they wanted to do was tear me down. I recognize that by many measuures my job is far from the worst and to begin with i’m in a fairly privileged position. But i just can’t tolerate managetment that gets off on spying on you then gleefully playing a “gotcha” card when you spend 30 seconds longer than you “should” between customers. I’m not going to put up with shit like that. I start school to be a therapist soon, here’s hoping that being able to really help people will be fulfilling enough to “earn” a living at it.",False,o9rqba,bodienne,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o9rqba/i_quit_today/,7,1

287,The True Manager Mentality (Personal Story),"Just something I've wanted to get off my chest for a very long time. I'm honestly not sure if I should say which company I am referring to, but I would rather not get in any trouble, if possible. 

I worked for a very wealthy and powerful retail market for about 2 years all together. In that time, I worked myself up from seasonal to full time and had earned a lot of respect from my managers and coworkers, alike. I've always been a respectful listener and not much of a talker, so I guess people feel comfortable enough around me to tell me things I shouldn't hear. Wellll....

Besides the fact that the store manager has his favorite saying ""If you don't want to work here, you can work at McDonalds"" which everyone heard on a regular basis after being told to skip, or take a half lunch, to stay late everyday of the week just to cut hard earned OT out of their paycheck on Friday, etc. Goodness, we all know how shitty they can be. I remember one day, one of the managers that liked/respected me told me something that made me sick to my stomach. It's not like I didn't already know the truth, but just hearing it from the snakes mouth made me quiver. I remember he looked over at me and said, while giving that famous elbow nudge ""Just get in good with the boss, and you're untouchable.""  

\^ This is corporate America. Hard work does not pay, having friends in higher places does. Considering I know the juicy fact that the store manager has a nice psychology degree, and he didn't get store manager position with hard work.

330,"I might actually like ""work"" (at least in theory) but I definitely hate jobs","I’ve been struggling to reconcile the fact that I rail against “work-worship” (and that this is my fave reddit ever) yet consider myself a “hard worker,” and not entirely begrudgingly.  Yes, part of that comes from being conditioned to be a workaholic, something I’m working hard to reverse.  But often, I do genuinely like working.

I tend to define work as anything that makes a change in your environment, internal or external.  Digging a hole is work, as is reading a book (since you know things you didn’t know before reading it). Being paid or not doesn’t factor into this definition. Many things you do for fun would count, and that’s the sense in which I’m happy to “work hard”…if I’m enthused about something, I’m willing to put a lot of effort and time into it.

***What many of us usually think of when we think of “work” (you’re paid for it, it sucks, etc.) I would define more strictly under the term “job”***

I’d define a “job” as an arrangement between people around one doing work for another. Almost by definition, jobs are paid, most often with monetary currency. 

It’s possible to be in a job that involves work you'd do for fun, but it’s much more common that the arrangement involves work no one would ever do if they didn’t need the payment to survive.

Jobs strike me as coercive by nature, and enforced through survival anxiety and, ultimately, through shame--external shame from bosses/customers, internal shame inculcated in most of us long ago.

I think the problem is that we've been taught to only value work done in the context of jobs.  

We’ve arbitrarily decided that work outside of a job arrangement is less worthy than work someone else is paying you for. For no good reason, we see gardening or writing a book on your own as less “character-building” than stocking shelves for 10 hours straight, just because the latter pays. 

Of course, by “character” I suspect most people mean being amenable to being bossed around, shunning your other needs, and otherwise being “dependable” to do a task despite any challenges or indignities.  I’m not into that type of character any more.    


Anyway, I'm still definitely down with the ""antiwork"" sentiment, but I guess if I had to nitpick, I'd define myself as more ""antijob.""",False,oabg0y,TooMuchAmerica,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oabg0y/i_might_actually_like_work_at_least_in_theory_but/,6,1

334,Yet another rejection-and the job was shit anyway,"WTF
Job posted for a month. Interviewed (Zoom) on Thursday-rejection today. Sad thing is that I only wanted the job because I’m ‘supposed to’.
Ad was misleading as fuck anyway-I love how they try to slip the ‘this is actually a shitty sales job dressed up as something else’ so you are completely confused when they ask ‘how many sales did you close at X company’. Dude I don’t know-and that’s why I’m not there anymore-another position that started as one job and turned into one I never signed up for.
I am so sick of sending out resumes, maybe getting called for a lame ass virtual interview (which is such a load of shit-how the FUCK are you supposed to read/connect with anyone on fucking zoom?) send the lying ‘thank you for taking time out of your precious schedule to ask me stupid questions that mean nothing while I pretend to be someone I’m not for 30 minutes so I can eat and have a roof over my head’ FUCK YOU and your shit job.

335,"I don't think it's normal for work to kill you this much, and I hate that you can't get a job you actually enjoy, rant time","Hello, 21F, got a list of da mental illnesses (bpd, mdd, gad, sad, cptsd, adhd) and I need someone to relate.

Work sucks ASS, that's the general cencus, but people still do it obviously. I don't understand how that's even possible, if I'm working more than 20/25 hours a week it's as if my entire being shuts down and I am only work. Before work I dread it, at work I dread it, I come home and dread it, on my days off I dread it, there's never a time I'm home from work. I even DREAM about working, I cannot escape it. I've had 4-5 jobs throughout my life and no matter how much I like the job itself of the people/management, I still feel like I'm dying. So much so that I just fantasize about ways to kms or get fired just so I don't have to work (not suicidal but damn if it don't sound like a peaceful option). So I've started this new job, 4 shifts in, and once again I feel like I'm dying. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I struggle to shower, I have no physical or mental energy to enjoy my time out of work, and even weed doesn't help me handle these feelings. I'm on stimulants and an snri and have been for a while, they work wonders and for the first time in my life I feel happy and capable and creative. But four days in and all of that has changed, I'm short tempered, I spiral easier and deeper, I can't handle any extra stress outside of work and I am always pissed off at the people I love. FOUR DAYS AND MY LIFE IS IN RUINS AGAIN. this isn't a coincidence, it's happened with every job I've had, and I've had to leave every job I had mainly due to mental health. It doesn't get better with age it gets worse.

So as far as solutions go, I'm moving down to PT instead of 40 hrs a week, and I guess I need to fix the root issue, why do I feel this way. It's because I lack motivation entirely. The idea of a great future without money issues and the opportunity to live a full life and such is not motivation enough to feel this bad everyday. Nothing is motivation enough. It hurts to much and takes to much out of me for any justification to motivate me through it. As everyone in this thread believes, the system is janked.

To survive in a life you didn't choose to be in you have to pay money, to pay money you have to work. To get a job you enjoy or a career you have to go to school, which you have to pay for, so you have to get a job. I'm in Canada, and nowadays it's a struggle to pay rent and bills and feed yourself off a FT entry level job, but I can't get any other jobs because I don't have experience, but to get experience I either need to get the job or go to school. Interviews are a facade on both sides, you go to work at the time your told, do menial tasks and even when you want to go above and beyond you're not allowed to. If there's an idiotic problem at work because of dumb rules and you think of a solution it's shut down. If there's a part of your job you do find passion for, you can't explore it because it's further than your job scope. You are allowed to be I'll only a certain amount of days and you have to get permission to do anything outside of work, you're an owned slave to someone and your life is no longer your own.

This whole problem I believe could be solved or atleast helped if I could get a job that sparks a little passion, I do not come by passion often, most times at all, so combine no passion with no motivation and a lot of mental struggle and you get someone who can't handle work. What coukd I find passion in? Anything that does with pets, or kids, someone that means I can look forward to something in my day. But once again it's impossible to get those jobs without experience or training.

So I'm here to ask 2 things. 1) does anyone else feel like working crushes your soul and ruins your life to an unbearble point no matter where you work? 2) does anyone have tips or advice in how to get a job without experience when experience is a requirement? I literally just want to walk a dog but noooooo I need three references for that, seriously fuck off.

Tldr - I'm mentally ill, the work system is horrid, I can't get a job that doesn't tear me to shreds. I need hell navigating this because no one has much of a choice on this earth and I'm dying inside, and will keep dying inside if I can't make a change.",False,o9osdg,reddit_usernaem,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o9osdg/i_dont_think_its_normal_for_work_to_kill_you_this/,8,1
336,Quit my job! Now what?,"After one too many breakdowns and suicidal thoughts on a Sunday afternoon, I grew the courage to hand in my 4 weeks' notice (too long!) and have now only got a few more weeks to go. 

I was promoted twice within a year, ended up in a really supportive and great team, my direct manager was lovely and always took the time to check in and see how we were coping with the workload, etc. 

But as always, we are promised one thing and then stretched to our limits. I am trying to figure out if it's the job I don't like, or if it's full time work that I don't like. Maybe I would feel less exhausted after a job that I enjoy or don't find as mentally draining. Maybe I just need to work part time forever. Maybe I need to go back to Uni and figure out what it is i'm meant to be doing. 

I keep doing the online quizzes that match a career to my personality but I am just so drained from my job that I just feel like work isn't what I want at all, it's so taxing to look for a job while still in a job that makes my life feel not worth living. 

My question is...where do I go from here? What has anyone else done to help with the feelings of helplessness and uncertainty about your future?",False,o9v81z,Georg1aa,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o9v81z/quit_my_job_now_what/,7,1

This comes a year after the majority of staff have been working remotely and having no loss of productivity, or profits from the companies side.

Yet the optics of having employees back, and the large empty offices spaces are forcing us to return. Regardless of the fact that everyone excelled for the past year

Obviously my friend in the dream is devastated because we're young adults without many prospects for the future, so like a typical young, ignorant city slicking former yuppie I hatch a hair brained scheme to ride a mobile home to Slab City, a squatter community in California.

Our teams and company adjusted to remote work quite nicely for an organization that was so big on having an office presence. 

This company transitioned back to the office at the height of an infection wave during the fall of 2020. I didn’t like that, so I sought a new job with remote opportunities. 

The company I transitioned to is now fully back onsite and I honestly resent the rhetoric more than the actual transition back. 

The wording of “Return to Work” communications annoy me. We aren’t returning to work. We’ve been successfully working from home for over a year. Just because you don’t have control over an hour of commuting, my lunch, and where I sit to complete my work, doesn’t mean I wasn’t working. The primary justification for the return was to increase collaboration and learning opportunities for newer staff. 

I’m a newer staff and not one person has sat me down to teach me shit since we returned to the office.

You might be committing time clock fraud!

Time clock fraud occurs whenever an employee does something while
punched in that is unrelated to work (while not on a 15 minute break).

we” -

Were are some easy-to-do tips to avoid committing time clock fraud:

© Use the restroom before you start work and before coming back from meals.

© Take sure to take off your coat/jacket, or other outer pieces before munching in.

© Take sure to secure personal items in a locked before munching in.

© Arrive early to ensure you have the time to complete any shopping or other tasks before
your schedule start time.

® Once punched in, you are on the clock and should immediately grab your equipment
and head to the sales floor.

\f 10 employees commit 10 minutes of time clock fraud a day, that’s 100
minutes a day. That’s 3,000 minutes a month which equals 50 hours of
Payroll lost.

Please remember that time clock fraud can lead to disciplinary action and
termination.

52 Saturdays a year. We are already required to work 6 of them during Christmas (Thanksgiving until New Years). That's 46 extra days of work! Based on a 5 day work week, that's 9 extra weeks of work! And 9 weeks of less personal time!

Its so fucking pointless though because they have us come in on Saturday and deliver all this shit, that on Mondays they cut over half of the routes in the building and send like 20 dudes home. Our fucking Teamsters union doesn't give two shits, so fuck them as well. A lot of drivers don't seem to care too much because money money money. Or they get sent home 3 days a week because it's so fucking slow here so their happy with overtime on saturday.

I'm ""top pay"" so I'm making pennies shy of $40/hr and I'm still in my 20s but I keep getting this feeling I just want to fucking quit and move out to a rural area in Utah/Colorado and live a simple life and be able to enjoy the outdoors. I work right outside DC, in one the of USA richest counties... I have to commute through one of the worst traffic congestions every fucking day, rent is literally absurd. All I want is a little house with a little bit of land (my neighbors house is over a stones toss away) and not have to sit in traffic 1 hour each way to do something as fucking simple as going mountain biking.

Idk what to do. Being a driver is literally the easiest job of my entire life. Even easier than working at a pizza place. But this 6 days is so mentally draining for me. There's no end in sight and it seems like everyone else dgaf about this. On top of that, I hate the area I live in so what really is the point. High cost of living will always be a thing here, traffic will never leave. I'll have to pay money everyday for ez-pass lanes... imagine paying to drive on a road... God forbid my taxes go towards anything that would directly benefit my life.

Anyways, I'm done ranting for now... It's 9am here so its time to enjoy my one day off woohoo 🥳",False,o8wsyr,SwtchbladeApocalypse,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o8wsyr/i_hate_ups/,14,1

423,Another Depressing Day in Bodyshopland,"I'm a senior software engineer in one of the crappiest European countries for engineers.

I recently started a job that involves upgrading a system that is several years old. That may sound a bit bad but it was actually a fun and learning experience... in the beginning.

Now, the way I was hired was through a bodyshop. The only thing these companies do is hire you on behalf of one of their customers, which is illegal here, but no one gives a fuck because this country is crooked to the bone. In my case the bodyshop's customer is another bodyshop whose customer is the actual company I work for. The way these bodyshops work is by charging their customers for your services, say €50k, and your salary is then a fraction of that money. 

The *actual company I work for -*the one that needs their system to be updated- is a dystopian behemoth that is owned both by many organizations. Working for this company is like being a 1984 or Kafka novel character. You work in isolation (no such thing as a team or sharing task details), and you are told to only discuss project details with your manager and to a limited extent with other employees (and only the ones hired directly by the company). 

At first, I used to speak with my manager twice a week for up to 40 minutes in total. But as the weeks went by these minutes started to decrease and I now get 15-20 minutes a week. 

I made a lot of progress on the system upgrade initially, but at some point I realized no one gives a fuck. I found out from some employees that the project is on its way to be abandoned and hasn't been funded for years. My job is only a way for corporate dossers to collect money while they watch Netflix.

First, I will say we are constantly understaffed. Like picture on a busy Saturday being the only cashier and constant long lines non stop. Also, management is constantly on your ass about selling credit cards and protection plans to customers. When you call for a managers approval it gets met with ""why are you calling me?""  kind of tones or constant sighs of annoyance that it makes you afraid to even ask for help. Managers always telling you to do multiple things at once or go to different departments or to cover lunch breaks. 

It's getting to the point where I've started looking at new jobs or just giving up completely. So I want opinions on do you think management is putting too much on me/society?

457,Slave-labour for Starbucks.,"My college sophomore year, I took a year off to work rather than start accruing tens of thousands of dollars in debt for the ""privilege"" of a undergraduate degree.

Starbucks was hiring. I applied. Starting work, I was determined not to be a ""problem"" employee.

Our manager, a computer-illiterate 63-yr-old *desperate* to retire with a full pension, was completely incapable of figuring out the software which existed to supply our store with the absolute minimum number of workers per hour to barely function.

Because of this, she sometimes accidentally staffed the store with **one** employee during the afternoon. As shocking as this may be for those who have never worked in a corporate coffee shop, one employee cannot solely cope with a frappucino-enraged metropolitan populace for an afternoon.

On one of the days when the my incompetent boss had accidentally assigned my co-worker to an hour of complete breakdown, I chose to stick around to help him. 

Well, chose is a strong word. 

After signing out and taking off my apron, I walked toward the front (the only way out of our location), and saw my coworker frantically making drinks while an angry line of customers crawled toward the door. 

I did the only thing I could. I walked to the register and started taking orders. I was furious. 

Not with my coworker. With the company. With my manager. With the whole of corporate America, taking advantage of people like my coworker, who, never expecting to get a college degree, was only hoping to one day achieve the goal of being a Starbucks manager, a goal which would (hopefully), one day, at least give him the housing and medical security he needed to survive.

I stood at the cash register, taking orders as fast as possible to try to bring the line down enough so that I could leave to go home, exhausted by the 3:00am start my day had had.

And then...she arrived. 

Our store would routinely receive visitors from ""corporate"" Starbucks, checking up with us to make sure we were following the corporate-gibberish-doublespeak we were supposed to memorizing and 'following' and 'promoting' for each 'brand-sharing' event. 

She asked me what 'roast' was being shared that day. 

I, apron-less,  only noticing that the line was *finally* dying down after her, having worked **for free** for 45 minutes at this point, flatly told her it was a Kenyan blend. 

She, bridling, raised her Karen haircut and asked me how I expected her to buy this $1.49 coffee, when I couldn't even give her the story of its origins. 

At this point, I, exhausted, realized she was one of them, from corporate headquarters. 

I wanted to cry. I was only there, working for free, apron-less, for my coworker. 

Standing behind the register, I didn't know how to tell that corporate mouthpiece that it was actually all my manager's fault.

Because my manager was just a woman desperately trying to retire with benefits that would not leave her homeless. 

And my coworker making drinks, also, just desperately wanted a a managerial position one day which would give him basic healthcare.

473,I have been voluntarily unemployed for three weeks now!,"I had a decently paying director role at my last company so I was in the position to be able to save around a third of every paycheck. I did that for about five months. I realized I would be quitting in May, four months into my employment. I worked hard, did my job very very well. I gave them two months notice (they only spent the last two weeks of it looking for my replacement so I had no chance to train them. Oh well, their fault.) 


Since leaving:
I accompanied my brother on a camping trip to Yellowstone (which was INCREDIBLE)
Visited my boyfriend's family for a week (whom I love)
Visited my hometown to see my parents
Worked out every single day. I'm in the best shape I've been in for years right now.
Read three full books. It's amazing I've been able to rediscover reading. Yesterday I read for like six hours straight. It was so nice.
Gone on night hikes with my friends and stayed up late without worrying about going to work the next day. I still get up early of my own accord and feel well rested. 
Cooked, done art, and played Age of Empires every day.


I am headed to a family reunion in two weeks
And going out to my favorite camping spot later this week


My boyfriend and I have been doing this system for the past two years where we save up and then give each other a break for a few months. He just went back to work after we spent the last three weeks together. He was happy to get back to his old job after about five months. I'm so glad we both prioritize our freedom over having jobs or endless money. Basically the only thing we spend money on is gas money (to travel), obviously bills, and food. It's a good simple life. We have very minimal responsibilities and it's great! 


My goal is not to brag but to let the community know how much my antiwork mindset has influenced these decisions. I recognize that my bf and I have the privilege of getting educations and acquiring well-paying jobs in fields we actually enjoy and this isn't possible for everyone, especially not for single people, less formally educated people, or people who may have the odds against them for other reasons. If I was single there would be a lot of stress, but it works well for us.

477,Well that whole “work life balance” thing changed fast,"I returned to my hospitality job after over a year of being furloughed due to COVID.

A big thing the company changed in that time for managers was going from 50 hour work weeks down to 40 hour work weeks. My boss specifically and compassionately said she “believes in work life balance and doesn’t expect our job to be our life.” Great. Fantastic. It made me like my job more.

Well now it’s getting busier. And they don’t want to bring back any more managers because we all know companies want to squeeze as much work out of people for as little pay as possible.

I mentioned that I would not be able to make a 3pm meeting, because I work from 6am-2pm. 8 hours. Like we were told to do. And I was basically told that I have to stay because it is “my job to support the company”. And actually “you should be working minimum 8.5 hour days with a 30 minute break.” Oh did I forget to mention that there is only 1 manager per shift (again, to save money) so a 30 minute break is impossible, and if they are going to force me to clock out, I will not be doing any work, which again, is impossible with only one manager here.

She also said something like “just because you work your 8 hours doesn’t mean you’ll be able to just leave after 8 hours everyday.” Like wtf you’ve got to be absolutely kidding me. They are just realizing that in this industry 8 hour work days are difficult to pull off when you don’t have a full staff and they are too cheap to want to pay an additional manager.",False,o9lwse,ang_17_ella,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o9lwse/well_that_whole_work_life_balance_thing_changed/,7,1

I hate the feeling of my energy and time being exploited for someone else to get rich. I hate the fact that I feel that most of the world's problems could be solved by doing away with our dehumanising capitalistic system.

I'm in consumer charity fundraising for christ sake. A job which I think is very noble as we really make a difference for a few amazing charities (among which Plan International, check them out as they do amazing work). But still I feel that in my ideal world we wouldn't need charities because in my ideal world, the world would be a more fair and more human place.

I hop jobs. I like meeting new people and learning stuff. Then, when the dust has settled, it's work again and then I go back to the aforementioned stuff: I'm contributing to a system that so goes against all of my values that I get down and a bit resentful in EVERY job. No matter how great the job is.

This is mostly just a rant, but if anyone has any tips on how to reconcile the inescapable fact that I have to participate in this system in order to have food and shelter - please do share.

Also, I realized when working that the laws protects only if you know it. Most places try to hide their rights to the workers, and even when they don't want to, they don't know what the law is. And the power hierarchy can make it Very hard to speak up.

So I “trained” Friday and Yesterday and gathered what info I could, first thing is every busser there had also applied to be a server and had been there for 3+ months and were next in line. Second is I worked two 10 hour shifts (they didn’t even tell me what time I’d get off, they kind of fumbled around the question) and nobody gets any kind of breaks or lunch breaks. All the managers did when I asked about it is pause and say “well if you want a snack you can grab chips, and if you get close to the cooks they’ll make you food.” Got off at midnight last night and was expected to show up at 10 this morning for what I assume was an even longer shift since it said opening and closing training.

523,Working in Jobs that Managers don't understand,"I have seen this so many times. My experience is mostly with technical and software jobs. It is very rare for a managers to understand what you are even doing. Most times your direct supervisor is from your field, so he or she will know what goes into these projects, but if you go up the ladder, people literally have no clue what you are actually working on and how much work it is.

So usually at some point they don't understand your work, but are the ones in the position of deciding how good you are doing. If you are really lucky your direct supervisor likes you and tries to get you a salary increase, if you are doing well. I have gotten most of my raises by switching jobs or telling them if I get more responsibility, I will only do it for more money.

On the other hand if they don't understand, you also can tell them some crap sometimes to get more time for tasks if you need work to be slowed down, but in general it is really annoying. They expect things to be done immediately that take weeks and even when you explain it to them or they force you to cut corners, which will make tasks take longer later on and then complain why these things take so long.

I've been told I can just look for another job or get therapy and I would feel a lot better. Maybe so, but for what? a few weeks? Then it's right back to wasting my life being exploited by a company I shouldn't devote my time and energy to. I can't change my mentality. I would need to be brainwashed entirely for me to feel like I want to work.

*Life has no greater purpose and that's okay*. I'm completely fine with that. I want to fill my life with things I want to do, things I want to experience. The ambition I felt when I was younger has fully dwindled away. I don't want to reach higher salaries and better work conditions. I don't want a resume. I don't want to write cover letters. I'm not business-oriented either, so I could never own a company or be my own boss, even if it's tempting. I don't have it in me.

Of course, I want to be comfortable. The job itself doesn't matter as long as I'm not feeling stressed. The thing is that working 5 days a week for 40 hours is too much. If I want a job that doesn't offer this kind of schedule, the salary needs to be much higher. With the skills I have, that's sort of impossible to find.

The conclusion is that there is no solution, at least nothing I could do on my own without big structural changes in society. That's a pill that's incredibly hard to swallow for a problem solver like me. My partner is feeling the same way, except she doesn't dread society and capitalism yet. She just thinks she's not a worker. I'm feeling hopeless, I'm not gonna lie. I thought I could manage it, but realizing day after day I can't do the things I love because I'm stuck at this stupid job is hitting harder than ever before.

537,I just quit my job and gave up a yearly salary of over 1 million USD,"Until 2 hours ago I was an overpaid blockchain protocol engineer earning $780,000 per year with an average bonus of around $500K.

Insane money, what was the catch? I had to work 100 hours+ a week, every single week. I also had 3 advisory positions with other blockchain projects which required contributions. I worked 7 days a week, mostly morning to dusk, with no time off. Any time I even suggested taking a break to my bosses, they just upped my pay to get me to continue my work. Any time something effects my work or takes even a marginal amount of time, I have to find a solution. Anxious? Pop a valium. Tired? Have a Modafinil. Can't get out of bed? Well just work in bed. Cooking taking up your time? Order Uber eats.

I pushed and pushed and pushed and I really tried to make this work for almost 5 years now. I have 2 kids under the age of 4 and I haven't see them grow up. I've lost most of my friends and I don't enjoy any of the activities I used to. I'm out of shape and I eat like shit and get winded walking around the block. My wife puts up with it because of the crazy money and being able to buy whatever we want, but I know she has been unhappy and lonely.

Today it really came to a head. It's been building all year but today I just felt so stressed I started crying and I couldn't stop crying. I'm a grown-ass 32 year old man worth millions of dollars with a beautiful wife and kids, sitting alone in his office and crying because I have nothing but work to fill my days. I started thinking about dying and my mood kept getting darker and darker. I had never felt so depressed and empty in my life. I thought about taking an overdose of something.

Then I suddenly had a thought. ""Why don't you just quit?"". It didn't even seem possible, but what was the alternative? Killing myself?

So I summoned the courage, and I wrote an email. I told my bosses my mental health is suffering too much from my job and I'm quitting. They phoned me back quickly, and offered me a pay rise. I said I couldn't and they asked me to suggest a pay rise which would keep me there.

I managed to end the call and now I'm sitting here unemployed. I'm still crying, and I still feel stressed as fuck, but I do feel like some kind of weight has been lifted from my shoulders.

I hope I made the right decision. I hope my career can recover in the future. I still have my advisory positions and I am well respected in the blockchain industry but it's not a good look to suddenly walk away from a major public project like this. But I just can't do this anymore, I can't keep telling myself that any amount of money is worth this.

No masks are worn, no social distancing and people hang of each other all night. 

Also, it's completely illegal and against covid rules in my country.

In our daily scheduling software telling us what we're working on there was a placeholder for the summer party giving everyone a day off as ""thank you for all the hard work everyone has done to keep the company thriving this past year"". They tell us literally every week how important we are, how grateful they are, and to keep safe and to look out for each other in ""this difficult time"" yada yada.

So I politely RSVP'd no to the invite as my country has just gone back into lockdown as cases are rising again (also it's illegal), and they REMOVE THE TIME OFF from our booking software and replace it with work. They've done the same for the few other people that feel the same.

They also did the same for the past parties, and after talking to a colleague about this apparently the people who are in the office (10 or so project managers) all went out for a meal and got drunk at the bar all paid for by the boss. They told everyone who was working remotely they were ""in a meeting all afternoon"".

555,Most of the jobs they have you working aren't even real work.,"Now, what happens, then, when you introduce technology into
production, you produce enormous quantities of goods by
technological methods. But at the same time you put people out of
work. You can say, “Oh, but it always creates more jobs.
There will always be more jobs.” Yes, but lots of them will be futile jobs.
They will be jobs making every kind of slippery and unnecessary
contraction, and one will also at the same time have to guile the
public into feeling that they need and want these completely
unnecessary things that aren’t even beautiful. And therefore, an
enormous amount of nonsense employment and busywork
bureaucratic and otherwise, has to be created in order to keep people
working. Because we believe, as good Protestants, that the devil finds
work for idle hands to do. But the basic principle of the whole thing
has been completely overlooked: that the purpose of the machine is
to make drudgery unnecessary. And if we don’t allow it to achieve its
purpose we live in-a constant state of self-frustration.

558,"So, this is the anti-working class version of r/NoNewNormal, huh?","Stop pretending you folks on the right actually work. You're just shills, househusbands/wives, fake disabled/crazy, who are just suckle fish on the big sharks of corporate dominance. You lot have some sort of mental disorder where you believe that if you shill or the corporations, you somehow live vicariously through their, and the GOP, successes. It doesn't work like that, just like leftists will never be a Bernie Sanders without actually political power and people caring about what they think.

I've just never seen people so hypocritical. There is no way you people are working, with as much time as you're putting into either anti-vaxxing, trolling Democratic/Black/Muslim/Atheist YouTubes, subreddits, Facebook pages. I get that a lot of you are either/and living off your parents or significant other's wealth...but start having some dignity. I get you're out on allowance by who takes care of you, but stop trying to ruin worker's quests for a living wage JUST BECAUSE you don't know what it means to have to work for a wage. It's just a pathetic thing to do, just to get some politician or talk show host to shout you out. It's like you work, tirelessly to have someone yell, ""HURRAY DEAD BEAT UNION BUSTERS!!! DESTROY THE WORKING CLASSES TRUSTFUND TOMMY!!"" 

You really can't be serious. Instead of trying to call out the unemployed, why can't you do something positive and cover the people who work multiple jobs and still can't make the rent? Maybe cover folks who are losing everything for hospital bills WHEN THEY PAID INSURANCE. Do something productive for your fellow man. You don't even have to have an opinion about what to do...because a lot more of you (not you being taken care of by other people, but people who look like you) are having the problems I've mentioned than not working. You can okay the ""Stolen Valor"" games all you want, but employed people are far too busy balancing their budgets and enjoying their financial freedom than being petty against the nonworkers. 

I'm just here to warn you that you will get nothing betraying people in the class wars, unless your family is able to take care of you until you die. Eventually, you will use up your nest eggs, and be crying for Democrats to save you.

563,Jobs and recruiters need to just post the damn hourly rate or salary in the job description and stop wasting everyone’s time,"My wife is a paralegal and recently updated her indeed information. A recruiter for a temp agency reached out to her a few days ago to fill a “legal support” position for Amazon. She looked up similar positions on glass door and didn’t find exactly what the recruiter talked about but, from what she saw she was guessing she could potentially make about $10 more an hour. This was after spending a few hours researching, debating and us talking about how it might be worth the commute (an extra hour a day total travel time ). She emailed back saying she was interested in talking about the position and received a phone interview invitation this morning. We recently had a baby and my wife is on maternity leave so she has the time available to do the interview during the day and on short notice. However, I knew she needed me to watch our daughter so I left work early so she could focus on the interview. During the phone interview I’m taking care of our daughter and I’m overhearing bits and pieces of the conversation. It sounds like the normal fake dribble you hear from recruiters and then the awkward moment of wage negotiations. I hear something about what kind of compensation my wife would want. She initially asks what is the rate they’re hiring for, after a nonsensical response from the recruiter, my wife says she’s looking for $15 more per hour in preparation to negotiate to the $10 or more mark (considering this is on track with what she researched). I didn’t hear it at the time but this lady comes back with saying that the most they could do was basically give my wife $2 more an hour. 

Obviously my wife said thanks but no thanks. It’s just so irritating that this was time, energy and my work hours wasted on this bullshit. Just post the fucking rate so we can say no right away and move on with our lives instead of wasting two days for a shitty offer. The way we believe is that we are just as good as the employer offering a job. The employer needs a job done, we both are good at what we do so, we don’t settle for pennies. A job is just a transaction, just like buying food from a restaurant. No, I don’t want to go to a restaurant to look at a menu with no prices and order something only to be charged 3 times what it’s worth. The same with a job, I don’t want to waste my time doing some interview trying to explain that I’m a valuable asset that can generate profits to only be offered what an entry level person should be making. Fuck your culture, fuck your growth, fuck your “family inclusiveness”, fuck your yearly paid lunch, just pay us a wage that reflects how essential we are to the profits made and leave us to do the job as outlined in the job description with no expectation for more. We don’t own the company, we don’t get paid to run the company so don’t expect us to act like an owner.

566,Working in sales has been... an experience,"It's almost unbelievable. I took the job becauseI needed one, and the pay was good. I'm decent at it, but I lack the drive to really push forward in this branch.

Why? Because management *expects* you to be a slimy asshat. People's boundaries, wishes and opinions mean jack if they aren't a customer. We are only here to make money, that's pretty clear. We openly discuss how to get customers into situations where we make decisions for them, use their previous words against them. It's basically just planned-out peer pressure. Our training manual literally stated that part of a well-executed sale is *creating a problem* for the customer.

I just wish my coworkers could at least be honest about it. My manager presented a strategy to me, which I politely asked if he didn't think was a bit rude to a potential customer, and he simply diverted it into us employees being caring and doing good work for offering our company's services at all.

He's a smart guy, so I almost can't believe he has deluded himself into actually thinking this way. But if it is the case, I can kind of see how. The whole business is built around making the individual employee push for the *next* sale, or the next 5, or 10, or 100, etc. It's possible he's just trying to keep selling me the job, but I would it's even more likely someone sold his job to him, and sold it good.

Corporate needs us to *care* about the process of accumulating wealth at the top, and they achieve it with commisions and trinkets. I can see how it works, giving small, pointless rewards to break up the monotony of a job that helps nobody, and does nothing besides encourage transferring of money. I definitely feel better going to work every day if the previous day went well, so I can see how people get stuck chasing the next high, but the job itself is just so *repulsive* that I definitely won't stick around.

I'll admit that it has been interesting to see how many blatantly slimy strategies actually work and are even commended in the business world from an inside perspective, and I will also admit that being a successful salesman requires skill. The skill of having no shame, and no respect for the people you meet. Even so, every day you don't get a sale, regardless of skill, is just a day of free advertising for the company.

You can bet my resignation is on the table the day after my next paycheck arrives.",False,o7zs99,bingbongthethrowaway,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o7zs99/working_in_sales_has_been_an_experience/,18,1

575,The year is 2071,"Capitalism has completed its inevitable evolution into neo-feudalism.

Earth is warmer than ever before, rising sea levels between the 2030s and 2050s caused the collapse of several countries while displacing millions. The Sahara desert is larger and the amount of global pollution is greater than ever before as environmental regulations have become a thing of the past. 

Corporations are now the rulers of the world and governments have been reduced to little more than ''mediators'' that settle power disputes between corporations.

99% of the human population owns nothing. Virtually every good and service is rent or subscription-based. The only people who legally 'own'' anything are the elites. 

If you want to have a child, you need to pay to gain the ability to *temporarily* reproduce. You also have to pay for paternity leave and when naming your child, you also have to pay for the right to use whatever name you give them, sometimes, certain names ''aren't available'' for purchase and you may have to pay extra to get them. You of course, also have to pay a yearly fee to keep your name 

If you have been in an accident, you need to pay the police to help you. Each police department sets its own prices and their treatment of you depends on how much you pay. The same applies to the Hospitals and Schools. 

If you have suffered a serious injury and are in need of some sort of cybernetic prosthetic, those are also rent-based. If you miss a payment, they simply stop working, god help you if you missed a payment on your prosthetic heart. 

There is absolutely zero privacy in the future, the corporate powers know absolutely everything you do, and the flow of information is tightly controlled.

I want to thank everyone who encouraged me from r/antiwork to quit my job. When I made my previous post, I was in a very low place. I felt ashamed that I was reaching out to random strangers for advice, given that my own mind, friends, and family, were all screaming at me to quit. 

I have always put unrealistically high expectations on myself and my behavior, which I was rewarded for at school and work. Even when the “rewards” were being vastly outweighed by my own suffering, I had trained myself value the “great jobs” and “this is excellent work” over the internal signals from my body that I was not doing well. 

I still do. I have been in therapy for over half of my life, where I was reminded over and over again that the standards I hold myself to were detrimental to my overall health. I justified my behavior by saying things like, “If I don’t have a perfect GPA no college will want me,” or “if I don’t complete my undergraduate thesis, all of this would have been for nothing and I cannot afford grad school,” or, “If I quit my job, which I know has done a shitty job with hiring people, how will I be able to live with myself knowing my residents may not be getting good care?” I have been out of school for over a year, and I now realize I have been working myself to near death to fill that void of feeling needed, or successful, in some way. I cannot look for graduate programs with the physical and mental conditions I am currently in due to my job. My job is not at all necessary for me to be successful, or to move on with my life, which is what I should really be valuing over everything else.

When I told my supervisor I needed to leave, she was understanding and empathetic. She said to me, “I wish this company had 100 of you, you care about the residents and want to actually work.” I couldn’t help but think how the company was not paying me living wages whatsoever, and I was letting them use my high achieving personality and passion to care for our residents to extract labor from me. My boss was, in a way, telling me the company needed more people sacrificing their well being for cheap.

I did not disclose the nature of why I was quitting to her, only that I was “not doing well.” I haven’t been doing well for at least 6 months, but for some reason or another I decided to put my foot down. I am ready to move on with life, wherever that means. I do not really know who I am or where I am going to go. I am looking forward to days and nights where I am not nauseous from the pain of physical labor, where I am not overthinking a decision I made regarding medication, and I am not bitter and angry from the food I denied myself as a form of control.

594,The Battle of Blair Mountain - 1925,"A lot of posts on here echo the ""Woe is me"" mentality that a lot of people (Americans especially) have when it comes to fighting for their own benefit. I'm here to say that even a fight that seems unwinnable is still worth fighting. 

My favorite example is The Battle of Blair Mountain ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle\_of\_Blair\_Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain))

Remember these brave men and women  who stood their ground in the face of almost certain death to ensure a livable wage for themselves. 

Then remember that if the federal government can't fight you face to face, they will infiltrate and legislate your brotherhood into dust.  The UMWA is still holding on, but the combination of corporate greed and the federal government's restrictions on mining (Both good ones that protect the environment, and bad ones that literally keep rural Appalachians dependent on government assistance to this day) have clipped their wings. 

Be aware that union negotiators are being bought as quickly as congressmen and the financial incentive to lead your union to agree to a contract ""Just to stay working"" is often times greater than what the union can pay them. 

The snakes will attack from all sides, but if we stand together, we won't be stopped. Even when private planes are dropping homemade bombs on people fighting just to feed their families. 

Be able to differentiate between someone working with you to achieve a common goal and someone only working with you to enhance their personal experience. 

Know that you aren't alone in feeling oppressed by the current system, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself.  Your actions will empower those around you.

I've been getting by doing doordash. I wake up, have time to workout (have lost 80 pounds), play with my dog, I work for a few hours and I'm home. It's been like living the dream to me I get to be myself again.
They changed the way the app works and it's harder to make decent money now, and frankly my car has taken a beating. So I got a job at Starbucks thinking I'll just work part time I don't wanna be a manager or working constantly like I did all through my 20s.
Its my 3rd day and I dont fucking want this. I need money though like everyone else. I tried to get a bunch of different kinds of jobs out of service industry and can't even get an interview. It makes me feel like if I'm just here to work at a store I'd rather blow my brains out. 
I'm 35, still don't know ""what I want to be"" and would rather die than spend the rest of my life busting ass for customers.

603,A Story of how I became to be antiwork.,"

I have plenty of driver related horror stories. One incident I had was when I first came to Georgia. I had some steering problems en route to atl from Florida.

Contacted dispatch and explained the issue. Was told to pull into the terminal. The mechanic there said it wasnt nothing he could do at the shop and I had to take the truck to Kentucky to the main terminal. Central Kentucky.

Reluctantly I agreed and drove there. The steering was getting worse by the mile to the point of me not having any resistance in my steering. I'm scared at this point because im driving through mountains.

Luckily I made it to Kentucky. Pulled into the garage as they popped the hood and told me to turn the steering wheel. They screamed for me to stop. I hipped out and asked what was wrong the mechanic said my gear box and steering wheel manifolds were hanging on by a cotter pin.

He said I was one of the luckiest people he's ever met because if it got worn out I would've instantly flipped the truck and killed everyone around me including myself.

The ones in Atlanta could've not only identified the problem but could've fixed it. It would've took a day or two. They refused to fix it because the load I had needed to be in Kentucky.

That load of recycled materials almost cost my life and a few hundred more.

Companies do not care about anyone. Only profit and products.

Erm... Of course I am, they're more essential than my own work and we've been classed as essential when all we sell is literally a promise of protection (but to use that protection you then need to pay for it again). I don't know about you lot, but I think that making sure the country remains fed during a global pandemic is a lot more essential to everyone than providing a financial service. 

Why is it that workers are so conditioned to think that other workers don't deserve a fair pay, and are happy to shoot down other workers cause they're so complacent with being underpaid and over worked.

 Between oppressive employers, complacent class traitor staff, and biased media it feels like the fight for change is a loosing battle, but I'm hoping that I'm wrong and one day we will all see a fairer society where we don't exchange a 3rd of our adult life's in exchange for rock bottom pay that hardly covers living expenses whilst making those who do the least richer by the second. 

It's time for a universal basic income, workers would have time to develop  skills or passions in their life to find their calling and gain meaningful employment that benefits not only them as the worker, but society as a whole. If they don't choose to work, no harm done all that spare time can be used with loved ones, or by giving back the community as there would not be any worry of meeting cost just to live. I'm sure the world would be a much happier place, with wayyy less nasty, bitter and toxic people about if this was the case.

630,The 3 things that happened before I lost my job.,"So, before the pandemic I worked as a graphic design lecturer at a private college. I had been doing this for quite a few years and I was pretty good at my job. I was more than qualified, I had a high pass rate for my students, got along well with my fellow lecturers etc. I absolutely lived lecturing, thinking it was the best path the improving graphic design in my country as I would be working with young people just getting into the industry.
Now, the 3 things that happened the week before I lost my job...

First my one work colleague quit and left to move to the UK. She was an older woman who kinda looked out for me and kinda made me feel safe their.

Second, I told the manager and the principal (2 different people) that I had been living with depression most of my life and just need help to keep my footing l. This was right after my colleague left. I didn't ask for time off, I asked to go see the company psychiatrist (who was actually a church leader working from a nearby mega church).

Last, I had to write a program evaluation where I had to go in depth with the courses we offer (specifically the ones I give) so when I wrote that we should not be teaching Adobe Animate in 2020, as it is really outdated (we claimed it was Industry Standard and used all over the country/world [for those who don't know, Adobe Animate was LITERALLY just Adobe Flash renamed]).

Education, especially Private Education, is so money hungry and driven that we as lecturers were encouraged to lie to students about the industry, and about what they needed to even get in. Like the Adobe International Certifications are mandatory to get work, which we coincidentally also offered.
One of the grossest things I ever heard (and often) was ""first most, we are a business"".
I never want to hear that, especially not when Education is involved. 

That week, I got my walking papers.
I have not been able to find stable work in my field as graphic designer or lecturer since. It's been 1.5 years now pretty much. And thank goodness that I have a caring wife who studied while I worked and is now pretty much supporting me while I do what I can.

I don't get home until almost midnight Wednesday and Saturday night. I pack my cleaning clothes in my work bag so I can change into them and immediately go to that job after I get off my main job. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was never my plan. But I feel sorry for both of my bosses who keep losing people and can't seem to hire anyone who will stay. I would feel horrible if I left with without one more worker. It would be cruel almost. My friends keep telling me to quit but I don't think I could do that to them without feeling like a horrible person. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can count more than the digits on both hands the amount of people they have hired and then left high and dry with me to pick up the slack. I actually trained someone last month for a week and then they quit a few days later. I am not looking forward to having to go through the training process again with someone new who is just going to quit a week later. It's getting ridiculous. And I have had enough.

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is I'm depressed. I feel stuck. I don't like working the hours I am working. I feel like I have no work-life balance anymore. I have anxiety and high functioning autism and just feel so burnt out and exhausted. The cleaning job is physically exhaustive and I dread having to do it after I get off from my main job. I recently lost one of my cats and I have not even had time to grieve him because I am constantly working and on the go. I have started to eat convenience junk and fast food because I never feel well enough or have time to cook a healthy meal or go grocery shopping and have started gaining weight again. I cry sometimes at night in bed because I look at the clock and know I have to get up at 7am and do it all over again. 

I cry when I think of how this is life and there is no getting out of it until I'm dead.",False,o7pv06,goingtothecircus,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o7pv06/feeling_depressed_and_working_two_understaffed/,6,1
649,Wacky theory about slow programs when working from home,I was allowed to start working from home at my new job and have been really happy about it but frustrated at how slow Citrix is. I'm not sure what it is since my internet is good and it seems like the speed of the program depends on the day but most of the time it's unbearably slow. My company allowed people to start working from home full time after the pandemic but I'm shocked at how slow and inefficient their setup has been for it and I doubt they're going to improve it. Maybe they just need to make it better or maybe they do this on purpose because they want us to get sick of working on slow systems and force us back into the office lol.

650,I no called no showed for the first time today.,"I have worked at about 15 restaurants in my cooking career and have mostly been happy. Recently I began washing dishes at a major chain restaurant in the new town I live in. I have washed dishes in the past and developed a fairly quick technique for maximizing efficiency in the dish pit. After my third shift I knew that this place wasn’t for me. I decided though to stick it out and see how it went. After meeting/working with  the other dish washers I realized that I was going to be doing most of the work. One coworker looked to be in his 60s(but drugs and alcohol  could of had some effect) and he refused to stay on task. He would help unload dish racks then walk away for 15 minutes at a time. My other co worker was a younger guy, first time in a kitchen/ dish pit and he also refused to stay on task or even take suggestions for how to do things more effectively. My last shift however was the worst experience I have ever had in a kitchen. From being on a wait almost the entire night (and dealing with the servers throwing their trash all over my dish table) to, having to essentially run the entire dish pit by myself because my team mate was “crushing boxes” for 2 hours during service; I made the executive decision to not come back.  I spent the better part of  5 hours thinking of how to leave work in that moment and only coming up with ways of hurting myself and that’s just no way to live.

662,Employers are Ones who Want Something for Nothing,"My Dad always told me that the key to being successful is acquiring skills that make you valuable to your employer. Well, I'm here to tell you that is all a bunch of horse shit. I am 36 years old, have been working since I was 15, and almost everyone of one of my employers have never compensated me for learning new skills outside of my work area. What they did was see that I could competently accomplish the new task and I was given more work to do. (Ironically the only place I worked for that had a written policy on pay increase was a McAlister's Deli that would give you a $0.25 per station.)

I have been working at a automotive conveyor plant for the last 7 years. I was hired on as a temp worker in the shipping department with no experience and was just packaging parts. Within a 4 months I was hired on and became the defacto manager because the other two people in the office quit. I was loading heavy machinery, organizing truck loads, ordering trucks, writing up international shipping paperwork and much more. After a year I told my foreman that I needed to be the official shipping manager since I was doing all of the work by myself and was only being paid $14/hr. He agreed and we had a meeting with upper management and they told me that there wasn't money in the budget and they were eliminating that position and my foreman would be absorbing that responsibility. So they fucked me and my foreman.

I was pissed and quit. I was professional and gave a 2 weeks notice and trained my replacement. I got a sales job, turns out I am not a salesman. I talked to my old foreman and he got back on as a temp worker in the mechanical assembly department making $14/hr. Guess what? I kicked ass in this department too. I learned mechanical print reading, mechanical assembly, MIG welding, basic metal fitting, and pretty much how to make sure that the conveyor system works before it leaves the shop. And how was I rewarded? By keeping me a temp worker for 3 FUCKING YEARS keeping me at $14/hr!!!

I demanded that I get hired on permanent and a pay increase to $16.50/hr. (I live in Mississippi, asking for anything more than that would be like asking the plant superintendent if you could raw dog his daughter.) My foreman goes to bat for me and makes it happen. But now that I had the audacity to demanded fair compensation they think they own me. They would constantly tell me to go the weld department and help prep steel for fit up and weld out. Guess what happens next, I learn welding fitting. I'm building JIGS and doing full fit work.

I ask for more money and was flat out refused. They told me that the $0.30 ""cost of living"" raise we get every year is all that they could give. That's an extra $48 a month. For perspective this is a mutli-national company. They have plants on almost every continent. They just bought a steel mill company and built a new facility to combine that new one and their old one. 

Now I was just going to stick out as I was in the middle of school trying to finish up my bachelors degree. Then Mississippi revoked my wife's disability, a whooping $700/month. (Apparently having a brain tumor 1/2 the size of a golf ball removed and having your brain chemistry  irrevocably alter only takes a year to get over.) We were barely making it with what I was making, $17.40/hr, and her disability. So I said fuck it and joined the Millwright Union. Better bargaining power, representation, and benefits. Sucks that I had to stop school again.

669,Those Who Dare,"Pour yourself a beverage of your choice, this is going to be a long one.

I admit, I pretty much lucked out. I'm european and found a well-paid job in the development sparte, which means, that the labor itself is varied and the pressure of a production plant is nearly non-existent. But I am also temporary employed and working in a 2-shift-system, which is kinda like going to the end of the rainbow and finding a pot of poop. I've been lurking in this sub for quite a while and I look over the big pond from time to time, which means, I've been able to think about some things.

I've always enjoyed good quotes and actually like to come up with (admittedly tacky) ones myself. Here's, what I cooked up during a slow afternoon shift:

""It were always those, who dared. Those, who were driven by the past to look into the future, yet chained down by the present. And whenever they managed to break free, they were always gracious enough to drag us with them, despite our constant kicking and screaming.""

First of all, we are not productive for 8 hours straight. We are actually just about [3 hours](https://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/in-an-8-hour-day-the-average-worker-is-productive-for-this-many-hours.html) a day productive. Mentioning a five-day work week with only 3 working hours a day in this sub is like bringing owls to Athens, but something is... off. The weekend wasn't invented by Henry Ford to recuperate, but to [consume](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zf22kmn). So, would there be a need for a weekend, if we would only work as long as our biology allows? Probably not. Imagine a world, where there's no need for a weekend to numb ourselves with various substances and (social) media. You could wake up and whenever you feel like it,  due to home office, be productive for three hours a day, seven days a week. The rest of the day is completely yours. Because typical office work is now efficient and meaningful thanks to the elimination of [bullshit jobs](https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/).

But what about all the other workers? Those, who need to be on-site? We could actually see a massive increase in those fields. The administrative sector has absolutely blown up during the past decades. But the people, who produce, fix and care have been squeezed. Quite literally. [Direct care workers](https://eu.freep.com/story/news/health/2021/05/04/caregiver-shortage/4891001001/) have an incredibly demanding work day, yet they are deemed ""low-skilled"" and the need to love care work was deemed as a substitute to a living wage. [Blue collar workers](https://www.councilofindustry.org/the-blue-collar-drought/) are a huge part of the workforce, that keeps countries up and running, yet parents will keep telling their children, that only a college degree will lead to a better life.

I have no doubt, that there are young people out there, that want to care for others. Or love to get their hands greasy (or wood-dusted). But they either fear downright miserable pay and working conditions or their parents instill this particular ""You NEED a degree""- mindset into them. Does that mean, that office jobs are going to disappear? No, they won't. And yes, blue collar and care taker jobs can and will be back-breaking. But if there are more people doing these jobs, motivated by encouraging peers and better pay, they might relieve each others. You know, sharing the burden and such things.

There's automation. This particular economist-paper-buzzword is actually far more complicated than the usual ""jObS gOnE""-peddling. While some articles are delivering [grim outlooks](https://engageemployee.com/robots-to-replace-up-to-20-million-factory/), others paint a more [facetted picture](https://www.industryweek.com/talent/article/22025840/automation-eliminates-jobs-not-work-new-report). There may be many unknowns regarding this particular aspect of the future, but its going to be a challenge for sure. The book ""The Last Firewall"" by William Hertling is a good read and delivers an interesting take: Every job, there ever was, is now automated. Humanity has now more free time than ever on their hands, but chooses... to revolt. Because they are missing the jobs. Now, you may think of the classical baby boomer, who build his/her whole identity around the workplace and has no real life. You might actually be [right](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/baby-boomers-2164681). So, how do we handle automation the right way?

Simple: Let growing pains happen. We can't make everybody immediately happy. But there's maybe something, that could offer some help: The [UBI](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-03/would-a-universal-basic-income-make-us-lazy-or-creative-germany-study-explores). ""Universal Basic Income"" has become quite the wedge issue (I'm surprised, that Tucker Carlson and his gang of misfits, otherwise known as The Foul &amp; The Furious, aren't constantly screaming it along the lines of ""sOcIaLiSm"") amongst economists. We can expect meaningful data in a few years, when the german test run is finished and salvaged, but the smaller, finnish experiment showed: Unemployed people receiving a modest amount of money (654$) instead of the well-known unemployment benefits were not only healthier, but also more likely to find a job. A small calculation: If all US-Citizen above the age of 18 would receive a monthly check of 600$ as a means of pressure relief, it would cost the US government just about 1,5 trillion dollar annually. While many wouldn't even notice the extra, monthly 600$ in their bank account, others would be impacted massively by this: The [working poor](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/19/coronavirus-how-the-pandemic-impacts-americas-working-poor.html). And the pandemic has only poured oil into the fire.

Yes, unionization and thus, wages being raised, is going to be faster to come by than an UBI. But I strongly hold the belief, that with automation cutting millions of jobs, people need a safety net to be able to find a new path. Because if a massive amount of people gets unemployed, yet has absolutely zero back-up, is going to send said people into quite the frenzy.

So, what's the conclusion of this massive chunk of text? Quite simple: Keep organizing. Keep discussing salaries and quitting jobs, that are detrimental to your health, be it physical or mental. But most importantly: Keep dreaming. The best ideas, I've ever had, came up during monotone, everyday tasks; when I spent the time daydreaming. Dare, to ask:""What if...?"". Dare to withstand the bullshit of baby boomers. It may feel like small steps, but they might be considered gigantic hundred years down the road. Last but not least:

hi, i am a new hire (1 month in) at a warehouse type store, but i've been working in retail the past 5 years. i am also a full time college student going about two semesters longer than i should because of the reasons ill talk about in this post. 

last year was shit. i lost my mom in may, as well as the pandemic starting to go full force, but losing my mom has really affected me horribly. i live at home still (i'm 21) and she was really sick (not covid) since 2016, went into remission, but got sick again in october of 2019. she was in at home hospice for a majority, so while going to school and working, i was taking care of my mom during the day until my dad came home, and it was just really depressing to be around 24/7 and i couldn't focus on any of my school work anymore. i failed two semesters straight (technically pass/fail which was offered to us in the pandemic) and its caused my graduation to be delayed by two semesters. i was working through all of this but lost my job because mentally i just could not do it 25-30 hours a week while my school situation was taxing on me and my home situation was taking a big chunk out of my mental health. 

now is june 2021, my home situation has changed drastically. i still live at home but we lost mom in may last year, i'm trying to make up and do things around the house as well as try to deal with my families grief and my own. i have to start school in august, im going to be doing 15 credit hours (full time) and work with a disability specialist and tutor as well as my advisor to try and get done and have a successful semester, as well as seeing my therapist. my new job has me working 35-40 hours a week, and i just moved departments so now in fall i will be working like 4-10 or 5-11 pm every night. 

should i just quit my job or see if i can come back in the summer next year? my dad is not very understanding with leaving the job i live with him and i know he will be disappointed in me if i do. i'm trying my best but i'm just completely out of spoons. i dont know how to even talk to my dad about potentially leaving my new job.",False,o8b7t0,ollowollo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o8b7t0/hi_looking_for_advice/,10,1

684,"I am burned tf out, AMA.","This is pretty much just a rant, so, whatever, I guess. Fuck everyone I'm here to talk about and fuck me for having to work with them. 

I am an electrical and data communications expert. And I fully mean expert. No arrogance, no hesitation. I am a motherfucking expert in the conveyance and configuration of electricity and data. 

Which is, I promise you, not even a very high bar to achieve. 99% of everyone I have ever worked around are blithering incompetents. 

I've seen electricians who couldn't make a data connection to save their lives and data men who wouldn't know the difference between phases if they fucking touched them together. Even in their designated craft most can't even function enough between their drug of choice to be half competent some of the time. The individuals I have met in the **large scale** commercial and industrial jobs which I have been a part who know even 5% of what's going on can be counted on one hand. Without a doubt, working with these people is the single, worst part of doing what I do.

Than there is the utter meaninglessness of the jobs of which I partake.

I exclusively work in commercial/industrial settings. Huge megacorporations just hurl money at any random company they can find to do the most banal shit. I would say that money laundering would have to be the only explanation except that I get paid so much myself to do their bs.

The two most common things I see in the data world that take up 95% of these jobs are:

1-going into a building with existing wiring and replacing the wiring with the exact same fucking wiring.

2-going into a building with a network of wireless access points and replacing them with different, not-any-better wireless access points.

Utterly pointless wastes of time and money. If I had a quarter for every building I've gone to with pre-existing cat5e just to replace them with new cat5e and nothing else I'd probably be a fucking millionaire. You want to replace this perfectly functional wireless access point with a different and in no way better one? Sure, whatever. Where do you want your old ones? Left up in the fucking ceiling to rot because you don't give a shit since you have enough money to not care? The usual, then.

At least with electricity I have a pretty good amount of power *lol* to tell someone to get fucked if they want to do stupid bs. Which is funny, because it's like the opposite of the data world and I never need to.

For some reason that I don't understand, there is this dichotomy in the business world that data services are the MYSTICAL GIFT OF THE GODS that just *makes everything magically better™* and they've **GOT TO HAVE IT RIGHT NOW NO MATTER THE COST.** Meanwhile, warehouses full of product are lit with obsolete t12 fluorescent lighting with magnetic ballasts so fucking old and heavy that I'm afraid colonel mustard is going to use it to murder someone in the observatory. 

These same companies that shell out so much money for data product that they literally barely even use won't even spare anything other than a sideways glance when you tell them the 480v 2000amp federal pacific panel running all their machinery and heavy duty equipment is probably going to burn their entire operations down one day.

And then there are the employers.

I don't think I need to explain how employers are fucking garbage in this subreddit.

Most of what I have done is, essentially, gig work.

What I mean by this is that, while I have only ever worked jobs which file me as a w2 employee, the turnover is so pathetically high that it's really and truly gig work.

Here's where my problem is. I've never been one to put up with bs at the best of times. But lately, I've been extra hardcore about not being a fucking slave. Because, you know, that's what BURNING OUT does to you.

I'm registered with a lot of agencies where the only thing I ever hear from them is ""Hey man we got this job over in ___ and they need you there tommorrow."" Except ____ is two states away and they want you to stay in a hotel room with 3 other dudes and no per diem. And the job is night work, so that the business can still run like normal during the day time.

Get fucked assholes. I'm not some thirsty fucking money virgin looking to ride your dick for a booty call. I live in a house with my wife and sleep in my own fucking bed at night. I've told them to not even bother contacting me if it's not in my city, and even then it's the same shit. They act like the stars and planets have to fucking align just to find work in my large, metropolitan city. 

And they still call me all the time for the jobs I've told them to get fucked for because they somehow don't have anyone else who can do it.

I'm working a job right now that is, guess what, replacing a bunch of existing shit with the exact same shit. I get there and the jackoffs in charge are so ignorant and disorganized that they would rather have me, making $30 an hour to be there, stand around while they figure out how to make a coax connection.

Everyone thinks all they have to do is yell ""MONEY MONEY MONEY"" and you'll jump all over them and than act surprised when they find someone who they can't buy away life happiness from.

Now for the most controversial part of this rant. UNIONS.

Oh man, let me tell you about the unions. 

Long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away...I put in an application with the IBEW for an electrical apprenticeship. Back when I didn't know shit. 

I didn't even hear back from them for literal years. I went out and just made a career in the time it took for them to even acknowledge my existence. They called me for an interview just like a week ago. 

At this point, I would literally be taking a huge paycut to even bother doing it, but I went to the interview none-the-less.

What. A. Waste. Of. Time.

The interview was like 5 questions long, had absolutely nothing to do with technical skill, and was obviously geared towards identifying know nothing greenhorns to wrangle in. Questions like ""Name a time where you had a problem you couldn't solve and why couldn't you solve it?""

I worked in my obvious experiences and knowledge into everything they asked me and these two old elitist jack offs straight up said to me in the middle of me talking that ""your answer doesn't have to pertain to the electrical trade.""

Fuck you. *Doesn't have to pertain to the electrical trade.* I wasn't aware that this was an interview for fucking walmart. I'd rather make no money than work for a bunch of assholes who would rather hire a know nothing nobody over someone. 

I can't speak for every union, but the ibew in my experience has been known to be, uhhh, pretty fucking corrupt. I can't say that my experiences around them have ever been very pleasant, that their people are particularly sociable, or that they don't look like a bunch of pyramid scheme scam artists. 

Maybe if they weren't also a completely closed club of pick and choose racist yokels with zero pretension towards affordable work towards the common person I would view them more charitably.

*Alas.*

That's the other emotionally draining part of what I do, btw. Everyone bites like pirahna for big business hurling money at them. But if you're just some person in a house trying to get your electricity working or data runs?

Haha. Nobody gives a shit about you. There's three facts of life. Death, taxes, and that no tradesman within a hundred mile radius of where you live gives a flying fuck about you. 

Ghosts are real. They just drive work vans and don't answer calls instead of haunting houses.

I'm so fucking tired of it all. I mostly quit working altogether last year around Novemeber and have just stayed at a home as a house husband. I've been growing a garden. I made my cats a bunch of bomb ass cat trees. It's been so peaceful and fulfilling. We've talked about it and my wife's been very supportive of me well above and beyond what I would have ever allowed for myself otherwise.

But I obviously can't just live without making money. I've got it better than many, for sure, but I'm bot exemot from having to make money. So every so often I trudge out to deal with the same bs for gigantic companies who think I'm just some money receptacle to do whatever they want whenever they want it.

After taking my order, she took her headset off and just walked the fuck out, got in her car and left. I laughed.

686,"I just quit a job which paid me $15,000 per week with yearly bonuses","Until about 2 hours ago I was an overpaid blockchain protocol engineer earning $780,000 per year with an average bonus of around $500K.

Insane money, what was the catch? I had to work 100 hours+ a week, every single week. I also had 3 advisory positions with other blockchain projects which required contributions. I worked 7 days a week, mostly morning to dusk, with no time off. Any time I even suggested taking a break to my bosses, they just upped my pay to get me to continue my work. Any time something effects my work or takes even a marginal amount of time, I have to find a solution. Anxious? Pop a valium. Tired? Have a Modafinil. Can't get out of bed? Well just work in bed. Cooking taking up your time? Order Uber eats.

I pushed and pushed and pushed and I really tried to make this work for almost 5 years now. I have 2 kids under the age of 4 and I haven't see them grow up. I've lost most of my friends and I don't enjoy any of the activities I used to. I'm out of shape and I eat like shit and get winded walking around the block. My wife puts up with it because of the crazy money and being able to buy whatever we want, but I know she has been unhappy and lonely.

Today it really came to a head. It's been building all year but today I just felt so stressed I started crying and I couldn't stop crying. I'm a grown-ass 32 year old man worth millions of dollars with a beautiful wife and kids, sitting alone in his office and crying because I have nothing but work to fill my days. I started thinking about dying and my mood kept getting darker and darker. I had never felt so depressed and empty in my life. I thought about taking an overdose of something.

Then I suddenly had a thought. ""Why don't you just quit?"". It didn't even seem possible, but what was the alternative? Killing myself?

So I summoned the courage, and I wrote an email. I told my bosses my mental health is suffering too much from my job and I'm quitting. They phoned me back quickly, and offered me a pay rise. I said I couldn't and they asked me to suggest a pay rise which would keep me there.

I managed to end the call and now I'm sitting here unemployed. I'm still crying, and I still feel stressed as fuck, but I do feel like some kind of weight has been lifted from my shoulders.

I hope I made the right decision. I hope my career can recover in the future. I still have my advisory positions and I am well respected in the blockchain industry but it's not a good look to suddenly walk away from a major public project like this. But I just can't do this anymore, I can't keep telling myself that any amount of money is worth this.

705,How to revolt against the rich,"To revolt against the rich, you must dismantle the life support of capitalism from the top down before the top collapses onto the people below. 

People say that capitalism will eat itself. What part of capitalism will get eaten first? The haves, or the have-nots? Even Sleepy Joe says he’d rather nuke America than let a state split from crony capitalism by means of force. So long as the SEC keeps bailing out those mega-corps they deem “too big to fail”, we will never be free from cronyism, graft, and lobbying. So long as the Federal Reserve is allowed to exist as the sole provider of a standard of value exchange, we will always have inflation and corruption. We could go back to gold or move to crypto, but this alone doesn’t wrench away the power from the hands of people like the governors giving bigger and bigger tax-breaks to Jeff Bezos so he puts his Amazon warehouses in their state. People need to put in place legislation that prevents tax breaks going to mega-corps like Walmart, Amazon and others, and give bigger tax-breaks to small business owners. People need to start saving their money in things that build wealth over time. People need to stop spending money on crappy Amazon garbage and start spending money locally. We need to start limiting our government more, what money can be spent on, how much money they take. When these big corpos can’t compete with small businesses working together, making better paying jobs, there will be a more equitable society. And when money isn’t spent the way its supposed to be spent, then the money should go back to taxpayers, because that money is a public grant whose purpose is to serve the public, it is not the public’s purpose to serve the grant. 

These are the real things that people need to support, to vote for, to fight for, but seem to get cast aside for minutia causes that only serve to divide us. We get so by distracted by mega-corps promoting division tactics via minutia like race, gender, ethnicity, on both sides of the two-party system, that we can’t even see how much we’re getting robbed every day by State and Federal governments. They starve us to death equally while we bicker about bullshit, burn down businesses, shoot eachother in the street, promoting an endless cycle of hatred. Our differences are like the thickness of a skin of a grape, we fight over whose side is thicker, far from the mountain of stolen gold that the billionaires are resting upon. 

The truth is that our racial, gender, and ethnic divisions are completely manufactured by the CIA. Project Mockingbird revealed that every single major news outlet is run by the CIA. 4chan was revealed in 2008-2010 to have been fully purchased by the CIA. Reddit is most likely also fully bought out by the CIA, same with Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Youtube, and every other major social media platform. Anyone who wants to go against the narrative needs to be more persistent than the CIA’s censorship, and needs to make sure that the truth is not distorted as it is being broadcast by beginning with writing a book, an immutable record of your ideas.

Next time you say ""damn, must be nice"" you might want
to understand the lifestyle that has made it appealing to
you!

8-5 didn't make it.

Marking our ass on the couch to watch of every night
didn make it.

Sleeping in on Saturdays didn make it.

Calling in when sick didn make it.

Being content with where we're at didn make it.

It came from some 15-20 hour days.

It came from beating the sun up.

It came from working on weekend.

It came from sacrificing family time.

It came from wanting a little better tomorrow at the
expense of today.

These are a few things to consider before you throw out
""damn, must be nice"" at someone! He are all products

of our competence. And extra efforts are what make the
biggest differences at the end of the day! #StayHungry

736,Dear First Worlders...,"*WARNING* The world (ruled by the callous mentalities created by the global cult of capitalism and illusion of meritocracy) has taken me to the point of being a misanthrope (yes I’m honest about it). That being said, I don’t hate anyone as an individual and believe humanity doesn’t have to be this way, though my hope for change dwindles every day. My misanthropy is multiplied by 10 toward privileged people because of their dehumanizing approach toward everyone else. This is a very passionate, angry rant directed at no one in this sub in particular, but directed at the general public in the first world at the same time. And this sub is the only place on the Internet where I don’t think the post will get 100% knee-jerk hate reactions, though I expect a lot of hate from bootlicker types. Read at your own risk. 

To my (temporary, I’m leaving soon) neighbors in the first world, never forget you are choosing to live like SCUM who support thousands of injustices with your daily actions and self-centered attitudes toward everything. You allow yourselves to be ruled by war criminals (both sides are the same corrupt BS) year in and year out while willfully turning a blind eye to the normalized genocide, forced poverty, and segregation your leaders perpetuate in all areas of the world. The only issues you pay attention to in current events and history are those that directly affect your self-interest or feed your biases. You also create an overinflated ego and sense of self-importance from your meaningless corporate jobs, most of which don’t make the world a better place and actively make it worse by hurting the environment and making corrupt Dark Triad people even more prosperous. You are a useful pawn for these people and that is all they will ever see you as, imagine thinking you’re some big shot credible person with authority for being just another obedient cog in a system of torture and death. Many of you almost subconsciously look down on the working class, illegal, and low wage workers in your countries, even though they’re literally the backbones of your infrastructure and the main force that allows you to go to that cushy office job every day and buy lunch with no worries of anything falling apart. 

Then, in your free time, instead of studying things like sociology / spirituality and trying to progress the world toward one of love and equality, you get on the Internet to bully strangers over trivial nonsense - looks, age, income, intellect, disabilities, mental health status, popularity, lifestyle, size, level of “success,” choosing to stay single or a loner, how social they are, how many people they slept with or didn’t sleep with, which religion / spiritual beliefs they have or lack thereof, and any personality traits / viewpoints that you’ve been trained by toxic parents / society to hate and don’t conform ad nauseam to your narrow comfort zone and worldview. You spend every waking hour online and IRL being as callous, unempathetic, and dismissive toward people and their experiences / feelings as humanly possible. I’ve seen so many instances of people who are genuinely struggling sharing their experiences online, only to be blamed for all their traumas by a bunch of privileged overgrown babies who are obviously out of touch with (global) reality and never faced any real adversity compared to others in those “shithole” countries they never think about. Or even compared to people in those “rough” neighborhoods of their own country that they only bring up when the “poor people commit more crime” narrative is mentioned. Never any mention of what causes the poverty though, just the blame / shame game left and right. And we all know how common fake friendships are in first-world countries, with so many people out there who want to know your deepest, darkest secrets just to use them against you or to take advantage. Vultures. I’ve talked to several people who are either from non-first world countries or lived in them extensively. They all say that friendships are not like this in other parts of the world, it’s a problem of the West or at least more pronounced. Here, people make frenemies instead of friends (regardless of gender) and it’s nearly universal. I think the reason for the toxic nature of relationships here is that almost every damn pursuit in Western culture devolves to a game of one-upsmanship and getting a leg up on somebody. Ah, there’s that good old capitalism-fueled competition rearing it’s head again. Patriarchy is another cultural disease that adds to the prevalence of hypercompetition as well.

Victim blaming, prejudiced criticisms under the guise of “tough love / advice” and casual gaslighting (of all kinds, in all situations) seems to be something people in your cultures do for amusement online, never thinking about the psychological harm that may have been done to the other person. It just shows how fragile your egos are and how they need to be preserved 24/7 against the slightest deviation. All of this insecurity despite the fact that you people go on and on about how you live in the “best countries in the world.” If something doesn’t align with your narrow scope of vision, you will refuse to consider or even hear a single word that the other person is saying and abuse them for expressing themselves in a way that you don’t approve. All so you can pretend that the world is A-okay, that you’re not complicit in thousands of injustices that occur everyday, and that anyone who gets mistreated, abused, or even killed brought it on themselves and “deserved” it. It’s like you deliberately turn off any semblance of humanity and empathy that neoliberal capitalist culture hasn’t already sucked out of you. 

I guess I understand, thinking this way makes it convenient to stay working mindlessly like an ant and only caring about your own lot in life, never truly questioning why it “has” to be this way. But really, why? We could literally have a global revolution tomorrow if people really wanted to unite. Because you’re afraid to lose your job? You have kids to feed? That’s part of the problem, knowing everything going on in this world and continuing to bring children into inevitable suffering just because everyone else is popping out babies and you don’t want to be an outcast, or a selfish desire for “legacy”. Or maybe you accept the status quo unconditionally because your parents told you “it’s just the way it is” when you were children? Bullshit, that’s the first time they tried to kill the passion out of you and you let them. Chances are that most of our parents / adults told their kids deflating things like this to perpetuate the just-world fallacy for themselves and avoid guilt about their own lack of action in making the world a better place. Then they bring more children into the world and indoctrinate them with the same sick values, and the generational cycle of mass suffering continues, beautiful isn’t it? But I know most people will probably say I should go to a shrink for this rant and that I’m the crazy one for not seeing the value in humanity when this is how we CHOOSE (yes it’s a choice, not “human nature”) to live.

There really isn’t much of a difference between the mentality of today’s neoliberal consumerist zombies and people like Hitler’s supporters. You neoliberals are just very slick with the way you do things, but it’s all done under the same wicked intentions of oppression and dominance for the sake of dominance. We literally have more than enough resources globally to give every human being a house, keep them decently fed, etc. But no, the majority of you narcissistic chimpanzees keep insisting “competition / hyperindividualism is good, survival of the fittest, cooperation / collectivism and being kind is for the weak.” Same idiots that go around saying things like “respect must be earned, not given” and “telling it like it is” to justify their prejudices and discriminatory actions.  No asshole, I’m the one telling it like it is, and I know you don’t like the actual truth because it puts you and your peers’ everyday shortcomings on a big projector for you all to see. 

And before anyone complains, yes, I understand there are hundreds of millions of people in the first world and SOME (very few let’s be honest) don’t go along with the status quo and try to be part of the change they envision for the world. This is a rant directed at the (middle / bourgeois class) MAJORITY. Honestly, so-called Democracy has proven to be the biggest tyranny of all. In other systems, there was always a distinct group challenging the authorities at play and they weren’t completely wiped into silence. If they were wiped via violence, it was later understood as a cruel act that shouldn’t be mimicked. But because the word “democracy” is falsely used to describe this inhumane system and sounds good on paper, the masses shut down people who rightfully question how “free” this illusion truly is and think they’re the real fascists. Since they don’t use violence and just shut these people out of the discussion via cultural power, those people have no viable way to make their point without looking like the bad guys. And while I don’t believe we live in a meritocracy, the fact that most people believe we do and their justifications for mistreating the “lower end” people show me that the concept as a whole is inherently bad for humanity due to the callous mentality it perpetuates. We are all slaves to the judgments of the majority, no matter how delusional they become. 

At least with one central leadership figure, you have a CHANCE of bringing in someone with a good head on their shoulders and high level of compassion. Your odds of finding one admirable person to lead are much higher than getting the majority to love and respect one another regardless of differences. The majority will always keep an ignorant and inhumane mentality toward anyone not exactly like them, and therefore will maintain a cold, despicable value system in society.  As a result, they fall for the lies and deceitful “charisma” of sadistic narcissists and propel them into positions of power / influence time and time again. Good, pure-hearted people who mind their business and try not to judge others over personal characteristics are treated like the exact opposite. They don’t participate in what most call “banter” so they’re viewed by the majority as “lame / soft” or “too boring / sensitive.” As a result, good people are usually targets of unprovoked bullying, abuse and / or isolation. Why? Because so-called civilized modern people have become so dumb and backward, that intending to be a good person from the beginning without having ulterior motives is viewed as “weakness.” This world WANTS you to be manipulating and transactional in everything you do and everyone you deal with. When people who refuse to play the game are permanently othered and inevitably deemed losers and outcasts, the society then acts like it was their fault and they must be truly lacking something inside them to not be able to integrate. No, these less than 5% of people just couldn’t allow themselves to be everyday sadistic sociopaths like the majority. 

It’s funny how Trump called Africa a “shithole” when from a character standpoint, even with their own flaws, people there have more redeeming qualities in one finger than your average Westerner has in their entire bloodline, ESPECIALLY Westerners that make close to six figures or more. Less wealthy people in this country at least TRY to help each other in limited ways sometimes and tend to have a lot more principles that they live by, for better or worse. There are many flawed principles but I can respect any principled person far more than the rich and middle class who push this “sell your soul and existence to the highest bidder” bootlicker mentality on everyone. If you refuse to be a part of bourgeois culture and play the game, you will be concern trolled and gaslighted by these people. They’ll say “grow up” or “you’ll never become successful thinking this way.” To these people, growing up means relentlessly chasing arbitrary standards of prosperity and becoming a compliant worker bee who never questions any of society’s authorities. Well, I say fuck you and fuck your media-crafted definitions of success, happiness and prosperity. All three are treated like a zero-sum game where crabs in a bucket must prevent the others from getting enough for themselves. People want to avoid concepts like misanthropy and antinatalism because they’re deemed as “negative and divisive.” All the while deliberately ignoring the fact that even so-called “positive” concepts have been bastardized by the puppet-masters of this world to keep the masses controlling, hostile and hypercompetitive toward one another. Humans want to continue living in strife despite the fact that true scarcity, meaning lack of enough physical resources to support everyone, DOES NOT EXIST and will only decrease as technology finds new ways to support sustainability and preserve life. At least misanthropy and antinatalism stemmed from concern for the greater environment and a desire to improve life for the people already here. People who buy into the “cult of individualistic positivity” seem to be primarily concerned with self-promotion and getting recognition above all else, even better if it’s at someone’s expense and they can feel like they knocked someone down a peg while pulling themselves up. The crazy part is that mentalities like this are promoted by society as “self-love” and “confidence.” Cultures of cutthroat scarcity are promoted as inevitable reality while cultures of abundance and compassion are quickly dismissed as childish naïveté. It is ALL cultural, not based on the physical reality that is abundance. 

At this point, I’m allergic to anyone this heinous society considers “successful” and want to keep at least three football fields of distance between me and those types of people. Write me off as a deluded loser if you like, I stopped caring about petty BS like that a long time ago. I only care about one thing now, and that’s knowing the true reality. Things probably won’t change, but I need to keep my eye out so I can at least avoid the madness myself. I’m a second generation immigrant native born in the USA, and I’m deliberately moving to a remote “third world” country to live on less money (and less stress) and to get away from this toxic, inhumane social Darwinist culture. No matter how many people’s lives are ruined by this system, the general public continues to go along with its twisted Machiavellian values and sweep problems / victims under the rug, all to pretend “everything is positive and I am in control of everything that happens in my life.” Material difficulties aside, at least people elsewhere have a somewhat closer relationship with reality (they have to for survival) and treat each other more like human beings. I’ll gladly deal with increased material inconveniences over this spiritually bankrupt cultural wasteland we call the West.

737,Society has always been a hunger games bloodbath,"The rich have always exploited the poor in the name of greed. Slavery has always existed. If you live in a first world country today its as good as its going to get. 

Only difference is now the slaves in a capitalist system have access to comforts that have never been available before in history and opportunity to better themselves and improve their situation. 

Is the system fair? No. But when has it ever been? Lets be real. People are selfish and act in their own interests. Not all but enough to ruin it for everyone. 

No one is going to hire you unless they can make profit off you. Thats why people start businesses. To elevate themselves. 

Someone has an idea and starts a business and if there is a demand then they hire people and pay them the least amount possible in order to make maximum profit. 

Whether that business owner had rich parents and could have afforded to fail 10 times doesnt matter. Life is not fair and never has been. We have always lived in a hunger games society. This is the most sanitized version of it ever. Especially if you live in a first world country. 

What can we do? Try to escape by moving up the platform. We live in a country that gives us opportunity to do that in so many ways. 

Learning a skill or craft or pursuing higher education or starting a business or applying for promotions in the workplace. 

Is everyone going to succeed? No. Life is not fair. Even under communism everyone is not equal. The ones at the top will have everything and everyone below nothing. And there is nothing they can do to improve their lot.  

Its just reality. We are in a fucked up hell hole brethren. Best thing u can do is not bring children into this world. Work, brainstorm, and try to better yourself and maybe it will pay off and you will be elevated on the platform. Or maybe downsize, work part time and be content to eat rations. I dunno the answers.

757,"Quit a job I hated, started a new job &amp; having worse burn out than before","I posted on here a lot a few months back when I was making my exit at my first job post grad school. The team I worked with was great and I got to do all of my work remote. Then, expectations from the state (I’m in social services) began to put unrealistic metrics on myself and my team of 2.

Shit hit the fan after terrible management communication and a total of 5-6 (myself included) quit.

I found a new job at a very similar organization, just doing different work. The pay was the same &amp; although I do enjoy what I do more now, the stress is killing me. The same unrealistic expectations are put on, and after a lot of budget cuts, my team is down to 3 of us, carrying a pretty big load…

I fooled myself when I thought starting a new job would somehow change the fact that I work 40 hours a week making $20-$21 an hour. I had suspicions before, but now confirmed my beliefs that getting my master’s in social work was a terrible decision. 

The jobs I’d like to have (behind the scenes not dealing with client load, just doing data, quality assurance type work) require years of client facing work. 

I’ve only been working full time since last August..not even a full year and I feel so anxious, depressed, and generally unwell. Maybe it’s time to see a therapist, but the reality is that this is my life for the next 40-50 years. Or maybe it’s time to seriously consider a different line of work, even if it doesn’t utilize my fancy worthless degree.

No amount of therapy or medication will spawn a job that doesn’t make me feel anxious to wake up every morning to be overworked and under paid.

Need to study? Go to the library, a coffee shop, or stay home. The teacher doesn't care as long as shit gets done. 

Need to work in groups? Schedule time and place with classmates that works for everyone. 

Need to talk to the teacher (the boss of the class)? Email them, verbally ask them for office time, or email them asking for office time. They'll help you (except for the ones that don't). 

Need to use the library, printer, or special equipment? Just go to the school when you have time.

Tonight I read a comment that said word for word, “But if we are not working for money, what are we doing with our life? How would humanity succeed?”. Finally drove me to post after lurking for some time. To this person who made this comment. I respect your privacy enough not to interject with my opinions or try and change yours. It would probably be pointless anyway, but I am truly saddened for you. Life should not be solely focused on small frail pieces of paper. Life is so much more than that. I know money dominates a major part of our life, but none of that is our fault. We are all just born into this concept. But I have another concept I’d like to bring up. Everything we needed to survive and prosper on this planet was already here long before the first human was born. Everything else we created along the way was just an attempt to simplify things for us in the long run. When you get down to the basics of what humans actually need, food, water, means of clothing and shelter. Then most importantly, each other. We already had it from day one. Capitalism and money are made up concepts we created to benefit us as a people. Just like any other concept or theory it is only right and responsible to question that concept to be sure it is still actually beneficial to us. To the person who made this comment. I hope you find more in life than just what the confines of your job earning pieces of paper allows you to feel. To anyone who actually reads this I hope you can join me in trying to send some positivity their way. It’s needed. Virtually spiritually, whatever way you prefer. Just send your good vibes their way.

I can see daily shipments as it relates to when government stimulus hits people’s bank accounts and how it results in elevated spending for the resulting couple of weeks - it’s directly correlated.

Ending unemployment benefits where people are making more money than working a typical minimum wage job won’t result in them spending more because they’ll have less money to spend.

Factoring in gas money (which costs more than ever) and child care needs for going to work vs. being on unemployment - there’s not going to be enough money to go around the continue the economic growth we’ve been seeing.

TL:DR - Ending unemployment benefits will result in more production and supply because people are forced back to work - but the demand will be greatly reduced because the unemployed were driving demand with better wages from their enhanced unemployment benefits.",False,o6z49e,Yeezy4Presidente,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o6z49e/ironically_businesses_advocating_to_end_enhanced/,3,1

801,"Hate your job and Suffering from depression anxiety and ADHD, know your rights.","Companies don't want you to know that if you elected Short term disability Insurance and have have depression anxiety etc you can use it. 

You go to your primary care doctor and let them know the following.

Depression is affecting every aspect of life, you are not having sex, not hanging out with friends, not talking to family, no hobbies, and struggling at work. 

From there you say ""I'm scared if I don't get help it will get worse, I don't want to end up harming myself, I need help""

You get a doctors note saying you need 3 months off work, take it to HR, then you start using short term disability. When that runs out you can then use FMLa. You won't have income on FMLA but you will get 1 of 2 benefits while you look for a better job still. 

1. Still have full insurance coverage
2. Still legally employed (no gaps in resume) 

Take your time to find a better job, more flexible hours, better pay, less responsibility  etc. You do NOT need to let them know you're on FMLA. HR speads misinformation because they want you thinking FMLA disqualifies you from looking for work. You just can't collect a paycheck on FMLA but we all know it takes weeks if not months to get a job. 

When you get an offer, negotiate saying ""wall let me talk to my current manager"" and use it to get slight more pay, or extra week of vacation.  

After you do say ""I put in my 2 weeks, but manager is asking if I can work 4 weeks so I can transition my projects to others"". Most FMLA requires you to return to work, work 2 weeks and then quit or else you owe your old company 3 months of health insurance premiums, which can be 600 bucks a month.

But seriously, I've been suffering through the hell that is applying for jobs for pretty much all of my adult life and I don't know if ANYONE has ever contacted my references. I never had a person who interviewed me mention that they had or would contact my references. There's never been a ""your former boss spoke very highly of you"" or ""your coworker seemed to like working with you.""
If references really don't matter, then it's unfair to judge a potential employee on whether or not they can scrape them up. Not everyone gets hired by jobs with competent managers or coworkers who would be willing to vouch for you if you leave/get let go from their job. I guess there's no harm in lying and giving them your friends' info, but what if you don't have those either? It's just another pointless hoop for people to jump through. 

Honestly, I would love if my references were used because I have a hard time advocating for myself especially in interviews.

808,Dear First Worlders...,"*WARNING* I am a misanthrope who believes humanity doesn’t have to be this way, though my hope for change dwindles every day. And my misanthropy is multiplied by 10 toward privileged people because of their dehumanizing approach toward everyone else. This is a very passionate, angry rant directed at no one in this sub in particular, but directed at the general public in the first world at the same time. And this sub is the only place on the Internet where I don’t think the post will get 100% knee-jerk hate reactions, though I expect a lot of hate from bootlicker types. Read at your own risk. 

To my (temporary, I’m leaving soon) neighbors in the first world, never forget you are choosing to live like SCUM who support thousands of injustices with your daily actions and self-centered attitudes toward everything. You allow yourselves to be ruled by war criminals (both sides are the same corrupt BS) year in and year out while willfully turning a blind eye to the normalized genocide, forced poverty, and segregation your leaders perpetuate in all areas of the world. The only issues you pay attention to in current events and history are those that directly affect your self-interest or feed your biases. You also create an overinflated ego and sense of self-importance from your meaningless corporate jobs, most of which don’t make the world a better place and actively make it worse by hurting the environment and making corrupt Dark Triad people even more prosperous. You are a useful pawn for these people and that is all they will ever see you as, imagine thinking you’re some big shot credible person with authority for being just another obedient cog in a system of torture and death. Many of you almost subconsciously look down on the working class, illegal, and low wage workers in your countries, even though they’re literally the backbones of your infrastructure and the main force that allows you to go to that cushy office job every day and buy lunch with no worries of anything falling apart. 

Then, in your free time, instead of studying things like sociology / spirituality and trying to progress the world toward one of love and equality, you get on the Internet to bully strangers over trivial nonsense - looks, age, income, intellect, disabilities, mental health status, popularity, lifestyle, size, level of “success,” choosing to stay single or a loner, how social they are, how many people they slept with or didn’t sleep with, which religion / spiritual beliefs they have or lack thereof, and any personality traits / viewpoints that you’ve been trained by toxic parents / society to hate and don’t conform ad nauseam to your narrow comfort zone and worldview. You spend every waking hour online and IRL being as callous, unempathetic, and dismissive toward people and their experiences / feelings as humanly possible. I’ve seen so many instances of people who are genuinely struggling sharing their experiences online, only to be blamed for all their traumas by a bunch of privileged overgrown babies who are obviously out of touch with (global) reality and never faced any real adversity compared to others in those “shithole” countries they never think about. Or even compared to people in those “rough” neighborhoods of their own country that they only bring up when the “poor people commit more crime” narrative is mentioned. Never any mention of what causes the poverty though, just the blame / shame game left and right. And we all know how common fake friendships are in first-world countries, with so many people out there who want to know your deepest, darkest secrets just to use them against you or to take advantage. Vultures. I’ve talked to several people who are either from non-first world countries or lived in them extensively. They all say that friendships are not like this in other parts of the world, it’s a problem of the West or at least more pronounced. Here, people make frenemies instead of friends (regardless of gender) and it’s nearly universal. I think the reason for the toxic nature of relationships here is that almost every damn pursuit in Western culture devolves to a game of one-upsmanship and getting a leg up on somebody. Ah, there’s that good old capitalism-fueled competition rearing it’s head again. Patriarchy is another cultural disease that adds to the prevalence of hypercompetition as well.

Victim blaming, prejudiced criticisms under the guise of “tough love / advice” and casual gaslighting (of all kinds, in all situations) seems to be something people in your cultures do for amusement online, never thinking about the psychological harm that may have been done to the other person. It just shows how fragile your egos are and how they need to be preserved 24/7 against the slightest deviation. All of this insecurity despite the fact that you people go on and on about how you live in the “best countries in the world.” If something doesn’t align with your narrow scope of vision, you will refuse to consider or even hear a single word that the other person is saying and abuse them for expressing themselves in a way that you don’t approve. All so you can pretend that the world is A-okay, that you’re not complicit in thousands of injustices that occur everyday, and that anyone who gets mistreated, abused, or even killed brought it on themselves and “deserved” it. It’s like you deliberately turn off any semblance of humanity and empathy that neoliberal capitalist culture hasn’t already sucked out of you. 

I guess I understand, thinking this way makes it convenient to stay working mindlessly like an ant and only caring about your own lot in life, never truly questioning why it “has” to be this way. But really, why? We could literally have a global revolution tomorrow if people really wanted to unite. Because you’re afraid to lose your job? You have kids to feed? That’s part of the problem, knowing everything going on in this world and continuing to bring children into inevitable suffering just because everyone else is popping out babies and you don’t want to be an outcast, or a selfish desire for “legacy”. Or maybe you accept the status quo unconditionally because your parents told you “it’s just the way it is” when you were children? Bullshit, that’s the first time they tried to kill the passion out of you and you let them. Chances are that most of our parents / adults told their kids deflating things like this to perpetuate the just-world fallacy for themselves and avoid guilt about their own lack of action in making the world a better place. Then they bring more children into the world and indoctrinate them with the same sick values, and the generational cycle of mass suffering continues, beautiful isn’t it? But I know most people will probably say I should go to a shrink for this rant and that I’m the crazy one for not seeing the value in humanity when this is how we CHOOSE (yes it’s a choice, not “human nature”) to live.

There really isn’t much of a difference between the mentality of today’s neoliberal consumerist zombies and people like Hitler’s supporters. You neoliberals are just very slick with the way you do things, but it’s all done under the same wicked intentions of oppression and dominance for the sake of dominance. We literally have more than enough resources globally to give every human being a house, keep them decently fed, etc. But no, the majority of you narcissistic chimpanzees keep insisting “competition / hyperindividualism is good, survival of the fittest, cooperation / collectivism and being kind is for the weak.” Same idiots that go around saying things like “respect must be earned, not given” and “telling it like it is” to justify their prejudices and discriminatory actions.  No asshole, I’m the one telling it like it is, and I know you don’t like the actual truth because it puts you and your peers’ everyday shortcomings on a big projector for you all to see. 

And before anyone complains, yes, I understand there are hundreds of millions of people in the first world and SOME (very few let’s be honest) don’t go along with the status quo and try to be part of the change they envision for the world. This is a rant directed at the (middle / bourgeois class) MAJORITY. Honestly, so-called Democracy has proven to be the biggest tyranny of all. In other systems, there was always a distinct group challenging the authorities at play and they weren’t completely wiped into silence. If they were wiped via violence, it was later understood as a cruel act that shouldn’t be mimicked. But because the word “democracy” is falsely used to describe this inhumane system and sounds good on paper, the masses shut down people who rightfully question how “free” this illusion truly is and think they’re the real fascists. Since they don’t use violence and just shut these people out of the discussion via cultural power, those people have no viable way to make their point without looking like the bad guys. And while I don’t believe we live in a meritocracy, the fact that most people believe we do and their justifications for mistreating the “lower end” people show me that the concept as a whole is inherently bad for humanity due to the callous mentality it perpetuates. We are all slaves to the judgments of the majority, no matter how delusional they become. 

At least with one central leadership figure, you have a CHANCE of bringing in someone with a good head on their shoulders and high level of compassion. Your odds of finding one admirable person to lead are much higher than getting the majority to love and respect one another regardless of differences. The majority will always keep an ignorant and inhumane mentality toward anyone not exactly like them, and therefore will maintain a cold, despicable value system in society.  As a result, they fall for the lies and deceitful “charisma” of sadistic narcissists and propel them into positions of power / influence time and time again. Good, pure-hearted people who mind their business and try not to judge others over personal characteristics are treated like the exact opposite. They don’t participate in what most call “banter” so they’re viewed by the majority as “lame / soft” or “too boring / sensitive.” As a result, good people are usually targets of unprovoked bullying, abuse and / or isolation. Why? Because so-called civilized modern people have become so dumb and backward, that intending to be a good person from the beginning without having ulterior motives is viewed as “weakness.” This world WANTS you to be manipulating and transactional in everything you do and everyone you deal with. When people who refuse to play the game are permanently othered and inevitably deemed losers and outcasts, the society then acts like it was their fault and they must be truly lacking something inside them to not be able to integrate. No, these less than 5% of people just couldn’t allow themselves to be everyday sadistic sociopaths like the majority. 

It’s funny how Trump called Africa a “shithole” when from a character standpoint, even with their own flaws, people there have more redeeming qualities in one finger than your average Westerner has in their entire bloodline, ESPECIALLY Westerners that make close to six figures or more. Less wealthy people in this country at least TRY to help each other in limited ways sometimes and tend to have a lot more principles that they live by, for better or worse. There are many flawed principles but I can respect any principled person far more than the rich and middle class who push this “sell your soul and existence to the highest bidder” bootlicker mentality on everyone. If you refuse to be a part of bourgeois culture and play the game, you will be concern trolled and gaslighted by these people. They’ll say “grow up” or “you’ll never become successful thinking this way.” To these people, growing up means relentlessly chasing arbitrary standards of prosperity and becoming a compliant worker bee who never questions any of society’s authorities. Well, I say fuck you and fuck your media-crafted definitions of success, happiness and prosperity. All three are treated like a zero-sum game where crabs in a bucket must prevent the others from getting enough for themselves. People want to avoid concepts like misanthropy and antinatalism because they’re deemed as “negative and divisive.” All the while deliberately ignoring the fact that even so-called “positive” concepts have been bastardized by the puppet-masters of this world to keep the masses controlling, hostile and hypercompetitive toward one another. Humans want to continue living in strife despite the fact that true scarcity, meaning lack of enough physical resources to support everyone, DOES NOT EXIST and will only decrease as technology finds new ways to support sustainability and preserve life. At least misanthropy and antinatalism stemmed from concern for the greater environment and a desire to improve life for the people already here. People who buy into the “cult of individualistic positivity” seem to be primarily concerned with self-promotion and getting recognition above all else, even better if it’s at someone’s expense and they can feel like they knocked someone down a peg while pulling themselves up. The crazy part is that mentalities like this are promoted by society as “self-love” and “confidence.” Cultures of cutthroat scarcity are promoted as inevitable reality while cultures of abundance and compassion are quickly dismissed as childish naïveté. It is ALL cultural, not based on the physical reality that is abundance. 

At this point, I’m allergic to anyone this heinous society considers “successful” and want to keep at least three football fields of distance between me and those types of people. Write me off as a deluded loser if you like, I stopped caring about petty BS like that a long time ago. I only care about one thing now, and that’s knowing the true reality. Things probably won’t change, but I need to keep my eye out so I can at least avoid the madness myself. I’m a second generation immigrant native born in the USA, and I’m deliberately moving to a remote “third world” country to live on less money (and less stress) and to get away from this toxic, inhumane social Darwinist culture. No matter how many people’s lives are ruined by this system, the general public continues to go along with its twisted Machiavellian values and sweep problems / victims under the rug, all to pretend “everything is positive and I am in control of everything that happens in my life.” Material difficulties aside, at least people elsewhere have a somewhat closer relationship with reality (they have to for survival) and treat each other more like human beings. I’ll gladly deal with increased material inconveniences over this spiritually bankrupt cultural wasteland we call the West.

812,"I’m not against “work”, more the conditions in which we work.","I consider myself an anarcho-socialist. Somebody who doesn’t really appreciate the government and disagrees with capitalism- and believes that change needs to happen right now. Drastic change- not gradual. We are doing that and it isn’t working. That’s the bear bones of what I am. 

But capitalism- that’s my issue. 

The “conditions” of the work environment are not just on a physical level. It’s on an emotional and mental level to. You could spend $100K on schooling, just to have to compete with people who have a better smile with you, even though you have way more potential. 

Then the financial level, almost every job has a rank system. Different workers are on different wage pays. I hate the gaps! People who perform the same activity, have the same qualifications and similar interests should get paid the same, no? Also, shouldn’t they get paid a livable and affordable price?

Is it just me or am o the only one who thinks that bosses should be catering to their workers, since the workers do the hard labor? Unhappy workers, unhappy clients, less money coming into your business. It’s insane. The working class gets no respect I feel.

Also- it’s hard to get a good job without going to college. Some people are not academically inclined. If somebody is working full time at a commercial store to make a living, at least pay them like it! Don’t pay them $11, 40 hours, with tax taken out and expect them to pay for 3 kids and $1500 rent. Make your workers happy and pay them REALISTICALLY.

I’m not done. I believe that the work force of the civilians put together is essential for society- but as an anarchist, living in a state where everybody acts accordingly to themselves is not too bad to me. But it’s easier to fix what we have than change the entire thing. Work is essential- but needs to be torn apart and rebuilt.

815,"The stupid, the unaware, the contrarians and the evil. These are the people that prevent progress.","Antiwork principles should be obvious, yet in the real world they are less popular then you would think. I was surprised how few people even heard about these ideas. I thought alot about this in a more broader sense and now ive come to the conclusion that for the most part, progress as a whole is not constrained by realities of science, laws or economics like we are taught to believe. But rather by certain characteristics of people that have certain negative traits who combined constitute at least around ~50-70% of the global population. This clash in values ultimately prevents a possible global consensus. I believe this global consensus is the basis of good and evil and to a large extent reality itself which is why in the lack of it you have alot of the chaos you do now. I've very broadly categorized this 50-70% into subgroups.



The stupid. These people are simply incapable of seeing how they are getting robbed by employers, capitalists and companies and how the system is rigged against them. These are usually the ""work hard grind hard"" type of people who work 80 hours a week for 20 years at McDonald's to ""double their salary"" without ever giving a thought to skilling up to higher hourly salaries or self employment. Anecdotally, it also includes the relegious traditionalists types who dont question narratives and live according to the customs and traditioms of people around. It's not malice but some limitation in cognitive abilities to be able to fully understand and grasp antiwork, flaws of the system and socialist principles. There may be a little bit of a chance to change but unfortunately once their simple habits and ideas are set they will not change.

The unaware and also the desperate. This constitutes the majority of the subsect of people discussed. These people are doing everything they can to survive, Climb the corporate ladder, beat the system and secure a life for themselves. These are the purest and most distilled form of victims and cattle produced by the capitalist system. These are your average Joe's who simply don't have the time or energy to read a book or go deeper into the philosophical principles. There view of the world is narrow not because they aren't smart, but because they simply didn't have the privilege, time or need to broaden their undeestanding of the world. After a certain period of time they become numb to the injustice inflicted against them and for entertainment go on blindly guzzling beers and rooting for the millionaire soccer player because he ""represents him"". Learning this stuff also becomes difficult because their is so much depth go it that jts like learning calculus when you never done subtraction before. On the flip side it also includes the very comfortable privileged. The suburb kid who became a dentist with loving wife and 2 kids. He simply has no need to disrupt this and passively becomes unaware although he too at level is a victim and prisoner, just a very well fed one. These people I think are still within reach to understanding antiwork principles but they need time and an actual intrinsic interest and will to learn.

The contrarians. These are the most annoying, spineless and vacuous group. At least with the evil you know where they stand. These are the ones commenting libtard and voting for trump to piss of the libs. They have no moral compass and will mould to fit any position as needed as long as it is contrary to the narrative they perceive as popular. If suddenly climate change denial will become a left position they will start accepting climate change. They will always bring the ""both sides"" arguement in blantly obvious cases of injustice. These are the dudes in your company saying you shouldn't have WFH just cause. Despite his reasoning, it meets some emotional needs deep down. I guess its either hubris, wanting to feel special and climb the ladder, feel smart or whatever. I thought initlaly this was a phase people had in high school but turns out it's everywhere and these guys never really grow out of it. There's alot of them too as we see time and time again. These people are just too toxic to change and they have no interest in advancing progressive causes, unless ironically if progressivism becomes what anti progressivism is now. The only salvation I find is that  usually these people get exposed for the emotional basis of their position and they typically never get huge systematic support amongst the 50% because they don't stand for anything besides being a troll Contrarian. For example if you ever browse far right wing forums you suprisngly see that Trump of Milo yiannopoulos (contrarians) never gets the respect that someone less popular yet more grounded and with more skin in the game like Steve Bannon(Evil) or Lincoln rockewell(Evil) would get simply because they are contrarian shills.

The evil. This would be too long if I went into detail but simply put these people possess all the negative traits that shape the anti progressive forces of the world. They are the complete polar opposite of what we would see as a moral person. Also, unlike the others, these people are grounded in their ways of evil and have a crooked philosophical basis behind it so they aren't vacuous like contrarians. Also generally the machiavelliansim that accompanies becoming evil also lends it self well to other societal valued traits such as intelligence, wealth and leadership that are all valuable in the capitalist system. These people are your bad bosses, who prevent work from home, micromanage and make you work 40+ unpaid hours just to see you miserable. They are the fascist politicians who genuinely believe that those unlike them should be exterminated. And these are you billionaires who despite being aware of their burden, do not pay taxes or do enough to help. I think they genuinely enjoy that like you and I would enjoy sex or get some kind of warmth like a normal person does seeing a homeless person getting a home. Beyond redemption, these people are your enemies and the architects of the system. One must do everything in their power and will to stop them  and treat them like an existential parasitic threat on humanity that they.


Anyways. This ultimately how I see the world now. At the core of it, it's a problem not of impracticality but of character. As long as these individuals exist and form a high % of the population antiwork ideas may not be popular. All you really can do in your lifetime is spread the word and fight agaisnt the evil. That's what I try my best to do anyways. I do genuinely hope that subreddits and ideas like this one day do lead to a great systematic change where these percentages will shift more and more over a long period of time. We probably won't live to see it but I still think it's worth the effort.",False,o73q1v,my2secondaccount,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o73q1v/the_stupid_the_unaware_the_contrarians_and_the/,0,1

817,Dear First Worlders...,"*WARNING* The world (ruled by the callous mentalities created by the global cult of capitalism and illusion of meritocracy) has taken me to the point of being a misanthrope (yes I’m honest about it). That being said, I don’t hate anyone as an individual and believe humanity doesn’t have to be this way, though my hope for change dwindles every day. My misanthropy is multiplied by 10 toward privileged people because of their dehumanizing approach toward everyone else. This is a very passionate, angry rant directed at no one in this sub in particular, but directed at the general public in the first world at the same time. And this sub is the only place on the Internet where I don’t think the post will get 100% knee-jerk hate reactions, though I expect a lot of hate from bootlicker types. Read at your own risk. 

To my (temporary, I’m leaving soon) neighbors in the first world, never forget you are choosing to live like SCUM who support thousands of injustices with your daily actions and self-centered attitudes toward everything. You allow yourselves to be ruled by war criminals (both sides are the same corrupt BS) year in and year out while willfully turning a blind eye to the normalized genocide, forced poverty, and segregation your leaders perpetuate in all areas of the world. The only issues you pay attention to in current events and history are those that directly affect your self-interest or feed your biases. You also create an overinflated ego and sense of self-importance from your meaningless corporate jobs, most of which don’t make the world a better place and actively make it worse by hurting the environment and making corrupt Dark Triad people even more prosperous. You are a useful pawn for these people and that is all they will ever see you as, imagine thinking you’re some big shot credible person with authority for being just another obedient cog in a system of torture and death. Many of you almost subconsciously look down on the working class, illegal, and low wage workers in your countries, even though they’re literally the backbones of your infrastructure and the main force that allows you to go to that cushy office job every day and buy lunch with no worries of anything falling apart. 

Then, in your free time, instead of studying things like sociology / spirituality and trying to progress the world toward one of love and equality, you get on the Internet to bully strangers over trivial nonsense - looks, age, income, intellect, disabilities, mental health status, popularity, lifestyle, size, level of “success,” choosing to stay single or a loner, how social they are, how many people they slept with or didn’t sleep with, which religion / spiritual beliefs they have or lack thereof, and any personality traits / viewpoints that you’ve been trained by toxic parents / society to hate and don’t conform ad nauseam to your narrow comfort zone and worldview. You spend every waking hour online and IRL being as callous, unempathetic, and dismissive toward people and their experiences / feelings as humanly possible. I’ve seen so many instances of people who are genuinely struggling sharing their experiences online, only to be blamed for all their traumas by a bunch of privileged overgrown babies who are obviously out of touch with (global) reality and never faced any real adversity compared to others in those “shithole” countries they never think about. Or even compared to people in those “rough” neighborhoods of their own country that they only bring up when the “poor people commit more crime” narrative is mentioned. Never any mention of what causes the poverty though, just the blame / shame game left and right. And we all know how common fake friendships are in first-world countries, with so many people out there who want to know your deepest, darkest secrets just to use them against you or to take advantage. Vultures. I’ve talked to several people who are either from non-first world countries or lived in them extensively. They all say that friendships are not like this in other parts of the world, it’s a problem of the West or at least more pronounced. Here, people make frenemies instead of friends (regardless of gender) and it’s nearly universal. I think the reason for the toxic nature of relationships here is that almost every damn pursuit in Western culture devolves to a game of one-upsmanship and getting a leg up on somebody. Ah, there’s that good old capitalism-fueled competition rearing it’s head again. Patriarchy is another cultural disease that adds to the prevalence of hypercompetition as well.

Victim blaming, prejudiced criticisms under the guise of “tough love / advice” and casual gaslighting (of all kinds, in all situations) seems to be something people in your cultures do for amusement online, never thinking about the psychological harm that may have been done to the other person. It just shows how fragile your egos are and how they need to be preserved 24/7 against the slightest deviation. All of this insecurity despite the fact that you people go on and on about how you live in the “best countries in the world.” If something doesn’t align with your narrow scope of vision, you will refuse to consider or even hear a single word that the other person is saying and abuse them for expressing themselves in a way that you don’t approve. All so you can pretend that the world is A-okay, that you’re not complicit in thousands of injustices that occur everyday, and that anyone who gets mistreated, abused, or even killed brought it on themselves and “deserved” it. It’s like you deliberately turn off any semblance of humanity and empathy that neoliberal capitalist culture hasn’t already sucked out of you. 

I guess I understand, thinking this way makes it convenient to stay working mindlessly like an ant and only caring about your own lot in life, never truly questioning why it “has” to be this way. But really, why? We could literally have a global revolution tomorrow if people really wanted to unite. Because you’re afraid to lose your job? You have kids to feed? That’s part of the problem, knowing everything going on in this world and continuing to bring children into inevitable suffering just because everyone else is popping out babies and you don’t want to be an outcast, or a selfish desire for “legacy”. Or maybe you accept the status quo unconditionally because your parents told you “it’s just the way it is” when you were children? Bullshit, that’s the first time they tried to kill the passion out of you and you let them. Chances are that most of our parents / adults told their kids deflating things like this to perpetuate the just-world fallacy for themselves and avoid guilt about their own lack of action in making the world a better place. Then they bring more children into the world and indoctrinate them with the same sick values, and the generational cycle of mass suffering continues, beautiful isn’t it? But I know most people will probably say I should go to a shrink for this rant and that I’m the crazy one for not seeing the value in humanity when this is how we CHOOSE (yes it’s a choice, not “human nature”) to live.

There really isn’t much of a difference between the mentality of today’s neoliberal consumerist zombies and people like Hitler’s supporters. You neoliberals are just very slick with the way you do things, but it’s all done under the same wicked intentions of oppression and dominance for the sake of dominance. We literally have more than enough resources globally to give every human being a house, keep them decently fed, etc. But no, the majority of you narcissistic chimpanzees keep insisting “competition / hyperindividualism is good, survival of the fittest, cooperation / collectivism and being kind is for the weak.” Same idiots that go around saying things like “respect must be earned, not given” and “telling it like it is” to justify their prejudices and discriminatory actions.  No asshole, I’m the one telling it like it is, and I know you don’t like the actual truth because it puts you and your peers’ everyday shortcomings on a big projector for you all to see. 

And before anyone complains, yes, I understand there are hundreds of millions of people in the first world and SOME (very few let’s be honest) don’t go along with the status quo and try to be part of the change they envision for the world. This is a rant directed at the (middle / bourgeois class) MAJORITY. Honestly, so-called Democracy has proven to be the biggest tyranny of all. In other systems, there was always a distinct group challenging the authorities at play and they weren’t completely wiped into silence. If they were wiped via violence, it was later understood as a cruel act that shouldn’t be mimicked. But because the word “democracy” is falsely used to describe this inhumane system and sounds good on paper, the masses shut down people who rightfully question how “free” this illusion truly is and think they’re the real fascists. Since they don’t use violence and just shut these people out of the discussion via cultural power, those people have no viable way to make their point without looking like the bad guys. And while I don’t believe we live in a meritocracy, the fact that most people believe we do and their justifications for mistreating the “lower end” people show me that the concept as a whole is inherently bad for humanity due to the callous mentality it perpetuates. We are all slaves to the judgments of the majority, no matter how delusional they become. 

At least with one central leadership figure, you have a CHANCE of bringing in someone with a good head on their shoulders and high level of compassion. Your odds of finding one admirable person to lead are much higher than getting the majority to love and respect one another regardless of differences. The majority will always keep an ignorant and inhumane mentality toward anyone not exactly like them, and therefore will maintain a cold, despicable value system in society.  As a result, they fall for the lies and deceitful “charisma” of sadistic narcissists and propel them into positions of power / influence time and time again. Good, pure-hearted people who mind their business and try not to judge others over personal characteristics are treated like the exact opposite. They don’t participate in what most call “banter” so they’re viewed by the majority as “lame / soft” or “too boring / sensitive.” As a result, good people are usually targets of unprovoked bullying, abuse and / or isolation. Why? Because so-called civilized modern people have become so dumb and backward, that intending to be a good person from the beginning without having ulterior motives is viewed as “weakness.” This world WANTS you to be manipulating and transactional in everything you do and everyone you deal with. When people who refuse to play the game are permanently othered and inevitably deemed losers and outcasts, the society then acts like it was their fault and they must be truly lacking something inside them to not be able to integrate. No, these less than 5% of people just couldn’t allow themselves to be everyday sadistic sociopaths like the majority. 

It’s funny how Trump called Africa a “shithole” when from a character standpoint, even with their own flaws, people there have more redeeming qualities in one finger than your average Westerner has in their entire bloodline, ESPECIALLY Westerners that make close to six figures or more. Less wealthy people in this country at least TRY to help each other in limited ways sometimes and tend to have a lot more principles that they live by, for better or worse. There are many flawed principles but I can respect any principled person far more than the rich and middle class who push this “sell your soul and existence to the highest bidder” bootlicker mentality on everyone. If you refuse to be a part of bourgeois culture and play the game, you will be concern trolled and gaslighted by these people. They’ll say “grow up” or “you’ll never become successful thinking this way.” To these people, growing up means relentlessly chasing arbitrary standards of prosperity and becoming a compliant worker bee who never questions any of society’s authorities. Well, I say fuck you and fuck your media-crafted definitions of success, happiness and prosperity. All three are treated like a zero-sum game where crabs in a bucket must prevent the others from getting enough for themselves. People want to avoid concepts like misanthropy and antinatalism because they’re deemed as “negative and divisive.” All the while deliberately ignoring the fact that even so-called “positive” concepts have been bastardized by the puppet-masters of this world to keep the masses controlling, hostile and hypercompetitive toward one another. Humans want to continue living in strife despite the fact that true scarcity, meaning lack of enough physical resources to support everyone, DOES NOT EXIST and will only decrease as technology finds new ways to support sustainability and preserve life. At least misanthropy and antinatalism stemmed from concern for the greater environment and a desire to improve life for the people already here. People who buy into the “cult of individualistic positivity” seem to be primarily concerned with self-promotion and getting recognition above all else, even better if it’s at someone’s expense and they can feel like they knocked someone down a peg while pulling themselves up. The crazy part is that mentalities like this are promoted by society as “self-love” and “confidence.” Cultures of cutthroat scarcity are promoted as inevitable reality while cultures of abundance and compassion are quickly dismissed as childish naïveté. It is ALL cultural, not based on the physical reality that is abundance. 

At this point, I’m allergic to anyone this heinous society considers “successful” and want to keep at least three football fields of distance between me and those types of people. Write me off as a deluded loser if you like, I stopped caring about petty BS like that a long time ago. I only care about one thing now, and that’s knowing the true reality. Things probably won’t change, but I need to keep my eye out so I can at least avoid the madness myself. I’m a second generation immigrant native born in the USA, and I’m deliberately moving to a remote “third world” country to live on less money (and less stress) and to get away from this toxic, inhumane social Darwinist culture. No matter how many people’s lives are ruined by this system, the general public continues to go along with its twisted Machiavellian values and sweep problems / victims under the rug, all to pretend “everything is positive and I am in control of everything that happens in my life.” Material difficulties aside, at least people elsewhere have a somewhat closer relationship with reality (they have to for survival) and treat each other more like human beings. I’ll gladly deal with increased material inconveniences over this spiritually bankrupt cultural wasteland we call the West.

835,Lol time,"Before this situation, I was a social democrat. I’m seriously considering moving further left, because what the fuck is this shit lmaoo

So today, I went to work (I’m a wheelchair assistant at the airport). I leave my shit in a cart next to the wheelchair area we regularly visit to pick up passengers, etc. I had a lunch bag with my car keys as well as my drivers license in it along with a lunch. For some context, that area is where most employees leave their stuff. When I get called for my lunch break, I head to the area and my stuff is gone. After making sure it wasn’t in the lost and found or DOA didn’t sweep the whole floor, the police and I came to the conclusion it was stolen. Okay, my fault, shouldn’t have left it in the open.

However, dispatch as well as the managers knew about this situation as I notified them several times. I later call the GM to further describe the situation to her and ask for either a week off (to get a new license and keys) or a schedule change so I have reliable transportation to and from work. Basically, she placed all responsibility on me which is fine, but rejected my requests. Didn’t provide a single alternative. 

This is hilarious, and after talking to multiple employees, I discovered that the company and management aren’t the best people. Saw it coming. Is there anything I can do besides quit at this point?

837,I had a dream that I was fired from my job,"Last night I had a dream that I was fired from my job, at the end of my shift I was kicked out of all my accounts and I couldn't log back in with my password. I then saw a meeting notification pop up on my calendar for an hour before my shift the next day including myself, my boss, the CEO and HR, it didn't outright say I was fired but I somehow knew what it was about.  

I immediately felt happy, excited, relieved and free, that same kind of feeling when you wake up as a kid and find out there's a snow day and school is cancelled. It was a feeling of freedom and endless possibilities that no planned day off, vacation or weekend could match. I spent all day looking forward to the meeting where I would get fired.  

I don't remember a lot of details from the meeting other than I was fired, I got an unexpected severance package and I found it difficult to contain my excitement and keep a straight face which seemed to confuse everyone else in the meeting.  

That's kind of where it ended, nothing crazy or unrealistic happened, I was fired from my job, I had some money and unemployment so I didn't have to work for a few months and I felt happy for the first time in a long while.

It will also prevent employee illness from overwork and allow them to pursue further education to qualify for better jobs.  


I personally don't believe this proposal will have much impact because it is only a recommendation and the business culture in Japan sets high expectations on employees. There is also a concern about potential pay cuts- employees won't opt into the 4-day work week if it means making less money. However, a part of me wishes to see this proposal come to fruition and put the spotlight on fewer working days globally.",False,o7065g,levi_j_s,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o7065g/japan_proposes_fourday_working_week_to_improve/,3,1

845,"If All Goes According To Plan, I Won't Have To Work Until At Least Next April and Will Still Get Paid","For the most part, I won't have to work. 

I'm on a leave of absence right now and stopped working in early May due to anxiety and depression and stress. The job I'm at is horrible but before I quit or hopped into another job, I decided to use them for their benefits!

So I got denied for short term disability due to a pre existing condition clause and because I haven't been there at least a year BUT I did get approved for state disability, so i'm getting paid for the 4-6 weeks i've been off work. The only thing is...state disability pay is a JOKE and pays less than unemployment, so I thought of another plan to get more money and not work.

I'm  going to return within the next week or two and got my doctor to say I was ready to return. In my state, you can take paid family leave and get paid up to $1000 a week for 12 weeks. That's much lower than what I make but is enough to cover bills and to save extra money. 

So I get to apply for that after the 4th of July but I need to be ""active"" to apply so that's why i'm going back to work. 

As soon as I get back to work, i'm going to apply for paid family leave. I don't see a reason why I wouldn't get approved as my mother's health is fucked up and i'm going to have her doctor say that i'm going to be her caregiver. 

So this will allow me to be off for 3 months/12 weeks. 

If I don't go out right away, I'll begin the leave at the beginning of August. 

When I return to work, even if i'm there for July, they won't have me doing shit because it will take a while to get me back on board. Meanwhile, since I have been out on leave, if they try to fire me for requesting a new leave, that will be clear retaliation and my state has a no retaliation policy for requesting paid family leave which is why i'm going to do it RIGHT when I return. 

So basically I won't have to do shit when I return to work anyway, then will be on leave again August-November. 

When I return in November, holidays will be approaching. Again, I won't have to do shit but attend meetings. At the most run a shitty report. 

I will request vacation as much as I have available from November to December as well. 

Once the first week of January gets here, I will actually qualify for 12 weeks of FMLA for 12 weeks and up to 26 weeks of paid short term disability! I will at a minimum get paid vacation and sick time for FMLA and will just tell my doctor I can't work anymore and have him sign off to go back on STD. 

So basically I don't give a fuck about the company I work for. I am going to keep taking leave as much as fucking possible, come back for a few weeks, then fucking REPEAT. 

They can kiss my ass. I want to date, drink travel, and just enjoy my youth.

846,LinkedIn Stories,"LinkedIn is full of narrow-minded, egotistical people who brags about their success to the point where they think being workaholic makes up their whole personality. They are brainwashed into thinking that working towards a “dream”; a sheep under capitalism is the end all. More often they so engulfed in their own “work” that they feel the need to post cliched stories after stories, most often sob stories, about how their childhood is pitiful and how “hard” they worked to get where they are. The best part is when they brag about being the first generation to graduate even though college, TAFE and universities have become more and more accessible. As a result, a lot of people hold degrees in different states, so I don’t know why they think they’re so special. The reality is that without work, these people have no personality, no stance, no nothing; because a toxic work culture is all they have ever known. They are too indulged  in their own bubble that they can t see the manipulation behind the phrase “chase your dreams and find career in something you love.” How about being a friend, a partner, a caring and giving human being ? How about having hobbies and doing things out of your free time? We have been bombarded with the same old 40hr/week, 9-5 job, wasting our majority of life on working and working until exhaustion and not being able to do things we love or spend time with those who we love dearly. The capitalists are creating a nation of robots that can’t take a mental break because mental health is not taken seriously, and LinkedIn is further perpetuating this disgusting workaholic stance .

I've done it - I've been the capitalist. I've started my own business and made lots of money and benefited from the labor of others to enrich myself. Don't get me wrong: it's really nice not to worry about money and to have even a modicum of actual agency in directing your life in this capitalist hellscape. But it's wrong - even then I wasn't happy - I didn't have a home or a community and the more money I made the further I felt pulled away from other people.

869,Dear First Worlders...,"*WARNING* The world (ruled by the callous mentalities created by the global cult of capitalism and illusion of meritocracy) has taken me to the point of being a misanthrope (yes I’m honest about it). That being said, I don’t hate anyone as an individual and believe humanity doesn’t have to be this way, though my hope for change dwindles every day. My misanthropy is multiplied by 10 toward privileged people because of their dehumanizing approach toward everyone else. This is a very passionate, angry rant directed at no one in this sub in particular, but directed at the general public in the first world at the same time. And this sub is the only place on the Internet where I don’t think the post will get 100% knee-jerk hate reactions, though I expect a lot of hate from bootlicker types. Read at your own risk. 

To my (temporary, I’m leaving soon) neighbors in the first world, never forget you are choosing to live like SCUM who support thousands of injustices with your daily actions and self-centered attitudes toward everything. You allow yourselves to be ruled by war criminals (both sides are the same corrupt BS) year in and year out while willfully turning a blind eye to the normalized genocide, forced poverty, and segregation your leaders perpetuate in all areas of the world. The only issues you pay attention to in current events and history are those that directly affect your self-interest or feed your biases. You also create an overinflated ego and sense of self-importance from your meaningless corporate jobs, most of which don’t make the world a better place and actively make it worse by hurting the environment and making corrupt Dark Triad people even more prosperous. You are a useful pawn for these people and that is all they will ever see you as, imagine thinking you’re some big shot credible person with authority for being just another obedient cog in a system of torture and death. Many of you almost subconsciously look down on the working class, illegal, and low wage workers in your countries, even though they’re literally the backbones of your infrastructure and the main force that allows you to go to that cushy office job every day and buy lunch with no worries of anything falling apart. 

Then, in your free time, instead of studying things like sociology / spirituality and trying to progress the world toward one of love and equality, you get on the Internet to bully strangers over trivial nonsense - looks, age, income, intellect, disabilities, mental health status, popularity, lifestyle, size, level of “success,” choosing to stay single or a loner, how social they are, how many people they slept with or didn’t sleep with, which religion / spiritual beliefs they have or lack thereof, and any personality traits / viewpoints that you’ve been trained by toxic parents / society to hate and don’t conform ad nauseam to your narrow comfort zone and worldview. You spend every waking hour online and IRL being as callous, unempathetic, and dismissive toward people and their experiences / feelings as humanly possible. I’ve seen so many instances of people who are genuinely struggling sharing their experiences online, only to be blamed for all their traumas by a bunch of privileged overgrown babies who are obviously out of touch with (global) reality and never faced any real adversity compared to others in those “shithole” countries they never think about. Or even compared to people in those “rough” neighborhoods of their own country that they only bring up when the “poor people commit more crime” narrative is mentioned. Never any mention of what causes the poverty though, just the blame / shame game left and right. And we all know how common fake friendships are in first-world countries, with so many people out there who want to know your deepest, darkest secrets just to use them against you or to take advantage. Vultures. I’ve talked to several people who are either from non-first world countries or lived in them extensively. They all say that friendships are not like this in other parts of the world, it’s a problem of the West or at least more pronounced. Here, people make frenemies instead of friends (regardless of gender) and it’s nearly universal. I think the reason for the toxic nature of relationships here is that almost every damn pursuit in Western culture devolves to a game of one-upsmanship and getting a leg up on somebody. Ah, there’s that good old capitalism-fueled competition rearing it’s head again. Patriarchy is another cultural disease that adds to the prevalence of hypercompetition as well.

Victim blaming, prejudiced criticisms under the guise of “tough love / advice” and casual gaslighting (of all kinds, in all situations) seems to be something people in your cultures do for amusement online, never thinking about the psychological harm that may have been done to the other person. It just shows how fragile your egos are and how they need to be preserved 24/7 against the slightest deviation. All of this insecurity despite the fact that you people go on and on about how you live in the “best countries in the world.” If something doesn’t align with your narrow scope of vision, you will refuse to consider or even hear a single word that the other person is saying and abuse them for expressing themselves in a way that you don’t approve. All so you can pretend that the world is A-okay, that you’re not complicit in thousands of injustices that occur everyday, and that anyone who gets mistreated, abused, or even killed brought it on themselves and “deserved” it. It’s like you deliberately turn off any semblance of humanity and empathy that neoliberal capitalist culture hasn’t already sucked out of you. 

I guess I understand, thinking this way makes it convenient to stay working mindlessly like an ant and only caring about your own lot in life, never truly questioning why it “has” to be this way. But really, why? We could literally have a global revolution tomorrow if people really wanted to unite. Because you’re afraid to lose your job? You have kids to feed? That’s part of the problem, knowing everything going on in this world and continuing to bring children into inevitable suffering just because everyone else is popping out babies and you don’t want to be an outcast, or a selfish desire for “legacy”. Or maybe you accept the status quo unconditionally because your parents told you “it’s just the way it is” when you were children? Bullshit, that’s the first time they tried to kill the passion out of you and you let them. Chances are that most of our parents / adults told their kids deflating things like this to perpetuate the just-world fallacy for themselves and avoid guilt about their own lack of action in making the world a better place. Then they bring more children into the world and indoctrinate them with the same sick values, and the generational cycle of mass suffering continues, beautiful isn’t it? But I know most people will probably say I should go to a shrink for this rant and that I’m the crazy one for not seeing the value in humanity when this is how we CHOOSE (yes it’s a choice, not “human nature”) to live.

There really isn’t much of a difference between the mentality of today’s neoliberal consumerist zombies and people like Hitler’s supporters. You neoliberals are just very slick with the way you do things, but it’s all done under the same wicked intentions of oppression and dominance for the sake of dominance. We literally have more than enough resources globally to give every human being a house, keep them decently fed, etc. But no, the majority of you narcissistic chimpanzees keep insisting “competition / hyperindividualism is good, survival of the fittest, cooperation / collectivism and being kind is for the weak.” Same idiots that go around saying things like “respect must be earned, not given” and “telling it like it is” to justify their prejudices and discriminatory actions.  No asshole, I’m the one telling it like it is, and I know you don’t like the actual truth because it puts you and your peers’ everyday shortcomings on a big projector for you all to see. 

And before anyone complains, yes, I understand there are hundreds of millions of people in the first world and SOME (very few let’s be honest) don’t go along with the status quo and try to be part of the change they envision for the world. This is a rant directed at the (middle / bourgeois class) MAJORITY. Honestly, so-called Democracy has proven to be the biggest tyranny of all. In other systems, there was always a distinct group challenging the authorities at play and they weren’t completely wiped into silence. If they were wiped via violence, it was later understood as a cruel act that shouldn’t be mimicked. But because the word “democracy” is falsely used to describe this inhumane system and sounds good on paper, the masses shut down people who rightfully question how “free” this illusion truly is and think they’re the real fascists. Since they don’t use violence and just shut these people out of the discussion via cultural power, those people have no viable way to make their point without looking like the bad guys. And while I don’t believe we live in a meritocracy, the fact that most people believe we do and their justifications for mistreating the “lower end” people show me that the concept as a whole is inherently bad for humanity due to the callous mentality it perpetuates. We are all slaves to the judgments of the majority, no matter how delusional they become. 

At least with one central leadership figure, you have a CHANCE of bringing in someone with a good head on their shoulders and high level of compassion. Your odds of finding one admirable person to lead are much higher than getting the majority to love and respect one another regardless of differences. The majority will always keep an ignorant and inhumane mentality toward anyone not exactly like them, and therefore will maintain a cold, despicable value system in society.  As a result, they fall for the lies and deceitful “charisma” of sadistic narcissists and propel them into positions of power / influence time and time again. Good, pure-hearted people who mind their business and try not to judge others over personal characteristics are treated like the exact opposite. They don’t participate in what most call “banter” so they’re viewed by the majority as “lame / soft” or “too boring / sensitive.” As a result, good people are usually targets of unprovoked bullying, abuse and / or isolation. Why? Because so-called civilized modern people have become so dumb and backward, that intending to be a good person from the beginning without having ulterior motives is viewed as “weakness.” This world WANTS you to be manipulating and transactional in everything you do and everyone you deal with. When people who refuse to play the game are permanently othered and inevitably deemed losers and outcasts, the society then acts like it was their fault and they must be truly lacking something inside them to not be able to integrate. No, these less than 5% of people just couldn’t allow themselves to be everyday sadistic sociopaths like the majority. 

It’s funny how Trump called Africa a “shithole” when from a character standpoint, even with their own flaws, people there have more redeeming qualities in one finger than your average Westerner has in their entire bloodline, ESPECIALLY Westerners that make close to six figures or more. Less wealthy people in this country at least TRY to help each other in limited ways sometimes and tend to have a lot more principles that they live by, for better or worse. There are many flawed principles but I can respect any principled person far more than the rich and middle class who push this “sell your soul and existence to the highest bidder” bootlicker mentality on everyone. If you refuse to be a part of bourgeois culture and play the game, you will be concern trolled and gaslighted by these people. They’ll say “grow up” or “you’ll never become successful thinking this way.” To these people, growing up means relentlessly chasing arbitrary standards of prosperity and becoming a compliant worker bee who never questions any of society’s authorities. Well, I say fuck you and fuck your media-crafted definitions of success, happiness and prosperity. All three are treated like a zero-sum game where crabs in a bucket must prevent the others from getting enough for themselves. People want to avoid concepts like misanthropy and antinatalism because they’re deemed as “negative and divisive.” All the while deliberately ignoring the fact that even so-called “positive” concepts have been bastardized by the puppet-masters of this world to keep the masses controlling, hostile and hypercompetitive toward one another. Humans want to continue living in strife despite the fact that true scarcity, meaning lack of enough physical resources to support everyone, DOES NOT EXIST and will only decrease as technology finds new ways to support sustainability and preserve life. At least misanthropy and antinatalism stemmed from concern for the greater environment and a desire to improve life for the people already here. People who buy into the “cult of individualistic positivity” seem to be primarily concerned with self-promotion and getting recognition above all else, even better if it’s at someone’s expense and they can feel like they knocked someone down a peg while pulling themselves up. The crazy part is that mentalities like this are promoted by society as “self-love” and “confidence.” Cultures of cutthroat scarcity are promoted as inevitable reality while cultures of abundance and compassion are quickly dismissed as childish naïveté. It is ALL cultural, not based on the physical reality that is abundance. 

At this point, I’m allergic to anyone this heinous society considers “successful” and want to keep at least three football fields of distance between me and those types of people. Write me off as a deluded loser if you like, I stopped caring about petty BS like that a long time ago. I only care about one thing now, and that’s knowing the true reality. Things probably won’t change, but I need to keep my eye out so I can at least avoid the madness myself. I’m a second generation immigrant native born in the USA, and I’m deliberately moving to a remote “third world” country to live on less money (and less stress) and to get away from this toxic, inhumane social Darwinist culture. No matter how many people’s lives are ruined by this system, the general public continues to go along with its twisted Machiavellian values and sweep problems / victims under the rug, all to pretend “everything is positive and I am in control of everything that happens in my life.” Material difficulties aside, at least people elsewhere have a somewhat closer relationship with reality (they have to for survival) and treat each other more like human beings. I’ll gladly deal with increased material inconveniences over this spiritually bankrupt cultural wasteland we call the West.

885,"I only view work as what the ''job'' can do for me, not the other way around.","I've been working capitalistic bullshit retail and food service jobs since i was 14 years old. I have been getting bashed by the people around me since then for my ''inability to hold down a job''. basically, i lived in a small town where everyone kept the same highschool job til they moved for college, and all college graduates kept the same job til they retired or died.   


I, however, only worked at places where i had friends and i had fun with it and i fucked around because i never took the market seriously, and the second my capitalistic sheep managers started giving me a hard time, i would quit. while i was working constantly, i never lasted more than 7 months at a job because i would not put up with anyone's shit.   


  
So many people say that this is bad, looks bad for me and my resume. and yet, it never impaired me from finding a job. wonder why that is? maybe because it doesnt fucking matter, capitalism always needs new slaves. so the way i see it is, i got to experience different jobs, different levels of bullshit, but got to make friends and memories along the way, and i intend to keep going.  


  
i dont see the point in going to fancy university and getting a fancy degree just to then sit at a desk for 40 years.   


I see these silly little jobs as much more entertaining and this might sound dumb, but they allow me to travel. i have 3 citizenships and in any of my countries i can just work a little retail job and afford a garbage little apartment for me and my cat and just vibe and discover places and meet people and make it worth my while, and really, work fades into the background.  


so while i hate the idea of selling my soul and body to capitalism as a forever minimum wage worker, i definitely see that it can have some advantages and work for me.   


plus, sometimes there are perks or i get a few cents above minimum wage, and it all adds to the delusional fun that is working to be able to survive. idk, anyone else have this attitude that, while work is rotted, we can make it work for our goals and plans?  


  
also, retail is bullshit and there is no one more stupid than ''the customer''.

I go to college out of state so it’s only going to be a summer job, but holy hell I wanted to walk out my first shift even if my parents would’ve killed me. 

I can’t believe customers are so disrespectful to leave food everywhere for the employees to clean up. And that employees have to clean it all up in dress shoes, black slacks, and the typical fancy movie theater outfit for minimum wage. I was sweating the whole time and then when I moved on to be “trained” at concessions, nobody taught me how to operate the register. I have a lot of money saved from my last job and I’m only going to be here for some weeks but I just absolutely dread it.

Long story short I have to live on my own, parents aren't okay with my sexuality so moving in with family isn't an option. My rent for my 1b 1b apt in Ga is going from 900/month to 1400/month and is in a terrible area. Constant fights, terrible neighbors etc. Not worth 1400. Also, my SO took a really good job a bit north of us so we are looking to relocate so her commute is not 1.5 hours each way. I turned in my 60 day notice to move and I cant find anything remotely affordable. The area I live in now has a terrible market due to a tornado that displaced ALOT of people. The area my SO works is more urban (expensive) and would really cause a financial strain.

To tie this into the sub, my boss informed me if I stay local and don't have to work remotely I will get a raise. But if the house I find is too far and I have to wfh, my pay will stay the same. My 1 year with the company is August which is when I am moving and I feel as if I should get a raise anyways. Not just if I can still come to the office and take up space. I am just so fed up with everything. I am tired of busting my ass at work to not even be able to afford an ok RENTAL house. I am tired of not making a livable wage and constantly struggling even though i tried to do everything right.

Now we have some of the most powerful economies in the world, there is currently more money on earth than ever before and we can't even guarantee basics like food and shelter. That is deliberate by the ruling class. We have become so advanced that we should be demanding other things that ensure living standards like free dental care for all.

952,"Avoid the ""Creative field"" /rant","If you have a ""creative "" passion please for the love of God avoid going to school for it in hopes of working a job.

Let me clarify further. Creative fields at one time we're literally just like any other trade. Sculpting, painting and so on. These fields required a shit ton of hard work, study and practice outside the workday to get good at. And these people were paid well.

But Creative work today? Fuck that. After decades of ""everyone is an artist"" bullshit. That entire field has been ran into the ground.

Look up Graphic Designer on indeed or LinkedIn.
Look up the stats of the amount of time art students in college spend outside of class studying. ( Just as much if not more than lawyers).

The creative field or creative tech has become undeniably unstable.

Entry level jobs.
3-5 years experience.
BA Degree.
$12-$15/hr 
Long list of responsibilities that are literally other fields and require multiple roles.



If you could understand the amount of work it takes to build a Good portfolio. Having to spend ungodly amounts of time keeping up with new software, new trends, psychology, communication and marketing. On top of having to have a social media presence. It's mind boggling stupid.

And this isn't even mentioning how much money software and training is going to constantly cost you. I must've invested in literally 30+ programs by now that all cost me atlease $200-$1500.

Want to talk work life balance? Imagine having to spend 40+ hours a week outside of work keeping up and improving your skills? All unpaid.

Job interviews? Imagine while working full-time for shit wages, having to constantly do ""art test"" for companies. 3d artist taking 2-4 weeks on these test just to be rejected for a job paying sub $30k.

The best thing you can do is to take your skills and work for yourself. Create a product in china, sell it retail in the USA.

I've worked countless jobs that if I was paid 5-10% off of my work commission wise would've increased my pay $100k a year. Looking back I could've made millions off of my labor. Vs being paid shit while others who do nothing profit.

There is a reason why almost all designers don't last in the field past 50. The pay is awful. Jobs are unstable as fuck. They either jump to code, or are lucky to land a director spot paying $50k+ a year.
$50-60k for a job after 20 years is pathetic.

It's almost like all the BS middle management made up jobs pay stupid high wages, while all the jobs that require the actual skills and labor pay shit.

954,Let’s do the existence math for a single 40 hour a week full time job. Spoiler: fuck capitalism.,"There are 168 hours available in a 7 day week.

Remove the 40 hours just for the job and we’re left with 128.

Doctors recommend 8 hours of sleep a night, so take another 72. We are now left with 56 hours. We’re not done.

Let’s be conservative and estimate you spend just 2 hours commuting to and from your job 5 times a week: we now have 62 hours left.

Now if we spend just a single hour a day preparing our food to keep us alive, we have  55.

1.5 hours per day to clean, grocery shop, car maintenance, garden maintenance etc: 44.5 hours remain.

44.5

For a single person with no children working a single 40 hour full time job with no overtime, we have less than 2 days out of 7 to exist.

Add a child to the mix? You’re screwed.

960,I think I finally just got my boomer dad to start critically thinking about capitalism,"My Dad is 76 and I am 36.  I startedrealizing the truth about capitalism in The United States and to blame for all our problems (and personally mine) a few years ago.  I have mostly unlearned my internalized Capitalism (I hope).

I overheard my Dad on the phone with my grandma (92) an hour ago trying to defend himself for collecting unemployment.  He retired in 2004 but became a crossing guard a few years ago for some extra cash and something enjoyable to do to pass time and he loves the kids.  He decided to go back on unemployment (since he hasn't worked during the Pandemic) after having a quad bypass earlier this year.  I heard him say ""Well I've been working sine I was 17, for over 50 years.  I've paid into the system so why shouldn't I benefit it?"" ""Of course I don't need it but its still my money"" ""I earned it"" etc... he and I could have had this conversation because he has never understood why I can't work in America with a disability.  He called me lazy for years ever since my first paid leave.

After the call ended, he told my Mom about it and mentioned some other things I didn't hear.  I just said ""Oh, well, that's just internalized capitalism.  She's 92, she's not gonna get it"" and shrugged as I left the kitchen.  My Dad stopped me, which is surprising because normally would have rolled his eyes and ignored me.  He said ""No, stop, what do you mean?"" I was not in the mood to have a pointless argument so I was like ""its nothing"" as I kept walking.  He said ""No, please, what do you mean by that?""

I told him that in the US we truly do not believe anyone is allowed to be happy and healthy unless they earn the right to do so by working long hours for little pay.  We are under the illusion that if we work hard, we'll eventually get everything we want and need and be respected.  I then asked him if he knew what the worst possible thing an American can do is.  No response.  I then told him ""Poor.  Poor is the worst thing you can be in America.  No matter how long you work or how little you rest, if you're making minimum wage - or worse, are unemployed - then that is your fault.  This is why we treat homeless people like shit.  This is why we have toothless poor folks in middle America worshipping Trump and hating on the poor.  Its cognitive dissonance.""

He didn't say anything - and if you know my Dad, that speaks volumes.  Normally he would have blown me off in a boomer tantrum.

Perhaps is not too late, I dunno.  But I do want him to start thinking critically about this.  He's much older and very privileged (again, the cognitive dissonance, he grew up in poverty) so I don't expect much, but its something.",False,o6ka4j,MayflowerKennelClub,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o6ka4j/i_think_i_finally_just_got_my_boomer_dad_to_start/,55,1
961,First interview after applying to hundreds of jobs and it sucked!,"I’ve been applying all over to get out of customer service and I found a gem of a job. Administrative Assistant, great pay, good hours, smaller company, close to home. I was excited for the interview. Had the pre-call and was asked if I could come in tomorrow for an in-person interview. I said scheduling is tough with my current job. I would need to provide notice to be off. He suggested a video chat instead. The next day, (today) I went into the virtual waiting room a minute before the interview and waited. About 15 minutes passed and I contacted the hiring manager. He thought this was an in person interview. I reminded him that it was not. He asked me to wait another 10 minutes because he was in the middle of something. We finally connected and he asked me all the standard interview questions, but he pushed for personal answers as well to a point that I felt uncomfortable.

He mentioned attendance and said, “We can’t have this person out or calling out because then their work would be on someone else.” Which I understand. He asked, “Is that going to be a problem for you and would your previous employers tell me that you were calling out all the time?”

962,Do bullshit computer desk jobs make you feel like shit/ age you?,"Does staring at a computer all day make you feel like shit? I'm studying for the bar where I've been forced to look at a computer for 8-10 hours a day for the last few weeks and I feel like its making me look and feel like shit. I was able to duck my way through law school with half the computer screen time most days... Now that I'm doing what I imagine to be more realistically indicative of what an actual attorney (and most of the office-bound workforce) does all day (that is, staring at a screen in one form or another) I'm realizing how much it sucks and is potentially affecting my health. Despite maintaining a decent diet (fresh foods, very little processed) and regular exercise (swim and weights 5 days a week) I've noticed the following;

Skin oily and breaking out

Back and neck pain

Dry eyes

General fatigue

Brain fog

Prone to a generalized anxiety and/or melancholy thoughts

I swear my face is getting longer and older looking... Might be developing a bovine-like gaze... Wtf? 

If this is the deal, then this shit ain't worth it. I think i'd rather be broke and doing something that doesn't involve cubicle work (most attorneys are glorified lackey cubicle slaves, (change my mind) but that's beside the point of this post). Anyone else think this screen/ cubicle shit is *really* bad for you? Any good science out there on this? I *know*, I get it, I shouldn't have gone to law school, so some of it may be the *type* of bullshit I'm engaging in on the screen... But how much of it is just the nature of working on a screen for such a long time in an office regardless of the content?",False,o61b5d,chacunsatasse,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o61b5d/do_bullshit_computer_desk_jobs_make_you_feel_like/,32,1

964,[POTENTIALLY TRIGGERING] I want to be a housewife so bad...,"**\[This post may contain heavy subjects related to mental illnesses and death. Please don't read if you feel uncomfortable\]**

At first this may seem like a First World Problem, but I live in a third-world country, so gotcha! ;)

I'm 27 and I work with IT - 9 to 5. I like it, my company is awesome compared to the stories I've read here (you guys are amazing for putting up with this a$$h0lery!)

I was a housewife during 2020, and I quite enjoyed looking after my husband's needs, and not being anxious 101% of the time, scared I might get fired for no reason, or hearing any kind of scolding from a boss, no matter how subtle.

I earn more than my husband (yay feminism?!), but I have severe depression and I've always felt I didn't belong in this harsh world since I was too weak to live in it like a regular adult. 

I asked my  shrink: ""Is that all there is? Working 40 hours per week and being too tired to do anything else? No pleasure in doing anything ever?"" and they were actually sweet, but blunt: ""Actually, yes, but most people are able to handle it with their own defense mechanism. And you have to find which one works best for you"".

I told them I understand their job is to keep me alive and well, but I've tried every medicine you can think of and overspent my hard-earned money on alternative therapy as well, to no avail.

People I know are okay with just having some beers or whatnot on the weekends to get away from it all, but sometimes I just think life is not worth living *sober*. I take my benzodiazepines to get through most days, and I know this could even cause Alzheimer's\* in the long run. But... then again, so what? If life expectancy is 70 y.o., for example, that means I'll just die a bit sooner than most, and being too afraid to try to off myself again, I think it sounds okay to me. Less years of work, right?

Every Sunday evening you'll find me crying on my husband's shoulder saying I want to rest my mind and go to sleep, but going to sleep means Monday will come sooner. I want to d!e, but I no longer make plans for it, thank goodness.

Yesterday I had a mental breakdown and warned my boss as soon as possible, but I can tell they weren't pleased. They're from North America, I'm from South America, **so I'm guessing there's a culture difference regarding mental health?**

Also, what's **your** defense mechanism as a mentally healthy person? (as healthy as anyone can be...)

*No mean comments, please, just trying to vent a bit and make friends! Thank you for your time if you read through all that!*

Neither of these things require people to be forced to come into the office, and neither are things that are pleasant when people are forced to do them. People don't brainstorm if they'd rather be someplace else.

And therein lies the problem. Every analyst, developer and coder out there who just wants to be left the fuck alone is soon going to start raising hell. If your job is some bullshit made-up corporate governance nonsense and you spend your days enabling capabilities, don't poke the hornet's nest.

raising retirement ages, but backed away amid a public
‘outcry. Now it feels it can wait no longer.

Current retirement ages were set in the 1950s, when the
average person was expected to die before reaching that
stage. For most men in China the retirement age is 60,
much lower than the average of 64.2 in the OECD, a club
mostly of rich countries. For female civil servants the
age is 55; for blue-collar women its 50.

The pressure for China to act is evident, but the
‘government appears not yet to have decided how to
reform the system.

Click the link in our big to read more on why China's
efforts to raise the average retirement age is facing stiff
opposition.

1005,Absolutely hate my job and wish I could quit/WFH again,"I hate the job that I'm currently working. I do data entry and make/receive calls to various companies. It is boring and soul-crushing. We were working from home for a while, and that made it more bearable for my mental health and life in general. However, they forced me to come back into the office a few months ago and I have just been very miserable since.

They're also requiring me to work 45 hours a week and that's taking it's toll on me. I'm also taking a coding bootcamp so I can get a better paying job, and juggling both has also been a struggle (though I've been doing really well in the bootcamp).

I wish I had more savings and could quit, but not only having to pay rent and bills, but my loan for the bootcamp is forcing me to stay. I wish I could WFH again, but they really want us in the office again. I don't even have a car, so commuting is a nightmare. I have had so many moments working here where I just wanted to stand up, walk away, and never step foot in this office again.

I spent a week out of state with friends abouta week ago, and the difference in how I felt then and now is night and day.

1022,Death and Taxes - a narrative-based game with strong antiwork sentiments,"I have been playing this one game that would may be of interest to you. It's an indie narrative-based, point and click game called [Death and Taxes](https://deathandtaxesgame.com/).

You  play the Grim Reaper and spend your days in a corporate after life setting just stamping who lives and who dies. The people whom you pass  judgement on are referred to by their age, name, occupation, and a brief description of what they have done/are doing. They aren't referred to by gender but rather third person pronouns - they/their. You are also referred to as ""Grim"", your employee number, or  ""you"" as opposed to him/he or she/her or \[insert name\]. You get to clothe your Grim Reaper however you like. You get to make dialogue choices, and you  get to make choices in regards to following what your boss Fate tells you day  by day or just go straight up anarchy mode and do the exact opposite of  what he tells you. However, there seems to be a ""correct"" balance to achieve in your daily workload in order to bring about the ""True Ending."" This is a branching story game with multiple endings. 

 (Case in point, I mostly played by the rules the first time around and...&gt;!it  brings about the apocalypse in the human world. The game will loop back  around and you get to start from day 1 with this newfound knowledge.)!&lt;  

It's fun, and the game has a strong [r/antiwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/) sentiment. At the end of each day, you sit down with your boss Fate to go over your day, and your dialogue choices range from suck-up responses ""Hey, Boss how was your day?"" to challenging authority responses like ""Why must I do it this way?"" to ""Ugh this is stupid. Can I go now!?"" There's even a point where...&gt;!Fate leaves the office a few times and puts his cat Lady Pawdington in charge of your review. He even straight up goes on vacation, and you get to ask, ""Can I have some vacay too?"" ""No.""!&lt;

The game has fully voiced NPCs too. You mostly talk to your boss  but there are other characters that you can meet, talk to, have drinks with, and...&gt;!start a rebellion with!?!&lt;

I'm on my second play through now. The game is available on Steam and Switch. I'm playing it on my Switch.

Highly recommend if you're looking for something short with a strong *fuck* this job vibe!

1023,“That’s just how it is” - But why?,"Maybe I’m going to sound like a lunatic, but someone please help me understand. 

I’m really struggling with spending 23 hours in a day working a job I hate, cooking meals for the work days scrambling to get everything done after working all day, and get to spend 1 hour of free time scraping up any relaxation I can muster in the midst of my exhaustion and burnout, and do it all again the next day, 5 out of 7 days a week, for the next 40 years. 

I’m feeling so depressed, especially because I hate my job so badly. I’ve tried talking to my husband but he’s found his dream job. As exhausting as his job is, he enjoys his days. His response is usually to shrug, ask if there’s anything he can do to help, and say “We just have to figure it out. This is just the way things are.”

This is it? This is what our existence is boiled down to? Selling 40% of our lives, sleeping away another 40%, and cleaning/cooking/etc for another 15%, and getting to enjoy the last 5%? This is what humanity has evolved to? I’m meant to live my life selling all of my time on Earth in the hopes that I’ll live long enough to get some relaxation?

I’m so tired. I want off this ride. I don’t want to exist like this. And when everyone says “that’s just how life works”, it makes me feel so broken and weak and lazy. I’m just tired. I want to rest and there’s no escape.",False,o65ntw,lil-ball-of-stress,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o65ntw/thats_just_how_it_is_but_why/,6,1
1024,Am I allowed to hate my job if it pays good? (serious),"I want to empathize that this is not a self brag post. Also I have 85k in student debt so that's where half my salary goes. I was working minimum wage myself not that long ago.... 

So I recently graduated as a mechanical engineer and frankly I really hate my job. I make more than enough for my needs. About 70k before tax. I hate every single task I am asked to due. I spent 5 years of my life studying design, just to be forced to fill out pointless word documents and excel sheets for other people. It NEVER feels satisfying to do anything.  I hate the fact that they are forcing us back to the office for company culture. I hate the bleak windowless fucking cubicle that I sit in. I hate the ""Happy Monday!"" fucking joke that I hear every goddamn morning. I hate the cold town that I live in, and the fact that in a few months I'm gonna have to drive through snow storms to work. When I'm at home or on my lunch breaks I just spend the time looking for other jobs across the country. When I finish work, I just go home depressed, counting the hours till I have to go back to bed. I don't even get 9 to 5. Most engineering jobs are 8 to 5. Some nights I have meetings at 9 FUCKING PM when they expect me at the office at 8 AM the next day.  

I just want to feel ok. Not even happy. This job makes me hate every second I am there. Some nights I cry myself to sleep. The messed up part is my coworkers are not bad. I don't hate them. They're normal people. I just loathe my existence. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest. Sometimes I see people here posting about how horrible their work conditions are and frankly I feel guilty because I ""have it good"" or whatever that means. I just want to know if hating my job is ok, or am I just an entitled brat.",False,o60juc,MeNoUnderstandesu,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o60juc/am_i_allowed_to_hate_my_job_if_it_pays_good/,23,1

1030,"I can’t help but be a bitter, cynical asshole and the reason is because of working in retail","Let me preface this by saying that I am honestly a good person. I like helping people. My field of study is centered around this. Many people have praised me in my youth and teens for being a well brought up, respectful person. I am always willing to help others out and feel empathy and emotion for those who are vulnerable. Everybody who meets me says that I'm a nice, quiet boy. You can call me a conceited asshole but I know my true colors.

But I also have gained such a cynical and bitter attitude from working in retail. It is truly amazing how damaging and traumatic this field is and people just don't realize it.

Everyday I am working with an underschedled department and coworkers who don't give a fuck. But the real reason is the customers.

They're nasty, messy and disrespectful. They scream for managers like children over minor issues. They let their kids run around the store. They throw stuff everywhere. They eat items and put it back on the shelf. They talk down to you and treat you like an idiot. They blame everything on you. And the kids. I just fucking hate the screaming kids.

Now I'm not saying that I want a perfect job. I know that there'll be assholes but fucking hell man. So many people just don't care. It has truly opened up my eyes to how disgusting and incosondierate our society is.

My tenure is retail has slowly changed me. I now snap more easily and have such little tolerance for assholes. I feel like getting into fights and confrontations instead of ignoring assholes in public. I have a lot of pent up anger. Sometimes it affects my mood for days and I go home thinking about what the fuck I'm doing with my life.

I have to try hard to not let this affect me. I usually never take it out on other people but the very odd time, my mood will definitely affect others and it'll be noticeable. This is totally different than my field of study. During my internships, people do shitty things, but I am working with people in conflict with the law and often have drug or abuse or mental health issues. Their assholeness isn't intentional. In retail I'm dealing with assholes who love to bully and demean ""lesser"" people. I'm so cold towards most customers now that when they ask me for stuff, I hardly even look them in the eye and. Just point towards where an item is.

I rant and rant to my girlfriend and parents which helps but everyday I just lose faith in Humanity. 

5 years ago I was much more vibrant and happy. I was pretty unaware of and ignorant to a lot of societal issues. The customers in retail have made me extremely bitter and cynical because of the bullshit they pull. Outside of work, I find myself annoyed with most people and I am definitely more judgemental. I don't laugh or conversate with strangers and ignore them if they try talking to me. I fucking hate people.

Today drove me over the edge. Some white trailer trash lady started yelling at my coworker because she had to wait 3 minutes for him to come back and cut deli meat. She started screaming for a managerial. When I came over I could see the entitlement in her nasty face. The fake smile and condescending tone when she asked ""LET ME SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER NOW, K THX"" almost made me jump over the counter and do something...

Next I was stocking in the aisle like usual. Some lady and. Her husband come looking for stuff and throw some empty boxes on the floor from the shelf for no reason. She says ""oh, he'll picknit up"" gesturing towards me

I go up to her. And say ""are you using this?"" she says no. I say ""so why did you throw it on the ground?""

She tells me that it's my job and some other bullshit excuses that I couldn't make out. Her husband says from several feet away ""did you tell him that it's his job?"". I said ""Nice. Act more classy next time"" and walk off.

Now I'm in my car on my break writing this post. I don't know how much more I can take.",False,o6iz9f,luca1467,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o6iz9f/i_cant_help_but_be_a_bitter_cynical_asshole_and/,14,1

1033,"I need advice, I feel like I’m at my wits end about what I want to do with my life.","(Sorry if this is doesn’t belong on this sub, if so please delete and I’ll post elsewhere.)I’m 25 and I started living on my own at 21 after college. I’ve always been “lucky” with finding and having jobs to sustain myself, but I’m really starting to feel the pressure of working a 8:30 to 5. My rent is about to go up a lot and I have the decision to either find a new place to live, or my parents extended an invitation to let me live with them so I could save money in these uncertain times.

I really enjoy living on my own. I love my parents and little bro, but my family can be a bit suffocating, so it’s gonna be a sacrifice. I want to quit this job because it’s very very stressful for me and I can’t take the office BS sometimes. If I quit I want to finally start to make more money with my artwork. I’ve gotten a couple of commissions and got my name out in my community a little and I’m working on refining my craft and working on my internet presence, but with a full time job there’s only so many hours in the day for art. 

I think it would be a good opportunity for me to start trying to do what I love, but I can’t help but think making the decision to focus on art and quitting my job would be a huge mistake. 

I worked so hard and so many hours to be able to sustain myself and move out. And I know how hard it is for people to move out nowadays. I’m not getting any younger either. But the idea of working like this for the rest of my life makes me wanna crawl up into a ball and never get back up again.

I can't handle it. There is heavy lifting and so many responsibilities I can't juggle it all. I got told off for leaving the fridge in a mess last night, even though a co worker told me to 'speed up' so I felt under pressure and tried to get it all done quickly before leaving.

Even today when I was doing fridge scanning, I could tell a coworker was getting another coworker to tell me if 'that was the last batch' I was scanning. Maybe I am slow. Maybe it does take me a while to get used to things. I'm only here 2-3 weeks.

I honestly dislike this job so much. I left a cashier job I was doing fine at for 6 months, I left due to toxic co workers and went here because I thought it was a good job :/

I'm also on blood thinners/Coumadin so I'm trying not to fall or have an accident, which is more likely working here

I think my depression doesn't help. I can't think straight today. I feel so disconnected from other people like I'm in another planet. I feel like going home. Honestly I don't even need the money.

1055,(Rant) Food not being a fundamental human right is purposeful abuse on the human race caused by the rich.," 

You wouldn’t tell a starving child that they don’t deserve food unless they worked for it. That's child abuse, right? And we \*are\* only mother nature’s children, after all. 

As a species, we need not pretend food is limited, or unavailable to everyone. If it makes you upset that people “work so hard” to bring the food to the people (and ""of COURSE they must be paid for doing such work!"") , I urge you to reconsider where humans got food from to begin with. We found it in the wild, where it grew from dirt and water, with the sun as the only source of energy. 

Yes, the wild is ALSO is where we had a chance of dying, I KNOW. 

In modern society, we have NO chance of dying from predation (this is the whole purpose of the society), however. 

But that does NOT MEAN food should be given to the rich more easily. That defeats the purpose of the society, and only benefits the upper class, who are all fundamentally wrong for so much as BEING so rich, as they are inevitably hoarding food in \*real time\*. \*\*\*This is TRUE, as poverty is the leading cause of starvation.\*\*\* 

It means the rich need to realize that the very essence of the word “rich” is negative and selfish when you aren’t also helping the poor by distributing your excess money almost immediately. This should really start to resonate with more Americans, as we are one of the most disgustingly spoiled countries on the planet. On top of that, since we live in our own little bubble here in America, and pretend the rest of the dying planet doesn't exist, why not fix things here anyway? Do you know how easy it would be? Tell the rich they are going to be imprisoned if they don't distribute. Is that wrong? ABSOLUTELY not, in my eyes. We're already neglecting the rest of the world. Start SOMEWHERE for Christ's sake.

It does not make you a good person to hoard your money; even if you think “if I spend it, who knows where it will go?”. You most likely know where it goes. Don’t kid yourself, do your research. Support just causes and stop purchasing things that are wholly unneeded by our species. Please stop to think about how worthless your purchases are compared to the people who have nothing: 10% of humans on our beautiful planet.",False,o63qos,blackandwhiteenvelop,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o63qos/rant_food_not_being_a_fundamental_human_right_is/,6,1

So...

When, why, and how the fuck did we get to this point where workers, perhaps the most important part of a business, get treated and paid like dirt? Has no one thought of this? Questioned it? Or does everyone not part of antiwork just happily want to bend over and get fucked?

Employers should be sending *US* resumes to work for them. Employers should be begging *US* to work for them, not the other way around. After we review detailed information from them, *WE* should be the ones telling *THEM* that we'll review their information and respond to them later about whether we accept or not.

1062,My dad was fired from his second job yesterday.,"My dad was let go from his second job at a popular grocery store chain yesterday afternoon. He had worked this job for close to eighteen years. He has worked a total of 70+ hours a week for the past 40 odd years.

My dad is over 60 years old. He is diabetic and has some of the usual cardiovascular issues someone his age would typically have.

He was definitely in the higher risk categories for COVID. Despite this, he never missed work at this job or asked for any reassignment of his usual duties to reduce his risk of infection. This was in contrast to many of his younger, less-at-risk co-workers.

He would at times bring in his own tools and offer his labor outside his normal duties to help out with general handyman stuff when asked. He was invested in this place. It was like a second home to him. He had befriended many co-workers and regular customers throughout his tenure.

His plan was to continue working after retirement to stay active and just because he liked the job so much in general.

As expected of someone his age and work history, he's lost a few steps. He's not as sharp as he once was. He doesn't hear as well, requiring the use of a hearing aid in the past few years. He tries his best, however,and having briefly worked with him at this job, I know he can still contribute.

He's also maxed out on his hourly pay rate, and since they're really not expecting much more out of him, he was definitely an easy target to be let go. This was coupled with a manager who didn't take to his personality and based his review on some spurious and frankly mild customer complaints which didn't really fit his normal behavior.

Having worked for this company for a brief period during college, I know the sniveling striver shitheads that usually work their way up the ranks. They are a company which sells this image of being a fun and loose place to work that is unburdened by bureaucracy. 

Well, yesterday, this shithead manager just cleared some salary off the books to make him look like an extra good boy to his corporate overloads. I hope he chokes on his fucking lunch.

Loyalty means nothing to these people. Going the extra mile means nothing once you are expendable. Take every cent and every advantage you can get out of these little tyrants. Cheat them out of whatever you can, because they will turn your life upside to save a few dollars.

1073,So sick of this,"I just want to start out by saying screw my workplace and certainly screw your $8.88/hour. I have had ONE weekend off since I starting working, and I had it off because my grandma was dying and my grandpa (from an opposite side) was having a major operation, not because I wanted to enjoy myself. My time, energy, and mental health is worth more than $8.88/hour. 

Today really drew the final straw for me. I had a killer headache today and took 4 painkillers morning, afternoon and evening and it still wouldn't go away. I asked my managers if I could go home after working 4 hours with a headache and they said they couldn't ""afford"" to send me home because I was closing. Like what? I guess us being a ""family"" isn't a thing anymore. I told my managers I've taken pain killers already and she says ""we can give you ibuprofen"" like gee, it's almost like I did that already 😐 I just told you that 10 seconds ago. 

One of my managers says I'm scheduled 4 hours this week and I said I thought I had to work the weekend, she said no and that's not what her schedule said. I look at the schedule after work......and I work this FRIDAY, SATURDAY AND SUNDAY....AGAIN...after expressing to my manager I'm sick of working those hours, she schedules me for another Friday-Sunday. Nice. Nice job. Thanks for listening. My nerves are struck right now, I just want to punch a wall, i have no life. One or two days off then back to the plantation I go. The cycle never ends.

This concept has baffled people who thought they had been hired to do something meaningful for as long as the con-artist who came up with the concept had a career.

As far as I can understand, KPI's are simply used to measure how well you or someone else does a job. The thought is pretty silly once you begin to think about it, since under any normal circumstances, you would think that a job either gets done or it does not. That's it. The rest is just meta, which is convenient since our KPI was how many KPI's we came up with. 

So we invented all kinds of metrics and measures that we started reporting on and everyone in senior management pretended to be completely on board with this stuff. I always thought it was funny how everyone played along. We were paid to invent metrics that are completely removed from reality and to generate numbers to accompany those metrics, and then someone else is paid to pretend to understand those numbers.

The jig would be up the moment someone asked what would change if those underlying numbers were to change, and you know it's all make-believe because in more than half a decade, no one has dared to ask such a simple question. We would all be out of a job if that happened, so it's better for everyone to play along.

Sometimes to generate suspense, someone might say something like ""I don't like these numbers"", which is hilarious since that would imply the person saying it had a clue about what those numbers actually meant. So then we take this ""feedback"" and come back the next day with new numbers, saying that we forgot to include this or that and that now it's fixed. Absolutely nothing of substance has really changed, so everyone forgets about it and moves on. 

I personally find it endearing when a summer intern or a junior analyst joins the team and they are anxious about how these numbers will be met by senior management and whatnot.  I feel like I should just tell them that it's OK to report anything you want , because they have no clue about nor interest in what those numbers are or should be. 

I once met a team that also had to report on their numbers and they'd heard such great things about us that they wanted to know how our reports are always so great. I just told them to develop proper KPI's and they pretended to understand what I meant by that.  I also took a look at the code they used to generate their numbers, and I found out that they actually hard-coded numbers into their reports. Hard-coded values because some manager had once said that he thought ""This number should be more like X"" so some snarky analyst had actually just hard-coded X into the report and everyone was happy afterwards. Problem is, that analyst had left and as new people came in, they had no idea what any parts of those reports actually meant, so now they had to scramble each month to fudge everything else fit those hard-coded numbers. 

Something else that might happen is that some manager who wants to make a name for themselves decides that they want to see some new metric, so an analyst has to go back and come up with a report on this new metric. Thing is, often these curveball managers don't last very long, so the analyst is stuck creating reports that no one reads. Some are smart enough to just stop reporting on stuff they think is unnecessary, but since such smart people are incredibly rare, what usually happens is that the reporting team begins to hire more people to do all the reporting. What used to be a half hour job can balloon into an entire organization in its own right, and the team manager needs to be promoted to director and that director then needs at least two managers to report to them on all the reporting that the team does. 

Since these reporting organizations tend to balloon into colossal monstrosities, entire industries have spawned to supply them with all the necessary tools. Analytics software companies sell their visualization products to unsuspecting corporations simply because unless analysts draw fancy looking charts and graphs, they'd have nothing of substance to do or to report on. What could previously just be submitted as spreadsheet attachment in an email now has to require days of planning and charting to visualize. 

This is what they mean when they talk about data analytics.

1125,Let's talk about the nap room,"So in my old job, the one I quit after calling my boss a fucking idiot and then refusing to apologize to her, there was a nap room.

I remember how HR was so proud of this room. When I was hired it was hailed as a serious perk. Anyone that felt tired and needed a quick nap could go in there and have one. What a thoughtful idea!

Here's the thing. In the entire time I worked there not a single person used that room. Not once. In fact one time after partying all weekend I was so tired on Monday that I booked an unused conference room, turned off the lights and napped on the floor.

Why not use the nap room, you idiot?

Here's why. To use the nap room, you need *to sign it out* with HR. Why is this a problem, you say? This is a problem because everyone in that place knows the second you sign out the nap room with HR, the entire management including the lawyers will know that they have an employee who is sleeping at work.

Suddenly HR is concerned, management is concerned and you're on the red flag list.

One of my roommates was very adamant that I shouldn’t do that because, “It would take your boss three weeks to find another assistant as good as you.” While I get that, my feeling was kinda like, so? If my boss wanted to fire me she wouldn’t give me two weeks notice so I could find another job, and if you wanted to keep employees maybe you should pay them more than $12/hr with no benefits to do specialized work? I’m not sure, what do you guys think? Would I be “in the wrong” to not give a whole two weeks notice?",False,o5ngt5,nightmaredaughter,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o5ngt5/no_two_weeks_notice/,35,1

1158,Why do employers act like a saint as if they’re doing god’s work?,"Some employers are the most arrogant, narcissistic and stuck up people I’ve ever met. They act like they’re doing god’s work when they’re offering people jobs above the bare minimum wage (they even admitted that they offer slightly above minimum wage) and complain how people don’t turn up to their interviews. They then proceed to exclaim, “I’m offering people jobs, they should not ignore me, I’m kind enough to remind people to attend their interviews”. Don’t act like a saint that you paint. If you aren’t even giving people above minimum wage for the degrees that they hold, the minimum experiences, time and mastery of skills, then don’t even get angry that people won’t show up.

1159,I got fired for organizing,"This was a few year ago but I thought I'd share with this community. I got a job working with someone I knew from the church I went to as a child, he was actually my youth pastor, I no longer practice any religion but I think this is relevant to the story. He ran a small screen printing shop, when I first started there was only about 5 full time employees and the owner rarely ever came in. I started at 11 dollars I believe and had to fight for every raise. I only got my first significant raise because I was one of two people who knew had to run the automatic press. The other person put in his two weeks for a better job and I was looking for better pay myself so I used this as leverage and told my boss I was offered a job with higher pay. Since he would have nobody to run his most lucrative press he reluctantly gave me a raise to 13 I think. Fast forward a few years he finally decided to try and grow the business by adding more presses and hiring more people. I was eventually promoted to production manager and had clawed my way to 18 an hour. I saw all of the work orders and I knew what the business was making and my pay was dismal in comparison and I was the 2nd or 3rd highest paid person in the shop. All the while my boss owned a small trailer camper that he maybe used twice a year, bought himself a brand new 4runner and owned his house and was raising 4 kids. The main reason I didn't quit sooner was that I really liked the production team there and we all got along pretty well. They didn't want me to quit either so I decided to try and organize for higher pay and health benefits. We had meetings outside of work and I even went as far as to make a budget to show that he could be providing healthcare and paying us significantly better all while still turning a healthy profit for himself. Well I never even got to share my budget with him because he fired my ass and told me it was because I once said that I ""was checked out from the job."" I ended up getting unemployment which was great and was sort of my plan B, it worked out better for me in the long run than to just quit.

1165,Walked out of work today,"Now let me preface this by saying I’m fortunate enough to not be dependable on my current part time job, I’m just using it as a way of financing my masters degree in teaching in Ireland and I’m probably quitting soon

I’m quiet content where I work, in a community leisure centre. I’m fairly friendly with everyone and rarely have issues with management as they’re genuinely nice people that I’m friends with

So I’ve been doing Tuesday through Saturdays at the moment, no problem whatsoever. The needed me on Saturday mornings and said I’d be off Sunday and Monday so I could spend time with girlfriend or go for nights away. Again no problem for me as I usually go out on a Saturday night anyways

Roster is done on a weekly basis but it’s almost so routine at this stage that checking it is almost trivial for me

So it finally comes out this Sunday which is late because our work week starts Monday but one of the managers was hospitalised with illness this week so I could understand. 

Out of curiosity I check it and I’m due to work at 6:30am on Monday. It was 5pm Sunday when I got the email. So I’m absolutely fuming. I had to look after dogs and chickens as my family are away until tonight 

I got into work at 6:30 as a compromise and said I’m leaving at 8:00 so get something sorted

The manager today seemed to take my statement as some sort of plead as she just replied “ugh okay I’ll see if I can find someone”

Come 7:45 I ask if they got that sorted and she just replied “who am I supposed to get at 7am on a Monday??” So I just told her I’m leaving. She began pleading with me to stay saying I can’t do that without cover and I replied a spiel about not caring as I was told I was off on Mondays, and that me showing up for 1.5 hours was a courtesy on my part as I had less than 15 hours between the time I received my changed roster to when I was working. Because god forbid I was in another part of the country drinking with no back on Sunday night and wouldn’t have made it at all? 

So I walked out to a very disgruntled manager who will probably be out to get me during the week for leaving her short staffed but it finally clicked to me that I’m not available to them at a click of a finger and have other commitments outside of work. I shouldn’t have to even consider giving my work notice when my family go on holidays or shouldn’t have to consider taking official holiday leave just to go for a night away with my girlfriend

Just wanted to get that off my chest! Again I’m afforded the luxury of not being reliant on work for finance, but previously I was sacrificing a lot of myself to keep them successful.

I PROMISE -- I don't mind working hard.  I don't mind a heavy work load.  I can even be reasonably flexible when it comes to low pay because I live in a very affordable area.  But I CANNOT DEAL with micromanaging, office politics and someone CONSTANTLY watching over my shoulder.  Leave me the fuck alone, let me do my work without feeling like I'm on eggshells for 9 hours a day, and don't give me shit for not participating in office 'outings' at bars or for not jumping at the 'opportunity' to work overtime when I've been coaching myself to 'just get through this week'.

My first job was working in a kitchen, my dad didn't even want me to go because ""it's a low job and I'm too good for it"" I went anyway and it was terrible. Next I tried to work in a school, got paid £50 a day and then got fired because I couldn't control some children who didn't listen to me. Then I worked in IT and got fired for being late by like 5-15 minutes and not getting it.

Now I'm doing my medical engineering doctorate, getting paid more money than any of those shit jobs to do it and working like 3-5 hours per day. My mum still thinks I'm poor because she makes like £1000 per day but whatever. At least I'm not like the thousands of graduates who are stuck at star bucks and McDonald's because the market is so oversaturated.

Of you go 50-70 years back, most of our workforce was in
agriculture and related activities.

Imagine what kind of crop we would have got if the farmer
decided to not to take care of their fields on Saturday and
Sunday?

It turns out, the concept has its roots in the fact of
spending some time with family, going to your spiritual
practices, and enjoying with people you love.

But beyond that, there seems to be no rational explanation
of 5 day week.

But holy shit,  I need a break. If I quit, I could apply for medicaid,  food stamps, all that and get by just fine, but the toxic pride I was raised on is really getting in the way. I took a 4 day weekend to stay home and just hang out with my boyfriend and it was GREAT, but I was filled with so much dread yesterday at the thought of coming in here and sitting for 8 hours wasting my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. I guess I just need some support. The idea that I'm supposed to do this every day until I die is making me suicidal.

1188,The real reason we won't have UBI any time soon,"“I suspect the real political problem for a
guaranteed income isn’t the costs, but the benefits.
A policy like this would give workers the power to
make real choice. They could say no to a job they
didn’t want, or quit one that exploited them. They
could, and would, demand better wages, or take
time off to attend school or simply to rest.

.. The truth of our politics lies in the risks we refuse
to accept, and it is rising worker power, not
continued poverty, that we treat as intolerable.”

1200,POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE,"      Sorry if this has been brought up before, but I haven’t seen it discussed yet. Although I absolutely agree with the sentiment of this forum and agree that there is a massive issue, I have conflicting feelings on the direction that would be best for everyone. 

    I am from the school of thought that we’ve been fed a story our whole lives that hard work will eventually pay off, and a working class hero is something to be praised. At one point in time, I definitely believed this. It has become clear to me that this is not the direction we are being led. It is clear to me that we are heading towards a robot/artificial intelligence driven economy. It is inevitable at this point. Where does this leave the billions of people that rely on jobs that will be phased out? A Universal Basic Income is clearly on the horizon. 

     Now part of me still romanticizes the idea of a meritocracy built on hard work where everyone can be the deciding factor in their destiny. The other part of me believes that working 40-60 hours a week to scrape by and have nothing left over prevents us from finding out what we truly value and enjoy in life. 

  Do we go the route of communism and everyone gets the same housing, same allotment of food, the same amount of money each month etc…- or do we completely dismantle the established order that is being put in place and try to supply enough jobs for everyone, ensure that everyone is given an opportunity to make a reasonable living with benefits, and an affordable education? What is even possible at this point? I have many more thoughts that I could put forth but it would require a novel length diatribe that no one needs to read.

  I would just like to hear what the sentiment is here. Is communism inherently bad or is it just inevitable that leaders will ultimately abuse their powers? Is it possible to get back to a society where currency is more evenly distributed? Or are we all fucked, and the path we’re heading down is one where we will all be slaves to papa government?

1205,Employer secretly replaced me while i was on sick leave,"A few months ago I got a second job with an upstart company. I was promoted 2 times in a couple of weeks. I was lavished with compliments (i'm no spring duck, i never believe this shit) and told how happy they were to have me. I got very sick and was out for a week; I was replaced immediately. They seemed surprised when I actually returned for work; but this new guy -- some hustle culture asshole -- seemed to think he was in competition with me, and was blatantly rude to me (he referred to me as 'This guy'); which they were blind to because he was kissing their ass so hard. Maybe he WAS in competition with me? (For my job). Anyway, my condition worsened I asked for a health leave which they granted; two weeks later I have recovered only to find that I had been replaced completely. 

I get it tho, business must go on YET I CAN'T HELP FEELING SLIGHTLY WRONGED/DEMORALIZED. They were so nice and positive towards me, yet they cut me off as quick as possible. But I will never get it in my head my employer actually likes or cares about me. It has been my experience that employers/manager-types like willing slaves who kiss their ass 'til the cows come home; and this has been my experience W/O FAIL. 

My personality comes into play too (I think); I mind my own business, keep my shit to myself, come in on time, do the work to the best of my current abilities, leave.

The company I work for has been making odd decisions during the pandemic, one of them being making employees work in the office during high covid spread alerts. If employees didn't want to get expose they could choose to use their vacation hours (but they're responsible for the work missed during that time). I chose vacation hours. I used that time to study for a cerrification. Anyways, after a few months they switched to work fully remote again, but now they want all employees to return to the office by the end of summer. This time non-vaccinated employees will get segregated to another building. They are ""encouraging"" (more like pushing) to get vaccinated, or get segregated. I talked to my doctor about this and told me that they shouldn't do that. I can't count on my team cause, even though they're against segregating, they're all fine with the decision (they spoke proudly about their ""struggles"" getting vaccinated). Today, my supervisor called a team meeting to specifically tell me to get vaccinated or else they would have to move me to a ""separate building"" and he doesn't want to deal with that. wtf!

Which has resulted in new hires making a lot more money than people like me who have been there for several years.  Because of the state laws where I am, companies are required to put realistic salary ranges in their job postings, so everyone knows what the new hires are making.

Well turns out that, after my raise, I'm *still* not making as much as a new hire.  If I quit my job today and got rehired under one of the new postings for the same job/title, I'd be making more money.

1224,"Before claiming how secular your country is, realize the religious fervor it takes to believe in capitalism","Humans don't actually need that much to survive and propagate the species, we need food, clean water, shelter, and to not be eaten by predators.  Capitalism doesn't provide any of this directly, instead workers are expected to engage in rituals called ""jobs"" to gain currency which can then be used in a ""purchasing"" ritual.  Your job probably doesn't create much of the above (food, access to water, shelter, security) but the superstition is that you add enough to an immaterial entity called the ""economy"" that you will be able to support yourself through purchasing rituals.

This whole system only works because this shared superstition exists throughout places that believe in capitalism.  However a shared superstition is not enough, since currencies can become useless and resources can become depleted through mass production.  Because of this, less religious adherents are in a constant state of anxiety.

I am mortified of quitting my job, despite my mental health and physical healthy declining severely while I have been working here the past 6 months. I do physical labor, cooking, assistance with ADLs, cleaning, administering medications, dead lifting residents who are 130lbs, and transportation, for a dollar and 25 cents above min wage. We are short staffed that if I left, the unit would have exactly 3 full time staff when full number should be double that, including night shift and managers. 

Worst of all is that I am technically not full time, I pick my schedule. I have convinced myself that things will somehow get better, the company cannot keep losing so many staff… so I have been working full time for reduced wages (full time, non-flex staff make a dollar more) until things “get better.” They have not. I cannot go up to my managers (who clearly sees how bad things are) without feeling like I need to throw up. I have housing, enough money saved up, I am out of college – most of my friends and family want me to leave this job.

1234,Any Max Weber fans?,"Here is a quick summary from Google. His books are easy enough to read though:

""Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism is a study of the relationship between the ethics of ascetic Protestantism and the emergence of the spirit of modern capitalism. Weber argues that the religious ideas of groups such as the Calvinists played a role in creating the capitalistic spirit.""

The point he makes is that we started to associate working hard with being a good person and this lead to capitalism.
It sums up a lot of people in my view, they think they are good people because they work every hour they can. Its almost a religious ""holier than thou"" thing.

*Before anyone points out Weber has been disproved, what was disproved was that this was specific to Protestantism because other cultures adopted the same idea but the idea itself still stands*",False,o5bdbo,BobbyCostner,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o5bdbo/any_max_weber_fans/,14,1

1294,"Advice, please! (... please!)","I've been doing a job for about 8 months now. I joined another guy, who's been doing the job for about 4 years, and he's a real alpha-type. No processes or requirements are written down, my manager is too busy and I question my colleague's understanding of what we're doing, however he is the only resource I have to learn how to do my job. Often, from the little I have learned, I'll offer something at a meeting and he'll undermine me in front of clients. It's quite a toxic environment. Sometimes I don't know what I'm doing at all but have to still present to clients and manage a lot of projects. 
BUT - I can work from home (no hour commute each way). It pays well. I do a 4-day-week, and work flexibly on the days I work.

I've been offered a job elsewhere, more aligned to my background and training, that offers a nicer sounding dept, much better training, a more manageable workload, but has set strict working times, 5 days a week plus commute. Also it's a pay cut of a couple of thousand.

Has anybody been in a position stuck between a crappy job with good conditions, and a good job but slightly worse conditions? Any thoughts appreciated.",False,o467y6,Craigj0812,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o467y6/advice_please_please/,4,1
1295,No job can pay me enough to be the boss's punching bag,"I can't fully blame people for not going back to work with all these toxic people out there. 

Last year, I quit a toxic boss after 2-3 years and felt so relieved after. This was the third job in a row where I was bossed around by someone toxic. The first tried to force their way into a supervisor role and quit after he turned over the entire department (among other sketchy things). It went from the best job to the worst job in under a year. The last two were both the owners of their company AND main reason for turnover. 

Learned the hard way that HR won't protect you from the person paying them, that stress can cause illness in a healthy person, and that stress can affect eyesight even if it's already good. Also, that I can have multiple mental breakdowns FROM A JOB . 

The happy side effect is that I set up systems and relationships that fell apart or were too complicated to revise after I left. I wanted to simplify them in the long run. It's too bad I was so stressed that I couldn't take notes so that toxic boss could yell at someone else to fix it for her before they quit.

A friend told me it sounds like it have PTSD from this most recent one so I got counseling for that. I didn't know you could get that outside of domestic abuse and being in a war zone. I'm doing better and still ruminating though. 

Part of me wants to chalk it up to not knowing what they look like before and learning the warning signs and how to set boundaries. I still wonder if I attract them (or are attracted to them), they just exist everywhere, or I get lucky. 

I have a low stress, low pay job now. Just have to deal with another toxic worker who I was told will never be made a supervisor despite being there for a long time already. I hope they'll stick to their word on that. I made it very clear I'm quitting if that happens. In the meantime, I'll continue to frustrate them by standing my ground and let them take responsibility for their poor work.

Managers who don't do a damn thing and relied on me to do everything to make them look as if they running everything smoothly and I was not properly compensated when I asked. The owners dodging anything and everything about a small pay raise with false promises.

Lazy, stupid coworkers, people causing drama as if it was middle school.  Having an employee who had been complained about numerous times to the owners from having those complaints ignored as he continued to be a horrible human who physically assaulted not one but two employees in the span of a year with no repercussions at all. The last assault saw the other employee who may have a broken nose quit today as well. The managers stopping that employee from calling the cops on him is absolutely disgusting and makes them an accomplice to the assault. Nobody gets paid enough for this shit at all and the stress from it to be assaulted from someone taking out their marriage/home frustrations at work.

I was going to finish off the week as a decent person as I found another better paying job thankfully but the assault was enough to just have me walk out early today.

I wasn't expecting it at all.

Anyways, last night, I get another call to come in today for storm work. Me and my gf have made some expensive plans for today and I told them that and that I'm not sure I'll be able to make it.

1311,90Days Notice Period!!!,"90 days of notice period! Does it make sense?

In 1996 notice period used to be 30 days. (labour law mandate)

But someone (in India) was really in love with his employees so they made it 60 days. Love kept blossoming and they made it 90 days!!

Really? 🤔

Well, I said in ""India"" because I know in US it is just 15 days or in some states it's ""employment at will"" which means you can walk out anytime.

So why in India we are so obsessed with long notice period?

Someone will say - knowledge transition (KT). I will say no KT can take more than two weeks.

Someone will say client's project. I would say those very clients let their employees go within 15 days!

I tell you the real reason - it was just to make exit more difficult. Did it work? No, infact it made it more messy.

Now people have more time in hand after notifying their employer so they keep interviewing and better their offer. This means if someone has 3 offers in hand, he is going to ditch two companies!

Those two companies after getting ditched couple of times will try to hire only those candidates who are serving notice period.

And here we go! We just started an artificial war right there!

By making notice period 30 days we can definitely reduce this multiple offer mess.

1321,What AntiWork means to me and why I’m not saying that nobody should have a job,"Work is a word that can be used in different ways.

Work is a verb.  As a verb, it’s the process of accomplishing a task.  Eg. “I worked on my garden”.  That is not what I’m talking about when I’m making an “AntiWork” argument.

It can be used in multiple ways as a noun.

The first way is to refer to the place that you are paid to do a task.  Eg. “I’m a contractor, I drive to work”.  That’s usually not what I’m talking about either.

The second way it can be used as a noun is to refer to a career that is seen as your primary responsibility.  Eg. “What do you do for work?”.

This is what I’m talking about when I make an “AntiWork” argument.  

I think work being seen as people’s primary role in life causes employers to take too much and employees to give up too much.  People who personally identify with their role at their workplace also tend to be very judgmental of people who have chosen different priorities.

1330,Today Is the First Day of the Rest of My Life,"I've done it, folks - as of last Friday I've quit my office job after eight long years, and am now starting my freelance career.

I thought I would be more nervous. I thought I'd be shaking and crying and a fearful wreck, but so far, it seems the anxiety and the tears I was shedding on a weekly - and sometimes daily - basis was actually from spending 40 hours a week at a job I hated.

After hearing that I was leaving, I had not one, not two, but FIVE coworkers tell me that they were glad that I was ""getting away from this abusive environment."" To head that others felt that way was like a shock to the system. I hadn't realized how bad it really was, and had in fact started believing that maybe I was a bad worker, that I deserved to be berated over minor mistakes, to spend my hours having panic attacks, to be openly disliked by my manager, because this was just where I was stuck for my life. I can't even say that the money was worth it - I was making a pathetic salary (despite three promotions over the years, I was still making a little less than three thousand dollars above starting salary).

I'm 33. I spent eight years at the same company - I started fresh from graduate school and it has been my only professional job - which means that I spent a quarter of my life at that place. Worse, it was never what I actually wanted to do! When I first got hired on, I told myself that it would just be for a year. I would get some experience, have that line on my resume, and leave as soon as I could. One year became two, then five, and then I found that my identity was wrapped around a job I could barely stand. I needed a change.

And you know, once I decided that I was going to quit whether I lined up a new job or not, it finally happened - and believe me, I'd been applying elsewhere for years. My new job isn't glamorous, but it is in a field that I love. It's remote (at my office job, we were supposed to be going back to the office soon) and, despite having fewer hours, it pays only a little less than my previous job - enough that I can survive.

And that's what I'm going to do. Survive. I'm going to survive, and without eight hours a day of dread-filled stress and work that lost its meaning years ago, without a manager who openly despises me and a company that refuses to see that I am a good worker who deserves to be treated as such - without all of that holding me back, I might just even thrive.",False,o4tmm5,nymori,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o4tmm5/today_is_the_first_day_of_the_rest_of_my_life/,9,1

1344,"How Do They Say Economic Recovery? ‘I Quit.’ (NYT, 20 Jun 2021, Excerpts)","The New Work Times http: //www.times.com/2021/06/20/business/economy/workers-quit-jobs.html

Now To They May Economic Recovery? ‘ Suit.’

With new opportunities and a different perspective as the anaemic cases, workers are choosing to leave their jobs in

record numbers.

A By Sydney Amber

June 20, 2021, 5:00 a.m. of

Economists believe that one reason more workers are quitting is simply a backing: By some estimates, more than five
million fewer people quit last year than would otherwise be expected, as some workers, riding out the labor market’s
convulsions, stuck with jobs they may have wanted to leave anyway. (And the millions of involuntary job losses during the
anaemic surely accounted for some of the reduction in quitting.) Now that the economy is remaining its footing, workers
may suddenly be feeling more emboldened to heed their impulses.

“There’s a lot of turn in low-wage jobs where people don’t really have a career progression,” said Julia Collar, a labor
economist at ZipRecruiter. “Of you find a job that offers just marginal more, there’s no cost to you in twitching.”

Or. Clot said people were accustomed to work being at the center of their lives and identified — a reality that may have
shifted during the anaemic.

“In general, we want a life of contentment and a life that has purpose,” he said. “And I think for many people, they’ve
discovered that contentment and purpose for them may lie outside of work.”

“T would be surprised if this ended before the summer ended,” said Andrew Chamberlain, the chief economist for the
hiring site Glassdoor. But he also said there was an “expiration date”: A high number of workers quitting will contribute
to a labor shortage, eventually forcing employers to raise wages and provide other incentive, which will help lure
workers back and re-establish economic equilibrium.

In the meantime, he said, workers — especially those with low wages — will continue to gain beverage over employers.

“The longer these shortage persist, the more bargaining power you put into the hands of very low-skilled workers,” he
said. “There is some evidence that employers are moving in response. and that’s unusual.”

1351,I am glad I found this subreddit,"You know, in the world where we live, we are the weird guys, the lazy ones. I have never felt like were born to work for an employer just to survive, specially with the kind of employers we have.

When I was 20 I got my Robotics titulation and I started to work on a company. The first thing I had to do is travel to England ( I am spaniard btw ). I was excited but at the same time I had fear. Well I was not wrong. Working there felt like hell. Is not the country, I met nice people in England ( including some of my coworkers there ), but the job itself. Damn, even my own company workers ( some of them ) treated me like shit. Like, we are working minimum of 9 hours a day, saturday and sunday included. We only have 2 out of 14 days free, and yet you look me wrong for wanting more freedom? I even asked my boss to have more free time, and he said it was OK, but when I told my colleges, my boss asked me what tf was I doing!! I am freeing myself and my companies you idiot... they prefer to have muted, hungry and poor people rather than people that just want a normal life. I am totaslly OK with the work, but not like that...

Later on I said I was quitting. I just got home one day and I started to cry. They offered me a job in the same company, but this time, in an office. I thought this was a good idea, and yes it was, at least for some time. Working 40h felt good, and in a desk. The problem came when , some fridays at the last time, they told me they neede me on weekend, in a factory ( I mean, not in the office ). I was OK doing this for one or two weekends but this started to be my day to day. When I talked to my colleges, they told me it was normal, all the companies will do that etc... they were wrong. After some years I decided to look for another company, and I found it.

Now I am earning more, I am working strictly 40h a week ( and if I have to work more, there is no problem on taking free days after to compensate ). I still have not the job I really want, that's why I am studying to be hired as my dreamt job, to avoid this sense of ""work for money"" to""do what I like and also get paid"". It is easier with the job I have now.

Also, some of my ex-coworkers started wuitting, finding new jobs... and those who did not are not happy at all... After all it seemed I was right.

Tl;DR: Feels good to discover there's some people out there that believes work should not be what it is right now

**The only way for people to stop being dependent on labor to survive is by growing their own food and timber**. Society is setup so that everyone is stripped of all resources and dependent on money to get access to resources. You can only get money by working, mainly. 

We're never going to solve anything through politics or memes. We have to take matters into our own hands and spread the information that we need small gardens all over the planet.

If you had the supplies to build a nice small house and build a garden/farm that grows all your food. Without paying rent, taxes, insurance, or for groceries there is not much reason to work. Everyone is working all these pointless jobs to afford their bills and monthly groceries. 

Why aren't people buying things that last them instead of working for money every month to buy things that they need to buy again next month?

After a decade of working six days a week and ten hours a day along with commutes of up to two hours one-way, I don't want to work anymore. Long hours are a given with the jobs where I live, and I've learned that I can't handle them in addition to being anxious about constant deadlines, talking to people, and having major responsibilities. I can't relax at all during the precious few hours I have at home after work and weekends bring me no joy because I know that I have to do it all over again on Monday morning.

I've browsed through countless ads but the thought of working like that again in more jobs for the rest of my ""productive"" years makes me miserable. If I was offered a position with a monthly six-figure salary, I still wouldn't want to do it.

Nowadays, I constantly dream about living a simple and quiet life where I can indulge in my hobbies and interests (the only things that make me feel happy and motivated). If I have to work, it would be at a low-stress, easy job that pays enough to cover the bills each month, and I'd be happy with that.

1370,How can you handle the Unemployment?,"I am not here, to tell everyone „Get a Job loser“ i can literally cope with your Opinions too on this Subreddit.

I mean, after i got graduated as a Machinist in 2015. I was about 3 Years on Job-Hunt. During this 3 Years, i was Employed for short Periods on Try/Hire Offices &amp; also lived off from Unemployment Benefits. Till i got a Full Contract in 2018 then i have to leave the Unemployment Office.

I am going to Tell, this Time was really depressed. My longest Time, where i was unemployed, was 7 Months. I can tell this 7 Months of Unemployment did fuck me up really bad mentally. I just can’t be unemployed. It will be fine, when i am Financially Independent. But i can’t do just „Nothing“.

I also know People, who never worked since more then 3 Years &amp; tell me, they are living happy. They have even Kids at Home. What is the Secret of this?
How can they handle the Unemployment?

I mean regulary, in my Country (Switzerland): The Unemployment Office just getting on my Nerves &amp; treat me like i am a Child.

The managers got a pay raise and apparently, because of that, the store could no longer afford to pay all of the store associates, so they had to cut the number of store associates in half, I was one of 3 store associates who was laid off and I was only there for 3 months. 

I don't know where to go from here.

I can't do retail anymore. I am sick of the inconsistent schedules and the fact that I'm always doing the jobs of at least 3 different people while making less than what one person actually deserves. 

Plenty of restaurants are hiring but if I work for a restaurant, I'll be getting paid worse than I was in retail while being entirely reliant on tips. 

Amazon is building a new distribution center where I live and they pay relatively well but we all know about the horror stories of Amazon and most people don't last there long from the sheer physical stress.

&amp;#x200B;

My entire resume since I graduated from high school is comprised of retail experiences and therefore, employers that aren't retail likely won't hire me because they won't perceive me as a good fit, especially since very few companies are interested in training their employees anymore. 

I also have Aspergers and this severely limits how much stress I can handle, its also the reason why it's taking me so long to get my associate's degree. 

I live with my mother, she doesn't consider my Aspergers to be a serious or legitimate hindrance to my work ethic and she thinks I'm just being lazy. She has grown increasingly impatient with my inability to land a permanent job and has threatened to kick me out several times. With no consistent paycheck and no friends to rely on, I won't be able to get my own place and if she kicks me out, the only path for me is homelessness and I don't know if I can survive that.

1390,What if I don't like any job?,"I am in this tough predicament. I don't have any job I think I'd like. People always say to do what you love as a job. But what I love is watching funny videos, playing video games and sleeping. I can't turn any of those into careers. I am passionate for drawing, creating music, videography, video editing and writing stories. 

But I know for a fact that if I turn those into careers I'd be burned out and I want to avoid that at all costs because my creativity is all that I have. I don't want to turn my creative hobbies into an income because if I get burn-out and lose them, then I'm beyond fucked. It would suck the fun out of doing those hobbies. Y'know what I mean?

I feel like I wouldn't like any job at all because I hate the idea of wasting the majority of my life away from them. It fuels my heart with resentment with anything that I am forced to do against my will. 

(Before you say I'm not forced against my will, please know that if I don't do these jobs. I will be homeless and poor and possibly end up dead on the streets. Which is like a form of slavery in a sense. It's all secretly implemented in our society, it's slavery but in a different form to make us scared and punishes us for choosing the alternative.)

And it's not like I don't want to contribute to society. I am a genuinely kind person. I do want to contribute to society but I feel like the work/life balance with these jobs are terrible in the united states. I heard many MANY stories of people working low-wage jobs for the majority of their lives and being treated like utter shit. Which makes me even more afraid about getting a job. I don't know how people do it. I have really bad anxiety so I know for a fact that things in my life are going to be so much harder for me. 

I just don't know how I'm going to cope with these jobs. Also, people have always said. Running a business or do freelance writing and such. I did research with all of that and most information says how hard and stressful it is to do those things. I don't want to do anything too hard or stressful for a job. If I end up doing a job that's too hard, I will end up feeling so uncomfortable to the point where I get into a really dark mindset. That's the best way I can put it.

I even tried to do other things like becoming a YouTuber but it's so unbelievably hard to even get success with that. I've tried for many years ever since high school but I never got any good results. That was my main dream career but it failed. So now I am left with nothing. 

I just want to do something that's relatively easy and low-stress because I want to enjoy my life. I don't want to be stuck feeling always on edge because of how difficult something is, especially if it's something I am not even fucking passionate about. I just don't get this life anymore man. I am scared because I think the only solution for me is to just accept it. But part of me is afraid to accept it because that's been my #1 biggest fear from day one. I was always afraid that I had to conform to this society and be a sheep, that my individuality as a person would be forever gone because I grew up a quitter. I just don't know what to do anymore dude. I really hate growing up so fucking much that every day this is on my fucking mind and I want it to stop. I don't know what to do and that's why I made this post. I am sorry if you hate me, call me a lazy piece of sh\*\* I really don't care anymore. This is my real feelings and if you can't accept that then leave this post and go read another post or something. 

Also, I know people are like jobs are just supposed to be a way to get money. I know that. I understand that jobs aren't supposed to be fun, I'm aware that it's just supposed to be a thing we do to get money. But that's not the issue, the issue is just my emotions to it all. If I am not content with my life then is that really living? At that point, I might as well not exist. What's the point of living if I can't even at least be content with everything? If I am literally suffering most days because of these thoughts then what the hell is the point? 

Should I just accept that all jobs will ultimately suck and that I should just view these jobs as just a thing to get money? And try to enjoy the small free time that I have? 

I love you all, also if you are suffering from the same shit as me. I am so so sorry. I notice that I am not the only one that feels like this, I genuinely feel bad whenever I see people saying they feel the same way because this shouldn't be the norm.

1394,"Company Profile: ""Horia Hulubei"" National Institute for R&amp;D in Physics and Nuclear Engineering (IFIN-HH)","# Preface

I have decided to blow the whistle on the ""Horia Hulubei"" institute in Bucharest, Magurele and decided to use r/antiwork in order to do so mainly since I believe that sharing experiences should alleviate the need of others to fall into the traps that I have fallen into. I hesitated on using /r/jobs but it might be that they have a pay-to-win thing going on similar to Glassdoor or Yelp. In any case, I am not looking for votes (or karma) and if the content is not appropriate I will be happy to move the content to a different section. There is a lot to recount so I will try to break the whole experience into palatable chapters such that the post does not read like a wall of text with no breaks or turns. I will try to also break down the experiences to conform to what most civilized countries would expect from an employer-employee relationship. I might wander a little into side discussions but only for the purpose of providing background or highlighting the employer's connections that would benefit the company profile and frame the testimony in context.

Please take note that most of this is based on personal experience as well as personal impressions and that i may very well be that the institute is great place to be. I am publishing this partly to maintain a record of what happened and to document my experience at the institute. I share this freely since I have noticed that there is very little information on the subject of IFIN-HH aside for a few dodgy reviews on various websites that seem to have been bought for or arranged to be posted. Nevertheless, the reader is encouraged to keep an open mind and take heed that these are personal notes and experiences that might just be factually wrong. It is ultimately up to everyone to make up their mind and hopefully, not too late to do so.

# Background

The ""Horia Hulubei"" National Institute for R&amp;D in Physics and Nuclear Engineering (IFIN-HH) (note the pompous name) started off as a typical communist ambition of third-world countries locked behind different forms of embargo with the western part of the world. Just like other typical endeavors, such as the current-day palace of parliament, the fountains running through Bucharest, the emphasis was placed on hyperbola and vanity rather than functionality and, as one could imagine, at the expense of the people since unfortunately the battle with the western world was economically dumped on the shoulders of the common man that had to double up on labor to fund the lavish dictatorial ambitions. It did not matter whether any important research was carried out or whether anything lasting was conceived, it just had to stand out and, ultimately stick up to the ""capitalists"". A lot of the glee was fueled by bling-patriotism or cynical patriotism, the employees developing some form of multiple personality disorder where on one hand they would have done anything to jump ship but at the same time any criticism would have been met with repression or victimization. A lot of this was carried on over by the Romanian diaspora where the same duplicity is observed: on one hand Romanian citizens living abroad criticize Romania and accuse Romanians of not fighting for their rights but at the same time they would adamantly refuse to return to Romania and actually fight for the rights that they seemingly hold dear to. All flash, no substance.

A lot of this has been carried over from communism and little has changed even in more than three decades since the alleged fall of communism. In some ways, one could argue that the situation has been somewhat amplified given that the embargoes has been lifted and that funds have been funneled by organizations such as the European Union into the hands of the very few that had a good time during communism. Surely, this was not the intended effect yet the result was fairly predictable given the power vacuum left by Ceausescu. A very archetypal decaying of repressive regimes. People that had it well under communism, have it well now and now it is bolstered and backed up by funding from alleged allies.

Most of the staff at IFIN-HH are former communist party members, have been working for the Romanian Secruitate or have acted as rats or moles for the Romanian Communist Party and mainly for the extra buck and advantages that they hold even to this day. Very little has been done to oust these people or make them pay for their crimes - as a side-comment, even if it was one of the accession conditions for Romania to join the EU, very few former files of the Securitate have been the light of day (I have personally been refused access to the files with an excuse that they do not have the files; which, in context, is absurd for a person traveling abroad during communism). In other words, the very same people that held communist party meetings in lavish and expensive hotels during communism are the very same people that are now in leadership positions. Naturally, the same frou-frou patriotism is carried over where a lot of the staff have made great sacrifices to send their progeny abroad, obtain double citizenship so they can jump ship when trouble arises yet perpetually seek to ""attract young talent"" to perpetuate more of the same through multiple generations. As it would follow from the former paragraphs, the same degree of pompousness is carried over when given a context where a lot of rural Romania lives in bleak poverty, the leadership of IFIN-HH claim bold plans such as winning the Nobel prize.

# A Short Moment of Glory

For a short while it worked. Surrounded by potential enemies and under the impeding doom of the Soviet republic, a lot of the staff got heavily involved with western institutes, in particular, Germany by doing political favors, organizing lavish conferences that had little to no purpose other than tourism or sex tourism, whilst Germany at times lent a hand out of pity as well as other geographic interests. Nevertheless, a belt was formed of fairly talented individuals that ultimately managed to escape by emigrating to other countries or have since long grown old, died or retired. Given the institute's notorious reputation for espionage as well as meager or politically-motivated wages, there has been little interests amongst youngsters to seek employment and more than likely. from what I have witnessed, with good reason.

# Employment

There is very little accountable employment going on at IFIN-HH. Most of institute is ""family""-driven and closed circuit with most of the job positions being dished out to ""the right people"", or, to spin a phrase, ""the same old good guys"". Being somewhat of an insider, my own employment took place more or less the same way. Even though I consider myself a professional in my domain, my future boss asked me to write some interview questions down; the same questions where then passed at me during the interview such that there was no room for failure. Ironically, and perhaps hilariously but not surprisingly for communist countries, my future boss awarded an interview mark less than the full mark even though I was the one to create the questions to my own interview.

A lot of emphasis is set on trust issues - at first, I did not understand why, but it became clearer further on when I was requested by my employer to get meddled in fraudulent activities. Although unbecoming of a public institution, IFIN-HH carries a subversive attitude towards employees where most work is carried out in a non-transparent form. None of the work even remotely relates to nuclear activity nor is the opaqueness justifiable by the institute's profile but the cloak and dagger attitude, as it came much later to my attention, is meant  to cover the crass incompetence of the personnel as well as being used as leverage to perform underhand deals for various political gains.

It is the case that every single minutia or details gets shoved under the carpet for no good reason. For instance, when handling a complaint from some of the staff, I forwarded the resolution and the message back to the person complaining, in order to show that work has been done and that the issue should now be resolved. I was immediately accosted by some of the employees claiming that I should not give the rest of staff too many details - even though, it was a trivial matter that would have worked to their own benefit once the claimant would have found out that their complaint had been addressed.

# Work Environment

There were a lot of underhand deals that one would hear about when talking to the lower tiers of staff. For instance a case was heard about IFIN-HH awarding PhDs in physics to various well-placed members of the state such as the police, the gendarmerie or the fire brigade for the sake of political leverage. In other cases, there were rumors of PhDs being written and awarded to some members of staff that were politically well-connected such as the progeny of former members of allies of the communist Securitate. One case in particular comes to mind where one of the managers had their PhD written for them and awarded in Sweden even though she had little clue of the subject and became a manager at IFIN-HH for a department that is far away from the topic of the awarded PhD. A lot of former Securitate members had a ""thing"" for Sweden and for some reason it was a place that a lot of these stasi members either sent their children or desired to emigrate to (more along the lines of the frou-frou patriotism mentioned earlier).

I was offered to complete a PhD in physics myself even though I have no clue (and little interest) in physics. Initially I thought it was a joke and I told them that I barely know the equations of motions, let alone do a PhD in physics, they told me it would all be ""arranged"" and that I would be awarded the degree regardless. When appearing visibly uneasy about going down that road, they told me that I should do it anyway, at least to be able to get better wages. In retrospect I could have completed a PhD in physics from an institution that claims to be reputable - of course, there would have been little I could have shown for myself to back up a degree in physics. It is funny, but the same people employed at IFIN-HH that heavily criticised Ceausescu's wife for holding a bunch of figurative titles were also the same people that would put their wives, cousins, nephews and what not through programmes to be awarded degrees that they had no knowledge of.

Intuitively, the work environment was a ""either you're with us or against us"" sort of arrangement and on the big lines I attribute the attitude to the staff and management's inability to distinguish between life and work. Just like all powers in Romania are mixed up in one large conglomerate with no separation of duties, the managerial staff at IFIN-HH was unable to distinguish business from pleasure. There were frequent fights such as one of the senior members of staff writing love poems to the female staff, fights in meetings between variously connected individuals on topics such as their wives cheating with each other as well as fully blown fist fights on the corridors between junior and senior staff on various topics, most of which, as I recount, the lack of professionalism to distinguish between life and work. Touching on the topic, one of the bosses hired his wife to work within the same department mostly for the extra benefit of being able to delegate funds though her such that on paper he appeared with a much smaller income. One of the same spouses that went off to do a PhD in nuclear physics while having only a technical school as her educational background - of course, just like my offer, a deal that would somehow be ""arranged"" and with the hopes of nobody calling them out.

The staff had a habit of procuring various apparel via work funds that they consigned though their contract but made personal use of. Exorbitantly expensive laptops comes to mind - water cooled gamer laptops that really were off the mark and context of research in physics. Even though it is stooping very low now and it feels mostly embarrassing seeing a sextagenary hauling a big gamer laptop after them in a trolley, it is worth mentioning because most of the work requisites were obtained and seen by staff as ""personal favours"". For instance, the terminology used was ""I bought you a laptop"" or ""I bought you a printer"" instead of the work requisites being considered as the necessary apparel to carry out work. It was all one big favor! This attitude bore down starting from industrial apparel that should have been a given since they matched the work being carried out and down to very elementary things such as soap, toilet paper or bathroom requisites. Employees would frequently bring such stuff from home with them because availability of said requisites hinged on the relationship that they would have with their boss: refuse to do a PhD in physics, get no soap in the bathroom, stuff like that. 

I was told by some of the low tier staff that one of the bosses had been hoarding water cooler bottles under his table and refused to share with the rest of the staff, the staff that he was responsible for. The same person approached me and told me that he ""suspects"" (what a word, though) one of my colleagues to be a gypsy, told me he was a little black skinned. You can imagine that given all the above I just did not know what to say. He told me that I should not talk to him much if he is a gypsy. On the other hand, this colleague was quite productive publishing some papers on nano technology and nobody ever had any issues with him such that I was not sure what to make of the event. I suppose that such events usually have to be reported and the institute did have an ethics commission as well as an union, however the recently promoted leader of the union was the one to carry the bosses suitcase up the stairs while the ethics commission frequently came to help the various head of the departments and worked mostly against the employees.

The top of the cake consisted in an event involving me when one of the bosses and the union leader told me that there is a colleague working in IFIN-HH that apparently had pirated material on his computer because some company complained that the software phoned home and requested from the institute that the person with the pirated material be apprehended. As a side note, you can see the dichotomy here as well: one one hand the institute claims to be ""family"" driven where everything can be arranged to the satisfaction of everyone while on the other hand they would readily rat out their own employees instead of shielding them from external pressure. On one hand they claim to be ""unified"" while on the other hand their would not even flinch to get their own people in trouble when offered political leverage, money or both. Similarly for the union leader, whose alleged prime responsibility is to protect employees and not do the bidding of the bosses, who was there with us when the boss extended this request to me. I promptly refused the request to ransack a colleague's computer and told them that I do not have the necessary legal power to do such a thing and that if it is really necessary they should follow up with the police or whatever legal entity has the capability of carrying out searches and that it probably has to be done with a search warrant. I told them that it is a strange request because such complaints follow with a cease and desist order such that even in cultures that protect IP, it rarely goes as far as having to collect evidence right from the get go. They were taken aback by my refusal and the boss shrugged it off and told me that he had some money to dish out and thought I would want some money. In essence I would have been committing fraud while being paid to do so as well as, imagining, going through a colleague's laptop that might have contained family photos and god knows what that I had little to do with and would have been little business of mine to see.

Otherwise, there was a generalized attitude of harassment of various personnel and, as it was explained to me, the harassment was ""bonus"" offered to some part of the staff as compensation for the low wages. Essentially, the bosses turned a blind eye to such matters paying staff in satisfaction, the satisfaction of bulling coworkers, rather than in currency.

# Co-Workers

After some of the former events I was considered ""untrustworthy"" (more on the lines of what was recounted before and the desire to hide any minutia) such that I was excluded from most of the activities. One of the co-workers got in touch with me, probably at the request of my boss, to sniff me out and see what I am about. You just know that you met a Romanian spy when the person you are talking to claims that Romanians do not want to leave Romania anymore. I acted a little surprised, oh? and played ball anyway to see how bad this was going to get. This guy, son of a former Romanian baron, had some of the most flexible mental gymnastics in him than I ever picked up from anyone else. He was a bit like that undercover police man that comes to a party and tries to blend in but for some reason he is always a bit off that blows his cover to the entire attendants of the party but nobody tells him straight up because they just play ball and go along with it to see what his intentions are. I made sure to bad mouth my boss in every communication with him knowing fully well that he was sent by my boss. I called my boss so many names in our private correspondence that I had to look up a dictionary of swear words just to feed him all this stuff. 

In any case, a paranoid individual and a walking-talking meme and everything that came out of his mouth was along the lines of ""See, Ivan..."". He told me a bunch of things about how fear keeps people in check, how the masonry destroyed Romania, how the Russians hated Romania, how the western powers destroyed Romania - while listening to him it made me feel like we were angels on a pile of dung. It was the best piece of revisionist history that I had ever heard topping up with some Russian princess Ecaterina that did some things that, alas, I cannot remember, cared little about then and care even less now. In his view, it was that Romania as some innocent victim and that there was a centralized conspiracy in destroying Romania. I mostly kept my hand over my mouth while listening to most of the drivel that he hurled my way. In any case, after some weeks he confessed on how he would like to run away from Romania so I guess that patriotism was not the main incentive of his little speeches. It reminded me of how Soviet spies were looking to exchange currency after the Berlin wall fell regardless of the generalized scare. It made me thinking that the worst enemy of Romania is the truth.

There is actually little to speak of about co-workers, mainly because they refused to ""co-work"" and perhaps the main reason was that even though they grouped up when it was beneficial other times they were mostly disjoint, every single one of them having various connections and deals that they kept to themselves and were used to justify their position. 

Every single attempt to ""co-work"" was met with unfriendliness, mainly since it meant that, at least in their minds, they would have to share the prestige, money or position. Competition amongst them was the run-of-the-day and a lot of them, from what I was told, would privately see the boss and demand that some of their co-workers not be placed on the same project for various reasons - a lot of the reasons, just made up lies. One of my co-workers on a project with CERN went right up to the boss from my second day of employment and laid out a whole fabricated story about me that was both hilarious and mind bending to listen to given that it was a fully blown fabricated story with lots of nuances. I was even approached by one of the bosses of staff that was equally bewildered by the story and asked me not to tell him about it. I eventually did, after I resigned but I guess that cowardice comes in large doses.

In one instance, I was ""hired"" as rent-a-coder to complete an assignment for a foreign student in the UK. I wiggled my way out of the arrangement but was told that it was not a singular case and that, just like awarding PhDs for political leverage, it was one characteristic of the IFIN-HH institute to reel in foreign students while hinging their bets on future ""arrangement"" possibilities. One colleague of mine was reeled in the very same way and got hooked up with the mail order bride of his life while dealing with the IFIN-HH. They tried this on me as well, but I suppose I am lucky to appear more stupid than I really am and was left to be just a witness of such ""arrangements"". ""Plagiarism"" in modern day Romania is such a flexible term: when it suits an arrangement, it is permitted, otherwise it is used as a political tool by people that have little to do with research in order to incriminate each other. ""One hand washes the other"" is something that is looked up to rather than looked down at and there are so many reversals that I have been witness to.

# Infrastructure

There was an overextended debate over E-Mail being read by staff members. In reality, the institute mixed research staff with support like nowhere else such that implicitly massive conflicts of interests were generated where control over mail serves was given to a part of staff that had no business and little to no formal qualification in administering the servers. For instance, the main mail server of the institute was administered by some guy with a degree in bio physics that probably picked up IT as a hobby and seemed to have more interest in political gain rather than IT overall. It was widespread paranoia and a lot of the staff asked around wondering whether E-Mails were being read. I was questioned on this point myself and just offered up the technical background on the matter. Since petty squabbles were another daily event, and given that I was personally asked to ransack someone's computer, it would not have amazed me if they did read E-Mails.

Most of the staff used third-party E-Mail services as well as bringing their own Internet to work. The latter was twofold, due to the lack of transparency of the server administration (as well as a non-existing support department) as well as the incompetence of the IT department to provide staff with a stable and working Internet. Any criticism to the computer infrastructure was met with a defense position from the IT department that, in order to avoid taking responsibility (and this is an ever re-occurring theme for IFIN-HH), would claim that the Internet provided to staff is for work usage only and that the complainee most likely used the Internet for something else and that is why their Internet does not work. Regardless of that, you were mostly on your own in case your work equipment was defective and most departments sought homebrew fixes to their equipment as well as hooking equipment brought from home to compensate for the lack of support.

As a general overview of the network infrastructure, there was an avoid and voracious desire to bar access to various websites. The reason therefore was twofold: one one hand the institute spent a lot of money in acquiring expensive network equipment that failed to match the profile of the institute. Essentially they acquired corporate equipment that is meant for small to medium businesses where employee are expected to focus on production-driven tasks that do not require ""research"". It goes without saying that researching a topic on the Internet might take you to various areas of the Internet that are either politically motivated, carry a degree of risk and so forth. Nevertheless, the firewall was a block-solution that applied universally and would block both E-Mail keywords or websites that were legitimate. Second, it was the desire of the IT staff to have employees call them and ask for various waivers for certain restrictions. There was a lot of that going on, where the IT staff tended to hold a monopoly on common-good resources because in doing so made them to be ""sought after"", and hence, I presume, important people.

For instance, I was asked to carry out experiments on a server that also held the E-Mails of about 800 people. My employer could not understand that you cannot carry out experiments on servers that are in production even though I explicitly told him that the entire server might go down if we push the experiments too far. As a bio-physicist, I do not hold it to him, but it does beg the question why he was placed in charge of the department if his background and experience did not match his duties - that being said, of course, aside the insider knowledge that he was, by association, one of the former communist VIPs. Other times, he inspired me with pity, mainly using one of the co-workers, a small step up and more enlightened, as his technical crutch because he was so clueless of the job he had to do. Nevertheless, all the selections carry out where politically motivated and if someone with experience would have, in spite of the absurd, sought employment at IFIN-HH, then they would have been marginalized by the rest of the staff for being too competent and inadvertently stepping on shoes.

There is a lot of assignment and reassignment of personnel going on more in general in Romania, shuffling of individuals from one position to the other such that it becomes diluted and unclear what their specialty is, if any at all. A late monument of a non-specialized society where people are hired by the numbers and not by the qualifications or area of expertise. I have been once told by a policeman that I am probably the right person to know how to hook up a soundcard which is akin to putting a DJ in charge of pyrotechnics and then wondering why the result is a bad outcome.

# Cultural Diversity and Inclusion

To borrow a quote, speaking of such matters at IFIN-HH is like wiping your behind with silk. There have been some checkups performed while I was there, mostly from the government, bu the checkups are pre-arranged such that whenever government dignitaries visit they are usually taken around by the shoulders (or waist) and lead down a pre-arrange path so they get to enjoy themselves and report to their superiors that everything within the institute is just hunkey dorey. In fact, right after a colleague threatened to sue to institute for misconduct and a large debacle on the subject too place, some government official came to one of the main meetings and expressed her satisfaction, non-ironically, I presume (I really don't know anymore), and stated how she likes that we all get along so well. Otherwise, as previously recounted, while the senior management staff drafts poems to female employees, matters of sexual harassment within the institute are met with laughter from the immature co-workers and staff. It was thrown at us, by one of the co-workers and also a government official (?) that if we spot a case of sexual harassment that we are free to report it which was taken for granted and met with chuckles from the rest of staff. I presume, partially since such things are way too fine for the brash attitude of the management staff and because such things go on but for various political reasons never see the day of light. Similarly, topics such as data privacy are also too fine for a society that has long missed its train to civilization.

Although not the only case, one co-worker attempted suicide by jumping out of a second story building and luckily just broke a leg in doing so. An event that was rapidly covered up and the blame shoved onto the victim. His parents are still seeking retribution via lawyers for what had been done to their son but given that the institute is well entwined with the police and the jeandarmerie it goes without saying that such events are easily covered up under duress and threats extended to the individual in question as well as their families. To cite a co-worker and to summarize: ""\[...\] they do things \[at IFIN-HH\] that even the mafia does not do."" In another case, a lady was harassed so much by co-workers, downright to calling her names, making up stories about her that she cracked under the pressure and got so paranoid that she thought the institute is trying to poison her. Another matter to laugh at, from the point of view of the institute and co-workers, no doubt!

""Cultural diversity"" stops at the point where you know that there is barely any foreign staff employed at the institute. Personally it stopped for me once one of the bosses mentioned that one of my co-workers was ""under suspicion of being a gypsy"". Otherwise, the occasional student is reeled in provided that they also are accompanied by funds.

# The ELI Debacle (a Societal Perspective)

Just like dropping a Coca-Cola bottle over a pre-industrial society the ELI project became an object of discontent due to disproportionate wages and cargo-pretige that was associated with the institute. The bottom line is that the working at ELI-NP became the object of veneration for people from low income backgrounds and thus sparked a lot of infighting between the various cliques that IFIN-HH harbors in general. Just like kids use to drive expensive cars through a hoodlum, ELI-NP was seen by many as an opportunity to raise their standard and flaunt their values to others that have been less fortunate. It was trivially clear that Romania was not up to standard to be able to harbor such an endeavor, just by noticing the large income discrepancy between the common folk and those that would have worked for ELI. It degraded to a bit of clown-endeavor where the general population had trouble getting tap water by contrast to the bold statements of the organizers promising nothing less but utmost excellence. There have been words and figures published in the media that were ripped out of an 60s Sci-Fi novels, involving suspended railways, lavish fountains, highways, tennis and golf courts and the likes, all of which, of course, right next to the piling up garbage that is unable to be picked up somehow. A bold statement, no doubt, for a country that barely has any highways.

Nevertheless, the authorities and various rag-tag branches of government bought into this elusive dream. So much that, from what I am told by first-hand witnesses, the government or affiliates went as far as to harass people that spoke against ELI and extend death threats and the likes to silence any opposition. I was told by one of the co-workers how their family started getting calls during the night, police checking up on them from time to time and all sort of oddities going on since they started opposing the project. Given the above, the behaviour of the government is no less than pitiful but given the context, it seems to be well explained for a country that lacks any shred of dignity. Extrapolating, but on good grounds and first hand experience, given that IFIN-HH acts so unprofessionally, there is grounds and reason to doubt that other institutions of the government are not much better off.

As could be predicted, nothing of that ephemeral dream came to pass: there have been no suspended highways or railways built, there are no golf courts, the garbage and stray dogs are just piling up and ultimately Romania has been excluded from EU funds. The initial agreement has been that the EU would find the construction up to a given year, at which the economic burden would shift from the EU to Romania - and, well, if you cannot pickup garbage then you probably cannot fund such a large project. In what regards EU funding, one of the main reason of disagreement has been the use of such funds: it was expected by the EU that by funding the ELI-NP project, the management would hire local or domestic (expanding to the EU) businesses in order to raise the level within Romania and the EU. Nevertheless, the management used the funds to employ overseas companies from the US or China which did not go well with the plan to infuse Romania (or the EU for that matter) with funds. Such projects, even from the construction perspective itself, reach into the billions such that it is understandable that disagreements would have arisen.

# In Closing

One of the last memories I have was stepping inside an office with one of the local kingpins of the institute that was in the middle of an inner political fight with one of the other old-new kingpin guys over a position of power within the institute. Since repetition makes the pattern, he was concerned about the IT department reading E-Mails and asked me if I know anything about that. Short of rolling my eyes, I provided the technical background and stated clearly that I was a persona non-grata already such that it would be highly unlikely that I would be given access to key mail servers that were well under the control of other political figures. What struck me though, with a modicum of awe, was how he mention that if he could, he would run as far away as possible - he called it ""defecting"", which was a weird word to use provided that we were still talking about a research institute and not a spy agency. I remember I stumbled out of the door and made plans to leave the institute at the earliest of opportunities whilst also coming myself under cross-fire of various political rivalry. ""Defecting"".

It is my conclusion as well as my own personal opinion, just like the rest of this document, that IFIN-HH is a cesspool of mixed-up services wrought with inner political wrangling and is very far away from being a research institute. I somewhat regret seeing some younger blood around there, thinking how eventually they will end up disappointed being perhaps naive in thinking that IFIN-HH or ELI, for that matter, has any future in Romania. Whenever heads of departments talked about attracting youngsters, I thought in my mind, better not since Romania is barely able to provide even the basic of necessities to its citizens lest contribute in any shape or form to research or bring grandiose plans to completion. The mix of politics, involvement of security services, a seething government chasing wet dreams way above their pay grade and the country's networth, employees with multiple citizenships seeking to ""defect"", shady individuals with revisionist and crypto-communist attitudes, and the ever looming piles of garbage just growing and growing makes IFIN-HH a toxic workplace environment and dangerous place to work for and should be everyone's last choice rather than the first.",False,o47ipr,richard_holden,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o47ipr/company_profile_horia_hulubei_national_institute/,0,1

The job that taught me the bullshit of the broken system was my time as a production designer/artist.

It was my first job out of college ( before I finished school ). It required really fast drawing skills in Adobe AI. Fast design decision making, and much attention to detail. Our jobs basically required us to create designs for products. Coins, pins, patches and so on. All the spec to be produced. Infinite customer revisions. And the customer didn't pay a dime til they bought the product. So they could literally just keep sending stuff in for years and never buy.


As I worked there for roughly 3-4 years I quickly took notice to this cluster fuck job. The pay was awful. 15-20/hr. No benefits,time off,sick days of any kind. Super vague noncompete of two years.

The company was set up like this: BIG boss has many small companies all doing the same thing. All staffed low to avoid benefits. Each company was ""ran"" by a family member / friend. Profit was split 50/50 with them and the big boss.

This literally paid them out ( after taxes ) $400k a year. And they did next to nothing. Bare basic customer service work. Customers just emailed us, they boss would print out the email, hand it to us. We did all the work. Then they just priced it out,  replied to a few basic questions. And took the order. That's it. And they got a 50% commission on the order. I got $15 for my work, and they got all the profit.

Orders ranged from $250-$15k+. 

I did the math while working one day. If I made a shit commission of 5-10% off my work. If every order was $250. My pay would have increased over $90k a year. Vs the $24k a year I was getting.
( Rent for a studio apartment is like $1400 ).

My suite had 3 people getting $400k+ a year, another guy getting $200k. And another at $90k.
The other 15 artist were being paid $15/hr.

We all sat in the same windowless room. So we overheard these fucks constantly talking about spending their money. They all had $200k sports cars. One guy literally paid for his exes rent.

1423,About one young man apparently handed a sinecure who nonetheless found himself unable to handle the situation [Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber]," **about one young man apparently handed a sinecure who nonetheless found himself unable to handle the situation**

I will begin with a story. The following is the tale of a young man named Eric, whose first experience of the world of work was of a job that proved absolutely, even comically, pointless.

&gt;Eric: I’ve had many, many awful jobs, but the one that was undoubtedly pure, liquid bullshit was my first “professional job” postgraduation, a dozen years ago. I was the first in my family to attend university, and due to a profound naïveté about the purpose of higher education, I somehow expected that it would open up vistas of hitherto-unforeseen opportunity.  
Instead, it offered graduate training schemes at PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, etc. I preferred to sit on the dole for six months using my graduate library privileges to read French and Russian novels before the dole forced me to attend an interview which, sadly, led to a job.  
That job involved working for a large design firm as its “Interface Administrator.” The Interface was a content management system—an intranet with a graphical user interface, basically—designed to enable this company’s work to be shared across its seven offices around the UK.

Eric soon discovered that he was hired only because of a communication problem in the organization. In other words, he was a duct taper: the entire computer system was necessary only because the partners were unable to pick up the phone and coordinate with one another:

&gt;Eric: The firm was a partnership, with each office managed by one partner. All of them seem to have attended one of three private schools and the same design school (the Royal College of Art). Being unbelievably competitive fortysomething public schoolboys, they often tried to outcompete one another to win bids, and on more than one occasion, two different offices had found themselves arriving at the same client’s office to pitch work and having to hastily combine their bids in the parking lot of some dismal business park. The Interface was designed to make the company supercollaborative, across all of its offices, to ensure that this (and other myriad fuckups) didn’t happen again, and my job was to help develop it, run it, and sell it to the staff.

The problem was, it soon became apparent that Eric wasn’t even really a duct taper. He was a box ticker: one partner had insisted on the project, and, rather than argue with him, the others pretended to agree. Then they did everything in their power to make sure it didn’t work.

&gt;Eric: I should have realized that this was one partner’s idea that no one else actually wanted to implement. Why else would they be paying a twenty-one-year-old history graduate with no IT experience to do this? They’d bought the cheapest software they could find, from a bunch of absolute crooks, so it was buggy, prone to crashing, and looked like a Windows 3.1 screen saver. The entire workforce was paranoid that it was designed to monitor their productivity, record their keystrokes, or flag that they were torrenting porn on the company internet, and so they wanted nothing to do with it. As I had absolutely no background in coding or software development, there was very little I could do to improve the thing, so I was basically tasked with selling and managing a badly functioning, unwanted turd. After a few months, I realized that there was very little for me to do at all most days, aside from answer a few queries from confused designers wanting to know how to upload a file, or search for someone’s email on the address book.

The utter pointlessness of his situation soon led to subtle—and then, increasingly unsubtle—acts of rebellion:

&gt;Eric: I started arriving late and leaving early. I extended the company policy of “a pint on Friday lunchtime” into “pints every lunchtime.” I read novels at my desk. I went out for lunchtime walks that lasted three hours. I almost perfected my French reading ability, sitting with my shoes off with a copy of *Le Monde* and a Petit Robert. I tried to quit, and my boss offered me a £2,600 raise, which I reluctantly accepted. They needed me precisely because I didn’t have the skills to implement something that they didn’t want to implement, and they were willing to pay to keep me. (Perhaps one could paraphrase Marx’s *Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844* here: to forestall their fears of alienation from their own labor, they had to sacrifice me up to a greater alienation from potential human growth.)

As time went on, Eric became more and more flagrant in his defiance, hoping he could find something he could do that might actually cause him to be fired. He started showing up to work drunk and taking paid “business trips” for nonexistent meetings:

&gt;Eric: A colleague from the Edinburgh office, to whom I had poured out my woes when drunk at the annual general meeting, started to arrange phony meetings with me, once on a golf course near Gleneagles, me hacking at the turf in borrowed golf shoes two sizes too large. After getting away with that, I started arranging fictional meetings with people in the London office. The firm would put me up in a nicotine-coated room in the St. Athans in Bloomsbury, and I would meet old London friends for some good old-fashioned all-day drinking in Soho pubs, which often turned into all-night drinking in Shoreditch. More than once, I returned to my office the following Monday in last Wednesday’s work shirt. I’d long since stopped shaving, and by this point, my hair looked like it was robbed from a Zeppelin roadie. I tried on two more occasions to quit, but both times my boss offered me more cash. By the end, I was being paid a stupid sum for a job that, at most, involved me answering the phone twice a day. I eventually broke down on the platform of Bristol Temple Meads train station one late summer’s afternoon. I’d always fancied seeing Bristol, and so I decided to “visit” the Bristol office to look at “user take-up.” I actually spent three days taking MDMA at an anarcho-syndicalist house party in St. Pauls, and the dissociative comedown made me realize how profoundly upsetting it was to live in a state of utter purposelessness.

After heroic efforts, Eric did finally manage to get himself replaced:

&gt;Eric: Eventually, responding to pressure, my boss hired a junior fresh out of a computer science degree to see if some improvements could be made to our graphical user interface. On this kid’s first day at work, I wrote him a list of what needed to be done—and then immediately wrote my resignation letter, which I posted under my boss’s door when he took his next vacation, surrendering my last paycheck over the telephone in lieu of the statutory notice period. I flew that same week to Morocco to do very little in the coastal town of Essaouira. When I came back, I spent the next six months living in a squat, growing my own vegetables on three acres of land. I read your *Strike!* piece when it first came out. It might have been a revelation for some that capitalism creates unnecessary jobs in order for the wheels to merely keep on turning, but it wasn’t to me.

The remarkable thing about this story is that many would consider Eric’s a dream job. He was being paid good money to do nothing. He was also almost completely unsupervised. He was given respect and every opportunity to game the system. Yet despite all that, it gradually destroyed him.

Why?

To a large degree, I think, this is really a story about social class. Eric was a young man from a working-class background—a child of factory workers, no less—fresh out of college and full of expectations, suddenly confronted with a jolting introduction to the “real world.” Reality, in this instance, consisted of the fact that (a) while middle-aged executives can be counted on to simply assume that any twentysomething white male will be at least something of a computer whiz (even if, as in this case, he had no computer training of any kind), and (b) might even grant someone like Eric a cushy situation if it suited their momentary purposes, (c) they basically saw him as something of a joke. Which his job almost literally was. His presence in the company was very close to a practical joke some designers were playing on one another.

Even more, what drove Eric crazy was the fact there was simply no way he could construe his job as serving any sort of purpose. He couldn’t even tell himself he was doing it to feed his family; he didn’t have one yet. Coming from a background where most people took pride in making, maintaining, and fixing things, or anyway felt that was the sort of thing people *should* take pride in, he had assumed that going to university and moving into the professional world would mean doing the same sorts of thing on a grander, even more meaningful, scale. Instead, he ended up getting hired precisely for what he *wasn’t* able to do. He tried to just resign. They kept offering him more money. He tried to get himself fired. They wouldn’t fire him. He tried to rub their faces in it, to make himself a parody of what they seemed to think he was. It didn’t make the slightest bit of difference.

To get a sense of what was really happening here, let us imagine a second history major—we can refer to him as anti-Eric—a young man of a professional background but placed in exactly the same situation. How might anti-Eric have behaved differently? Well, likely as not, he would have played along with the charade. Instead of using phony business trips to practice forms of self-annihilation, anti-Eric would have used them to accumulate social capital, connections that would eventually allow him to move on to better things. He would have treated the job as a stepping-stone, and this very project of professional advancement would have given him a sense of purpose. But such attitudes and dispositions don’t come naturally. Children from professional backgrounds are taught to think like that from an early age. Eric, who had not been trained to act and think this way, couldn’t bring himself to do it. As a result, he ended up, for a time, at least, in a squat growing tomatoes.[\[67\]](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-bullshit-jobs#fn67)

1437,Interesting Lie Told to me by a Mass Chain Coffee Shop Employee,"My fave drink is currently ""temporarily discontinued"" at a certain coffee shop I'm sure you all know. 

The guys that work there, where I've been buying this drink for a long time, said to me one day, ''bad news! there's not going to be any more coming in for a few weeks!""

I said, ""NOOOOOOO...... but wait... why?""

The guys said it was due to ""covid"" that there aren't gonna be any deliveries for a few weeks. Which is kinda weird, considering there were no problems DURING the past year. So I asked for another excuse. They told me that they might be changing the recipes, then they said they ran OUT of certain products... 

Come on. Seriously. Who actually doesn't believe this has 100% to do with the fact they probably don't HAVE people there to manufacture this crap. And probably don't have any truck drivers available to deliver this shit to stores in certain regions. 

Meanwhile this chain has produced commercials to be played non-stop specifically advertising all the cool, refreshing drinks they are OUT OF for probably the majority of summer. 

Go into one of these shops, and try asking them WHY they're out of half their menu. You'll either get one of the excuses I got, or maybe some new ones. I also find it sad, I think all these employees actually buy this shit they're being fed by management. Lame ass excuses to cover up the fact nobody wants to work for their company, either. 

I'm seeing people posting pictures of completely empty aisles in stores like Target, Wal-mart, grocery stores... it's a bit scary, but at the same time I kinda feel good about it. We all know THAT MANY PEOPLE in this country have had it and an actual effort is being made to turn the tables on employers, and as a result, there is literally no stock in retail stores, coffee shops have no fucking coffee, restaurants are closing half the week, or totally... 

I've been acting pretty lackadaisical on the job, and simply don't care who doesn't like it - after all, I'm one of the only people they still have in there. And it feels good to have so much less stress, so much more freedom, to call the shots in my own life. I hope it's a trend that gets BIGGER.

1438,What class are we?,"I remember reading a book back when I was a high school student. It was recommended to me by my maths teacher. It was a book on how to be a successful businessman. The book went on and on about swallowing failure and embracing change, but what stood out to me the most was its comparison of the three classes society is typically divided into:

* According to the book, the lower-classes are focused on survival and live/budget on a day-to-day basis.
* According to the book, the middle-class are focused on comfort, and budget on a month-to-month basis.
* According to the book, the upper-class are focused on financial independence, and plan years or even decades ahead.

The question is - which class am I, if the only reason I dream of financial independence is because I want to survive without having to work? Yes, I'm anti-work.

1443,What does antiwork think about fluoride?,"Fluoride theories have always been shut down by everyone around me as a crazy conspiracy. But I have done research papers about fluoride in my neuroscience classes and found good evidence that it floods your brain cells and makes them perform improperly. It's not exactly understood what the overall impact is on us, but it's definitely not good the way it effects our brain cells. It is classified as a neurotoxin in many parts of the world.

I know people will claim that it's natural and we used to get it from spring water. That is true. But the fluoride in our tooth paste and drinking water is synthetic. It's not the same. Also, it's difficult to control how much fluoride you consume because it's just put in the water without your consent. 

People claim that fluoride makes us more docile and more susceptible to influence and persuasion. I saw a post on here today talking about how he feels like everyone looks at him crazy when he talks antiwork. Do you think that fluoride theories have any legitimacy or are they are all nonsense, crazy, lunatic, conspiracies? Is it a good thing that we have no choice but to drink fluoride and have no control over how much?

I remember years ago I saw a bunch of news stations warning about not using fluoride. They were talking about how fluoride free toothpastes were the best sellers on amazon. The whole ""fluoride is good for your teeth"" is about as valid as ""milk is good for strong bones."" They're just lies told to us by lobbyist to sell their products.

1444,I never believed in UBI until the pandemic. Now I see that it is the key to a genuinely free and fair market.,"I still don’t support $15/hr minimum wage (or any minimum wage for that matter). But UBI, IMO has been now experimented in the USA for over a year (unemployment via COVID), and it’s done what minimum wage never could: given people the freedom to choose.

With UBI, every human being in the country would have a choice between employers. Businesses usually think of competition as between other businesses only—which means maximize profits at all costs.

But UBI introduces a new kind of competition: competition for employees. No matter how menial or “unskilled” the labor you need is, you’re forced to compete with UBI to offer compensation, which means you may need to reassess your business model. 

Imagine being able to tell an employer that $15/hr is garbage for what they want when you could “earn” $13/hr by sitting on your butt or doing whatever you want.

In short: it’s an unexplored  avenue for ensuring a more free and equal opportunity market and the businesses that adapt will succeed and those who don’t will fail—and they’ll go down kicking and screaming about how it “isn’t fair” that they can’t hire legal slaves anymore.",False,o3zzi5,IfByLand,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o3zzi5/i_never_believed_in_ubi_until_the_pandemic_now_i/,23,2

Her dad: I've heard of some people actually taking sick days when they're not even sick.

Me: Oh yeah, my mom did that all the time.

Her mom: That's disgusting!

Me: Why?

Her dad: It hurts the company. If I'm an employer, why would I want an employee who exploits sick days to get out of work?

Girlfriend: Everyone does that.

Me: They allot a certain number of sick days, so they've already accounted for it. If your sick days are about to expire, why wouldn't you take them?

Her dad: I'm sorry, but I cannot respect that.

Me: Wow, okay. New perspectives!

In 49 states, inmates are charged for the costs of
their own incarceration.

 

There's no way to pay these bills ahead of their due dates or work these charges off
while in prison, no matter how hard you work. To inmate can earn enough inside to cover
the costs of their incarceration; each one will necessarily leave with a bill. The state of
Florida, which pays inmate workers a maximum of $0.55 per hour, killed former inmate
See Taylor $55,000 for his three-year sentence. He would have had to work 100,000
hours, or over 11 years nonstop, at a prison wage to pay for his three year incarceration.
Even as a free man working at Florida's minimum wage of $8.25, he would have to work
more than 6,666 hours — more than three regular work years — and not spend a penny
on anything else to pay it back. These debts are impossible for the even hardest-working
people to pay off.

Most people enter prison poor, and half of formerly incarcerated people are unemployed
six months after they leave custody. Those who find jobs after prison will earn very little;
the median income for people within one year of their release is $10,090 — only 55
percent had any earnings at all. His makes paying any type of bill a challenge. The bills
for one’s prison time compete with active and essential living expenses like housing,
food, utilities and transport. X-offenders in the United States owe about $50 billion for
various criminal justice costs like arterial detention, court fees and incarceration costs. It's
estimated that as much 60 percent of a formerly incarcerated person's income goes

 

toward “criminal justice debt,” even for those who have ostensibly paid their debt to
society.

 

life after
incarceration, because in 46 states, failure to repay them is an offense punishable by yet

These debts can make it even harder for a returning citizen to rebuild the

more incarceration. A Georgia man named Thomas Garrett pleaded guilty to shoplifting a
$2 can of beer and was fined $200 and sentenced to probation, supposedly so he could
avoid jail. That was a futile hope, since he was eventually incarcerated after he failed to
pay over $1,000 in fees attached to that $200 fine. In Rhode Island from 2005 through
2007, failure to pay court debt was the most common reason that individuals were
incarcerated, which means that, in a state that routine spends around $200 million on
corrections every year, the most common reason for incarcerating people there was
something other than crime.

1501,Working fulltime in a meaningless job and living frugally relying on a 401K/retirement to live more comfortably when you’re old is a WASTE OF LIFE.,"OK, to be perfectly honest, it’s entirely possible that this idea may actually be popular, and people simply PRETEND that working for retirement is great simply because they HAVE to, and it’s just slightly less painful to lie to yourself and pretend that it’s a great life.

Am I saying that saving and planning for retirement isn’t important? Not at all. I simply don’t care about it, because I’m 25 and been missing out on life, I’m talking about things that most people experience, even without making/having a lot of money. But being rich would GUARANTEE I could experience and enjoy these things. Sure, you may be open to a flood of gold diggers and fake friends, but on the poor end, you can’t even really AFFORD (yes, literally) to take those chances.

Advice like “live below your means”, is common. Live in a rural/remote area or the dangerous part of the city, buy second hand clothes, have a flip phone (really dumb, because a lot of jobs EXPECT you to have an iPhone or Android smartphone now, and you can’t even get an Uber ride to get home or go to work without a smartphone), eat only ramen/rice/beans, and tell yourself that you’re still better off than people in third world countries so it’s selfish and greedy to desire more in life, American dream and that sh-t.

Living “below your means” is simply sometimes NECESSARY for survival. But living so bare minimum YOUR ENTIRE LIFE? Working and waiting for “RETIREMENT”? **ONE,** you’re wasting your entire life, and **TWO,** plenty of elderly can’t even survive and are still working or have to go back to being a dry cook/cashier/janitor, the jobs that might as well be automated because they don’t pay a living wage and the work itself serves no meaningful purpose, the entire point of working is so you can live, since we’re brought into this world (WITHOUT OUR CONSENT) and we’re only worthy of survival/decent comfort if we, not only work, but have skills that can make the rich even richer.

No skills? Or skills that are more hobby based/freelancing and will likely only be able to generate a living income if you’re the **BEST OF THE BEST** in your niche? Then you’re **WORTHLESS** to society, you “don’t deserve to live”.

You see, the problem is that modern society/civilization is incompatible with nature/biology/evolution. When humans created modern society/civilization, it DID DO A LOT OF GOOD FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, but it also just threw everything out of balance, causing new chaos.

At this point, the only solution, is to keep progressing. Advance and automate technology as much as f-cking possible, not suppress it just to keep these worthless jobs that “aren’t supposed” to pay a living wage anyway. And keep **RELIGION THE F*CKING H3LL OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS!!!!!!!!** You right wing extremists (yes, going too far left can be dangerous too, I’m not denying that, both sides can suck) keep ruining everything and preventing true progress from occurring. Like keeping prostitution illegal and unregulated, and keeping healthcare behind a (VERY EXPENSIVE) paywall.

This whole GME/AMC/meme stock thing is **TAKING WEALTH BACK FROM THE 1%**, as SHOULD happen (be careful and don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose though, it’s a slippery slope like gambling). 

Nobody should be so desperate, that they have to resort to gambling, risking the little they do have, for the **CHANCE** (NOT GUARANTEE) at escaping poverty/abusive households/relationships/employers, or just to be able to afford lifesaving surgery or medication that they need (and hopefully getting enough money on GoFundMe).

Does anybody even care to hear what I have to say? Am I just stupid, lazy, entitled, or even outright delusional?

I like to think that I’m WOKE, at least a lot more than MOST people are.

So... we're all malingering under late capitalism, right? Wages are stagnant. Housing prices are through the roof. There's only so hard you can grind to make ends meet, and things have been getting steadily worse for 40 years. The global neoliberal status quo has been sucking the life out of the middle class for years now, as a lucky few escape into extreme wealth, and most are left to toil endlessly for a fraction of the real wealth our parents got for similar levels of work. 

How do you guys think the rest of the 2020s will play out, globally? We've had a hell of a start already. Lots of people who were climbing slowly got pounded back into the dirt by COVID and the resultant depression. Will this finally be the push the world needs to realize an anti-work future, where hours are gradually cut, more workers employed, wages increased, unions resurgent, and newer, better forms of social organization taking the place of the ruthless individualism that has been the paradigm for the past few decades? Will we be facing another years long great depression?

Attendance & Business Needs

 

With warmer weather coming and restrictions being lifted, it has become clear
that we need to establish policies in order to ensure smooth business operations.

BLOCKED PERIODS: The hotel will re-state the practice of blocking periods of
time for PTO requests. A hotel is a 24/7 operation, and we need to be available to
serve our guests and provide them with a superior experience while they are with
us. The approval of time off requests will be based on business needs. Times of
high occupancy will be blocked and requests will not be accepted. Excused

absence during blocked periods will result in disciplinary action, up to and
including termination.

CALLING OUT of DENIED LEAVE: Of you call out or miss work on a denied leave
day, disciplinary action may follow, up to, and including termination.

1515,"""Millennials are choosing careers over having kids"". No, I'm not. I'd rather have kids than a career, but the capitalists have created an economy where we can't afford to have kids.","Any other millennials getting sick of the endless headlines about how we are ""choosing"" careers over family? Because I am. I am not willingly ""choosing"" a career over having kids, I'm stuck living in a society where it is increasingly *unaffordable* to have children and where there is minimal support for families because society has been set up so the rich can benefit while the rest of us suffer.

I don't find my career fulfilling. I'd be *way* more fulfilled having and raising a family, maybe working part time in something low stress, but my fiancee and I don't see a way we will ever be able to afford that, not when we'd need a bigger place, more money in an economy where wages are stagnant, and when grandparents are forced to work until their 70s instead of helping with kids. Both of us spent a lot of time with grandmas growing up because the economy didn't demand couples work until they were 70+ to retire. 

I'm also sick of being seen as a ""bad feminist"" because I'd rather have a family than a career. I'm not judging anyone who finds fulfillments from their career. But I hate the way we have been conditioned to think we *have* to want a career. Wanting a fancy career is  just not for me. Work is a means to an end for me, something I have to do in order to put clothes on my back and a roof over my head, but nothing more.

Then the office had to let me go and there went my health insurance to pay for the surgery I'd need. Then we had spent so long surviving on one income it was decided to stay off the front lines until we got vaxxed. Now I'm vaxxed, but it came too late to make a difference for my EFM.

If you had the bravery to just up and quit a horrible job, but now you're having to explain the gap, now is the easiest time to do so...

1556,Why No Buy Friday is a great form of protest.,"Yesterday was the [3'rd No Buy Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o2f0hc/3_no_buy_friday_baby_steps_leads_to_bigger_steps/). I like this idea it's simple, peaceful, team building, unites us, anyone can do, and has minimal sacrifice.

1. It's peaceful, no one gets harmed. Most likely you will postpone your purchases. There is no intent of harm. Any ideas that inflicts damage  requires too much sacrifice, and many people will have fear such as losing their job, losing their home. This is just chill on friday. At first you will probably sacrifice being with your friends as they will want to go out and spend money, but once they join in, you and your friends can just go to the park &amp; chill.
2. Due to above point this has potential to build additional trust with your friends, as it's also a team building exercise.
3. It gives a light signal to corporations that something is up and we are working together.
4. It is something that everyone can do no matter the income level.
5. The sacrifice is very minimal, and there is no risk of anyone losing their jobs over this. Just shift changes in jobs to avoid Friday. Which I hope will have a trickle effect into normalizing a 3-day weekend. I don't know how far it will go, at minimum this protest will accomplish us gaining trust with each other.
6. Builds a community that wants change. Right now there is a clear problem and we can't agree on how to protest, or what issues to protest for. This is a baby step that creates a rhythm, creates trust and belief that we can accomplish something together.
7. You don't have to go anywhere. I recommend enjoying your day with free activities like park, playing games, you can just stay home.
8. Disability friendly, and accessible due to above point. Anyone can join this protest.

If you see on the news that this isn't working, the fact that it's on the news means this protest is working. Anything that harms corporates will have a storm of FUD campaigns dismantling the organization. If such a thing happens that means a simple day like this is harmful more than we understand and we should definitely continue protesting like so. The media keeps telling us we can't work together cause it doesn't work. Well, it doesn't work cause first of the enemy is telling us it doesn't and we believe them. It's a self fulfilling prophecy. And secondly corporates put huge effort in dividing us for anything even if it's useless and I suspect they will try for this protest too. By growing weekly every friday, we grow our trust, our beliefs, and we unite on the simple fact that we want change. This thing alone will scare corporates.

Any form of strike requires huge amount of coordination, requires supporting each other, neighbors, strangers and more. No buy Friday is weekly and the coordination is adhoc, doesn't require a central entity, just your belief, which will make it hard to infiltrate. The protest itself is not perfect, it's not entirely my idea, I have seen discussions on this sub antiwork about doing different forms of picking a day and not buying anything.

1562,Mowing lawns were my introduction to useless work,"In high school I started mowing lawns in the summer. I got all the clothes and food I needed from home, but I wanted money for expensive junk like cooler clothes and candy.

Not until later did I realize how bad monoculture lawns are for the ecology, and how people keep them for showing off wealth (""I don't need to grow food here""). My job as a lawn mover was basically removing all the beautiful flowers that tried to break up the monoculture. And I was polluting with noise and exhaust while doing it.

Doing this useless job to consume useless junk really encapsulates what much work is about. I wish I at least had saved the money or spent them more wisely, but grinding and rewarding yourself for grinding is a vicious cycle.

Just before graduation they fired me from both jobs as I no longer will be student and they can only afford hiring students. Understandable. Since then I have been sending CVs to different jobs. I have sent more than 200. And it's terrible.    Either I am too educated for a job ( like shop assistant) or I don't have enough work experience (jobs in my field). I know it's only been two months, but I am starting to feel depressed. Even jobs in my field are suddenly paying as little as shop assistants or like other jobs that don't require degree (yeah crisis after pandemic) Why did I go through all that stress and studying only to work 9-5 job for 900€. And that only means someone will hire fresh graduate without any real job experience.

So he has no future there.

I lost my job at the start of covid and no one has even responded to my applications in weeks. I used to get interviews, but nothing since like March, now. not even a hint of a job. nothing. I DO have a degree, a BS in a lucrative industry. Still, no one wants me. 

to make things worse, I won't explain the ridiculousness of THIS situation but we have to be out of where we live by mid-July, hard stop. And again. No one replies to rental applications, calls, emails, or any attempts to get into somewhere to live---be it rent or buy.

1615,Companies need to be taxed where they earned the money.,"I saw a post on here from somehow wondering if it's possible to put a cap on net worth.

I just wanted to put out here that companies hide a lot of money in letter box companies in countries like Hong Kong, Switzerland, Panama... 

The reason why is company tax laws. Companies are taxed where their fiscal seat is. This is the place of registration or where the ""letter box"" is. A lot of chains just have an address on some slumpy building in Hong Kong. 

Taxes are much lower there, which is why they want to be taxed there and not here in the west. 

If we truely want to tax the rich, we need to change company law. This will lead to a lot of chain stores quiting though. But that's ok, since multinationals took a lot of job. Less multinationals means more jobs. Small businesses pay fair taxes and try to get by with some ""black money"" which is usually tolerated.

So I got another job, Instead of giving my 2 weeks notice, I took a 1 week vacation to check out the other one to see if I'm gonna like it there, and after that, I showed up to my original job and cashed my remaining vacation days and sick days (which is awesome) and asked them if I can just work part time which really pissed my bosses off but they have no choice but to say yes, I was  barely working, I was just half assing everything on there wishing they would just get rid of me  LOL but they could not fire me because they know the manager is unbearable and no one would really last a month with her. I really don't want to burn any bridges because I'm paranoid like that, somehow I wish I should have done worse but I'm glad I didn't.   

In the end, I got a better pay from the other job and I left this horrible one. My job right now can be a bitch too but it's much more tolerable that the last one.

But he appreciated my top knowledge of real estate law. I was working part time. When the rona happened, not much was being sold so he asked me if I wanted to be a building manager instead. I knew there is a shortage of building managers because it's long nights and fairly average pay. Average is 1600 net and cleaning ladies make 1500.
The conversation went like this:

- I took this job because it's part time.
- Why don't you want to work full time?
- because it doesn't fit with my other activities
- why not?
- i do freelance work
- oh
- i told you when you hired me
- you know, it's kinda fun work you know, i know it's long nights... But...sometimes you see some interesting personalities during these meetings
- (i was thinking wtf then you do it yourself. I already said no. I don't give a rats ass about appartments and the complaining people there)
- if you can't be building manager i'm gonna have to let you go because there's no work to do during the rona
- alright... (me secretly happy looking forward to a couple of months of freedom).

I didn't really work as a freelancer. I just really wanted out... I hate men who try to push or trick me into a job that clearly sucks monkeyballs and is payed like a cleaning lady.

1638,I stood up against my toxic manager and quit my job,"I started a new job about three months ago. This time, I was determined to make it work after a few failed attempts at other jobs. However, very early on, I spotted some weird behaviour from my manager (clear red flags in hindsight), that I tried to ignore or justify in my mind. For example, she would send WhatsApp messages late at night about things that were not urgent, or she would get very frustrated if I didn't remember very specific (and irrelevant) details of certain projects.

Once she got angry because I sent an email on a Saturday morning saying I could not look at emails anymore that day. She got so offended that she organised a meeting that week and expressed how disappointed she was. My response was that ""I'm contracted to work 40 hours a week, no more no less. My time costs money and I won't give it to the company for free."" She didn't like it.

Fast forward 4 weeks to my performance review. She says I'm underperforming (bs) and that I need to work harder. She then adds a set of unrealistic targets to my (already unmanageable) workload. Of course, I opposed to such an impossible task and asked HR for support. They knew about my concerns as I had raised these with them a few times.

After some turbulent back and forth with manager, HR set up a meeting with both to 'get to a resolution'. I knew from my conversations with HR that nothing much could be done (they were useless but empathetic), and so I basically showed up to resign. I told my manager that ""I no longer wanted to work under such toxic and delusional management."" She was fuming, her face red as if she was going to explode at the any given moment. Later on I was told by HR that she would have fired me that day anyway.

It felt so good I'm ecstatic. I know it's just a small victory, and that I still need a job, but I'm so happy that I stood up against her oppression! Working is already hard enough to have to deal with such poisonous people.",False,o3cwxk,humancat0,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o3cwxk/i_stood_up_against_my_toxic_manager_and_quit_my/,46,19

I think everyone can agree that the exploitive system which has been in place for so long desperately needs to change, but what power do we really have? What can we do?

I personally just recently started my professional career. I see older people in my office, some of which have been there for upwards of 30 years, and it terrifies me. Every time I sit in my cubicle I can’t shake the feeling that I’m throwing away the best years of my life, doing something I have no passion about purely so that I can afford food and a home and some select few luxuries.

1667,Going through the motions again..,"Hey all, so I just moved to a new city and possibly landed a new job, so exciting, I know. It’s waitressing at a local pub, and I have never done this before so if anyone with experience would like to share their stories, I’d love to hear! 

Anyways, I had a sort of trial shift yesterday, and I’m not sure how it went. My overall impression of the job is that it’s somewhat degrading and soul sucking. I’m encouraged to flirt with customers for tips, dress sexy, gotta deal with obnoxious people drinking, And the girl I was shadowing was running around constantly and barely had 5 mins to even take a piss. Do I want this to be me? Maybe there’s a reason I stayed away from serving, other than the fact no one ever aspires to do that. I went to trade school originally and I’m fed up with that shit too. 

What put me off was how they had me come in at 9am, didn’t even say how long my shift would be, or if I should bring a lunch etc. Do they even have a staff room? Who knows. So, I was anxious the night before and hardly slept, and anxious In The morning so I didn’t eat. I threw up when I finally got home just from stress. I have been pretty isolated during the pandemic, so it was quite overwhelming to be interacting with so many people and having everyone stare at the new girl. I have some social anxiety so I push myself into it sometimes but I just wanted to die when I was there. 

So as soon as I ask how long my shift is, the guy goes, “why? There somewhere else you gotta be?” And I said that I have a right to know so I can be prepared and take care of myself etc, and I just have a right to know how much of my time I have to give up to you before getting back to my life, and I was pissed. Like fuck off, none of your business for one, and two, yah I got a million places I’d rather be than here. I only thought the last part in my head lol. I’m in my 30’s, been working since like ten with paper route and babysitting, then steadily working since 15. I’m fucking burnt out, I just need money don’t expect me to kiss ass. They probably saw that as a negative thing like I’m not super stoked to be there, we will see if they call back. 

Thanks for listening to my rant guys, I love you all in this community and I hope we can fucking change something someday.",False,o2j2zq,justme4433,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o2j2zq/going_through_the_motions_again/,5,2

1674,Just sharing that I quit my job and some of my own perspective on working.,"I quit my contractor job paying $20/hour. This rate may seem pretty good for some of you, but I live in a major city and the the taxes on contract work is crazy high. I basically make a few dollars more than a McDonald's worker where I live. Previously, I was making $32/hour as a web developer, but that job burnt me out so bad and the commute was a 3 hour total every day. Which was why I pivoted my career and starting working from home with my contractor job. Basically, I had decent paying jobs throughout my life and comfortable environment. I had the privilege of not having to suffer at a Amazon facility and peeing in a bottle with no breaks. Or flipping burgers and having crazy people throw nuggets at me. Yet, I am still on this sub-reddit because I think something is not right with working the way we do.

For some background. I am not white or living in the suburbs. I am a brown asian whos parents fled here from a third-world country and I grew up in a gang infested neighborhood. I busted my ass to get myself in the corporate world and it fucking sucks. Ever since I started working, there is no time for creativity, art, or working on your own projects or living your life. You are not free. You are a corporate slave. This is not a life any of us wants to live. My biggest accomplishments in life happened when I was unemployed and had mental time to think freely and make things

&amp;#x200B;

Some of my accomplishments when I was unemployed:

\- Wrote a JavaScript tutorial article which blew up to monthly thousands of views for some time.

\- Went to New York on my own savings after I quit my previous job and wrote an article about my experience which also blew up and gained thousands of views.

\- Got super fit and was the top post on /r/brogress for a few weeks when I posted my before and after pics.

\- I made a few youtube videos on web development which broke above 1,000 views each consistently whenever I uploaded.

\- I made electronic music and shared them on the internet with positive feedback.

\- I was able to breathe and get 8-10 hours of sleep everyday.

Unfortunately, my savings did run out and I had to get another job, which is the one I am currently working until my last day next week.

NONE of these accomplishments would have been possible if I never quit the jobs I held and I was employed. There is simply NO time for these things. Most of these accomplishments happened during odd hours like 3-5am because my mind gets creative at odd hours. I uploaded videos, wrote articles, made music, and created posts always after 12am midnight. When I'm employed, my brain becomes mush and I just become  demotivated and it feels like I'm on a drug that just numbs my whole life down like a creative person that jumps on Ritalin or something. On top of this, it is impossible for me to pretend like I care about a company. So many people at work act as if the company is their life and then weeks later they vanish either from being fired or they just jump ship and go to another company. It's all fake and I'm not a great actor. I'm never a culture fit at my jobs. I'm just the quiet dude that gets work done. Hopefully, one day. We all find a way to get our bills paid for without having to slave away our time. It's possible, we just have to find our own path to get there.",False,o2gv18,sok213,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o2gv18/just_sharing_that_i_quit_my_job_and_some_of_my/,15,10

1678,This Job feels different and I'm pumped.,"I'm not as anti-capitalist or doomer as this subs usual vibes so if you want that vibe skip this.

Last job was classic anti-work bad job type shit, and leaving was awesome, I even went 6 months on savings just not to go back to work.

But I got stuff to pay for so I was looking for work and I found something I am happier with and just wanted to share it with you guys.

I have wanted to get into finance for a while, I like numbers, and numbers with $$ at the front or %% at the back just make sense to me, in a funny way that makes my friends go ""huh how'd you figure that out so fast?"" I just felt like that whole world was out of my reach.

Anyway this new job is paying us to take our licensing, and the whole thing is work from home. They plan to transition back to the office, but for now its optional. Super convenient for now.

My last job worked in office through all of 2020, and the boss was an anti-covid conspiracist and thats just the surface level stuff.

I've got benefits and normal hours and no weekend or off hour expectations and the pay will cover the bills and build up my savings again.

The culture seems cool so far, no toxic shit. I'm too jaded from other jobs to really trust it, but hell getting paid to get my licensing? I could leave after I am done, and they can't take that from me, I am way more valuable in the job market after that, and I am pumped about it.

Like I said its not as doomer or anti-capitalist as the sub usually is... for fucks sake I'm getting licensed to work in finance, half of you probably think I am contributing to the eternal cycle of wage slavery.

increasing. You have zero socioeconomic beverage, zero
political power, zero say.

on.

More and more jobs require degrees, and those jobs pay
less and less, and those degrees cost more and more. He
have a more educated, more competent workforce today,
and that workforce is getting poorer, not richer. Your
individual competence has nothing to do with it, our
situation today is the result of macroeconomic forces -
there is a socioeconomic power balance. The more
power the rich have - the employers, the job creator - the
less they have to pay you. It's that simple.

Im so tired of this hassle of working every fucking day for a low wage of 10 bucks an hour. Im so fucking done with everything. I come back after a 5 day vacation ( that i had to fight for after fucking working 4 months without asking for more then one day off) and come back to this dumbass of a fucking manager who is extremely sexist and is so full of himself. He comes to me telling me shit that i already know and is telling me to do something i already don't. I been working here for a year and this is the bs i get? And now there is a no cell phone ban for some fucking reason because in this store there is not a single person who comes in for literally 4 hours at a time and hell if they come in I help them immediately and do my god damn best. But here he comes telling me all this Shit as if I never done thing. Then he tells me that when i was gone that HE made 2,000 in sales or some bs like that and tells me that we need a better attitude. Bro i was gone on the busy days and not only that but the reason they come back is because of me and the other low wage slaves help them. You didn't do jack shit and even then why would we want to get the store have high sales when we don't get paid more then 10 bucks for it? The sales of the store doesn't correlate to how much we get paid and you micromanaging us doesn't fucking help. Then he says we don't tell customers they can refund because we don't do that and its like bro some customers will fucking lie about that because everyone fucking knows you cant refund shit why would we say that? And then you throw other people under the bus for what? Im so fucking done with this shit and if i leave its the same shit somewhere else and it never fucking stops. This world is fucked and im so tired, depressed and angry that this is how this fucking life is. Its 2021 and people still act as we should be proud to struggle to pay for car, insurance, food, rent, and fucking phone bill. Fuck working for small and big companies.

1715,It's Impossible to be disabled (Rant),"I have PTSD, bipolar disorder, severe free floating anxiety disorder, and fibromyalgia. My doctors have said for years that I am disabled. I tried to apply for social security, which I paid into for 30 years. And they told me that I cannot possibly be disabled if I have worked in the past 12 months. I asked them how that is possible and they had no answer. So I filed for FMLA leave, and I'm trying to take advantage of the short-term disability benefits, which I have been paying for for 5 years. The insurance company has taken 4 weeks now, to even make a decision. After receiving 12 pages of records about my diagnosis and treatment, they said they needed more. My medical team proceeded to fax them 137 pages, and told me that they were angry that they requested such invasive records. After all that, they approved one month of benefits. I don't want to go back, because I don't know what I would do if I snapped again. The federal government says I can't be disabled, even though they aren't doctors. My doctors say I am disabled, and they are doctors. I've been paying for insurance, both medical and disability. And when I need them to do the one function that they serve, they try their best not to. Oh, and they are only going to pay 40% of my regular pay.

Today he started chewing me out in front of the other contractors (not his employees) about leaving the garage open where we have our office onsite.  It's a secure site behind a gated residence and it was already 98° by 8am this morning.  There's no AC in there and I was never told it had to be closed while I was onsite.   While he was bitching I just collected my tools, gave my notes to the PM, and told the company owner I expect my payment in the next billing cycle.  The best part was the look on the other contractors faces.  They were trying so hard to hide their amusement.  

I've worked for enough assholes in my years to know what happens.  It never gets better, it'll only get worse.  That's how asshole bosses operate.  They grind you down till your broken and just take it.  A bully.   But after taking enough shit over the years, I know how to stand up for myself and walk away.  No one will can do that for you, you gotta decide.  You won't see their other employees ever do it because they've been broken.  Don't let it happen to you.

Weird, when a home has 10+ offers all at the seller's disposal, then you really aren't even purchasing a home, you are having a sealed bid auction, and higher offers due to FOMO are increasing home values which to me is going to lead to a crash.

Honestly I don't even think there is a shortage of homes.

1726,The weekends just stress me out now,"I'm sure you all can relate, but I can't even fully enjoy my weekends anymore.

My husband got a new job, working a traditional 8-5, M-F schedule. Before this job he was working 4-2, which don't get me wrong, was awful and not healthy whatsoever. But the only good thing about it was that he was able to help around the house or run errands while I was at work because he was off so early. He worked at a grocery store, so we almost never had to go grocery shopping because he was able to buy our groceries at his store. He would also sometimes go to the laundromat after work, since we live in a shitty apartment with no laundry machine hookups. 

I'm so happy and proud of him for getting this new job, but now we only have the weekends for all our errands and I hate it so much. We have to go grocery shopping, go the laundromat, basic cleaning, and meal prep for the week because we're trying to eat healthier. The absolute worst part about it is that I now get very anxious when we have plans on the weekends. I should be happy and excited that I'm seeing my friends and family, but all I can think about now is how are we going to get everything done?? This week we have plans on Saturday and Sunday is Father's Day, so those days feel like wipe outs. My apartment and car have been a mess for weeks because I just don't have the energy or desire to spend hours cleaning on top of everything else. It's honestly depressing me. And yes, I know we should be doing these throughout the week, but the reality is that I have to take care of my animals in the morning and don't get home until 6:45. So we end up eating dinner, walking our dog, taking a shower, and watching maybe 1 hour of TV before bed.

1728,Anyone a young adult and feel that the next 10 years is going to be mysterious?,"I decided to drop out of community college because I couldn’t find a major I was remotely interested it and found college to be a scam. If you don’t go into a ridiculous major (have y’all seen calculus? You can’t pay me good money enroll in that shit), you are pretty much bound to be laughed at/broke, unless you have creativity along with great work ethic.

However, great work ethic is practically used against you in remedial jobs. I’ve bounced around jobs, most of them being public companies where every manager has a manager, there is always a higher up. I am pretty much done working at these places because they exemplify corporate greed. None of the jobs I had ever offered any benefits and even the pizza place I worked at that I thought was more “family style” just wanted the best of both worlds of corporate style without giving me the benefits of being a family.

I feel that a “good job” is nothing but a myth as I live in an area that can be considered overpopulated. What is there to do for the average male in society? I will admit I was never crazily gifted athletically or academically, but I consider myself average and I’m sure some people can say I’m above average (my parents say potential is the sky but what do they know lol). 

I don’t want to sell my soul to some company that sees me as a hamster running a wheel for their piggy bank they can smash so they can travel the world, buy designer clothes, and drive around in the latest BMW…

The job is mostly administrative with some interesting tidbits occasionally. It’s not difficult, I get paid decently and work from home, and doesn’t take 8 hours a day. Some days I don’t do anything work related. With that said, it’s not satisfying at all. Was talking with my partner about it today and it went like this:

Me: I want to get a different job to get some fulfillment. I don’t feel anything great from the job I have now.

Her: Yea, but you get paid a decent salary with minimal work and a bunch of downtime. You have time to do things you want and still make money. Plus, you always disliked your old bosses.

Me: But a different job might give me that fulfilled feeling again.

Her: Why not look for that feeling with something you want to do? Like a hobby. A big one. You always wanted to learn wood working.

Lightbulb!

I've felt somewhat satisfied in previous jobs, but never proud. Work has had me so brainwashed for the last 10 years that I only thought I could get satisfaction from a job rather than something I want to do. How stupid.

1779,Honest Review of my old McDonalds job,"Appreciate the downvotes, good to know people support corporations treating employees like slaves. I posted this to indeed by the way:

""I worked at McDonald's for a month before I voluntarily quit over the phone. The training was very barebones. They had you sit infront of a very old and dilapidated PC and made you go through basic legalese/osha stuff, as well as very basic rudimentary ways of operating the equipment. I should have took this as a sign to leave earlier.

No overtime, they choose your hours, and you can't even take a photo of the schedule. You have to call and ask what time you come in. You will be overworked and underpaid.  The REAL training they had you do was non-existent, because there was no real training. You are literally dropped right into the heat of battle, mostly clueless, and guided by another employee who isn't even a trainer, just another long time employee there. All they do is demonstrate how to do the tasks a couple times, then they expect you do mimick that perfectly, then they get mad if you mess up or ask for details. The person training me barely spoke English so there was a huge language barrier and I couldn't even ask a question.

The term ""crew member"" is vague, as depending on the day, they'll have you either doing 1 thing or literally everything. Drive thru, cashier, grill, etc. Given the option of either cashier or grill at the time I applied, the existing employees there saw I was new and immediately used that to assign me as the person to operate the grill, and putting the food in the holding cabinets, which is the dirtiest, hardest and fastest-paced part of the job. Some days its very slow, and other days you just cannot keep up. Everyone else got to do the easier work while they shirked the harder responsibilities onto me. I was the only employee out of all of them to be forced to take out the trash and clean the floors/grill grease trough as well. Sometimes if someone more experienced is not there that day, you have to take their place (ie. putting together the sandwiches and wrapping them up), ON TOP of the work I already have to do I explained earlier.

In my particular case because of the work I was assigned, I had to walk in and out of the walk in freezer a lot, and sometimes you will have to take out several heavy boxes at once and be in there for extended periods, and despite that, theres no point in putting a layer on to warm up, because as soon as you walk out of the freezer, the rest of the floor is staggeringly hot from the heat being output from the grills.  Management has no respect, or value for their employees in the slightest bit.

If you look new, naive or like a pushover, they will take advantage and you will be treated like a slave. Several times there have been situations where one manager will tell me to do one thing, then as I am doing that thing, another manager will ask me do do another thing while I am already in the middle of doing the first thing, then the other manager will tell me to do ANOTHER thing, until you get to the point where you forget the first task you were supposed to do.

You get 2 10 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch which is never enough time. Sometimes you'll be standing hours on end and your feet will be sore. Sometimes you will be lifting for hours on end. Every day was different and unpredictable and I dreaded going every time.

Overall, I outright felt like a slave working there, and nobody should have to put up with what I put up with. Please have dignity. Please have self-respect.  Do not work here. This job impacted my mental health greatly and has forever tainted my perception of what an actual good job should be.""",False,o2a8k7,spnzer,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o2a8k7/honest_review_of_my_old_mcdonalds_job/,12,2

1784,Fuck the American work force for making ME feel guilty for leaving your shitty job.,"I’m mostly a lurker, just here to rant. 

I landed a fantastic job earlier this week, something I will actually enjoy somewhat, that gives me more time to spend with my family, and pays me almost double what I make at my current job. 

I went to tell my supervisor that my last day is on the 29th of June. I did this because I start my new job on July 6th, and seeing as how I haven’t had two consecutive days off since 2016, I thought “you know what? I deserve a few days. Just a couple days to make a trip to see my parents, and get my house in order. When I told my supervisor when my last day was he decided to berate me, call me immature and unprofessional and then he said “when your new job doesn’t work don’t come back here”. 

So safe to say I am livid right now. Seriously? After years of working this shit job, and doing every bullshit task they gave me and never complaining this is how I’m treated?


I just packed up my office, wrote a “resignation effective immediately” and a notice of separation and I’m leaving this place as soon as the general manager comes back. 

The worst part? I for some reason feel GUILTY AS FUCK for quitting. Like somehow I feel like the bad guy here. I’ve been verbally harassed and manipulated by this job for years to the point where I feel like I owe them something more than a fucking letter. 

I cannot stand the toxicity of the work places in the United States. I don’t owe them shit. But yet I’m made to feel like I’m ruining my own fucking life because I decided to make a change for the better. Fuck that shit. Fuck being “unprofessional” and “burning bridges” if a workplace ever makes you feel guilty for leaving, fucking do it anyway. Those bastards are lucky they’re even getting a resignation letter. 

TLDR: fuck your job and fuck every job. You don’t owe them shit. If you’re thinking of quitting, do it. And NEVER feel like you’re the bad guy, do not put that feeling on yourself like I do. You deserve better, and so do I. The only way the work place culture changes is by us refusing to participate in their game with their arbitrary rules.",False,o2u33k,regularguybsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o2u33k/fuck_the_american_work_force_for_making_me_feel/,70,58

1806,Work won yesterday (again),"I work from home full time currently and have done for the last year or so. I woke up yesterday at my normal time having had an horrendous dream where I witnessed something very traumatic. My alarm woke me up before what happened in my dream was resolved so I was very disoriented when I woke up and actually in some distress, crying at what I'd seen and so shaken I went to the toilet and was retching for about five minutes. I won't go into detail about the dream, it's not PTSD as what happened didn't happen and can't happen now in reality

I considered taking a sick day but knew I had a couple of meetings I needed to attend and some work I was supposed to catch up on due to us being very short staffed. Like a fool I logged in but struggled to concentrate during the first few hours so didn't get much done. I attended the meetings as normal and barely contributed, all I could think about was ""why the fuck have I worked today"". It got to around the time I go for lunch and I received an email advising I had been unsuccessful in a job application for an internal vacancy in another department. I was still shaken so it barely registered.

When I went for a walk at lunch to clear my head, I realised I'd been an utter fool, realising I can't control what I can't influence and I've been stupid worrying about the impact that missing one day of work would have on my workload. I shouldn't have much to complaint about, I'm reasonably fit and healthy and in a job I actually find interesting but should pay better. The job application was only really for doing a similar role with a bit more responsibility for more money. It's not what I want to do long-term, which is teaching, so I wasn't really disappointed about not getting it

My problem is self inflicted. I'm pushing myself hard for work - I've used one years leave allowance over almost two years, but work couldn't care less about me. I'm just another person with a staff number. I live on my own so have been almost ever present online during covid and work know I'll just get on with whatever I'm given.

My boss told me that I need to councel him for missing work. How do you council someone for missing work because they were sick? My company doesn’t offer sick days and finally offered PTO but you need to ask off of work at least two weeks in advance. My co-worker has had a difficult family life and has had to miss days to take care of his family.People get sick and need time off to heal themselves. They shouldn’t be punished for circumstances they can’t control. I’m not surprised that my boss is like this. He lives in a different state than his family so it’s obvious he puts work before family. 

Thank you for listening. I’m tired of employers having no compassion for their employees. Maybe if the company offered sick time off this wouldn’t be such an issue?

1815,Just Got signed off by the Doc for 2 weeks for stress. Fuck my managers. Felt good walking out leaving them in the shit.,"We have different bands of workers, the lowest in our dpt being a 3 and highest being an 8. A senior position is considered 6 and above. 

I'm a band 4 so pretty much bottom of the rung with a couple of extra jobs. However I have been put in charge of a whole lab section for a visit by an accreditation board because I know more about the section than the band 7 manager who takes home 20k more than me. 

Everyone is told they cant take leave around the visit as the lab needs to be ship shape. So I get in to work today on my last day to get things ready and management have given every band 3 the day off. So I just spend the day doing 3 people's jobs whilst stressing about not having the section ready. Not only this but I'm currently ill and came in so a girl could have the day off to move. Turns out she was actually just moving her bf into his new flat and had colluded with another band 3 on my team who had a drs appointment of which she told him not to tell management about it till today so she'd be guaranteed the day off.

The day of the inspection management have let a band 3 off, a band 5 off and the actual head manager is off too. 

Got straight on the blower to my Dr at lunch, got signed off on stress, sent it to my line manager and said see you in two weeks, good luck with the inspection.

Felt great. Fuck them and fuck that place, that place drove me to putting a belt round my neck and tying it to my door the other night just to make sure I know i have an easy way out.

1821,There's a system in Germany wherein employees have the right thru the works constitution act to elect fellow employees into a works council that has right of co-determination in a bunch of matters. Sad that this doesn't exist pretty much anywhere else in this format.,"In Germany, co-determination at establishment (corporate) level
refers to the representation of employees of one company in
relation to their employer. The employee representatives, who are
elected by the staff, have participation and co-determination rights
in the employer's decisions. Forms of co-determination at
establishment level include

> rights to information,

> rights to be consulted,

> rights to give advice,

> rights of veto,

> rights of initiative, and

> co-determination rights.

German employee representatives participate
in decision-making

To-determination at corporate level is a comparatively powerful
instrument in the possession of the elected employee
representatives because the employer and the employee
representatives have the right to decide at equal level within the

statutory limits (so-called principle of positive consensus).

A decision taken by the employer without the compulsory
participation of employee representatives, for example, may be
legally ineffective and, hence, incapable of effectively shaping the
legal relationship with the employees (so-called theory of
conditional effectiveness, according to which the effectiveness of
any measures taken by the employer is conditional upon the

implementation of co-determination rights).

In an extreme case, the employee representatives could in fact
paralyze a business unit in Germany, e.g. by objections to the work

schedule prepared by the employer.

I'm the typical case we read here every day: crazy boss, stupid amount of workload, corporate culture BS, insane goals and expectations, lots of anxiety, etc etc... In the las month, 3 employees have quit our department and I just can't wait to be the 4th and save my mental health. Sadly, stuff out of my control made me delay my plan of quitting at the beginning of June and now I'll probably have to wait about a month until I can give my 2 week notice. 

The point is that despite knowing that I'll leave this hell soon, I'm still feeling like shit and hopeless everytime I have to deal with my manager's gaslight tactics and passive agressions. I feel physically sick knowing that I can't avoid my performance review meeting in a couple of days and I'll have to listen to his BS for almost 2 hours.

1857,Didn't go to a work happy hour and am not sad at all,"I left my last job in March of this year. I was a leader at the company and even just do to my job effectively, I had to build bridges among departments and network with people. I managed to do it well but as an introvert, it was exhausting and the place was toxic.  A never-ending merry-go-round of kissing ass and politicking and if you're lucky, you can get promoted, make an extra 10%, double your stress, and see your family less.  No Thanks.

Cue my new gig today where I'm back in an IC role and although I'm bored, I find ways to look busy and study up on some personal passions in the downtime.  Some guys from some other department (who I rarely interface with) were in town (And they only come twice a year!!)  and the Boss makes the rounds saying that there's a Happy Hour and we should all go - but it isn't mandatory - but we should go.

So I don't go. Because fuck this, I already put in my time today and did my job.  You want to go to lunch?  Sure.  But 7:30pm, my wife is home alone, I've been out of the house for 12 hours and I'm still stuck at work?  Absolutely not.

The inevitable walk-through this morning with passive scorn was palpable.  *""Missed you last night LyricalPig....Everyone had a great time""*

*Me with boundaries: ""I wasn't able to make it""*

Remember, none of these people will be there for you in a moment of need beyond what their HR handbook says they might do.  They won't be there for your spouse or kids.  This is a business transaction.  I hire a guy to trim my trees (have some huge goddamned palm trees)  When he's done, I don't just ask him to do other chores around my house and stay and socialize awkwardly with me.

1858,[vent] I feel like capitalism just doesn't work for people like me and being a stay-at-home mom sounds appealing.,"Well, capitalism doesn't really work if you're someone like me. Capitalism works for people who want to be something. They want to spend four years of their life in education, another several years gaining skills and experience and then the rest of that time just climbing the ladder of promotions until you get the raise you want and you're getting the paycheck you want.

That's just not me. There's very few things that I have stuck around with for that long. There's art but I don't really want to monetize my art. Sometimes I do art a lot and then sometimes I don't do it much at all. I couldn't imagine being a money-making machine with my art. I couldn't imagine having that kind of energy for anything.

I want to be around kids and cats.

In a post capitalist world I could be around kids and cats and not have to worry because I don't have to make money. I just have to contribute to society. I could clean it up the garbage one day, help out the elderly, help out with animals. I don't need a degree for those things, just a few days maybe a week of training.

I don't want to do a bunch of things that require a degree, I just want to help people because I love people.

If I had the money I would turn my home into a Haven for LGBT kids.

I feel utterly useless to capitalism and like capitalism doesn't care about me.

It almost feels like being a stay-at-home mom might be better. Because at least then I get to work on my hobbies and be around kids and just have fun.

1866,I am very lost right now,"Bit of context: I’ve been depressed for a year or 2 now. During that time, I’ve radically changed my way of thinking, and I’m becoming increasingly interested in the concept of simple living. 

I’m in my early 20s, and can honestly say I have absolutely no dream job, or even a job I’m remotely interested in. I feel like society has its ways of convincing people that everybody has a dream job, and that when you’ve found it, you’ll ""never work a day in your life"". I’m not buying it. In an ideal world, I won’t work, because it’s just not something that energises me. In fact, I get exhausted very quickly, and just thinking about having to work every day for the next 40 years stresses me out. 

Instead of working, I would love to spend every day doing something I love. Walk around nature, write stuff, and live far away from any major city, so I can finally breathe and escape the overwhelm. I just hate the fact that that’s practically impossible, because I am not financially independent yet. I’ve come to a point where my depression is getting worse, because I don’t feel like living in this world, where you HAVE to work just to survive. Aren’t we supposed to do something we love? Right now, I believe that I’ll either be happy when I’m doing something I really love, or if I’m not working at all. 

In my opinion, I’m stuck in a vicious cycle, where I want to enjoy the little things in life, and not spend the rest of my life stressed because I have to work, simply to survive. However, that won’t be possible until I become financially stable, which won’t happen until I’ve accepted that I’ll settle for a crappy job which will make me miserable. 

I’m so lost. Is there anyone who has similar thoughts and can give me some advice? I really don’t know what to do or what to think right now.",False,o1xx9v,Eaglxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o1xx9v/i_am_very_lost_right_now/,11,21

Instead of raising our wages for having to work 4 times as hard, they pay us minimum wage and expect us to work more hours to make up for the lack of workers. 

Two days ago, I tested positive for covid 19, Ive been deathly ill and showing all the symptoms. Im fully vaccinated but still very sick. I informed my deli manager and their boss yet they still had me go to work. The past few days Ive been working 9+ hours whilst feeling like im dying. Customers see me breathing heavily and coughing but dont care. My coworker saw me struggling to breath and didnt care. Today I had to just walk out because I blacked out from lack of oxygen. They wanted me to stay regardless (also had diarrhea woot). 

What should I do with this situation. I tried to work despite being sick because im really poor and on the brink of going homeless. I already found a new job and they hired me with a much higher pay but I still have to do these two weeks for the deli.

Do?

Congratulations! You own what Is called an investment property. He're very sorry to hear your
tenants are in trouble. Have you considered lowering or even eliminating rent for your tenants
during this time?

But that means | will lose money! That doesn’t seem fair to me.

In the contrary! Returns on Investment (net profit/investment cost) can be positive or negative.
His is called risk and it is a fundamental part of being an investor. You are not guaranteed to
make money on investments, even housing.

I still don’t think that’s fair. Didn't my tenants agree to risk when they signed on to lease
my house?

That's not quite right! Unless your tenants have a financial stake/control of the asset, they are
not investors and don’t share your risk. They are people who deserve a place to live.

Well then if I'm an investor then I'm entitled to do whatever | can to get the most returns
on my investment, right?

That depends! To you think that includes forcing someone onto the street? Rousing is not a
luxury item; it is a necessity. Are you sure you're allowed to force people into hopelessness
because your investment carried more risk than you thought?

But | have a mortgage to pay off!

You should join your tenants and call on the government for a rent and mortgage amnesty!
Mortgage banks are also investors and are responsible for risk too! On't punish people who
can't afford basic necessities, they are the ones in your community, the banks are not.

| don’t have a mortgage but | still rely on income from my rental properties. That about
me?

Of your income is affected by the crisis then you could try applying for government assistance.
Your tenants are probably doing the same thing right now. Cry asking them for help.

I have to work minimum 48 hours a week (four twelves, usually more than that) to make bills. Outside of that I have no money. If I had money, I still wouldn't have time or energy to do house chores and cooking and cleaning. If that was a non-factor, I have no friends because I have to spend all my time at work. Can't go to school because I need to work full time plus just to skid by. Even if I did manage to finish it would take way longer than a normal degree, and I would be saddled with decades of debt.

It's been this way for 5 years now. It's so taxing. I'm so burnt out. I can't do this for 40 more years (minimum). My body is in shambles. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to in life.

1914,Guilt over 2 weeks: what is wrong with me?,"Let me start this off with saying that it is mainly the clients and understaffing, but otherwise I really enjoy my workplace and coworkers. But this job is draining me is so many ways, I am at the point where I lose sleep to the anxiety I have with this job.

This is an IT company and I am the help desk dispatcher. I am highly praised and I feel like I really was foundational for the team. I've been here for less than a year but I not only coordinate technician appointments, their communication, large scale projects, technician/client questions or concerns as well as ticket input/management manually. My responsibilities grew because a majority of my peers will not handle these responsibilities. 

The manager for the team does not manage the team at all, he just advises on their ticket and that's if I put these issues directly in front of him. Morning meetings are buddy sessions and otherwise, he is handling lvl 1 techs because he doesn't have the spine to demand more employees. I've been demanding for our superiors to get more employees, further management but because they are all buddies, nothing is done. Similar aspects for the project manager.

I honestly like them all as individuals and I had been communicating for months all of the shortcomings of my team but it doesnt go anywhere, only recently has it started gaining traction. Our clients walk all over us with their demands and my already understaffed technician team can not only keep up but then put their frustrations on to me. Finally I've put in my two weeks and now everyone is upset with me. I want to cry because of how frustrating this situation is but because the CEO, far removed from the real labor and work my team puts in, has prioritized growing this company and profits. 

I know internally that I shouldn't feel guilty, I need to prioritize my mental health and wellbeing but i still feel like somehow I made a mistake. I know I want to go but I feel so guilty I'm thinking of recanting my 2 weeks. I have savings for a few months but my family did chastise me for not jumping into another job immedietly. 

I would appreciate any wake up calls and positive words from others who have learned to shake off the work guilt. Thank you for going through this rant with me as well, already feeling better just stating this all out.",False,o1bpop,Tususekon,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o1bpop/guilt_over_2_weeks_what_is_wrong_with_me/,6,5

1918,I’m not a slave to my debt,"I went to grad school almost 10 years ago and I have six figure debt. I don’t want to sacrifice my life at work and kill myself to pay off this debt. 

I feel like I’m the only one among friends, acquaintances, and others in my field that is NOT living to pay off student loan debt and thus not letting this stupid number define me.

That stupid number on a screen doesn’t mean anything to me. It’s not real. I don’t get why that intangible number dictates people’s lives in such a strong way.

One of my friends is proud of the fact that she works a full time job and has a weekend per diem job to make more money. She has worked 14 days in a row before. No thanks. She’s way closer in paying off her loans than I am, but idfaf. A single fuck!! Like I said, it doesn’t mean anything to me.

I don’t know if this is naive of me, but I feel like I’m watching all the people mentioned above on a conveyor belt to work their life away just to get rid of that number.

Does anyone else think similarly to me in this regard? Is anyone else not willing to be a slave to work just to erase a number in 30 years time that at the end of it all NO ONE thinks to themselves on their death bed: “Man, I’m glad I worked so many hours to pay off my loans.”",False,o1om20,starsandsage318,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o1om20/im_not_a_slave_to_my_debt/,16,7

1926,"[vent] I really can't bring myself to care about school work enough to do it, and i feel like im condemning myself to a very dull future.","I despise the school system, the work system etc, because it ultimately leads to a monotone life of dull receptivity and banality. of course, you all know this. I dislike it, even, to the extent where im entirely apathetic to it. I dont really care about getting a good job, I want to live an eco friendly life, raise insects/animals and make small exciting gifts for people im fond of, to make them happy. i care only about people and the enviroment

now, very sadly, that simply just isnt possible. the majority of eco work, outside of scientific studies (im homeschooled and dont take science so that isnt an option) is voluntary. and rather unfortunately, to my greatest disdain, making my friends happy is not a means of living. I would have to work to, quite literally, not end up a bundle of lumps on the dreary city streets (which, as a woman and a minority, isnt the safest) however, doing school work- at all, causes me to feel very very strong negative emotions which often make me too stressed to do it. i havent done practically anything for months, and as im homeschooled there is no motivating factors to do so. but, even so, with no positive motivation, there still comes negative disapproval from my tutors everytime i submit an assignment late. its a messy whirl wind of apathy, anxiety, negative external validation and a raw dislike of everything to do with non fulfilling labour

i understand that i need to do my school work, and play along with capitalism in order to live a fulfilling life that doesnt end up more stressful down the line. i understand, i just cant.

1932,My desk job is slowly destroying my soul (and my body),"I’ve been working a sedentary desk job for three years this August. I worked retail before this job for 2.5 years, and while I had some issues with lower leg pain from standing stationary for several hours a day, it’s nothing compared to this job. 

When we were still in the office, I experienced migraines, headaches, and eye strain on an almost daily basis. It was a combination of staring at a bright computer screen along with the ugly unflattering fluorescent strip lights. Then we were sent to work from home because of Covid and because it was unexpected, I had to do a makeshift setup at my dining room table. It worked okay for a couple months and then I started to experience lower back pain to the point where it was difficult to walk without a limp. I switched out the dining room chair for an office chair and it improved a bit.

By that point my roommate had moved out, so I was able to make her old bedroom into my “office space.” Was able to get a legit desk and make the set up a little more comfortable. Again for a while I felt a bit better, but fast forward one year. The headaches improved because I could keep my house darker than the office. 

I am now having some sort of neck or back pain on a daily basis. I get headaches and migraines and eye strain almost constantly. I feel much better on the weekends and it comes back almost immediately on Monday morning. I gained a ton of weight last year but so far this year I’m down 15 lbs. 

Things I am doing to try and alleviate it: again adjusted my set up so it’s perfectly ergonomic according to articles online, wear a posture harness thing to make sure I don’t slouch, wear blue light blocking glasses (I don’t wear glasses normally so it hurts my ears) and getting up from my desk once an hour to stretch and walk around. I’m on the phone for 9 hours a day and the headset hurts my ears and the constant audio exacerbates the headaches. 

I’ve been sitting at my desk for less than an hour this morning and I’m already nauseous from a brewing migraine. 

We’re simply not built to sit or do any sort of highly repetitive movements for 40+ hours a week. We’re meant to be doing a variety of activities each day. After 3 years of working this job I’m at the point where I almost can’t physically do it anymore and I’m only in my mid-20s. I’m looking into jobs that are a mixture of sedentary and physical work so I can get a variety of movement into my day but it’s hard.",False,o1w77m,apndi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o1w77m/my_desk_job_is_slowly_destroying_my_soul_and_my/,17,17

Then this other guy, who is of an equal title to her, asked if he could use me for support on a long term basis (which is normal). He then starts making comments that I should be working 60-80 hours a week, despite that my role only calls for 45 (I average 24 hours of actual work a week)

When I told her about this, she said no way and we had a talk with him about how I'm sticking to 45 (24 in real terms) and he was set straight. 

Turns out she's been in work environments that work people literally to death, as one of her former coworkers kept putting off doctors appointments because of their work load. That person had cancer and didn't realize it until it was too late to treat, all because of inhumane work hours.

I make $17/hr (not livable in this area) and work about 38hrs/week. My schedule is and has been incredibly flexible, I mostly make my own hours and have a lot of freedom. 

I haven't figured out what salary would make me stay (currently tracking money for the month paying for everything, whether or not it's due to see what the most I would spend in a month could be) but my biggest concern is that I hate working. I love my job! But I hate working. I have other passions that I would much prefer to be doing with my time. Some of it I am paid for, but it's really just to justify spending my time doing it.

I see what kinds of hours some of my fellow PMs are putting in and I don't want that to be me. I currently am not allowed to work OT which is fine by me because I refuse to spend more time here than I have to. 

I'm just looking for advice for how I could try and navigate this situation. There is a 50/50 chance that I will stay working here in this expensive area OR my bf will get  a new job (he's currently working 60hrs/wk and desperately wants out) and I will follow him wherever he finds a new job.

Knowing this industry, it seems like 40+hrs/week is the norm. But it's not for me. I'm wondering how I should explain my thoughts to my boss. Or do I not? When I make a salary am I able to say ""I will not work past 40 hrs""? Or should I just delicately plan my exit strategy?

Recently I have gotten off of my antidepressants, mostly because they made me feel emotionally blunted.

I’m finding myself more irritable and depressed (who would have thought). However, the only area of my life I’m having these feelings are during/at work/thinking about work. I can’t help but feel this is going to be my life for the next 40 years, exploited and run down. Keep in mind that I put 9-5 in quotes as many people nowadays work 7-5+.

If you're good at something, there's a very good chance that you put a lot of work, time and effort into refining that skill. If you're spending that much time learning something, you've got to have some interest in it.

1994,Corporations are not democratic,"Everyone always say ""We live in a democracy!!!!"". Yet we spend majority of our time in corporations, which are when you look at it not democratic at all. 


Instead they have clear hierarchy. Employees have no real say. Someone owns the corporation and controls it and have the final say in everything. The owner decide when you work and how much you earn. 


Before humans started working in corporations, majority of us humans were independent farmers working with our family. The Amish people is a good example and they also do it today. Also during the time we were hunter and gatherers we were free.

2009,"Is it really necessary to have infoline for every single thing, there is?","I work on customer service and honestly - most of those calls are the same. It's not necessary to answer all of these calls. Cancelation of an order ""when will it arrive"" and so on. There are only little amount of problems, that I could solve. And what I cannot solve - usually people could know it, if system was sofisticated enough.

There are not enough people in my job, I'm ending it in the end of July. It's really bad job. Our management is good, but corporate?

There are big fight between corporations here. You can't tell people truth on e-shop. Honestly there are no ""next day delivery"", but we need to have it there, because people would order somewhere else, where they are also lying. 

If corporations would be honest to customers, there wouldn't be such an amount of calls. Everytime there's bigger amount of calls, it's about ""Why wasn't I informed month ago?"". 

I hope there will be automatization. Me as a customer - I don't need to speak with someone. I want to have FAQ. But almost everytime there's nothing like this, so I need to write an email or call. They tell me something, that could be on web, that they are paying. 

Everybody's complaining, that there's not enough people. But why would anyone work in a job, that should be payed as well as management, because it's really hard work? If you want to have 40 operators, instead of informations on web, good for you. But you need to pay them more. 

I'm payed well. But it's only because I'm not lazy as others (you get payed by amount of calls/e-mails) and I want to have good salary. And I'm really quick (it's disadvantage in work...I hate it, but I can't be slow, I would bite my hands of boredom). 

Let robots take our job. The only ones that needs customer line, are seniors. And for them there should be some helpline, where they would find things on the internet and making orders for them.

I'm naive to think, that it would work...I love utopia.",False,o1r6xr,weedarbie,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o1r6xr/is_it_really_necessary_to_have_infoline_for_every/,4,2

2011,"Rate of pay shouldn't just be about ""skill level.""","Rate of pay should take into consideration the amount of stress that workers take on. This should be based on social factors in regards to customer interactions and interpersonal relationships between coworkers.
I'm more so thinking of customer interactions as they can be far more stressful and labor inducing than that of dealing with coworkers.

The higher up you go in a job setting, the less work those people have to actually do. Those jobs are to mainly check that the work the people below them is correct. They often time get upset if they find an error and spend more time reprimanding a mistake that doesn't usually occur than just fixing it. It takes away from their free time of sitting around and talking to other people on their level about non-work stuff.

2021,i hate my job so much," Hello, I am a 21 year old college student I hate work and school and life right now. I am with my parents for the summer. My parents are the kind who do NOT allow quitting of any kind, do not allow idleness, and insist my siblings and I have a job. I am working at a daycare right now and I am so miserable that it is genuinely getting hard for me to bare. I have to clean up human shit since my kids poop in their pants, the smell of the poop makes me gag bile, I work EVERY SINGLE day, my summer is being wasted, I am constantly nagged at by my bosses and fussed at, and the kids are some of the most disrespectful I have ever come in contact with. They are two and all I hear is no and they are a lot more violent than any other toddles I've come in contact with. Every day is agony. I go back to school at the end of the summer. Should I just tough it out or should I quit? The smell of the poop follows me in my literal sleep and my mental health has genuinely never been worse. For people who say I knew what I was getting into by working with kids, I have never worked with kids this young and had NO IDEA I was going to be working with kids this young. I thought I would have 4 and 5 year olds. I also am going to be forced to get shots and a physical which is not covered by health insurance and is 120$. I am so miserable that it is getting hard to continue on. Should I quit? My boss would literally be so confused/freak out. Everyone would wonder why and they are GROSSLY understaffed.

2041,Negative evaluation... after bending over backwards during pandemic,"Long story short, I am a manager at a publicly open building. I run a department of 7-13 people depending on the time of year. The entire pandemic we were open, my staff are elderly, and were obviously scared of coming to work in a building without security, facing budget cuts, and more work being piled on all of us. Last week each of them approached me individually to tell me I'm the best boss they've ever had and how grateful they were for how hard I fought for them during the pandemic, and how understanding I am when family things come up, people are sick, etc. It meant a lot to me.

Fast forward to yesterday and my boss (who makes more than twice what I make and has a private office with natural light and never works the floor) gave me a negative review, no raise, and 2 pages of criticism about some minor mistake I made when I was recovering from a concussion and covering for two sick employees that were out for a week with zero additional pay, increase in tasks plus making a ton of COVID related decisions/adjustments and procedures for the entire building.

&amp;#x200B;

I consider myself very lucky that I make good money in an area with a terrible economy. That wouldn't be the case if I worked in the private sector. 

The expectations are ridiculous. There's never a non-stressful moment while I'm working, most of my coworkers (same level as me) are idiots. A lot of the lower level employees are amazing (Although many are terrible) and do a great job. They're hanging on for dear life just like the rest of us.

I hate what I do and where I do it. The end result is allegedly positive, but I rarely see it. It's a constant grind and I've had to get FMLA in order to be able to take days off so I don't get overstressed and lose my mind.

I came from the hospitality sector where I was working 65+ hours  per week and threatened with my job almost daily. 

I don't know if I can do this for 16 more years until I can retire.

The only reason I stay is because I started college at almost 40 and started everything over. I make 40% less than my classmates who were 25 when they finished. I couldn't find a job for almost 2 years out of grad school because I was competing against people half my age.

The only reason I stay is because of the retirement. If I move back to private sector I can't retire until my 70s. (I'll be 50 this year) If I stay fed, I can retire at 65 in 2037.

2065,i hate so many things about modern life,"i've felt like this for awhile but i just wanted to share i guess.

today i woke up around 9:30 a.m., my body was just ready to get up at that time, no alarm or anything.

i made coffee, and just relaxed as i drank it.

i then went to the bathroom, and i cleaned my teeth.

i'm having some issues physically, so i've been doing stretches that a phsyical therapist gave me, which took about 20 minutes. i didn't even do all of them, just the majority. i'll do the rest later.

i then headed to the supermarket, and noticed it was about 11:30 a.m., and it got me thinking. modern life sucks in so many ways. if i had to work today there's no way i could have done what i needed to do just to feel ok and somewhat normal. i would've either not gotten enough sleep, or not been able to do the stretches, and rushed like hell to get out the door.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nlcy7v/im\_writing\_a\_book\_about\_my\_corporate\_experiences/](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nlcy7v/im_writing_a_book_about_my_corporate_experiences/)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Every once in a while, someone has a great new initiative they want to push company-wide. We had one where we were tasked with coming up with some kind of startup spirit. 

I've never worked in a startup, but I'm pretty sure they don't happen by forcing people you don't know (with jobs and roles completely unrelated to yours) together, and telling them that now they have to come up with a value-adding brand new idea that's going to disrupt the entire established industry.

That's a tall order. 

This initiative was planned to last for a couple of months, and all it did was have tens of teams of about a dozen or so complete strangers introduce who the hell they are to each other and then talk about what kinds of ideas people might have. 

""Gamification"" - this was a big thing. Sure, we were all on board, but gamification of what exactly? 

No one knew.

Some people really wanted to take the lead in these teams, and I'm more than willing to oblige. At the end of our two month stint in this weekly ""any ideas?"" group, we had a powerpoint presentation of something ready and we presented this disjointed mess amidst a veritable Oktoberfest of other disjointed messes. 

Believe it or not, forcing hundreds of randomly picked people into small groups to generate ideas did not generate ideas. 

I have no idea of the cost of this kind of an exercise, and while I believe that sometimes you just have to experiment, a coordinated effort of this magnitude was doomed to fail from the get-go. 

I've always wondered at how large companies get overtaken by startups, and perhaps now we know. Startups begin with having a small group of people with a shared vision come together with a product idea, be it software or whatever, and then beginning to execute on it. How do large corporations compete with this? Well, by kickstarting their own startup culture exercises. Obviously this happens by assigning random people into groups and ordering them to generate an idea that will obliterate the competition.",False,o0xwat,Agreeable_Flight_107,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o0xwat/management_initiatives/,0,3

2076,My daily routine as a non-exempt employee working from home in a job I hate over the last year and a half,"+ Set alarm for 8 or 8:30 depending on how tired I am or insomnia is bothering me the night before. 

+ Wake up with alarm and take prescribed Adderall. Clock in for 8:30 and go back to sleep until Adderall takes effect. 

+ Start to wake up around 8:24-9:00 depending when I took my Adderall. Pull out my phone and respond to texts, browse reddit. 

+ Around 9:30 - 10:00 depending on how tired I am feeling (I have bipolar as well as adhd and been having some thyroid issues too so lots of medical stuff affects my energy day to day) become satisfied with my phone procrastination and decide to get ready. 

+ Get dressed, brush hair, make cereal and start actually working 10-10:30. 

+ Some days grind like a mfer. Other days get distracted constantly and waste tons of time during the day browsing other things online. 

+ Take a longer lunch sometimes but clock in before I’m done resting/procrastinating. Usually not sooner than 10-15 mins. Just sometimes I take a walk or something. Other times I clock in but finish eating. 

+ At 4pm - 4:30pm realize I’m mentally and emotionally exhausted with work for the day and decide to go play red dead redemption 2 until I can clock out at 5. 

This is honestly a bad day example. Which I have more often than not. On a good day I wake up with the sun naturally at 7-7:30 and get started by 8:30-9. I am super productive and get a lot done. But I hate my current job and the depression of trying to find another job in this market is a drain while being held hostage by the current job. We’ve been short staffed since I started 3 years ago and I burned out a long time ago after being continuously expected to fit 16 hours of work into each 8 hour shift. Also stopped caring after management changed and the new manager rescinded my promotion and pay increase recommendation from my previous manager. 

I started getting more things done even by spending less time doing it by giving less fucks and half assing it. But I have to be careful about it because my team lead looks at stuff and will ask questions if they notice. It’s not like I’m doing anything bad. It’s just that they give us each 920 accounts to work over two weeks and also expect that we will some how make sure it’s all done perfectly which isn’t realistic. Like do you want all of it done with a few not wholly correct or do you want maybe half done with perfect accuracy. It can’t be both you whip cracking fucks. 

If I get a new job and have to go into the office during training idk how imma cope. My friends invite me hiking on weekends and want me to their place (30-45 drive) by 7-8. I’m like no can do. Best I can do is by 9. They wake up at 6am still to to to work on site. Idk if I can ever do that again. Before WFH I was commuting two hours a day, waking up at 5am just to get there in time.

2088,Am I nuts or is this absolutely insane?,"I work for a global leading insurance brokerage. I'm not very high up in the chain. Just a lowly commercial broker. 

My workload, or rather the workload of everyone in my team is absolutely ridiculous. There's currently 7 of us (which is important to the rest of my post) working 9-5, 5 days a week. Almost every day, we all skip our lunch break, log in early each morning and finish after 5pm. 

We each deal with about 25-30 clients each month. Every one of those clients has a renewal which needs processing (which can take anywhere between an hour to literally weeks) , and we then deal with each of those 300-360 clients enquiries throughout the year.

We used to have 6 team members until one of us left in January 2020. Her workload was then simply distributed among the remainder of the team... we didn't get paid more for this and we're all on a salary and do not earn commission. 

We were all asking when the hell that team member was going to be replaced, as the workload was nigh unmanageable.... it took them 7 months to replace her. 

Great, we're back up to 6. But with all of the new business coming in, we're still struggling to keep up. 

Just a couple of months ago, they hired us a new team member, who took up the role of 'team leader'... this person was not a broker, but had previously been an underwriter for an insurance company. For those of you that don't know, the two roles are very, very different. 

....we had to train our own team leader. 

But it gets worse.... I've been in this job for 3 years at this point and I still frequently learn new things. The industry is forever changing and keeping up with both internal and external updates from insurers on top of everything else is incredibly stressful. 

So anyway, this new 'team leader' has been here for a few months at this point. Due to having to train him we're still struggling, but we got news last week that one of our team is moving over to the corporate team. 

So we're back down to 6 people, our 'team leader' (that we had to train!), is still learning, and the workload is still increasing. 

This company is a 'global leader' and they don't even have a structured training scheme for roles that leave us responsible for insuring businesses worth millions... seriously, wtf.",False,o16mr4,Celtain1337,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o16mr4/am_i_nuts_or_is_this_absolutely_insane/,15,8

It's a pretty big project that I've been really involved in, so I told him I could help out in the field for a couple of days. Big mistake. The work those guys do is brutal. 12+ hour days regularly, they get notified the night before they have a job at 5 AM. The work is hard and they get back to the shop late alot. They have little time after work for their family or hobbies. They work in extreme weather conditions. Think Wyoming in the winter and Utah in the summer (105 today). They deal with straight up assholes for customers, breathing down their necks. They work under pressure to get the job done with minimal time. Their bodies and minds suffer. They are beat up by the time they're in their 40's and 50's.

They do this all because the system we deal with forces someone to do this horrendous job. All in the name of money. The customers will not shut down at a decent time, or for a reasonable window. They demand these guys work 12 + hours in inhumane conditions and travel long distances after. So because they have to be up and running to make more money, these guys suffer. 

These are good guys and I like a lot of them. But they're the type to say ""at least I have a job"". They tell me how they're previous job was a lot more work. I hate that they do this stuff so some dickheads can make lots of money. And somehow they are made to feel grateful. 

After doing their job for a couple of days, it makes me realize how toxic and damaging the system we have in place is. I would never do their job and don't know how they put up with it.

It's also useless to say life isn't fair, as if we haven't heard this a million times. I feel like throughout my life having been employed, underemployed, unemployed, and a student person, I've seen many processes, seen many faults as well as some good points. Ironically, the most I've ever worked was when I was a teacher, as that is literally all evening and every weekend, in a place where kids naturally pose anti-work phrases at you. (For the record, I never once told them that life isn't fair and then moved on.) I make posts in other subs where I think the system is not worthy enough to be met with a 'life isn't fair' and a quick turn of the back. I feel like my most recent post still has me questioning whether I'm entitled for simply pointing out flaws or expecting some bar. Then I think I'm going mad. Then I pin ball between the two. In real life too, it's the same parroting phrases and I just think can everyone be content with working whilst it not even providing basic cover for rent and other must-costs. (Bear in mind, teacher's pay is so low where I live, and certainly works out minimum wage once you factor in out of hours work, though not in that now).

2151,Boss said I was under a PIP to potential hiring manager…but I’m not,"Long story short: I got behind in work around the beginning of the year and stuff started piling up. There was a few reasons why this happened: 
1. Toxic ass team and managers = low morale and motivation, plus WFH
2. Struggling with some mental health stuff 
3. Got a serious life threatening condition from working out in Jan. which I’ve finally been feeling back to normal about a month ago
NOTE* I’m like 85% caught up at time this happened

Realized I needed to gtfo of my current team and decided to put in for an old colleagues team, everything was going well until that manager talked to mine. She stated I was under a PIP (performance improvement plan) which was then relayed to me thru the hiring manager. First time I’ve ever heard that term so I was like “uhhh I mean I’m not in a class or anything I was just told to make a to-do list” 
Anyways a quick google search shows that PIPs are official plan/programs worked between HR, boss, and said employee….none of this happened nor did I sign anything etc. All I did was make a word doc to-do list and that was a way for my boss to micromanage my progress.

I've worked at this shitty retail job for two years at one of the worst companies you can work for, all due to lack of opportunities in the rural community I now live in. Five days ago without justification or reason I was accused of over $1000 of theft without my till for the day being over or short and despite the fact the cameras didn't show me stealing anything because of course I didn't, I'm not that stupid. 

They ended up getting it resolved, turned out the closer that night fucked up the math on the deposit so bad that all that money never even existed in the first place. Its clearly a case of my manager panicking and looking to pin it on someone because that's a lot of money to go missing on her watch. So much for having your employees backs right? Whatever.

Anyway, this whole debacle has cemented my decision to get the fuck out of dodge, because if money really does ever go missing what's to stop her from accusing me again? However, due to financial strain I can't leave until July 31st, by putting in my 2 weeks on July 17th. 

I can hardly even be civil with my manager anymore and it's about all I can do to drag my ass down here every day.

He has been working remote for an entire year completely in defiance in what we've been expected to do (working in the office/remote alternating days).

While working from home he's been repeatedly nasty and abusive towards her.  He recently threw her under the bus in front of the president for missing a single email, meanwhile he hasn't set foot in the office in a year, has expected everyone else to mail him drawings he needs, doesn't check his emails, doesn't contact customers.  He has basically coasted this whole time on some vague 'expertise' he has in estimating our company's primary product, which is basically just entering data into a spreadsheet.  He doesn't care because he's at retirement age anyway, but the company hasn't trained up anyone to replace him, and we've been getting less and less work both because of the economy and probably because he's shitty SOB who no one wants to work with.

She's telling me all this and I'm trying to fire her up more by saying how he's going to drag us all down with him since the economy is getting bad and he's off fucking off doing less while we all need to pick up what he's dropping and she shuts down and says that she's scared of being out of work so she's going to just shut up and do everything for him.

2193,I dont even know why I was so eager to join the workforce in the first place.,"26M . Back in 2014 , I was a typical carefree 19 year old teenage college student . I had no major thing going on im my life apart from school . I did not fail classes nor did I get straight A's or B's in most of them either which I think was okay. Most of my time was spent hanging out with friends , watching sports , playing football and video games, joining local meetups when I got the chance  e.t.c . I normaly slept at 2 am and woke up at 8:30 on most days . During the christmas that year , I went to visit my parents and ran into an old friend. He told me about how he was hustling and studying at the same time and I could too . He wasn't trying to sell me on anything , he was just spreading the ""hustle  culture"".

We parted ways and I thought about what we were talking about. I thought that making money while studying was a good idea since I would have something going on as soon as I finished school . 2015 is when I decided to change my life . I started doing various gigs here and there . Doing peoples homework , making and sellling detergents , restaurant  work , cleaning pools , leetcode nonsense , basically anything that could make money. I started reading self help books . All I can say about them now is if you are a young  person without a clear goal with what you want to do with your life (Most people ) and want to add fire to your depression, read self help books.

4 years after graduation , I have been for the most part doing the same gigs . The difference is that I am now older and not much money to show for it . The realisation that  even with hard work and ambition , I am years away from buying my ideal home . The way to get rich and have plenty of fuck you money is by stealing , embezzling public funds , lying to customers and throwing others under the bus .  I don't even know why I was putting myself through all this pain . My dad told me once that he was willing to pay for everything as long as I helped from time to time in his printing business like I had done for years. Who am I to listen when a motivation quote tells me I could be out in the streets "" hustlin and being self made"".

 Given another chance , i would chose to continue being care free for up to two years after graduation . Once you are done with school , the message is crystal clear. F\*ck you, playtime is over . Grab a shovel and get to work. Any personal goals/dreams/ambitioons are out the window.

2204,Learned The Hard Way About “Hard Work Pays Off” By Devaluing My Worth,"*Hello folks! Although hard work can pay off, when it comes to the corporate/job world, that’s not so true; however, it can pay off if we’re talking about personal goals that you’re working hard to accomplish*

I used to work my ass off; waking up 4:50 am, working 12-13 hours, working two jobs at the same time, etc. Unfortunately, I was a gullible teen off of high school who had not experienced reality yet.

    Right out of high school at 17, literally the day I graduated, I moved and went to work in roofing the next day. We would work 6-7 days and would work up to 13 hour days at times! Pretty hard, brutal work I might add; however, I did gain useful skills for future use from this.
    The people I worked with highly encouraged hard work and kept *pushing and pushing* more and more upon me. At some point, I had become the best worker and a jack of all trades in my field. I had learned how to do everything, but I had the working force of 3 men! Due to the fact I was always being pressured to work harder, I tried to become quicker and stronger to shine above the rest! I could lay out roofing shingles for three guys at once, remove a roof at the speed of three workers, so on and so forth...
    *My hard work did not pay off however, and I never got a raise and I was never allowed to move up.* Even though I had learned to do everything and faster and quicker than everyone else, and more efficient, they realized moving me up to a shingle roofer position would cost them more money. Of course I did shingle roof sometimes, but my main job was every job: Removing the old roof, removing old nails, cleaning up gutters and ground, putting the new shingles on top, putting the new roof on, putting all work tools up and packing us up. Meanwhile, everyone else’s job was to remove the roof and put the roof on and *they were being paid more*
    My co-workers were being paid more even though I done their jobs, and more work too, but I was being paid less. Even when I asked for a raise, multiple times, I was refused.

    After working in roofing for almost three years, I left and moved into my own place. I did not realize moving would cost so much and now I had to work *two jobs to make up expenses...* so, I worked as a Mattress Deliverer for a company and at the Amazon Fullfilment Center at the same time. I was working SEVEN DAYS STRAIGHT, with no days off, which when compared to 6 days a week in roofing is not so bad when I first thought of it.
     I would constantly work hard and try to over achieve at both Amazon and the Mattress Company for months without a single off day; however, nothing good would come from this. It was now about 4 months without a single off day and I had not even a single raise from all my hard work and I was perplexed...did my hard work not pay off?

     I suffered from being anorexic from losing so much weight from working 4 months straight and working out, that I essentially quit both jobs to try to recover from it! During this time, I turned to gig work and came across the reality of companies fortunately...At this point, I had spent THREE YEARS OF MY LIFE WITH ALMOST NO OFF DAYS, working my ass off and over achieving and all I got in return were “thank you’s” and “you’re a hard worker.” No raises? And being extorted by being given more work???

  All my life I had been taught the lie about “hard work pays off” and “companies will notice.” Oh yes, they did notice but guess what? All they did was thank me...essentially, me doing more work for less money essentially lowered my value as a worker in the workforce which is ducking depressing for me to realize....Over time, I started to realize that time is valuable and living the life you want to live should come first. I shouldn’t have to work my ass off until I’m 60, which I may add is about the average life expectancy in America, just so I can retire...these companies really want us to work until the average life expectancy in America until we should retire...essentially, they want us to literally work to death; or the life expectancy we are expected to die...
How the hell can I go on working 60-80 hour weeks knowing we’re in a cycle of working to the average life expectancy in America? That literally shows how much value is put on our lives here

  Of course I still work; however, I do gig work currently and plan on staying that way to make more time for myself. I truly value my life, but I can not believe I really wasted the first three years of my life after high school being extorted by the system...in turn, devaluing myself as a worker...work hard, but only work hard if it’s to a personal goal...these companies will make you feel like you should be ashamed if you don’t want to over work yourself to meet a company’s goal...but in the end, is meeting their goal really beneficial for your future?




TLDR;

Have you ever heard of the statement, “hard work pays off?” Of course you have!

Unfortunately, I had to learn the hard way about this and learned that hard work only pays off towards a personal goal

I was a fool...I went to work the day after graduation...working 12-13 hour days; for nearly 6 days a week at my first job in roofing. I learned to do every part of the job, even better and quicker and more efficient than the ones who I worked with. Unfortunately, they handed me more work, and pressured me to work harder, which I complied with and became a three man work force in one...even though I had to do more work than anyone else in my job, they refused to move me up and pay me more as it would save them money to just have me do everyone’s jobs

After working in roofing for three years, I moved and upon moving, worked two jobs at once, 7 days a week at Amazon and a Mattress Company. I worked my ass off and did not take a day off for nearly four months...I ended up becoming anorexic and had to learn the hard way that all my hard work got me no raises and actually devalued my worth as a worker",False,o0x64m,Ro_Capone,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o0x64m/learned_the_hard_way_about_hard_work_pays_off_by/,85,25

I still feel like I don't have a answer. So I know it's possible I will not get one, or the one I want, because only me can decide and choose what's right for me. 

If everyone here is supposedly antiwork but perhaps still work, it is so you can live, pay what you have to pay and have leisures ? And maybe because you don't have the choice, or were told/formated to think it's how life is. I mean, I think I am, because we go to school for this reason in the end, besides not being completely stupid. 

And there is this I don't know, success culture ? Do something, or you are a failure. 

So, what do you work for ? If I say yes to do the interview and if I am accepted, the reasons were that I just have nothing else to do, yes, and they money.

2246,My cover letter for 2021,"Can we just cut all the unnecessary cliched questions about “what hospitality means to you,” and “when is a time you felt you gave great customer service.”  

I have 17 years experience as a server, bartender, manager, host, assistant manager, busser, expo, banquet and special event server and bartender, and even some experience behind the line.  

I have worked for a wide range of concepts and practically every company at some point: Landry’s (McCormick and Schmick’s), Pappas (Pappadeaux), BJ’s, Yard House, Grand Lux Cafe, Brio, and a ton fo private, chef-owner concepts.  

I don’t have time to play games or to be led around and have my time wasted. Restaurant owners and managers complained about lack of staff and now we are all forced to suddenly scramble for the first job we can find, because there are allegedly great jobs everywhere, and restaurants are allegedly desperate for staff; isn’t that why you all lobbied to get us cut off from the benefits that allowed many of us for the first time to actually have a consistent income stream without putting ourselves in danger? 

I’m fully vaccinated and since we have only one more payment coming from TWC, I need a job and fast and I don’t have time for HR and recruiters to waste my time. I do a good job, am both fast and efficient, and maintain a positive attitude while at work out of obligation. My plan was to go back to school and enroll in HCC’s EMS program, and take advantage of the unemployment while focusing solely on school until I could take the NREMT BASIC EXAM and start working as an EMT by the end of the year. I am still going to pursue that but now I need to also pick up a job because there are allegedly so many jobs available.  

Despite the tone of this letter, I am not a rude or insubordinate employee. I will give any job I receive 100% when I am there. It makes it more enjoyable, and negativity is bad for everyone. But I am not going to hide my frustration at being put in this position only to continue to send resumes and get no reply.  

I don’t have time for a long hiring process, and I am not looking to be in training for a month. I learn very quickly, and I have been doing this for so long that I don’t need to waste my time or yours following someone else for a week. I have bartended at a very popular and busy fine dining restaurant on Canal Street in New Orleans, and bartended at the Superdome for Saints games and concerts. I have bartended private events for the former governor of Louisiana, President George HW Bush, Queen Latifah, and Nancy Pelosi. I know what I am doing.  

I will be in class on Mondays and Wednesdays from 8 am to 4 pm from August 23 until November 24, therefore I won’t be available on Monday or Wednesday during those months. I need to be able to make $400-$700 per week, and given how rigorous this program is, I need to have time to study and be well rested so there can be late Sunday or Tuesday nights. The full program lasts for two years, and I want to find a job where I will work for that time; I don’t have time for job shopping.  

If you hire me, you will not regret it. I’ll give it my all when I am there, be professional and mature, and not complain nonstop about policies I don’t like or try any of the other things some of the younger employees might pull. I just want to show up, bartend, do a good job, and have stable income while I pursue my dream career.  

I need to start working ASAP, and apparently restaurants are desperate for staff, so why don’t we skip all the nonsense and get right to the interviewing and hiring?

2279,I walked out of my pizza delivery job…,"Well, there’s not many places I can get this out of my head and get responses from like minded people…

Let me start off by saying that I pretty much did this job for disposable income. I worked at a higher end pizza chain where we charge upwards of $30 for a specialty pizza. Anyways, that doesn’t matter because drivers get paid $13(minimum where I’m at). That’s cool and all, I was never expecting to get paid like $15+, we also get 1.50 per delivery which is eh considering gas prices nowadays. My big problem with my boss is that he is soulless and whenever there is a slight problem with my scheduling or something he becomes like this corporate possessed dummy. This is coincided with the fact that he has a useless fat wife that comes into only micromanage, she essentially is a ghost of our boss who ONLY comes into doublecheck on micromanaging shit (like why did you park over there and can you explain to me why you missed work again?)

I personally believe that being a pizza delivery driver, if you are punctual, have a newer vehicle that isn’t a total beater, this should not be a minimum wage job. You clean, you take phone calls, and deal with typical restaurant bs.


Well, the final straw hit when they broke covid guidelines by having a big ass party of 20+ people crammed in a tiny dining room. Ventilation was horrible and I didn’t want to get sick. I told my boss this situation is horrible and his only solution was to offer a n95 mask. That was when I told him it was my last day there, I honestly had no problem doing this and didn’t regret it because of how soulless and slimey he is. He wants the best of both worlds of “family style” but “corporate strictness”. I just couldn’t do it no more, for minimum ass wage.

2280,"I fucked up by voicing a concern when our boss asked, “any questions, comments or concerns?”","So for some context, I work in a ticket booth at an amusement park and it’s been insanely busy lately.

The second you’re done with one customer, the next one is already standing there and they’re pissed off because they had to wait in line. If I even want to take a sip from my water bottle, i have to apologize and do it as fast as i can while the customer gives me a dirty look. By the end if it, I’m practically losing my voice and I’m so mentally exhausted that I can barley think straight.

I know I’m not the only one who feels this way because my co workers have told me that they have the same issues. Everyone hates working ticket booth. It’s honestly terrible for our mental health.

So at the end of our meeting yesterday our boss asked if we had any questions, comments or concerns. I raised my hand and said that i get overwhelmed in that situation. I started to explain my idea for a solution, but she cut me off and said that we need to talk about it one on one.

2283,"Raise due in March, not giving giving raises out until September.","This is a rant because it is actually infuriating.  I work in healthcare, amidst all of the bullshit which we had to deal with this past year would have expected a raise, maybe even give a cost of living adjustment.  A few employees, myself included mentioned something to our manager.  The month of June would mark three months overdue.  I am convinced that if a few of us didn’t say anything it would have never been addressed at all.  This is because they actually weren’t planning on giving any of us raises at all.  The excuse was we our behind, I find that unacceptable that a huge healthcare company is behind on paying employees raises, one of the most basic incentives an employer can provide for their employees. 

Today I was approached with a piece of paper  that said our raises wouldn’t even be given to us until the beginning of September.  SEPTEMBER?!  But they plan on back paying us all…..so that makes it all better!!!  They will probably be a joke anyways but it’s the principal. 

What if I treated my employer just like how they treat their employees.  What if I had no sense of urgency and showed up to work when I felt like it.  What if I demanded they pay me for all the shifts I worked where I didn’t even get 8 hours in between.  Which is highly questionable and I am almost certain employees must be paid time and a half if they have less than 10 hours in between shifts.  Really getting sick of the bullshit.

Any widespread faith in the system is dead, what is left are people who are simply going through motions because it is what they are familiar with.  This is a common response to natural disasters and wars, survivors will still attempt to go through the motions of their daily lives even as everything falls apart around them.

The rhetoric around labor in the first world has shifted starkly away from hopeful planning for the future to how to exist as comfortably as possible for as long as possible.  This is a key symptom that should be familiar to anyone who has gone through depression.  The bleakness of one's life obscures the potentialities of that person's life, they no longer have the energy or vigor to plan long term.

When we experience this as a species however, it probably is no longer the ""irrational pathology"" that therapists and doctors will be able to pull us out from.  It is the true form of the world through sober eyes.  Work always sucked, but generations of people pushed through it to be able to see some kind of net benefit in their life, it was a potential for the future that would motivate them through the monotony of work.

This generational hopelessness is widespread, and it really is not even irrational.  You could shut up and follow the rules and get your degrees, or invest properly, or work for yourself, you could ""get it right"" in whatever that means in your worldview and die in a pandemic, or a blizzard.  You could just lose it, and the delusion of keeping it, accumulating it, being able to pass it on to your family or those you care about is fading fast.

People may gaslight you and keep calling it depression, but it's only really treatable depression if it is founded on an irrational reality.  A lot of people are anti work because there is not even the potentiality for any flourishing anymore.  That fluorishing is important, because there is no point to work without being able to build up something greater, it is only wasted effort, it is only survival that could be better spent on just surviving.

Food is exploding in price, the very idea that capital or money could keep you from being starved, or cold, or healthy is shattering.  There are millions of people looking for the way out, through investments or businesses, but it is becoming wasted effort, and even if it worked it would only hasten the fall.  Even if you become one of the .0001% that could afford a bunker when the time comes, you will starve within a year once the climate catastrophies that wipe out the other 99.9999% hit.

At my current job I’m the only employee. I’ve been on my own since February 2021 as my co-worker quit then. My boss is finally hiring someone new in July. 
We get two weeks of vacation but this also includes sick days. To me this isn’t a lot. But I’ve had to have my wisdom teeth taken out so that cost me 3 days. I didn’t want to miss work and use my vacation but my doctor said it was required and gave me a note. My boss was annoyed cause he’s never had oral surgery only fillings and figured I’d be back next day but my dentist said no. I never call in sick and if I have appts I ask way ahead. But my boss leaves every single day early and sometimes he comes in late too and sometimes not at all and it’s just me. He says he won’t leave as much but then he does anyway. And he took a whole week vacation when it was just me as the only employee I got so overwhelmed cause I’ve only been at this job barely a year and I haven’t got training on everything and all these people called and I didn’t know how to answer them and he wasn’t always near his phone. And now he’s taking two more weeks off before this new coworkers starts. I was hoping I could use some PTO to move into our new house but now I’m not gonna be able to with him gone for two more vacations.

2334,An interesting conversation about millennial work ethic.,"I was with my grandpa at our local diner tonight and as we were waiting for out food I overheard two boomers talking about today's generation. You can probably imagine the convo. Apparently we don't want to work and are lazy and we'll be dead by 50 or some shit. 

Immediately my eyes lit up because as the only millennial between 3 boomers, my grandpa included, I felt included in this conversation as I was sitting right next to them. I piped up when they stopped speaking and said it's not that we don't want to work it's that we're done working to make our bosses rich while we're stuck working 2 jobs and still unable to afford a decent living. I say this as someone who worked two jobs and had to do sex work on the side just to afford a couple hundred bucks extra for a hotel while I had surgery 2 years ago. I'm also working with my grandpa on building a tiny house now since I'll never be able to afford a house and I have no need for that much space right now. I understand what hard work is, and I have no intention to work that hard for anyone but myself again.

They proceeded to lecture me on how it's a big responsibility; like no shit. The generation who had it the easiest trying to lecture us should be a fucking crime.

I have no doubt my grandpa would have stood up for me had it not been for the fact he's practically deaf. Just thought you'd all like to her we're all lazy shitheads who faint at the site of labor.

2343,First good job," I’m a 26m living in Oklahoma. Grew up working a hard job from 14 (it was a family job, and it was abusive but that’s a long story).

At 23 I found a new job in IT at a local credit union. Initially I was both over the moon for a normal job, and also so incredibly anxious that I was having digestive issues and stomach ulcers because I was terrified they’d fire me and I’d have to go back. So, I don’t think I started to develop a healthy idea of what I should expect for myself and from my employer for a long time.

I currently am a few months into my third job at a large tech company. Full work from home, very good benefits, and my boss seems chill as hell. One of the benefits is 12 sessions of free therapy a year through Lyra (this is a thing, I was shocked). There’s some other good things going on in my personal life too, but I just wanted to say that I think this is the first time I’ve really been happy. A huge, huge part was finding the right job. For the first time I feel well paid and like these people really do want the best for their workers, and the clearest evidence of that is they out their money where their mouth is. So far, I’ve been treated awesome, which makes me excited to be here and stay here. The people here who have been here for years say they intend to retire here in private conversation.

There’s a shitload of shit jobs, but there are also hidden gems. I applied for this job literally just because I was like “well it won’t hurt” but it was listed for someone with both more work experience and education. I don’t have a degree, and it seems like most decent jobs don’t even take your application with no degree, so this was one a few that did.

Basically you miss all the shots you don’t take. I’ve got more stuff to work on in my life for sure, but holy shit does this take pressure off.",False,o0dhi6,ricktactoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/o0dhi6/first_good_job/,12,12

2368,It’s fucked up how parents think “success” for their children is them having a “good” job.,"And by “good job” they mean “full-time ‘middle class’” job.

I hate to be crass in comparing modern work life to chattel slavery, but I tend to think that an analogy would be quite helpful here. Most people don’t want their children to be field slaves of the “working” class (retail/warehouse workers, restaurant workers, etc) but they want them to be house slaves of the “middle” class (office drones, programmers, etc). And they somehow think that this is “desirable” (it’s only so in the relative sense). Like, it’s still a situation where the corporation will abuse them to the highest limits legally possible while profiting off the employee’s work/talents.

I guess that this is easier for parents to cope with mentally, though. To imagine that you birthed and raised a child only for them to be someone else’s bitch — and most people refuse to simply consider that *not* having children may be a viable option.

2420,Corporate lifestyle is disgusting,"Hello everyone, I’m here to write a rant about common work lifestyle. I think it’s disgusting how far the act of sucking up to your “superiors” is ingrained in human psychology, how people are so afraid of being who they are just because you need that in order to please some schmuck who probably got there by the act of nepotism. Hypocritical how we’re always told to be ourselves, but when we are, we have to be at specific standards to fit in. I keep hearing these stories of common workers trying to endlessly please their bosses such as bringing them coffee every morning, faking greetings, having the “initiative“ even though it’s not in their contract (god that concept is repugnant), being a general beta in general; but the moment you drop the act for a second you risk becoming another victim of unemployment. It’s also insane how language itself is tampered with, “my boss”, who the fuck would go as far as to say “my boss”? No, he’s not your fucking boss, he’s just some fucking common Joe manager doing some work in the same place as you. The moment you call someone your boss that’s the moment you accept losing your dignity.   
Is there a way to circumvent this? To just go and do the fucking job and not have all these clown acts at the same time? Truly disappointing if there isn’t. I sometimes want to beat the living shit out of these insolent power tripping managers so badly, they do not deserve any respect from anyone.",False,nzgp4b,PhVIII,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nzgp4b/corporate_lifestyle_is_disgusting/,7,16

2425,I'm No Call No Showing today because fuck 'em!,"This subreddit has proven to be a very helpful place for me lately. It's made my depression worse but also opened my eyes to the fact that I'm not the only one who thinks things are completely fucked with our job market! It's depressing af, but helps me understand my true worth a little better and not what companies want to say my worth is. So today, I'm acting in protest and will probably get fired but you know what, fuck em!

Anyway, today I decided I wasn't going in to my pharmacy tech job that I absolutely despise. Let me tell you why. The pharmacy I work in is extremely high volume for an area on the outskirts of Knoxville.  I have to deal with pain pill abusers going agro at me, impatient assholes at the drive through, being told I'm not fast enough even though I'm new and trying to learn what certain drugs are and their names because nobody trained me on that stuff, so customers think I'm dumb as shit. I have to put up with all of this at $12.50/hour at 22 hours a week. I can barely even sustain myself on that. Just last week they changed their uniform policy and I don't have enough dress clothes or black scrubs and I can't afford any more because food and bills take everything from me.  I'm also fast approaching my deadline to get my Pharmacy tech license and guess who has to pay for it? That's right, me!

I'm tired, depressed, my nerves are shot, and I'm broke. So you know what. Fuck em!! I'm going to look for a job that's actually going to pay me something I can survive on. If they don't care enough about me to give me hours to sustain myself, then I'm not going to care enough to show up for my rinky dink 7 hour shift with no break.",False,nz044p,DaddyDankMemes420,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nz044p/im_no_call_no_showing_today_because_fuck_em/,44,36

2468,"I realized today when looking at a house for sale, just how fucked everything is.","Almost everything in life comes with a price because capitalism is a system that tries to find a way to extract as much money as possible and balances the razors edge between letting people have enough money to barely rent a small apartment and genocide through starvation and lack of housing.  

There are many houses in my town that have sat empty for years because the banks as well as the police will not let you live there. Police is short for **POLIC**y **E**nforcer because they are only there to enforce the policies attributed to capitalism rather than the well being of citizens.

To the bourgeois, it is more ethically accepted and not considered immoral in anyway to let someone freeze to death rather than let them go into a home to stay warm, a home that has sat empty for quite some time.

Likewise people building tent cities find themselves at war with police who often come through on orders of the city and tear them down. We cannot give any illusion to the wealthy that there is an issue with the system or maybe more would start questioning it. Is it almost illegal to be homeless in the most ""free country on earth"".

Our healthcare is massively expensive because it serves as an extraction system, so does education. Everyone is fine with K-12 education being free but only does educating yourself to the point you might vote against their interest (which is hard to do anyway), so it comes with a massive price tag. It really never made sense to me that K-12 education is free yet higher education is not.

Every day these fuckers find a way to charge you for something or have a fee for no other reason than to fatten their wallet at their expensive. You can overdraw your bank account by $10 and get hit with a $35 fee, for no other reason than being poor. The bank charge you $35 for borrowing $10 from them yet they can lend more money than they even have to their name (fractional reserve banking), and making interest on this imaginary money. They can charge you 25% interest on a credit card and pay you .25% interest on the money in your account.

Now corporations are buying homes at 50% over market value sending first time buyers to the back of the line, because like always, cash is king.

After months of sleeping only a few hours a night(stressing about the next work day) , waking up with a knot in my stomach, being in a dark depressed hole, I don't know why it is so difficult for me to just quit.

My husband is telling me to hang in there because the money is obviously making his burden lighter. I have never felt this depressed and anxious at the same time. I know I can make money working from home. I've done it before for a few years.

I am scared of disappointing my husband and my boss / co-workers. If I continue at this job, I might just jump off a bridge! I just can't go on anymore. Telling my husband seems to be the hardest part. He is aware of my stress and works for the same company. His solution is for me to talk to my boss and let her know that the workload is too much.

2506,"Depressed, panic attacks because of work","I'm 21, uni student. I work at a food part of a well known UK store (operations assistant) which is heavy lifting and other stuff mainly behind the scenes.

Honestly. I can only really cope working 12-16 hrs a week. I have depression, panic attacks triggered by work mainly, anxiety which came from my abusive upbringing (parents)

I also had heart surgery when I was 15 and that means I'm on warfarin (blood thinners) for the rest of my life. Which adds to the anxiety if I fall or have an accident which is likely during work. For example I picked up a box of wine but the box was ripped at the bottom and nearly smashed a full bottle of wine on myself.

I'm just tired and disinterested in work in general. I've only been at this job two weeks. Thought it was 2 or 3 days a week. Which I can manage, but I'm in everyday next week and it just messes with me mentally. 

I feel incompetent and slow. Honestly. There is stuff that needs to be done quickly, but I like doing things at my own pace. I believe my mental state just messes with my cognitive ability. I can't concentrate and I always forget where I was at while I was doing stuff

Also the fact that I have no appetite and barely eat as much anymore doesn't help in this line of work. I just feel like sleeping when I get home, even after a 4hr shift.

I'm still on a temporary 1 month contract so im half hoping they get rid of me. I really don't care at this point

I don't even spend much either, I have a good bit of savings over the years and from college grants and loans. I'm a minimalist and I'm tired of working for peanuts for something I don't enjoy. Retail isn't for me.

I just love my free time. Going for walks in the sun. Travelling to places. Just chilling to music. The gym occasionally. I honestly don't know how the general public work 40 hours a week and be genuinely happy. Getting paid nothing just to bump of a millionaires profits...

The only work I genuinely enjoyed doing was working as an IT Technician for 16 hours  a week for FREE during my work experience program when I was 17, genuinely loved it. Was so laid back and I got a lot done. Fixing computers and just displaying some items.

Then they treathend to have me fired because they are required classes. At which I told them that they should act how they see accordingly.

Currently 23 states are scheduled to start ending unemployment benefits as soon as today. I'm claiming in a state that is not part of the 23 and I'm in a mental and practical position where going back to my former career or salary is not really possible. Honestly I don't have a unique strategy except for saving aggressively and possibly leaving the country. 

For those who are seeing the benefits end early, what are you doing?

They asked for every job I've had since I started working and there's no way I could remember all of them - I've had maybe 30+ jobs in 6 years.

&amp;#x200B;

What else can I do to avoid working? I have faced so much discrimination and bullying in life, I refuse to work in such toxic and hostile environments. I also refuse to break my back working for a crap wage. I'd only start working again when I can get a nice and air conditioned office or remote job that pays more than 50k.

&amp;#x200B;

Think about it. If I were to get some crap 30k a year job, I would lose all my benefits and end up having a worse quality of life than I would being unemployed. If I get a medical emergency, I'll be in debt for life, versus having everything covered by medicaid.

Recently our company has been rolling out new hardware to many of our locations that has never ending issues arising, leaving it on the helpdesk to clean up the mess with call volume we don't have the staff to support (this is nothing new, there are also constant updates that are done to our POS system that are never properly tested before roll out or properly communicated to us before hand, on which again the helpdesk takes all the front end heat for it while managing sends out emails asking why you aren't follow up on tickets fast enough). I have saved up quite a bit over the 2 years and will be pursing some certifications in the field while taking some much needed time off to focus on my physical and mental health before I lose my mind.

The premise of minimum wage, when it was
introduced, was that a single wage earner
should be able to own a home and support
a family. That was what it was based on;

a full time job, any job, should be able to
accomplish this.

The fact people off at this idea if presented
nowadays, as though the people that ring up
your groceries or hand you your burghers don't
deserve the luxury of a home and a family, is
disgusting.

I do 80% of the work since management is shit and my coworkers suck- 4 out of 6 in the office area for our department literally don’t do a dang thing- make mistakes which should get you fired (they’ve done everything wrong the past year) and since I DONT make any I’m expected to do all their work while they get paid to mess up

I’m tired. I WFH. My mental health practically died and I may be depressed 

Can’t quit cuz I’ll be broke but I’m here to ask... if it fine if I take an extra break or two here and there as long as ALL my work is done? I work 9-5:30 and it only takes me a total of 3 hours to do a day or couple days of work. 

Being in the office makes me more exhausted since I just sit there stretching work that can be done in 3 minutes for a few hours. I go above and beyond for this company (esoteric lab for infectious diseases) and ruin my mental health- the entire departments GUARANTEED yearly raise was denied due to one coworkers 0% productivity since we started WFH

2603,"We can stop this, together.","I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n61l4s/yo_im_just_sayin/) a month ago about how the antiwork community is rapidly growing and we could actually make a change with the amount of people in this community. Well, that generated more attention than I had anticipated.

I had all sorts of people such as professional writers, software engineers, web developers, and so on contacting me wanting to help. I had people saying [they were waiting for my next instructions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n61l4s/yo_im_just_sayin/gx5ljbc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I was not prepared for this.

I do not want to be a cult leader. I do not want to start a movement that promotes riots and I do not want be the face of abolishing capitalism. However, I have been thinking about this project as much as I could to come up with a real solution.

This is what I have come up with...

People are 'forced' to work jobs that they hate because if they did not they would be homeless and starve. So, we need a way to ensure that people have food and a place to live, even if they are not working.

The solution is SEEDS. Seeds grow the food that we eat, seeds grow the food that the animals eat that we then eat, and seeds grow the timber for housing. People need to collect, share, and grow seeds of all the variety of plants. It is honestly the only solution I can think of to get people out of the system and becoming less dependent on capitalism. I have created r/SEEDSociety for people to share information on how to transition to this lifestyle.

# S.E.E.D.S. Seeing Everyone Eat Disrupts Society

I could go on a huge rant about how this would literally solve all of the worlds problems, but I have more to say and I will save that for anyone interested.

I realize that this is not an instant solution. I realize that not everyone has the means to grow their own food. I realize that not everyone wants to spend their life gardening.

# Earth Loves All

I have come up with a movement called **Earth Loves All.** Basically, the movement is about spreading awareness and doesn't attempt to motivate people to do anything.

The idea is that the Earth provides us with all of the resources that we need and we should not be forced to work for them because resourciopaths (sociopaths that hoard resources), a word I made up, created a society that strips us of everything and make us compete for basic necessities.

The ""Earth Loves All"" phrase was thought up to be an incomplete sentence on purpose. It could become ""Earth Loves All Africans"" or any other group. Humans create groups through instinct and I wanted to create a group that encompasses all people. The one thing everyone has in common is that we live on the Earth.

So now that I explained the name, let me explain what Earth Loves All supports believe in.

* The Earth is our home and we should not destroy it. In fact, we should actively rebuild the Earth.
* All humans have a right to food, housing, healthcare, and education.

That's it. It seems simple, but for some reason humans have been developing advanced civilizations for thousands of years and yet most people are forced to work their entire lives.

I have created r/EarthLovesAll which actually got up to 100 members very quickly. It is not active, but please go there and start posting memes, ideas, and rants. I also have a website [EarthLovesAll.com](https://www.EarthLovesAll.com) that I have not put anything on. If you are interested, go ahead and write up an article and send it to me at [MoneyLovesMisery@gmail.com](mailto:MoneyLovesMisery@gmail.com). I will post it onto the website if I think it supports the movement.

# About me

I don't know if you care, but if you read this far maybe you do. I am just a guy who has been passionate about trying to solve mental health issues for the past 10 years. I have a degree in psychology with a minor in sociology. I am an advocate for psychedelics because psilocybin mushrooms cured my depression. I have been poor my whole life and I have even lived in my car for 6 months before. I make all of my money through the internet by teaching English and doing other random things like testing apps and websites. I want to find a way to spend my time making a difference in peoples lives and influencing humanity in a way that stop destroying the Earth and actively relieves people of all possible misfortunes.

I'm thinking that the best way for me to have an influence is by using social media. I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNk9JkOxt6xVHKGgfrVVFYw/featured) that you can check out and see my face if you want. I haven't used social media since around 2014 but I've made profiles on twitter, instagram, facebook, pinterest, and tiktok that you can follow by searching ""PsiliPijiPhili."" I hate social media but I think it's the best way to reach people.

TLDR; r/SEEDSociety is a new community that will help people learn how to use seeds to become less dependent on capitalism. r/EarthLovesAll is an awareness movement that aims to stop destroying the Earth and ensure that all people have food, housing, healthcare, and education. r/antiwork has 330k members and we can come together to make a change.

2635,eMpLoYeE aPpReCiAtIoN WeEk!@11!!!,"Ok, so I work for an industry that was open during the pandemic. We had about a month and a half off during the beginning of the shutdown but after that I was one of the few people going to work on an empty train scared shitless of this new disease and working with angry customers within 6 feet of me almost daily. All while my bosses kept telling me how we should be thankful that we still have  a job and were being paid while we ""stayed home"" (nevermind the mandatory shut down that didn't permit us to be open). This major company also received countless grants from the government. They changed their hours and closed our branches earlier but to make up for it they started forcing people who worked in my position to take laptops home, learn completely different positions and wfh while also coming into branches and working their normal position to make up for the fulltime hours that they still were paying us. In other words we worked two jobs for the same pay due to no fault of our own and if we refused to wfh then they only paid u for the hours that the branch was open and we ""forfeited"" our fulltime pay. Nevermind the people who had kids at home or who needed to assist family that was home.

When branches returned back to normal hours they almost instantly began relaxing covid restrictions. Now customers dont even need to wear masks and we cannot refuse their service if they dont. TBH those restrictions weren't ever truly in place (but we still cannot use the fridge or microwave in the break room and they have gotten rid of the coffee and watercooler. IMO all of these things are just for the purpose of saving money and not covid related, lower light bill and dont have to buy coffee/water anymore!). Now we've arrived to eMpLoYeE aPpReCiAtIoN WeEk and they've given my branch a 15 dollar per person budget. We are located in an extremely expensive city where 15 dollars cant even get u a decent lunch. Options available are individual slices of pizza, twinkies OR chocolates cause u know *due to covid* we can't eat items that aren't individually packaged but we CAN have customers coughing in our face maskless and better not refuse their service. Honestly, I'm disgusted. We risked our lives to go to branches during the most hectic year of our lives to gain this company immense revenue (I'm African American so this yr also was during the BLM protests so my mental health also took a hit). We put our health and our families health at risk and all they can come up with in one of the most expensive cities in the world is 15 dollars?????

2637,Having to find a job again is making me an anxious mess.,"For the past half year, I’ve been unemployed and, thankfully, have gotten to live with my parents so I can save up money. My life has been turned upside down, and I’m essentially starting over after realizing that I don’t even know if what I went to college for is even the right career for me. I’m not the passionate little bright eyed bushy tailed lass I was in my early 20s. 

Even so, not having to work has done WONDERS for my mental health. I’m not burnt out. I’m not tired all damn day. I don’t have to commute… every day feels like the weekend and I’m so lucky to even be in this position because it’s likely the only “break” I’ll ever get from work in my adult life.

A deadly pandemic is the only way I was afforded a break from work in life. How messed up even is that?

Anyway, I’m extremely stressed out now because this break is coming to an end. I was planning on taking the summer off (you know, to enjoy it), but my state is making everyone on unemployment search for work because “people just don’t want to work anymore!”

I’m dreading the work grind so much more than even having to try and figure my life out at this point. I wish we could all just get enough to afford to live and choose to work if we wanted more “luxuries,” but our society is so obsessed with working and hustling that it feels like it’s never going to happen.",False,nxnfqy,quack-and-slash,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nxnfqy/having_to_find_a_job_again_is_making_me_an/,5,2

I recently started my own company but I’m still working for this place while I get started. My own company’s revenue is currently $2k a month. Considering I just started last month it’s not bad. At what point do you quit your job? I’m thinking about getting a part time job in my field and then quitting my job, so I still have steady money coming in but have much more time to devote to my own clients. 

On top of that, my company now expects me to work 1-2 hours over regular per day with no overtime pay.

2640,"One of the biggest joys of being self-employed is doing whatever, whenever.","Today I was out in the high heat for several hours going to yard sales and didn't feel good the rest of the day due to heat exposure. 

So I decided I'm not doing any work related things today. That's all it takes, a simple decision.

No calling work, no guilt-tripping ""we could really use you today"" bullshit, no static from a superior, no doctors note, etc.

Likewise if I need more sleep some nights than others, I can sleep in a few hours once a week or so and just start doing work when I get up. No schedule to adhere to, nothing.

If I wanted to take the next two weeks off I could. 

Now I'm not 100% anti-work, I mean if the support systems existed in the US to do fuck-all and survive, then yes I'd be all for it. I am, however, 100% against working for other people.

It's is such a giant relief of stress and mental health doing my own work. I'm sure I could make more money if I went back to school and got a degree, but I'm doing ok financially and to me health is more important than all the money in the world. I don't worship money or material possessions either. 

 As it is right now in the US we have some of the lowest rates of self-employment of any industrialized nation.

2649,Worked through the whole pandemic. Then I quit.,"I worked at my retail pharmacy job for 7 years. When the pandemic started my job was secure and actually was even busier than normal since we were essential workers. It was also one of the worst years of my life. Their covid protocol changed all the time and half the time it was like they threw a dart at a wall and whatever it landed on they did. Half of it didn't make any sense and it stressed all the workers out because WE had to follow all the covid rules but we couldn't enforce our customers to do so. 

Then after about 2 months it was like covid didn't exist anymore and it was back to metrics. ""Make sure you ask for shots. Your customer scores are low. Upsell our monthly program. Got yelled at by a customer? Tough. Also, we cut hours for all the stores in the district but we added on extra work for everybody. We're also gonna make it super hard to have a day off."" etc etc. 

It was a problem every day. I literally couldn't take it anymore. So I put my two weeks in and my last day was Sunday. 

It's been glorious! I slept late every day since. My feet quit hurting. I can do stuff around the house without working it around my every changing work schedule. No more worrying about stupid corporate bullshit and getting yelled at for poverty wages. 

I know I can't not work forever, but I have enough money socked away that I can take a few months off and not feel like I'm going to die. 

The worst part is that I was willing to work with them because they begged me to stay. They needed workers because of hour cuts and other people quitting, but they also weren't offering me anything to stay. No raise or perks or anything, so I bailed.

2658,Rejecting productivity in your free time.,"Ok, so most of us here are, to one degree or another, anti-work. We recognise the absurdities inherent in the systems of work we currently toil under, and we long for more time away from work. Perhaps we even wish for work to be abolished completely somehow!

However; something I struggle with personally, and I suspect many of you do too, is that itchy protestant work ethic in the back of our heads. Or whatever religious or secular system you want to blame for it. You know, that feeling that you need to ""optimise"", make the most of your time, and most of all, make that time PRODUCTIVE. Your days are considered more or less valuable by this metric of productivity! What did you get done? What did you learn? How did you develop yourself or improve your knowledge? Self-improvement and permanent development! What skills are you learning? None? What kind of bum are you?! 

I was filling the extra time I've had over this last year in ways I found met this criteria of productivity. Learning to code, trying to write stuff; various ways to scratch the itch and justify my existence. I regularly see people flex about how they do all these different things outside their jobs and they want to not work so that they can do those things more. I'm not even talking about lucrative side-hustles. It might just be productive hobbies or Skill-Development. 

And that's fine! That's fine, but it's not for everyone! What's wrong with just vibing? Maybe you don't want to create. Maybe you just wanna chill. Maybe you want to do that MOST of the time, and you're not a super-driven, optimised person.

Any suggestions please?,"Work has been quite stressful during pandemic and while it took me a long time to have this realisation, I don't want to care about work anymore. I've been working for about 10 years now and unfortunately for me, never felt this way before. Always gunning for that next promotion, competing for that new role. While money was a big motivation, I'd be lieing if I said that was the only one. 

For the last few weeks however, I've been feeling some sort of discomfort towards work so I started trying out small ways of skipping work. Delegated few tasks to others, declined few meetings, stopped myself from responding to every email at the earliest. While I don't want to care about work anymore, I'm finding it tough to convert this into actions apart from these small acts. And even trying these out has been making me nervous and I get too stressed out at times. But I want to keep trying.

What are some other ways I can professionally, stop more work coming my way and possibly reduce my work load?",False,nyc20a,ti_nydog,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nyc20a/trying_new_ways_to_reduce_my_efforts_at_work_any/,14,1
2678,My manager wants me to work off the clock,"I'm already working on my resume. I'm done with this bullshit. Long rant below and I apologize, but you guys get it. 

This job has been fine up until now. $17/hr with fairly reasonable expectations, especially for retail. Except earlier this week I had to take a deposit to the bank. The bank is an hour away, round trip, not accounting for the time spent there and the tourist traffic. 

Instead of having employees go to the bank on the clock, which would be fine, my company has you go off the clock and then lets you add an extra 15 minutes to your time when you punch out the next time. 15 minutes of pay for a trip that took an hour and a half. Strike one. 

Now there's a virtual meeting tomorrow morning. I said I would come in early for it. My manager says 'why now download the program and just watch it at home.' Usually I'm a little more tactful, but this is right after the whole bank deposit thing. I straight up told him I don't do work things at home off the clock. Want me to work at home? Make me salaried or give me a way to clock in from my house. Strike two. 

Companies will cry about how badly they're affected by time theft. But wage theft is a much, much bigger problem and I refuse to voluntarily contribute to it. Meetings for work still count as work, and I deserve to be compensated for my time. I don't check teams or emails or meetings from my personal devices or from home. I'm not waiting for strike three, I'm gonna start looking for something that actually will respect my time, even if I have to fudge my resume.",False,nxnsmv,plushiequeenaspen,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nxnsmv/my_manager_wants_me_to_work_off_the_clock/,13,1

Nowadays I work near a single 5 hr shift once a week (it fluctuates constantly, but right now it's this). I really do want to enjoy my time off, for 6 days. But every day I get closer that feeling is always coming over me, and I hate it so fucking much. I've kinda got some anxiety about work (related to how much of my life I'm going to spend in a shit hole, I don't want to get into it). I've come to the realization that any job I take, anything I do. I'm doomed and I will always have this feeling of dread as long as I need money. 

Really the only time I don't feel dread is when I come back from work and think about the week-long vacation I'm going to take. But every day it inches forward.

On the days I work, I try to stay up as long as I can not out of not being tired, but just because I hate it so much I don't want the day to end because if I don't go to sleep it still feels like the day never ended and I still have time, but you know never works out that way...lol. 

It's already pretty much a blessing that I can have 6 days off, when most people only have 1 (Sunday doesn't fucking count), and I know. I know how entitled it sounds, but I also know if I ever end up like that, for the rest of my life. Spending 5 days working, and 2 days of dread. I'll probably kms. 

If you read this, thanks it meant a lot. My family says that I should keep my job and continue working and that it's a blessing cause there's homelessness and unemployment, idk I just hope someone understands at least.

2691,I have a bad feeling things are gonna get a whole lot worse.,"True story: I remember reading a video game magazine in the mid 2000's that had this advert.

&amp;#x200B;

[2020. Corporations control everything. Some honest foreshadowing..](https://preview.redd.it/jhs11ci2cr471.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23d3d9b435f94cec6a441ff5296a5447303aad79)

The pandemic was just a nice little sample of how little of a shit corporations care about us. If it wasn't for a freeze on rent, mortgages and stimulus checks, things would of gotten bad, fast.

But look around you, corporations are buying up homes in swaths. Corporations are merging all the time and stifling healthy competition in regard to worker's rights. Pizza hut might look like it's own company, but it's owned by Yum Brands which also owns KFC and Taco Bell. There are some major corporations that own a bunch of shit yet make it look like each company is this small entity on it's own. I believe they do this on purpose in order to give an illusion of choice. Now Staples wants to merge with Officemax/Office Depot, which was already a merger of two companies in 2013. 

This change is happening fast. Initially I thought it might of been something my future kids would face but honestly it's going to get a whole lot uglier in less than 20 years.

 Imagine a merger between Walmart and Amazon. Amazon would then have physical locations (they already do, but not many). So if you get fired from Wallzon, you can't work at their stores or distribution centers. Imagine if every large scale company was owned by 5 conglomerates.

I try to be optimistic but the data makes it quite hard. Like so many people being unable to come up with $400 without using a credit card or taking out a loan. The amount of people still living with their parents or unable to buy a home. The cost of college.

It gets worse year, after year, after year, after year and literally nothing is being done about it. How long before this house of cards comes crashing down?",False,nxy1jh,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nxy1jh/i_have_a_bad_feeling_things_are_gonna_get_a_whole/,18,1

I bring you another rant/tale of how America's cult of work has ruined me mentally and will probably cause me to end myself one day. (Not upcoming anytime soon, I'm just slipping into absolute madness)

So, I currently work as a pharmacy technician. I live in East TN so the cost of living is low and at $12.50/hr, I could most definitely have a worse wage. But the problem is, I don't hardly have any hours. The company I work for is a large grocery chain and they're stingy af with hours already with more hours being cut in the coming weeks. I live paycheck to paycheck with barely anything left to save. I don't hardly get to treat myself with anything and I've pretty much given up on having anything nice for myself like the gaming pc of my dreams or a car that's not a jalopy. Why? America's cult of work has decided I'm not worth it. I will always be stuck with shit jobs, with shit wages at shit hours. That's my worth. The more I think about it, the more I think maybe the system is right. I have no real skills, nothing I'm good at, and I'm not smart enough to start a bussiness and I don't know how to make things. I make videos and streams but they looks and sound like a 12 year old put them together. 

Just today I went to a job interview at a warehouse and was turned down. A fucking warehouse bro. That just shows that I'm absolutely useless.

2717,[RANT] Losing everything and work taking even more.,"Yes, I will be a whiner. I'd worked for the same company for 18.5 years. It's literally the only job I had besides summer amusement parks and McDonald's as a teen. The money could be good but it was super strict and threatening atmosphere (I now work for a ""gas station"" and realize managers don't actually scream at people all the time). You could literally lose $10/hr for 3 months if you made a mistake in one file/document... And it could literally be something as simple as one missed comma. There was also no guarantee you'd be able to regain that hourly wage.(at my highest I made $37 per hr. When I was fired it was $20). 6 years ago my mom died. She was my best friend. The only family I had besides my son. It destroyed me. Anger depression, etc. I realized that money didn't help her and while I spent all of my spare time with her I always wish I had more. So after having another child (and later a 3rd) I went part time. Much better for my whole life. But my quality at work had been an issue for almost 2 years. I was training and given 6 more months to fix the issues. A week later they fired me. Now, 8 months later.... All my work for them, overtime, creative new programs, leading training earlier in my career, etc. means so little they're fighting my UC. Saying I was a horrible person who refused training.

I’m thinking of quitting my day job to pursue my goals of being an illustrator.

I work at an awful call center job that has been hemorrhaging employees for the past quarter. about a third of the team left, and these days we usually have half as many people working as we used to when fully staffed. They are not replacing the ones who left. It’s full time and often soul sucking, but I work from home and have health insurance. I’ve been there a little more than a year and a half and don’t see much prospects for a future at this point. Im overworked and don’t feel respected or valued and I’m treated like statistics while the company tows the “we respect work life balance” line. Anyway, enough venting.
I was trying to break into storyboarding and illustration/comics when covid hit! I’ve done some work in the arts before, a few gallery shows, some self publishing of novels and comics. I sold a script once and have done a bunch of production gigs, mostly in events and film/tv/commercials, and have a BFA. I spent covid writing/illustrating a graphic novel, and in February I took a commission from a friends band to make some assets for an animated music video. It was a great opportunity and I had a lot of fun, I just wrapped up the project a couple weeks ago and the director of the video (also a friend) asked if I wanted to do some freelancing for his workplace as an illustrator on their shortlist. I also got a similar offer from a college friend who just launched a design studio. On top of this another guy is asking me to do a small commission that may turn to more work making art for a game he’s working on, it doesn’t pay great but sounds fun! 
I’m looking at least 170 hours of paid “work” from these, with no guarantee of how much could follow. 
I’m in conversation with my benefits/hr team about negotiating some time off for the initial gig,  but I often wonder why I’m fighting to keep this job when I could use use 40 hours a week to promote my work and find clients. When I did freelancing in LA for about 18 months before covid, working on sets mostly but inching toward becoming a Storyboarder, It was grueling and often scary wondering where my next paycheck was coming from.
I only have a little saved up at the moment, but rent is much more manageable in central Illinois where I live now, though less opportunities exist out my front door there is a small artist community in this college town here and of course i have the internet and social media to find work on as well.
Any advice on how to know when to take the leap? And maybe what to do after?",False,nxpktq,iamnotafraid2,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nxpktq/i_want_to_quit_my_day_job_and_be_an_illustrator/,4,1
2745,"""Time off"", what's that?","So, with my job, I very often get called in on my days off. I'll be scheduled to work 4 days, but inevitably someone calls or texts last minute to have me go in somewhere (either at the main building or home visits).

Over the past month, I've had 2, maybe 3 days where nothing was expected of me. I had nowhere to go and nothing to do. Last night I got home early (1 am) and decided I was going to have a couple hours to myself instead of going straight to bed. I got in my pajamas, sat on the couch... and didn't know what to do. I couldn't remember what shows I was watching, or what hobbies I was working on. I just sat there trying not to think about chores or my upcoming work schedule. And it was tough. I got some snacks and watched a couple YouTube videos, but ended up deciding I might as well go to bed so I'm not as tired tomorrow as usual.

This is the 2nd year I skipped vacation. Last year was because of covid, but this year I just had way too much work to do.

2746,A labour time economy?,"So, after [a short comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ny2fuc/what_exactly_do_you_want/h1i03ix/?context=3), I thought this might deserve its own thread. In short, I [found a remarkable book](https://www.marxists.org/nederlands/documenten/1950/1950gic.htm) from the 1930's Dutch council-communist left, that left me so enthused, I immediately started editing it for modern language use, so this could be republished for a wider audience (a project that is pretty far along right now, should speak Dutch and be interested). An earlier version in English can also be [found online](https://www.marxists.org/subject/left-wing/gik/1930/), although you can find the [second edition in print](https://www.amazon.com/FUNDAMENTAL-PRINCIPLES-COMMUNIST-PRODUCTION-DISTRIBUTION/dp/B0851LZZ17/ref=sr_1_1?crid=28YZJT7AXYQMD&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=fundamental+principles+of+communist+production+and+distribution&amp;qid=1623509579&amp;sprefix=fundamental+principles+%2Caps%2C260&amp;sr=8-1).

Why this hype? I've been active on the far left as a communist for over 15 years now and barely do I get to read or hear about how communism would actually work, like economically. Most commonly you get a variation of the argument ""we don't have blueprints"", which is a cop out. Then there are many strands of communists that aim for a replication of the Soviet Union but ""better this time"". The most developed argument along these lines is perhaps [Paul Cockshott's take on it](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/), which has never really convinced me.

This book however, the *Fundamental Principles of Communist Production and Distribution*, starts from the comments Marx and Engels made in their *Critique of the Gotha Programme*, *Anti-Dühring* and *Capital* and develop it from there. It is still just a basic outline, its fundamental principles, but still already gives a comprehensive look at how a communist economy would 'tick'.

The basic premise is extremely simple: you abolish wage labour and, thereby, money. This gets replaced with a social accounting based on (socially average) labour time. From an individual's perspective this is extremely transparant: you work, say, four hours and you get four hours 'credited' which you can spend on whatever the hell you want. There's no more exploitation as surplus value (that is, profits) no longer exist as wage labour no longer exists.

From the perspective of society, labour time accounting also becomes very transparent in planning for the (re)production of the economy, for human consumption and even for free-at-the-point-of-use general services like public transport, education or healthcare.

Besides this positive claim, the book also critiques the 'soviet model' of a centralised and bureaucratised economy and, crucially, *why this model can never work*. While the book has its weaker points (mainly in how to *realise* this), I think it's a good thing that it would get rediscovered by a wider audience. I hope this thread contributes to that :)",False,ny8xfm,Q-collective,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ny8xfm/a_labour_time_economy/,22,1

2751,What I would have liked...,"What I would have liked is hmmmmmm......................with my masters, to have a job that pays 80k per year, a stable job, with health insurance and a pension, and to have my husband have the same. 40 hours per week, and no bullshit abuse or stupid 'company meetings' where we all go around the circle and stand up and say in 30 seconds what we're working on that day to our colleagues. Just a mature environment where we do work that is useful for society, and not for a company that is a net detriment to everyone.

Then, with 80k per year each, my husband and I could save up for a modest house, a retirement. We could live frugally and also work in a way that makes us feel like we contribute to society, have security, and a sense of significance in terms of our work actually being useful. 

If you think about it it's not too much to ask. Not even six figures for two people with a masters and a phd. And let's say if people aren't college educated, why not also a salary, a pension, health insurance, \*regular work hours\*, respect, and maybe 60k or 40k per year (or even 80k) depending on how demanding the job is and where it's located.

2755,Why I Quit My Job and Became Anti-Work,"I just recently discovered anti-work and I’m glad to surround myself with people that feel the same way I do about living to work. I have a life story to tell about how I’ve grown increasingly anti-work…

In 2017, I was laid off because the company I worked for eliminated my position due to downsizing. Fortunately, I just accepted a Creative Services Director position for a local tv station within the same week of my termination. I negotiated a pay rate that doubled my previous pay so I was very happy and thankful. I thought life was sweet because I had a higher paying job and my family could settle down in a new place and lay some roots. The downside, we would be moving out of state with no family or friends nearby. It was just my wife and two kids, ages three and one. We were fortunate enough for my wife to stay home with the kids while I worked. The job was stressful, fast paced and I was constantly working under pressure to meet deadlines. I was struggling internally. I felt alone because I worked all day and was missing out on spending time with my family. I was missing watching my kids grow. My wife helped me feel better by sending videos and pictures of her and the kids. It was a sad reality knowing my family was literally down the street, but I felt so far away because I’m stuck in an office for at least 9 hours a day. Sometimes, I would cry in the bathroom because I missed my family and I felt like I was missing out on so much. The pictures brought me joy and happiness, but I felt saddened too knowing my family is without me. I had to push my feelings aside because we lived off a single family income so I grudged along. This went on for three years until I finally quit ( more of that later). 

My wife and I added a new addition to our family, late 2018. She had a difficult pregnancy and raised the family alone a majority of the time because I was working to save PTO for my son’s birth. My absence was very hard on our relationship. We had no help from family or friends and I was juggling a work/life balance. I regretted leaving her alone while she battled severe morning sickness but I didn’t know what else to do because we lived on a single family income. Some days I would sneak out of work to come home, but I couldn’t keep this up because I eventually got caught. My GM told me I needed to figure out my work/life balance better, giving me a stern warning that disciplinary action would be taken if didn’t “figure it out”. These words came from a man that put his work before family, living hours away in another state separate from them. There’s no way he would have compassion for my situation. It’s always about the bottom line and what’s best for the company. Paid parental leave is nonexistent in America so I ended up using the remaining PTO I had to care for my wife and kids after my son was born. My wife almost died in the hospital from birth complications because she became septic. Thankfully she recovered and we were discharged after 5 days in the hospital. She needed help even more now but I had to return to work because I used up all of my PTO. I wish I could have stayed home to help and care for my wife and kids. I think it’s disgusting that paid parental leave is not required by law. It’s sad to think that puppies can not be separated from their mother no sooner than six weeks, yet in America it’s ok for women to go back to work two weeks after giving birth. She had to do it alone again, this time with a newborn with colic. My wife and I began fighting more frequently now because we were tired, stressed out parents. Eventually things got better for us as we developed a new routine and she recovered postpartum.

It’s now 2020 and started the year off with a new GM, another boss that puts work before family. There’s an annual company trip to Vegas and I wouldn’t be able to make it because my son has a rare medical condition that requires special treatment at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. It’s a trek, a 7 hour drive one-way. It’s important to keep the scheduled visit because the hospital’s schedule is always full and rescheduling can be a nightmare. I told my GM I would not be able to make the company trip because his medical appointment conflicts with the scheduled company trip. She told me that my attendance is mandatory and if I declined to go, her boss will get involved. I viewed this as a threat so I walked away wondering how I will make this work. Thankfully the trip was canceled because of COVID-19.

 I always rallied for promoting good and safe health precautions when Covid-19 began and that’s also when the issues became worse. My GM told me that it was a democratic agenda and there would be no action taken for health and safety precautions.My wife became sick with COVID-19 symptoms on March 31st and her doctor ordered us to isolate at home for 14 days. My GM would not allow me to quarantine so I used PTO for the first part of the isolation. At that point someone close to me made an anonymous call to the GMs boss, which resulted in my GM calling me a few hours later to tell me to stay home per CDC guidelines. Every morning, afternoon and end of my work day the GM would call wanting updates on my wife as well as my children. She then asked for medical records for my family and when I said no, I was contacted by HR, GM and the corporate HR. They told me that if I don’t provide my families medical records, they would contact their doctors and the health department to obtain them.Because I said no, considering I don’t have access to my wife’s personal medical information, my GM said that I had to break quarantine and come back. I show up at work ready to social distance and ended up leaving again because my baby became sick. Living in East Tennessee, the healthcare is very poor. We always had problems with inadequate care and negligence. We packed the family in the sedan and drove four hours away to Kentucky. I’ll never forget that moment driving 100 MPH down the interstate with my hazards on as I looked over at my wife in the passenger seat, holding my son for dear life as he had trouble breathing and his fever spiking to 104. We rushed him to the ER and the medical staff saved him. They tested him for Covid-19, but the results came back inconclusive because they could not get a good sample up his nose. The ER doctor diagnosed him with COVID-19 and discharged us, ordering us to quarantine. I was forced to use PTO again and still could not work from home while under quarantine. I ran out of sick time and had to go back to work because my GM did not approve working from home. 

I was in my office when another employee came to me and asked for help (outside of my department and nothing that I am required to do within my job) and I said I couldn’t as my baby is being treated for Covid19 and I am supposed to isolate. The employee asked the GM why I wasn’t allowed to quarantine and the GM brought myself and HR in and yelled at me saying I will not self isolate and that I am getting my office taken away and will work around my staff. I am the only department head without an office now and felt like I was retaliated against. The GM said she will determine when and if I need to self isolate and she said, verbatim, that I was crying wolf over my baby. She said she does not think anyone is sick and that I need to stop isolating unless she tells me to go get tested. Immediately following that, I submitted FMLA papers and a couple hours after doing so, I was written up for not working while using my sick time. My FMLA request was ignored and it had been a week or more before HR finally approved it.  My GM’s intentions were to drive me away because I was a strong advocate for workplace safety and following CDC guidelines. She wrote me up two more times, gave me a bad review and was constantly nagging me about work. I had enough and on July 2020, I quit my job and walked out. It was a liberating feeling! 

We moved back to Kentucky and are now surrounded by friends and family. I’m  working a different job and don’t make near as much money, but that doesn’t matter because family is more important than wasting away for a job that doesn’t care for the well being of it’s employees. I find work culture and “hustling” to be very toxic, especially in America. I take no pride in working my ass off at the expense of losing out on enjoying life and missing family/friends time. If I could change things, I wish I didn’t take the job In Tennessee but I didn’t know what else to do since I was laid off with no safety net. My wife was so strong through it all and continues to be the best wife and best mother for our family. I couldn’t ask for more because she continues to amaze me everyday. I am blessed to have her in my life. 

I wish there were better workplace laws in America like paid parental leave, higher minimum wage, and healthy severance for termination. Also, it would be nice if employers would provide more PTO for its employees. It’s a disgusting rat race and I’ve become jaded about society rewarding people for living to work.

I don’t think that we are born entitled to live a leisurely life without working towards somehow by contributing to society. But I also don’t think the system is fair and that the 1% shouldn’t control the resources and rig the game. 

Anyways, though I mostly agree with the general sentiment here, it seems seems like until there more of an effort to do something about it, that a lot of the venting is just that.

2781,My rant about working life,"Hi everyone, fresh member on this sub but i've been against working (especially working till 67yo as it is the case where i live).

&amp;#x200B;

As of today, i'm 25 and on peak financially and physically. I'm working as a sales executive in the N1 company (in our field) in my country.

Thing is, i'm bored af, i started here 1.5 years ago as a warehouse employee replacing a sick worker that was not meant to come back ever.(He miraculously survived his ultra heavy alcool and cocaine problem and came back like he never left). So there's 1 dude too much in the company (me) and i get offered a chance to become an developer and they give me access to web lessons to learn SQL.(they also tell me it better works out or i'm out)

The thing is, i hate studying, i hate ""working"" at home, unless i have a super interesting thing to do and i'm 200% in or it is a physical job and it occupies my mind. But telling me to come everyday, do the physical work and when i get home after a 8hr day + 1h commute to learn something people go to university during 3 years killed my morale. Also, they gave me 1 year to be work ready and it was that or i was out. Morale -&gt; 0

Time goes on, i try hard to study (fucking up my personnal time and relationships) and the colleague who's the senior dev and who's supposed to be training me is never at the office so no one to show me the work.

4 months in, they call me for a meeting, saying i did 0 efforts to make it work and that i'm like 0.1mm from being fired. I had to take some naps during my lunch time wich all my colleagues in the warehouse were ok with, and i almost got fired because i was sleeping during my un-paid lunchtime.(Some people are taking naps for more than their lunchtime and no one bats an eye)

They also tell me that they can't fire the alcoolic (or ex-alcoolic we don't really know tbh)  because that would be un-ethic. And they gave credit to someonelse for 2 weeks where i managed the warehouse alone ( we were 3 ) when covid started.

BUT!! AS GOOD LORDS AS THEY ARE - they found a solution , make me a sales executive so they can look like super cool people ""saving"" me from unemployement. It was all cool when starting because i learned new stuff etc. Now it's just boredom, i'm a secretary disguised as a sales exec, sending emails like a robot. Thank god reddit is there and now i found my place in this sub.

I'm not 100% against working, but i'm 100% to let people choose how they spend their short time on this planet, i'm all in on investments and cryptos to hopefully retire at 35-40 wich is my life goal at the moment.

I'm lucky to have a passion in videogames and IT stuff in general to withstand working in that field, but my income is reinvested, in the hope of making enough cash to not fucking care anymore.

Here's the thing.

You do not know the nation has collapsed til it's waaaay over. I'm talking like.. everyone's just acting normal. Like nothing is wrong. Pushing through it with ""optimism"". Blind ignorant optimism.

""Hope, while ignoring reality is delusion.""

Stage one: infrastructure stops being funded.
Stage two: people are made famous for no reason as a distraction.
Stage three: The government is broken up and cannibalized by smaller powers aka corporations or dynasties.

That's all already happened.

Stage one: must've started well over 50 years ago.
The first place his head by this are usually major cities.

Stage two: we all know this is true and can probably name at least 20 different people who are made famous for zero reason.

Stage three: we see this everyday with all the government contracts and corporations trying to ruin every government sector and make it private. we are at a point that even our military is held hostage by private companies.

The economy isn't going to get better. The rich aren't going to fix things. Just like in Venezuela they will get up and leave. And those with enough power and wealth who simply can't leave as easily will run a massive dynasty here.

And when America falls the entire world will feel it. This is why you see so many countries pulling away from America and trying to rely on their own resources.

2788,I have a friend who is being hopelessly exploited and its heartbreaking to watch.,"So as I've posted on here before, I used to work for a horrific company that absolutely took advantage of and abused its employees. The owner and all upper employees were unbelievably narcissistic, completely lacking in empathy, and viewed all of their employees as pawns and lesser beings. I left, and was able to find something much closer to my ideal work environment.

A good friend of mine still works there, and has taken over most of my responsibilities and title, though her salary is substantially less than mine was. They are currently in the midst of their busy season, and the abuse and exploitation of their employees is just staggering.

This woman is working 60+ hour weeks with a salary well below the minimum federal salary overtime threshhold and the company lies and says they have a small business exemption to avoid paying overtime. The business regularly picks up last minute events and does a terrible job scheduling their employees so as a manager she's frequently made to hunt for people to send to events at the last second, with the implication that it's her responsibility if no one is available. 

She has been fending off a foot injury for awhile, and yesterday was told to come in and she could spend her whole shift at her computer, even though this time of year often involves lots of manual labor from every employee. She went in and was promptly sent to work in the basement on her feet.

She has a doctor's appointment this afternoon and her whole leg is swollen. She called them to let them know she wasn't coming in because she can barely walk and they basically told her she had to come in anyway and guilt-tripped her about all the things in her wheelhouse that needed to get done - things that there is no good reason another employee couldn't do.

Through all of this, I've encouraged her to stand up for herself. Especially today I reminded her that if she has decided she is too injured to work they have no right or even real ability to override that decision beyond what she gives them. 

I felt so good about finally quitting and leaving that place behind, and they were furious with me when I left, so I have an idea of the kind of pressure she is dealing with. She is aware of the fact that she is most likely NOT overtime exempt. But through ALL of this, the fact is that she lives meagerly paycheck to paycheck and even though she's miserable and is completely aware of how much she's being exploited and abused she can't really afford to rock the boat or quit. She's working so much and is so exhausted when he has time off that it's difficult to organize a job hunt (I know that's a poor excuse sometimes, but I suspect we can all sympathize with that feeling). I try to refrain from nagging her about finding a new job because I know what that can feel like.

All of this to say fuck that system, and fuck those business owners who treat their employees like objects and are unable to see beyond the next dollar they might make peddling their overpriced crap no one needs.",False,nxizbb,MyOfficeAlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nxizbb/i_have_a_friend_who_is_being_hopelessly_exploited/,9,2

2799,Just quit. This is the email I sent my boss.," 

Hey \[Manager\], 

We have been scrambling around all week just so some executives are able to have a bar crawl. God forbid one of them sees a beer out of place. Its bullshit and I am done. I get one little weekend to see my family for only like 48 hours and I get back immediately thrown into the mix on one of the busiest weeks of the year in the busiest neighborhood of the year. I don’t like that I got all of this responsibility thrown on me in one week.  

Before anyone says I should have had plenty of time to prepare I had gone on vacation a week prior to this for my birthday, which was then first vacation time I had really taken in the whole year and a half I worked there. (I don’t count taking one day off on a Friday just so I can have the privilege to drive home to my family for the weekend). 

Two employees went on vacation to PROPOSE to their girlfriends and both of them have had to send orders to me because the accounts don’t fucking respect people’s personal time.

I have accounts yelling at me about not receiving beer because drivers are so overworked they can’t finish their deliveries, I have 5 different management just telling me to remember to do 20 different things plus everything individual accounts ask for. I have seen this company cause so many people so much stress I just no longer want to be apart of this rat race.  

They have everyone fighting over incentive money while we plan a party for the executives. Fuck that shit.

Literally none of this shit will matter in a week. A new corporate beer or event will come out, AB will promote the shit out of it, everyone gets stressed about selling this one thing in order to get their incentive money, then the next week its on to something else. I am just tired of it man and I am not even a sales rep, I honestly don’t know how you guys are able to do all the stuff you do.  

I am sorry but for my mental health I literally just can’t force myself to do this job anymore.  

\[Manager\], you have actually been the best manager I’ve ever had and I just hope once all this blows over we can still grab a beer or something. I am not taking this out on you. Just from watching from the sidelines of this company I just don’t think I want to work for a company that causes its drivers and sales reps this much stress. 

I am going to go on a camping trip and I won’t be back until Monday. I won’t be answering my phone or any emails. We can sort out whatever happens to me when I get back.",False,nwyrbq,OrionMac,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nwyrbq/just_quit_this_is_the_email_i_sent_my_boss/,17,7

Yes $4.50/hour in Singapore for a semi-skilled job!! No surprises that the dental clinic was filled in by foreign workers and I am fairly confident that the company use this ""bait-and-switch"" tactic to show the government that they are in need of foreigners to fill up the positions because it is something Singaporeans wouldn't do.

I am fully and happily employed. I realized that the fast food restaurants near me are in rather desperate need for workers and from my acquaintance, the average pay for a fast food worker has increased and the company is doing more to retain them.

2809,"40F w/spouse: have the opportunity to buy a home in Northern California and work corporate job for the next decade to pay it off and be mortgage-free. Instead, want to leave the US and embark on a self-funded sabbatical to travel and decompress and eventually work on own projects.","Highlights:

* 40F married marketing professional working a comfortable job in Silicon Valley
* Have the opportunity to buy a home 1 hour from San Francisco and pay it off over the next decade if I continue to maintain my current corporate career
* But wiped out from working over the past 15 years in corporate and don't know if I have it in me to keep the same pace to sustain the mortgage
* Instead would like to resign and take a 2-year self-funded sabbatical and travel Latin America
* I have a healthy savings and a US$15,000/yr passive income stream (a fraction of what my US day job pays but serviceable in Mexico)
* No kids, no pets, minimal(ish) belongings which we're willing to sell
* I could ask my company to allow me to work remotely in Mexico (they do adjust pay based on location however and I'm not sure about international restrictions) but I truthfully need a full break not just a change of scenery
* Feel rather numb with my current job, and scared to *not* do what makes me excited in life (traveling, writing, knowledge management, creating content)

//

I went through a difficult childhood in which I essentially raised myself, grew up in poverty, helped my mother financially throughout my teens and early 20s, then put myself through an undergraduate and graduate degreed education (the first in my family), then worked the ranks through the corporate world until I now find myself in a well-payed job in Silicon Valley.

Except now I'm just plain tuckered out. My job looks great on paper. I'm paid very well. I have excellent benefits. I have a good boss, decent people I work with. But, at times I just feel completely numb.

It's not that I don't want to \*work\*. It's the mindlessness of imposed deadlines, endless emails, meetings, circular tasks for the sake of appeasing the machine, business speak (*I'll circle back, reach out, I'm just following up, checking in, what's the delta, you're on mute, KPIs, MBOs, can I get a copy of those slides, let's do a round table)* etc.

It kind of erodes you and this was happening years leading up to COVID — so this is not fatigue from the pandemic.

I understand the trade-off. I know all of the mindlessness above means that I get the cushy pay and benefits. I sincerely appreciate for a lot of people in my position, they'd be perfectly satisfied and happy. No judgment. In fact, I'm kind of disappointed that I'm not one of those people (it feels like I'm defective).

Part of me also feels a bit devastated, that I'm a fool for even considering walking away from this.

I've explored a lot of other avenues to make sure it's not other aspects impacting me psychologically. 

I've been through a lot of counseling and therapy. I've done extra projects at work in other divisions to see if I just need to change up my focus. 

I eat right, I get movement, and I have a loving spouse. Fortunately, in my view, I have no kids (love children but not 24/7). We have no pets (love animals but not the maintenance).

I've worked for different companies, I've moved to different states, cities, counties. I've changed titles, roles, responsibilities. 

All of it has been helpful to some extent but never truly motivating.

I've been very disciplined in my life and I've pretty much always done what everyone else expected of me. I've always been seen as wise, reliable, trusting, gentle, etc. I'm usually well loved by my bosses and colleagues. I say that with no pride: I genuinely am happy to serve them well and be helpful. 

And to be fair, it hasn't always been external pressure, I've always done what \*I've\* expected of myself and pressured myself to do. 

However, I would kind of like to step outside this construct, as it were, and do what I \*want\* to do versus what I \*have\* to do. When I think this way, it's like a huge weight lifts off of me, as if I've been wearing a heavy mantle.

The only times when I've felt truly \*alive\* are when my husband and I were traveling. Like, ebulliently joyful.

For example, in 2018, I took off three weeks to explore Germany and France. At the end, I didn't want to come home, I wanted to keep going to another country. (This is not the only traveling we've done.)

What I'm doing is probably very idiotic. Maybe I am committing career and financial suicide from a Western perspective.

At the end of this (estimated) 2 year sabbatical perhaps I've been able to rebirth myself in a sense and come back to corporate America with renewed direction -- although I understand the risk of losing my place and maybe losing some ground with pay, etc.

Or, maybe I'm able to generate my own revenue through putting my skills to work for myself (my spouse also with his skill set).

I don't have a question. I just wanted to connect with other people maybe going through a similar analysis. And also the exercise of writing this out was helpful.

Thanks if you made it this far.",False,nx7hhg,MysteriousApricot559,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nx7hhg/40f_wspouse_have_the_opportunity_to_buy_a_home_in/,15,1

It's too complicated to consider the feasibility of a job reimbursing you for that (I certainly am not smart enough to debate it as I can see multiple angles to it) but imagine if you factored that into your work day, how much is your hourly wage *really* worth?

I did the math, averaged out my salary over the past years. If I factored in not only the commuting time but also time getting ready for work, my wage goes down a whopping $11.44 per hour.

Our vacation time is set by the company we don’t really get to choose when we can take a vacation and some of us have to wait till that time comes in. We don’t get to choose how long our breaks are most of us only get 15 mins if we are lucky. Sometimes we have to work through the break. We can’t even tell our manager no we don’t want anymore work.

2820,"Even with good working conditions and benefits, work is still a hassle and burn outs still exist","I shall add even with excellent conditions.

By the very nature of employment no matter what your status is (employees, civil servant, self employed, etc), work will at point decrease the quality of life.

Here's what every work have in common :  routine for years (meetings, deadline, planning, etc), little time to develop ourselves (even when you have 50 days a year, it's still the crushing majority of your time devolved to work 10/12 months), having to put up with a hierarchy, justifying everything (vacations, illness, lateness, etc) and the pressure that goes with every work.

I think that the labour organisation will wear down the most Stakhanov of us all. I was thinking that in a world where work is still there, the solution (one of) is alterning periods of work and period of time. For exemple, 1 month of work and 1 month of vacation.

I was thinking about it when working at the hospital (currently), the system is made to fatigue and stop any good willed person. I see young graduate being lied to about contracts, cutting staff, no replacement. Hospitals are the place where breaks are really needed as a tired nurse is a less careful nurse (not even talking about abuse). Medical shortage makes for even more rude doctor. And the worst?

Granted, this was set against the horrors of the pandemic, and experiencing COVID firsthand was terrible. It was made worse under the specter of knowing people were risking their lives so I could get groceries, and they often were working because they had to. (My spouse’s military pay takes care of us monthly, and we are blessed to be in that position.)

But as I hunt for work, I feel frustrated because I cannot, for the life of me, answer the question, “what do I want to for work?” I am perplexed by it, and I believe it is because I don’t feel like a job exists for what I want to do…. Or maybe I want to do a lot of things.

You have to use your own vehicle with 100³ ft of cargo space and cover all expenses but they only want to pay you the km rate for a small car. After vehicle expenses you make less than minimum wage in a lot of cases.

My route was very heavy over 250,000 pounds of flyers per year alone. Parcels and regular mail easily topped 500,000 pounds. I'd run my Tahoe in towing mode because you could really feel the extra weight.

All that work and you barely make enough to get by on your own without living in a dump apartment or having some random roommate. I didn't realize how depressed it had made me working there. Just the thought of quitting noticeably changed my demeanor.

I don't know exactly what I'll do next but I have one option coming up but it's not what I'd want to do. I've also been working my ass off learning to code for almost a year now so that's something.

2847,Skilled Labor,"First time poster, long time lurker, so please forgive my formatting errors. Throw away - I don’t want to connect this to my main account.

So, I work for a large online tutoring company. I have over ten years of tutoring experience since I started doing this kind of work back in college. I’ve always loved helping people in this way, and I’ve worked a few places doing it since I started.

Most of my experiences have been good. Sometimes students can be stressed out when they come for help, and helping them manage those emotions is a big part of being a tutor; not that is should be, exactly, that’s just a very common byproduct of the crummy way we do education in the US.

I’m writing this post because I want to complain about my employer: above unnamed large online tutoring company. First, they pay us minimum wage. Keep that in mind next time someone says only unskilled jobs pay minimum wage. I had to have a degree to be considered for the position. I had to pass a competency test for each subject I tutor (English and Science subjects), unpaid. I had to pass a practical interview, in chat and with voice/audio, unpaid. My job has no benefits, and is heavily monitored and regulated. I regularly receive critique from my “mentor” who is not available to actually help me with the problems I have, and there are lots of problems.

The application in which we interface with students crashes very often. The time clock that I see in the app does not match the server clock, and I get an earful every time a session goes over the allowed session length, even by seconds. I would like to mention here that this is the first tutoring job I’ve ever had that has mandated session length caps. In every other place I’ve worked tutors function as a flexible, team-unit. The time it takes to help someone understand an assignment or get a grasp on the topic the professor didn’t have the time or attention to explain properly in class can’t be easily confined to an hour or twenty minutes or whatever (I love teachers, they are also slaves to our crummy education system).

Recently, they lifted our “pandemic allowances”, which was basically that you weren’t required to accept voice sessions if your home situation isn’t quiet and distraction free anymore. They lifted them without telling anyone, and I haven’t been able to get support or my mentor to even talk to me about it. All my messages have been ignored or bounced to someone else (usually just back and forth between those parties). They did, however, have room in the newsletter last month to explain that although they had been receiving a lot of requests to remove negative reviews on us that weren’t our fault (long wait times in queue, app problems, etc) they simply couldn’t do that without also taking away the “positive reviews we had received that we didn’t deserve”. They had room in the newsletter for that snide bullshirt, but not to tell us that we were going ‘back to normal’.

The worst part about it (and I could go on about the many appalling ways they treat us and the students) is the way that we are all so isolated from each other. I’ve been with this company for a few years now, and I have never, not once, spoken to anyone else who works there, except my mentor and support (with their rather ironic names). 

IRL, tutors rely on one another to cover diverse subjects and specialties, to create a wider pool of shared knowledge, to share tools and resources, and to cover appointments when one of us has to spend extra time with someone who needs it. And I’m just enough of a believer in labor rights to know how important it is to be able to talk to your coworkers about work conditions and pay. They forbid us to give our contact info (or any ‘identifying information’) to anyone, and they forbid us from speaking to the press. We have no internal communities or contacts whatsoever.

Rant over, I guess. Thanks for reading.

2851,"I want to make a point that is so fundamental, it sounds childish. But most people probably won’t be able to wrap their head around it. Explain, if you can, how I’m wrong.","“Money” is a social agreement of exchange. It is represented in physical form by rectangular cotton mixed with linen. 

Without its physical form, exchange is the exchange of objects. The only “object” a human needs is a consumable piece of food, or a shelter from an outside force that would kill or sicken them. This is all with the exception of the diseased. 

Now, since money is a rectangular representation of exchange, before it existed, we must have either found food in the wild, or stolen it from someone else who found it in the wild. (Remember, food is ALL the human body needs for survival. With ONLY food and shelter, reproduction is possible). 

So, before it existed, we grew food ourselves, foraged it, or we stole it from other people who grew or foraged it. 

Instead of following a commodified system of exchange that had to be represented by a rectangular piece of cotton, people stole and foraged anyway. 

Now, we still have to steal and forage. The poor must steal the majority of their food (I personally have seen this in many communities I live in and near), and people must “forage” or exchange, with one another, because food is literally locked behind bars and chains unless your hand possesses a rectangular cotton piece. 

This makes absolutely no sense. If people still must steal to eat, money has absolutely no purpose. If its sole purpose is for exchange, that’s incredibly petty and selfish and just plain weird, seeing as the individual human needs nothing to survive except for proper food portions. 

The entire philosophy about money does not hold up in my head in any meaningful sense. If I want something that I can’t convince someone to give me, I don’t deserve it until I’ve convinced them it would be better in my hands. A rectangular piece of paper should not change that. It should not also be a ticket of gold that makes people sell anything they’ve ever foraged or obtained, regardless of the objects importance, as the money (cotton) ITSELF, is absolutely worthless.

Later on, I saw Guy painfully walking into the hallway to which I naturally asked what was wrong. What he admitted to me didn't surprise me, but it shocked me inside how truly painful it was for him. *Both of his knees and both of his shoulders* were essentially shot. Guy had at least 3 surgeries for them, which understandably and officially left him permanently disabled.

I then bring up to him how much our society has lost its principles given how long we have accepted this abuse from the system to which he agrees with my take.

Decided to go to college so I could have more time and grow up/stall my life and see if I manage to get out of the rut… at this point it’s nearing being out of school for good (failed out 2 years in because it doesn’t interest me and I can’t pay attention) I have 5 days to write an academic dismissal appeal but I can’t get myself to do it. I’m just a financial and emotional burden onto my parents at this point.

I never had a job, except for a year, in Brasov, as a high school teacher. And it was a complete failure. I realized I could not practice a profession. I have to wander around in life. To avoid any responsibility. I have to do everything in order to save my freedom. Freedom to not work in the proper sense of the world. All my life, I calculated how I can be free in a complete sense. Life is only worth living if you are free. I don’t want to be a slave in any way. This is the only absolute certainty that I’ve had in life. I don’t want to be subordinate. I can succumb to any humiliation. On the condition that I am free”

2885,Working part time is the perfect middle ground.,"I was working full time from 8 am to 6 pm 5 days a week. Then I needed to take an exam for my future plans. To study for that exam, I needed time from work for 2 months. Talked to my boss. Lowkey threatened to completely quit if not delivered what I want to get. And the short, I started working part time from 8 am to 12 am for 2 months.

It's absolutely the best because working full time totaly fucks me up and I am literally dead when I arrive home. But not working at all and spending all your days at home is not so good neither. Because then I oversleep and do absolute nothing. But working part time gives me a reason to wake up everyday and start my day early and be productive for the rest of the day. And when I am staying in home, I honestly never wake up before 12 am anyway. But when working part time I leave the office at 12 am and I still have my whole day. It feels like I don't work.

And the best part is, I still get paid. It's less than normal of course but they give me 2/3 of my normal salary eventho I only work for 45% of my full time, so that's weird but I am totally fine with it. 



So in short, try to work part time instead of completely quitting if you have the chance. Not working at all is turning into a lazy lifestyle at some point and its frustrating economically. But working part time keeps you getting paid and gives you a reason to wake up everyday but still feels like you don't work and sets you free as early as 12 am which is earlier than I normally wake up on my holidays.",False,nx17fv,erenozata,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nx17fv/working_part_time_is_the_perfect_middle_ground/,14,4

Was the whole point of getting an office job just a means to day trade or work on your own passions while getting paid in a comfortable location?

I feel like I’m missing something or maybe everyone is too scared to speak up. I’ve tried to be positive and take these “opportunities” by learning new skills and incorporating my own professional development. I’ve gotten new jobs and I’ve even been recruited to new ones.

2898,Disability,"Hi folks. I’ve been disabled since 2004. Fortunately, my last job was at an insurance company and it had great benefits, including a long-term disability (LTD) insurance policy. Between that plan and the optional disability gap insurance (to make up the remaining 35% of my base pay that LTD doesn’t cover, I’ve been “earning” $100K a year since becoming permanently disabled in 2006. I’m not bragging, just posting this to remind folks to ALWAYS spend the extra money, if you are at all able, to buy into disability coverage if it’s offered(my cost was about $13 twice a month in premiums). 

I was a very healthy person and never expected that a car accident would take me out in my relatively early years. If it hadn’t been for these disability policies, I would have been roundly fucked, since social security disability insurance is less than $1,000 a month. I would have ended up dead by now due to medical poverty. Even with a decent Medicare policy, I have to shell out about $9,600/year in first-dollar medical costs. Without that “optional” disability coverage, well, you’d be reading somebody else’s post because my ass would be deceased years ago.

2914,"We all have limited time, why waste it on work","I can't believe it took me this long to find this sub. I finally found my people. Warning this is a rant I've been holding in for a while. 

I find myself debating with people around me way too often on this. Background: I graduated from one of the top unis in the world but I honestly hate working with a passion so now even after working for 6 years I'm still at an entry level job doing the bare minimum. Sometimes I hate myself for this when I see my friends all rich and successful. But when I see the amount of hours they work, I just can't bring myself to ""buck up"". 

At this point I'm like, sure, a promotion would be nice. Some extra cash would be nice. But if that means a more than proportionate amount of increase in responsibility and work, then no thank you. 

To me, our time alive is limited. Why waste it doing things we don't like? I have people commenting on how much time I spend on playing games at my age (almost 30) when I could be doing something more productive like enriching myself or doing investments blah blah adult stuff. And that playing games, or even reading fiction is ""a waste of time"". If doing these ""productive stuff"" brings you joy, then GOOD FOR YOU, I'm envious. But I hate it and I'd rather be happy. If the time spent on my hobbies makes me happy then the time is not wasted. 

It's also because I've come to realise a fact, that is for most normal people, it's pretty impossible to become filthy rich no matter how much we work. If I do work hard and get a better job yadah yadah, I'd become marginally richer. The increase in quality of life is so minimal, what's the point.

2928,It’s bad enough we need to slave ourselves for a paycheck and yet we have to deal with stress on top of it,It’s absurd how we have to dedicate so much of our time and lives to working shitty jobs just to survive. Supervisors and bosses then have the nerve to add constant stress and make it seem like our jobs are the most important aspect of our lives. It’s sickening that majority of our lives we have to endure this kind of stress. I just feel like I’m in a constant state of stress because even on weekends I’m dreading the upcoming work week or have to do mandatory overtime.,False,nxfn3t,amethysttt07,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nxfn3t/its_bad_enough_we_need_to_slave_ourselves_for_a/,4,1

2930,"If I’m going to be killing myself working for you, the least you could do is let me listen to music while I do it.","I deliver shit to grocery stores and stock shelves once I get the shit into the stores. I got a pair of air pods for Christmas and had been listening to music/podcasts while I stocked shelves. I only ever had one headphone in so I could hear what was going on around me, and I never wore headphones while driving or doing any other activity where it might be unsafe. Other people from other companies did the same thing, so I kinda just assumed my company was the same, especially since the few times I saw my old supervisor, she never said anything to me about it even though she saw I was wearing my headphones. 


Just got a new supervisor and apparently it’s company policy that we’re not allowed to wear headphones in stores while we’re servicing them (I don’t recall that policy, but I doubt he’d make it up). I didn’t get written up or anything, but now I’m not allowed to listen to my own music or podcasts and instead am forced to just listen to the shitty “in store audio network.” That plays the same 5 songs all day every day.

2931,"I'm done with 9-5, I'm going to begin enjoying my life again","I'm 36, work in a busy hospital, worked in person through the pandemic, caught COVID, recovered and went right back to work as soon as I was cleared. My hospital sent us a ""hero bonus"" which was...5 whole N95 masks sent to my house. Thanks a fucking lot, I literally steal more N95's than this every week.

Yesterday I decided that I need to reclaim my own life. My mental health has seriously suffered since the beginning of 2020 obviously due to covid, lockdowns, work shit and the loss of my sister last June due to cancer. She had two kids, my niece and nephew ages 4 and 1, though my nephew was only 3 months old when she passed. I've been extremely depressed, borderline suicidal tbh and it seems like the only thing keeping me around is that I can't imagine leaving my niece and nephew without their only uncle and leave my parents with no kids out of two. 

I get home from work exhausted both mentally and physically which leaves me basically no energy or capacity to cook dinner, dishes, laundry, housekeeping, etc. I don't even have the energy or motivation to do things that I used to enjoy like reading, gaming or golfing. It's taking a toll on my relationship with my GF since she is feeling the burden of having to try to pick up my slack. I do still cook and clean stuff but I'll be the first to admit that she's doing more of it. She's very understanding of my situation, I'm very lucky to have someone so supportive but it's getting to her as well, my mood, energy level, lack of interest in most things anymore including sex most of the time, it's having a negative impact on both of our lives and it can't continue like this.

When I got home yesterday we had a great conversation about our situation, in particular my work situation as she knows how miserable I am. I told her I want to quit my full time job and do freelance writing jobs and gig work like delivery and she was completely supportive. I can't continue working in a place that feels more like a punishment or prison sentence than a means to support my survival. I can't continue asking permission for a day off or a break to run an important errand or attend a doctor's appointment like I'm a fucking child. I had to basically plead for extra bereavement days off when my sister passed and they acted like Xerxes The Generous God for giving me 3 extra fucking days. This isn't how we're supposed to live and now I'm ready to do something about it.

My sister's death actually made me realize that you can do everything the ""right"" way, get a career, work your ass off, pay for your health insurance, sacrifice things that are important to you to ""get ahead"" in your career and then lose everything with one phone call. We had to crowdfund her last couple rounds of chemo because she lost her employer sponsored health insurance due to the fact that **she was dying of cancer and couldn't fucking work** and therefore was deemed uninsurable. What. the. fuck. America?

So I'm dipping out. I'm not sacrificing the remaining best years of my life when I can be active and actually enjoy life before my body begins to break down even faster in order to keep up with the status quo that's clearly not working for me in any way to die early having not achieved really any of my own personal goals or realized any of my potential as a fucking human being, not as a wage slave sacrificed at the altar of profit and productivity. I have a sick dual screen phone that is pretty amazing for office productivity. Fuck that, I'm watching Youtube on one screen and reading r/antiwork on the other screen, fuck your productivity metrics.

So yeah, sorry for the long rant but I'm quitting at the end of the month. I'm going to do some freelance writing and work on some old projects that I'd shelved a long time ago, do some delivery driving where I can take breaks whenever I want, go to the driving range or fuck it, do a full 18 in the middle of the weekday and I won't fucking feel bad. I'm going to stay up late when I want and sleep in when I want, book vacations when it suits me and my GF and not ask permission to someone who doesn't give a single fuck about me in any way and only cares about the empty chair where I used to be. I'm done being afraid to ask for things and accepting what I'm given. I'm going to make money on my own terms even if that means taking home a bit less. If the tradeoff is that my mental health improves and I can begin enjoying my life again then it's a trade I'm willing to make. 

Fuck your 9-5:30, unpaid lunches, micromanagement, denial of time off requests, need a Doctor's note for a sick day, employer sponsored health insurance, 2.5 hour daily commute, office bullshit and ""hero pay"". 

And a big thanks to this subreddit for showing me that it's not just me feeling like this, I'm not an outlier, a weirdo or a lazy fuck for wanting to live my own life on my terms. I've never been more motivated to change my life than now and if that change means taking a few steps back and slowing the pace to enjoy the scenery then that's what has to be done. If you're reading this and feeling similarly then I honestly hope your situation allows you to make the changes that you need to make for yourself and not for anybody else, especially not for you fucking employer.",False,nxk3cg,Derp_State_Agent,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nxk3cg/im_done_with_95_im_going_to_begin_enjoying_my/,32,4

2933,Traveling,"Just want to preface this with two things 
1) I posted on here the other day and never got around to replying to any of the comments and now it feels like it’s been too long for me to go respond now, so, thanks anxiety ig 
And 2) I’m on mobile (sorry) 

Now. I’m still young- I’ve got a lot of life to live and things to learn, but I do know two things for sure right now. Those two things are that I have absolutely no goals in life other than to be as happy as possible, and that working is just not going to make that happen for me. This sub has helped me so much in feeling recognized in my distan for capitalism and being just a cog in its machine, and I really appreciate that. I guess my reasoning for this post is: is it a reasonable idea for me to try to save up as much money as I can from the job I currently have (and depending on the pay and how much it costs, might be quitting in October) in order to buy and restore an old van/bus and travel the U.S. in it? Does anyone have a rough idea how much that would cost, or would that be a better question for r/vandwellers? I know the van life probably won’t be one that I’ll commit to for the rest of my life, but I hear too many older people saying they wished that they would’ve travelled more when they were young rather than putting it off until they put aside enough money to do it (because let’s face it, the working class is never going to have ‘enough’ money for traveling). I’m not looking for any sort of 5 star living while in a van; I know it’s going to suck sometimes. I know every day won’t be an amazing adventure. I just want to go out and see what there is to see and meet friends along the way.

2974,All these arguments against working from home...,"I feel like I am going insane. So many of these arguments are so dumb and ridiculous.

\---

""People miss the social interaction, they feel lonely and depressed at home. If you can't see your coworkers you are socially isolated""

Have you ever heard about the concept of actual family and friends? I enjoy socially interacting with people I actually choose to interact with and not just people I am forced to sit next to for 8 hours.

""All the distractions at home make you less productive, the energy of everyone working in an office will make you want to work harder!""

First of all, most distractions they list are literally not distractions. Doing the laundry, doing the dishes are things you have to actively choose to do. If the laundry machine then beeps, I will concede this is a distraction. But studies have shown you get interrupted by coworkers every 13 minutes and you need about 27 minutes to get back to focused work. Children may be a distraction for parents, but that does not mean everyone who doesn't have children needs to come back to an office. Also it is proven you are more productive in home office.

""The commute gives you time alone, time to prepare for the day mentally, to reflect,...""

This is one of the dumbest things. If you want some time alone to reflect, to thing, go for a walk alone. Why does this need to be connected with going to an office. Are you just an idiot or what the hell is going on?

""People have put on an average of X pounds while working from home! If you go to office you will have to move around, walk up and down stairs...""

This is a you problem! If you don't have the discipline to stay away from the fridge or do some exercises, then that is on you. I actually use my gained free time to exercise a bit, the thing I was often times to tired to do.

""You will communicate more with coworkers and creativity will flow!""

Offices especially open offices are provenly bad for communication. People communicate less in an open office as they are afraid of disturbing others, as they should. But since companies don't really care about the reality anyway, this is understandable.

""It is hard to separate when work ends and home life starts.""

No its not, you shut down your computer and put it away. This is also just a discipline problem.

2977,"Your thoughts about the ""One Big Union"" concept?","One Big Union

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Big_Union_(concept)

---


The One Big Union was an idea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries amongst trade unionists to unite the interests of workers and offer solutions to all labour problems.

Unions initially organized as craft unions. Workers were organized by their skill: carpenters, plumbers, bricklayers, each into their respective unions. Capitalists could often divide craft unionists along these lines in demarcation disputes. As capitalist enterprises and state bureaucracies became more centralized and larger, some workers felt that their institutions needed to become similarly large. A simultaneous disenchantment with the perceived weakness of craft unions caused many unions to organize along industrial lines. The idea of the ""one big union"" is championed by anarchist syndicalists to organize effectively.

As envisioned by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which for many years prior to 1919 had been associated with the concept,[1] One Big Union was not just the idea that all workers should be organized into one big union. In the 1911 pamphlet One Big Union, IWW supporters Thomas J. Hagerty and William Trautmann enumerated two goals: One Big Union needed to ""combine the wage-workers in such a way that it can most successfully fight the battles and protect the interests of the workers of today in their struggles for fewer hours of toil, more wages and better conditions,"" and it also ""must offer a final solution of the labor problem – an emancipation from strikes, injunctions, bull-pens, and scabbing of one against the other.""",False,nwi2pz,Busy_Golf6799,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nwi2pz/your_thoughts_about_the_one_big_union_concept/,7,1

2999,Why It's Bad to Have a High GDP,"[Source](https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/why-its-bad-to-have-high-gdp)

## To put it in other words...

The common way of looking at Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is that it's a metric of economic success: more GDP is more wealth. Wealth is good. ""Poverty"" (meaning low *per capita* GDP) is bad. Nowadays, pretty much everyone talks about ""economics"" like this as if this truism was scribbled on the back walls of the cosmos.

This is just looking at one side of the ledger in a kind of global double-entry accounting book. A logically equivalent way of looking at it is that **GDP is a metric of economic exchange required for survival in society as it exists**. You can say that some area ""produced"" $1 billion of output (sounds good), but you can just as easily say that $1 billion was required for that area to sustain itself (sounds bad). These two are simply logically equivalent.

## Living on $1 a day

Let's dive into the Gestalt: when you hear that a family of eight lives on less than a dollar per day (PPP adjusted), you might wonder how they manage! To *actually* do such a thing would require buying large bags of rice for the whole family, eat only that and live in free cardboard boxes.

The reality is that that often uttered phrase means that they use less than $1 a day in the general economy, while the rest of their livelihood is ""off-the-grid"" or self-sufficient. They may grow food in a family farm, hunt for food, and most of their daily needs from cooking oils, to plates, to pottery, to soap are often made at home as well.

There is still ""an economy"" but often one that is barter based or *socialist* in the real pre-socialist sense of the word: mediated by direct face-to-face social tit-for-tat between neighbors and friends, none of this mediated by currency being exchanged, thus it is not part of the GDP.

If you read about some Bangladeshi village where the only product is ""textiles"", that doesn't mean that everyone there makes textiles all day and, without a textile company, everyone would've starved to death. It means that the only on-paper, measurable global industry practiced there is textile manufacturing. Other villagers might farm, hunt, even do some kind of gathering in some places. They will produce the arts and crafts and live the way people live when you leave them alone. If your view of the world is mediated by GDP, you're only seeing the extremely small sliver that pops into existence when people exchange something involving legal tender.

This is extremely difficult for us modern bugpeople to understand because to be a bugman in a large city is to produce absolutely nothing on one's own and buy literally everything you need from the store. To us non-productive people, GDP means income which means survival. But the further out of Bugmanville you go, the clearer the vacuousness of GDP becomes. When you realize that most of human wealth is unmeasured by GDP, you realize that Whig History and Steven Pinkerism is based on shaky foundations.

## Example

A minor example. We had a large Thanksgiving feast near my uncle's house in very rural Florida. As it got cold in the night, we had a fire in a repurposed old sugar cane cooking vat artfully standing on used symmetrical cinderblock pieces. A bugman hipster might pay two hundred dollars or more for a similar looking ""authentic"" piece of equipment. Those $200 would be counted in the GDP. A bugman hipster might have also bought or rented chairs for the event, ""contributing"" more to the GDP, but my uncle, as part of the local wholesome church community, simply borrowed some from the church. Thus our event produced basically no GDP output in goods or services, despite being functionally equivalent to some similar but expensive and ergo ""productive"" ""Friendsgiving"" practiced by urbanites. In reality *we* are richer than the bugmen hipsters who blew hundreds of dollars on a faux-folksy party. In this case, we owned the firepit and had easy access and permission to the chairs, thus we are more economically flexible than they are. That GDP that they produced/expended is evidence of deeper reliance on the economic system. That GDP output is a marker of *fragility*, reliance on the conditions of the outside economy in the same way that a village of Bangladeshis who abandon their traditional way of lives to work on textiles are more fragile, despite being able to save up for iPhones.

## What GDP really measures

**Most of the increase in GDP across the world is simply the movement from local partially-social partially-under-the-table economies to economies mediated by taxable currency.** An economically self-sufficient village with close social relationships and a barter economy has 0 GDP. A township of entrepreneurs and artisans you partially barter and partially use currency which they don't report has 0 GDP. All of these people are ""in poverty"" and ""earn less than a dollar a day"". And if you want to be truly self-sufficient, that means having a personal GDP of zero.

More than that, pretty much everywhere, GDP is a strong indicator of social upheaval. If you think that GDP is some eternal goodness, remember that *everything ""good"" about industrialization shows up in the GDP*, while at the same time, *everything bad about it will not show up*. Or, sometimes bad things are registered as positive economic growth: urbanization has caused mass-disease, and if that means a market for new medical services and pharmaceuticals, great! The GDP just went up! The Ganges is polluted due to the textile plant? That just means more opportunities for local entrepreneurs to sell bottled water! The GDP just went up! Are people being pushed out of fishing or other subsistence occupations because of it? Even better! Now they have no choice but to contribute to the GDP! With every passing year, in fact, more and more of the GDP is produced by dealing with the problems that our higher level of GDP have caused.

At the end of the day, **GDP is only a measurement of how reliant a place or country is on the global economy**. Self-sufficiency has a GDP of 0. Wasteful consooomerism has an extremely large GDP.

## Planned obsolescence

I have one of my great grandfather's early electric circular saws. It has a bunch of gunk in it, but it still works (although I recently took it apart to replace some old screws and springs and other little parts to be careful). They literally do not make circular saws like it; it's all metal, while even the fancy modern stuff is mostly plastic.

The ""unfortunate"" thing about it and other durable tools is that it's ""bad for the economy,"" especially the GDP. Since that thing has been around since maybe the 50's or 60's, that's as long as 70 years the economy has gone without the ""stimulation"" of us having to buy another saw.

Viewers of my technology videos: Which would be better for the world, if everyone used the material equivalent of a classic American-made IBM ThinkPad, or some Apple Laptops that are unfixable computers made of mostly batteries designed to conk out right before the new version comes out? Regardless, the Apple Macs that cost thousands a piece are much better for the ""economy.""

That's what I mean. If you have quality tools and do not need to constantly throw money at the system to buy things, fix things and otherwise waste money, you are going to be having a lower GDP. That's just how it is.

## The propagandistic role of GDP

When you don't think things through like this, GDP is supposed to appear as an objective measure of economic goodness. You're supposed to be looking at those GDP charts and saying, ""Wow, my life might be terrible, I am not free, I am subject to forces out of my control, and I am told I have to participate in mass-consumerism to survive, but these charts are the facts\[!\], and the facts say that things are better now, so I believe them!""

It's legitimately surprising to me how big of a boon the idea of increasing GDP is for Whig history and NPCs of many different ideologies. People of the Left and Right will matter-of-factly tell me that a plastic based economy taking over the world is still good because the line is going up. I've heard it as a justification for everything:

&gt;Don't like globalization?  
You're wrong, the GDP is going up.  
Don't trust state-funded institutionalized science?  
You're wrong, the GDP is going up.  
Don't want child drag queens?  
You're wrong, the GDP is going up.  
Don't want everything to be made of plastics and other petrochemicals?  
You're wrong, the GDP is going up.  
Don't want mass pornography?  
You're wrong, the GDP is going up.  
Don't want free sugary drinks since infancy?  
You're wrong, the GDP is going up.

When you abandon the illusion of GDP, you are suddenly able to ask whether massive technological ""progress"" has *actually* been good for real human life and human pychology.",False,nwgq7h,14WordsOfTJK,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nwgq7h/why_its_bad_to_have_a_high_gdp/,8,1

Every other post here is from people who describe their current mental state as depressed, anxious, or even suicidal, and all because they have bosses and/or ""work cultures"" that are dehumanizing, exploitive, or emotional abusive in some way. Ending remote work - which many companies seem desperate to do as soon as possible - would just force people back into that crazy-making Hunger Games-like environment. At least with remote-work there is some safety and control, some *dignity* even. Yes, the work is monotonous and meaningless (pointless?), but at least being at home you can salvage some autonomy and aren't exposed to the misery and abuse of other co-workers.

3007,Does anyone else hate seeing employees defend customers?,"For some reason it really gets under my skin when I feel like employees have been brainwashed by the ""customer is always right"" mentality and the culture of customer service. To me it is ridiculous to expect an employee to never show annoyance, never snap at a rude customer, or in general act ""unprofessional"" when met with rudeness and ingratitude from customers. 

I know I'm bitter because I've been working since I was 16 - that's nearly a decade in the workforce - and most of that has been in the restaurant industry and retail. I've been treated like garbage by nearly everyone involved- owners, managers, corporate, customers, coworkers...overworked and underpaid as well. it's all taken quite a toll on me. Because of that, I revel in stories where employees were rude right back to customers, neglected their work, snapped at their bosses, etc. In my opinion, the more an employee can get away with that actively goes against customer service culture, the happier and prouder I am for them.

So it annoys me when I see other employees of this hellscape that is customer service standing up for customers and saying stuff like ""you're being so unprofessional"" and ""you should have just ignored that rude customer and smiled through your aggravation and helped them with what they needed.""

first of all, what level of ""professionalism"" can be expected of someone who is being paid minimum wage, or slightly above it? I mean, seriously? and how much are employees expected to put up with from the public while being expected to smile and be polite? why are we expected to lick the boots of someone treating us like shit just because they're a customer or a boss?

I know I'm bitter, but I feel truly sorry for anyone so brainwashed by our culture that they come to a rude customer's defense over the defense of an employee who finally snapped after years of mistreatment.",False,nweqhy,kabutomushii,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nweqhy/does_anyone_else_hate_seeing_employees_defend/,9,1

3023,"I nearly poisoned myself just so I could avoid work today, a rant.","Before I begin with my story, keep your mean comments about me being a dumbass to yourself. I know what I did was dangerous and stupid and I know that I'm a dumbass, but that's what the system, being one that doesn't cater well to people with anxiety, has lead me to.

I woke up this morning and immediately felt anxiety. Today was not the day, I didn't want to go to work at all. I work as a pharmacy tech and honestly hate the job so much. I have had so many negative experiences with customers at every job since I was 18 that I can't hardly stand it anymore. I feel traumatized and scared all the time, ontop of my anxiety that makes it much worse. Ontop of that, everyone there makes me feel dumb. I'm the new guy and know nothing about medicine. I feel out of place between the pharmacists, pharmacy students, and others going to school for something medical related. Then you have me, just some degen who likes weed and video games. I always worry that people and customers are judging me because I feel like I don't know jack shit there. I don't even know why I applied now that I'm thinking about it.

But you know what I find scarier? Not having a job, losing my apartment and my fiance hating me for being useless. So naturally I was terrified to call out. I've already called out twice in the past month. Calling out is such a terrifying task for me as well.

So, my mind says ""Why not be sick?"". After a little bit of research, I find out that drinking warm salt water can make you throw up. Now, I'm not a complete idiot, but I am pretty dumb. I know people aren't really supposed to drink salt water. But I hate being at work so much that I was prepared to endure whatever. So I drank some salt water, a big hefty glass, didn't even measure the salt. 

My plan was in place, I'd walk into work, the salt water would do its thing, I'd make a spectacle of it and puke infront of someone and be sent home. I'd grab some water or something with electrolytes and be on my merry way. It did not go that way at all. I felt dehydration hit, I got hot, felt like I was sweating. My stomach begins to gurgle and my vision is kind of foggy. I feel confusion hit me, but I try to push through hoping I'll blow chunks soon enough. I just occasionally dry heaved and kept working in that state for about 4 hours before actually being sent home after ran off to the bathroom to have a full on panic attack. I looked in the mirror and noticed my face was bright red too. How did nobody notice sooner that something was wrong. 

This system is so cruel and I feel trapped, feel like I'm stuck in customer service jobs, forever to be miserable. The only thing that ever seems to make me happy is my twitch streaming and gaming. But let's be honest, I will never make it as a streamer. The odds are against me on that. 


Anyway, that's my story/rant about how I nearly overdosed on sodium today and felt like I was dying of dehydration all because I didn't want to be uncomfortable for 8 hours today because I wasn't in the right headspace to deal with people. Either that or maybe I was just too much of a pussy to call out.

3038,I feel like I finally see a light,"So I finally see perhaps just a small opportunity to go fully self employed again doing what I was doing before I began working for someone else again if that makes sense (film and TV extra). Depending on what I do in the self employed role could make as much as four figures for one day’s work. Plus it would be doing something I centrally enjoy and never been happier doing compared to other jobs I’ve done. But it isn’t consistent pay as there can be droughts of work and stuff can get cancelled just like that or require quite a bit of travel at unsocial hours. 

Wanted to leave my day job for a while now but now I’m not sure if this is the time or if I should take the leap? Three days work with the right roles can pay almost as much as what it takes me almost a year to make in a 9 - 5 plus I’m then free to engage in my other self employed stuff. Just a 9 - 5 kind of prevents focusing on it but is consistent pay. Then again, look at my posts in this sub, the day job has messed with my anxiety and stress levels so much.

3041,Want to quit my job,"I work for a company with good repurtation in our region. Three months ago when I first started I was excited to work there, but that ended the first weak working there. At first I tought that I could do it until the end of the summer, but after today I want to quit now!

First week I was asked if I could be in charge for a part of the project(not in the job descriprion(minium wage job)), and I stupidly agreed to do it as I have the knowlage to do it. I was hoping that it could get me a full time and beter paying job at the end of the summer.
Yestersay I was sweating my ass to do as much as I posibly could for that project while having to basicaly force every other coworker to atleast show me where are the materials for the project. But when someone who works there for 20+ years comes for the matherial for their project everyone needs to help them load the matherial and the boss even drives it to the location and helps with the project for it to be finished quickly.
My project involvs lots of goverment money that I will never see. And the project is made so porrly from the begining things are mising becouse they didn't order them or they might be somewere but I can't find them. When I ask where can I find something they say I will find out I will order them. 
Today I was told that I didn't do enough yesterday as the work should be finished. Work is not finished becouse he is a por boos who doesen't do much for work to be eficient.
The company doesent invest in tools to make more eficient and If you have a cheap 20 $ sugestion how to make work more eficient, they say the owner won't give the money to do so.
Every joung employe that I talked to wants to quit or will quit soon. 
Needles to say I wont stay long. I have some money saved and will focus on finishing my studies. 

How is the best way to quit my job. 

1. Go to work but do nothing or very litle until fired probably never becouse they can't get new workers.

2. Leave keys and a card +project papers in a locker and just diaspere

3. Tell the boss this is my last day of working here... give him keys + project papers and return the card in acounting to get 5$ back

4. Just don't show up for work monday morning and block every work related number

3043,"""If you want the bonus too then get promoted to a manger to get it.""","This is what a district supervisor said when I worked at UDF. For those who don't know, UDF is a convenient store that sells ice cream like shakes and such. I worked there the moment I got out of highschool like a dumbass. Not only do they typically treat employees like shit, they don't give breaks. I worked there for five years and I didn't think breaks were a thing. My naive dumb-self stayed in that job for five years and never knew breaks were a thing.  I could go on and on about this but I'll try to stop here. lol

&amp;#x200B;

So then, let get down to this bullshit. When a store does good, the store manager gets bonus pay. So what does store managers do? They are on our asses about everything and try to keep the shop at all times looking good, without breaks. We had a meeting and the district supervisor comes in tell us about this big deal coming up and tells us work hard and our manager get a bonus. Most of us gave him the exact same look and I guess he felt it, ""if you also want the bonus to become a manager."" Yeah about that, if everyone became a manager at that store then there would be no normal  employees.  To become a store manager; most of the time it was someone who skipped being a normal employee because they had experience somewhere else. Second, getting a manager position is not something you work hard for and everyone gets the shot. Taking over a store to be a manager would come to; someone quit, someone was fired, or someone transferred. 

They essentially want us to work to the bone so our boss gets that nice extra bonus but the rest of us? Not a damn fucking thing. We never got any bonus pay or anything but a good job from our store manager. Even then, I thought it made no fucking sense. I'm supposed to put in extra work and be extremely meticulous so my boss whatever that sweet bonus? Gtfo of here!  Did you know my state min wage was at the time? 7.25 and guess how much they start you off? 7.35 and if you were lucky, maybe you start with 7.50. You had to work a serious amount of hours to get a pay raise.  I'm talking about 40+ hours to get a fucking nickel raise within three months.

Certified Hardware Repair Tech Dell/Lenovo/HP

2200 hour paid training, meaning I must pay $3600 in which they will deduct from my pay @ $150 every two weeks. Training is 8-5 M-F.

After training I would be able to sit for the CompTIA A+ cert and some others. I am sure I must pay for those too.

Mind you I live in CA and the pay rate for this position would be $11.05/hr for 160 hours after that it goes to a whopping $13/hr for 6 months and then I would get a mind blowing raise to $13.79! and finally tops out at $16/hr, although the goal would be for a higher paid position.

I'm in Supply Chain part of one of the most pretigious companys here in Mexico (OXXO). The job is pretty easy but demanding. Inventory, sells, KPI, and everything else that excel can do. 

Due to the pandemic, last year and the first months of 2021 I was on home office. I always been quite efficient with time, so I finished my 8-6 job in 2 hours, with plenty of time for doing my hobbies and focus and important stuff. 

It was all cool until I have to come back to the office. I'm dying everyday of boredom. I try and do my work slowly, but still I ended up with 4 free hours a day.

I was thinking quitting, I have about 3 months of my needs covered in savings so I'm planning on taking some vacations and focus on finding an online job.

What are the best advices you guys can give me abut the remote job? Is it hard to find one? Where can I start looking for one outside freelance and fiverr which are full of other people and it's hard getting a good client? I have a bachelor on Marketing and I can defend myself on PS and AI.

But I know very well how job agencies act and I didn't have one agency that didn't do anything illegal. 

This time I didn't like the job because I had to WFH which didn't work for me, I was completely bored out, never got feedback, thought I was doing great, but never saw the team, not even in Zoom. I was also starting to feel extremely tired and depressed due to other issues. I wasn't surprised when I got my notice. The end of the would almost be the same period as the end of the project so it didn't matter to me. I was already dead inside. The job agency told me by telephone that they would give me a 4 week notice.

I waited for the notice which has to be in written form. I didn't receive it so I asked in an e-mail for the notice and other docs. They'd take care of it. Then I got a call that I quickly needed to sign the documents. Luckily I didn't sign, because it was a mutual termination. I wouldn't be entitled to benefits if I had signed. The agency knew very well they were in the wrong, because they had nervously asked me if I found another job yet, which is incredible, because I was only two weeks into the notice and it's also none of their business.

To troll I had actually lied I had found a job already. When i replied that I would not sign a mutual termination they got all pissed and defensive lol. They ended up having to end the contract without notice period to not offend the client, and pay out the notice.of

The worst was how belittling this woman was to me. She obviously tried this before and never had someone stand up for themselves like this.

Don't care a second about job agencies. Don't list them on your cv. They're only legal employers, not factual employers. List the client if you want.

3055,I don't understand how anyone is supposed to be happy in this rat race that is life,"Apologies in advance bc this is definitely a rant.
 For the past couple weeks especially I can't help but feel like what is the fucking point. Every single paycheck I'm barely scraping by to cover rent and utilities, car payment, phone service, food etc. I have NOTHING left to spend on myself. Ever. I haven't bought myself anything that wasn't like, a nice sandwich and a bowl of soup in a year. And I could only justify that because its food. You know, one of the things I need in order to stay alive. I have NO savings, so if anything unexpected happens I am screwed (I'm waiting, any day now, because life loves to tell me to go fuck myself).
 I finally have health insurance for the first time in over a decade, made my first doctor's appointment in as long, to be told that new patient appointments run around $400 without insurance, but they couldn't give me a ballpark amount. I want to go to the doctor because I KNOW I'm depressed, and bipolar disorder runs in my family and I'm 99% sure I have it, life is absolutely miserable, and now I get to bankrupt myself trying to make myself feel even slightly better. Literally what is the point.
 All I have ever wanted in my life is to own my own home. Nothing special, specifically a tiny home, just big enough for myself, MAYBE one other person. I bust my ass, actually make $15 hourly, but it still doesn't matter. I'm never going to get what I want. I'm surviving out of spite at this point.

3058,Volunteer work is just as bad as paid work,"TL;DR: Don't bother volunteering unless it's in something you're passionate about or will help you get a job.

I've volunteered an awful lot in lots of different places and if I'm being honest with you, I was taken advantage off as much as I am in a paid position. Obviously I didn't do it for the recognition or anything, but I sure was annoyed when people took the mick.

The first volunteer work I did was when I was 16. Busted my ass in this cafe working 30 hours a week, getting told off multiple times for not knowing how to do certain things and having to deal with incredibly rude customers. It was exhausting work and because I was young and naive, they got me to do essentially everything. I did enjoy it though and I learnt a lot of new things, not to mention all the confidence I gained (plus they only needed me to help out for a month or so).

I also volunteered at the back of a charity shop, sorting stuff out. It was dull. I learnt nothing more other than I hate retail. Customers were rude, the staff were okay but they were old and we had nothing in common, and I spent hours in a stuffy room folding clothes. I lasted a year before the store had to shut down. I was hired because they couldn't afford to employ another staff member, so instead of being treated like a volunteer, I was treated like staff.

Volunteered at a doggy daycare. Job was good, boss was an absolute asshole. She would scream at the dogs and couldn't hold a temper to save her life. I spent all day picking up dog shit, starting at 7am in the morning. She only hired staff under the age of 21 to save money. The breaking point was after being on my feet for several hours, I decided to sit down and pet one of the dogs. She comes storming in, 4 hours after the start of my shift, shouting at me that I need to be standing up and that I'm being lazy. I left the next week. I later learnt that over Christmas, she had given everyone a Christmas card with a £10 gift card in, except me. Wish I had told her to shove my notice up her ass.

There's loads more stories about being treated like shit, but volunteering is just code for ""we just don't want to pay you"". Unless it gives you some kind of advantage, don't even bother.",False,nw2jfu,rockymcrolling,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nw2jfu/volunteer_work_is_just_as_bad_as_paid_work/,13,1

3063,"Ah yes, just work yourself to death and pay someone else’s mortgage.","| have a legitimate question. Why is it that you can get a very nice two
bedroom place for $8-900/month (sometimes even $6-700) but then if
you need a third bedroom, your price instantly goes up to well into the
thousands? It's seems absolutely ridiculous that a third bedroom would
make rent $1200-$1500/month. That's a mortgage payment. College
students with growing families don’t have that kind of money. Especially if
their family is big enough to need a three bedroom apartment.

I just need to just a little bit like it so I can tolerate it. Cause 9 to 5 of doing something I hate is seriously making me super, super depressed.

So how can one find a job I'll like? I'd even be willing to go to college again, but I just don't like anything. I looked through any and all possible career paths and I'd rather drive a rusty nail through my ballsack than do any of them.

I'm lucky I had a good support system with my friends and my boyfriend who's been incredibly supportive during that time. 

When I think about it one of the only times I was truly happy in my life was during another sick leave last year when I had the time to do what makes me happy and was connected to my close ones during the first quarantine in march 2020.

If you're going through this, I'm so sorry, I hope it gets better and we can organize to put an end to this. But before that, I hope you find some comfort and know the problem isn't you.

3079,a newbie babbling,"Hey everyone,

fist of, I hope this is allowed, if not please delete.

&amp;#x200B;

I am pretty new to the anti-work sentiment. It started about 1.5 years ago when my roommate told me she wasn’t going to work full time after her degree. Partly because full time positions are not very common in her field, partly because she said she just didn’t want to.

Now for me as a business major, this was completely mind-blowing. Up until that point I was, naturally, very career focused. It was what they taught us to be. I had done two internships, was just starting out a part-time job and went to every career fair and “free career workshop” I could find. I had accepted that I would never have a “dream job” but I was still planning on shooting for the quickest and most efficient way up. Planning my route through a prestigious Master’s to a top professional qualification in my field. All this while I knew that my internship, grinding away at one of the world’s most well known accounting firms, had been far from a great experience for me mentally.

&amp;#x200B;

Then Covid happened, and I started working and studying from home, I failed my last exam, which added another year to my undergrad and I watched some people of the people on youtube that have recently popping up, that talk about how capitalism work sucks Now I am here and these are some things I’ve learned:

1. I don’t want a career any more. I’ll be ok with working a four-day week to get by, but only if it accommodates my needs.

2. Number one need being: work from home at least half the time. I don’t know the anti-work community’s stance on wfh in general, but I love it! No time wasted on commute, comfort of your own home and avoiding toxic office culture, sounds great to me. And instead of spending the times I don’t have anything to do or short breaks everyone needs from time to time, pretending like I’m busy, I can fill these precious minutes with small household chores, so I am free after work ends. 

3. And let’s be clear here, I still do my work, but I’ve come to realize that time I save by being extra efficient (which is definitely a bit more stressful), doesn’t automatically belong to my employer. As long as they don’t reward my heightened productivity with extra compensation, I don’t see anything wrong with just taking that extra time for myself. And that is just a lot easier to do when you’re not constantly being watched by your boss.

4. And the work getting is done is really all they care about. They don’t care about you. I mean, I’ve always kind of known this, especially because as a part-time employee and student on the side, I don’t bring much “value” to the company. Nevertheless, I always felt bad, if I had to leave a job, was very apologetic for wanting time off and always made sure to coordinate everything I did with my boss. But it seems like he really doesn’t give a flying freak what I do. He never asks how I’m doing (working at home), he rarely realizes what I’m even working on at the moment and doesn’t even make sure I have enough work. So why should I care. I’ve completely stopped checking in with him regarding my work schedule etc. If he has a problem with that, he can come talk to me. It’s taken some time, but I’ve learned not to stress about it any more.

5. Especially since I know how little they pay me for what I do. Since I work with clients and part of that involves invoicing, I happen to know exactly how much money I’m making them and how much they pay me in return. I’ve been wanting to ask for a raise for a while (I’m too shy), but in the meantime I will put in the effort that suits my compensation.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly haven’t come far in my journey yet. I don’t know how I want to spend my life. I still feel like I can never truly relax because it feels unproductive. I’ll be spending the next two months on a retreat and I really hope it’ll help clear my mind a bit and show me what life without any work is like. **If you’ve got any reading recommendations that you think might help, I’d be glad to hear them.**

3139,Insane amounts of tasks at work? Is this normal?,"I don’t know if I’m just overreacting or actually in the right?
I started working at the reception of a company months ago and everything seemed great. My boss is a nice, older woman but an extreme perfectionist sadly. 
So 2 weeks ago I came to work and found 13 tasks at my desk (yes I calculated them) they all had little stickers on them from my boss asking me to do it. It was RIDICULOUS stuff like „please bring those papers in this room“ or „throw this cardboard in the garbage bin one floor down“. Just seeing my desk (and my mail afterwards) full of task got me into a panic attack and I felt paralyzed for hours. Like why give out such weird tasks? Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying I wanna do nothing because I enjoy meaningful and serious tasks. But this was just stuff she could have done herself instead of taking the time to write stickers on them. Or stuff that is literally just her microorganising every molecule. So, the boss came later and wanted to give me 2 more tasks. I couldn’t reply and just broke down and cried, she seemed understanding of my situation but said that it’s normal, everyone has such amounts of tasks? And she became all pseudo-samaritan and said that having those tasks will help me improve my stress and organisation skills? 

After this convo with her, I’ve noticed more and more how I get every single „fart“ of a task. Another coworker needed to something and my boss was quick to say „oh let them (me) do it“. 

And today I come and see my desk again full of papers. Now it was another coworker giving me stuff to do too which caused a full mental breakdown and I was just crying (thankfully while clocked in atleast) me and the boss had another convo after this and she said again how it’s normal and how there are only 6 other coworkers at the reception and they all get so many tasks to do blahblah. I did hear of 2 other coworkers that they’ve never seen anyone get this much of work .. 

I honestly don’t know if my boss kinda „gaslighted“ me into believing this is all normal. On top of this, I always have to pick up phones and do the customer contact part too (which is getting harder for me too with my sanity going downhill)

Can someone maybe share examples of their work tasks? Or tell me atleast what is going on? :/",False,nv9a97,lidlwater,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nv9a97/insane_amounts_of_tasks_at_work_is_this_normal/,5,1

3158,I'm interested in hearing more about the anti-work rationale (Genuine),"I confess I don't know all the nitty gritty details of all the arguments behind anti-work philosophies but I tend to agree with some of them and disagree with others. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, I'd like to get hear the additional reasoning behind some of the points I don't agree to see if I would change my mind. I visit this sub occasionally (2-5/mo) and don't really get to see much rational argument -- just a lot of rants. Please comment respectfully on some or all of the points below if you disagree with me.

&amp;#x200B;

1) ""Wage-Slave"" 

Or some variation of it. This term seems overly bombastic and almost certainly not meant to be literal. Slavery has such a complex and serious history and meaning that you can't honestly compare employment to it. With a job, you are \*\*voluntarily\*\* agreeing to do something in \*\*exchange\*\* for an income. 

2) Capitalists are evil

I agree that many aspects of how the market and its participants function are reprehensible. I think the strongest argument I've every heard for why the complaints of business over regulation is hyperbole is child labor. We use to have it; then, we passed laws banning it. We still have a functioning market today without it. Nevertheless, the core idea of private citizens owning capital (in terms of money) or assets (in terms of land, buildings, stocks, etc.) is not inherently evil. There is a core incentive to improve the efficiency, but guardrails have to be put in place. Baseball players are incentivized to knock the ball out of the park but a referee is there to make sure they don't use an air cannon.

3) Working hard or hustle culture is dumb

Let's draw a distinction between people that are motivated solely for an income to sustain themselves and people that are motivated for other reasons (e.g. achievement, altruism). I agree that at a baseline, nobody should \*\*have\*\* to be overworked to live a safe and stable life. I do subscribe to the idea that we could probably have a 4 day work week standard AND every worker could earn enough for (i) food, (ii) shelter/sanitation, (iii) healthcare, (iv) education,  (v) security, and (vi) transportation. However, I disagree that hustling or working hard or putting in overtime or working 70 hours a week is \*inherently\* bad when the primary motivator is the worker themselves. I've had friends that have started businesses; I myself have worked long hours not because I needed to but because I worked for a company where I believed in what they did and wanted us to succeed and improve. I derived satisfaction from our purpose like someone might derive satisfaction from playing the guitar.

4) We could all just buy a farm and live off the land

You could, but you'd have to give up every modern convenience like cell phones, TVs, automotive, tractors, refrigerator, etc - to be consistent in your logic. Each product of convenience we use in our life is the result of thousands of other people working in interwoven supply chains. Again, there's a distinction between an individual wanting to live is isolation/independence and thinking that the whole of society could. Work still needs to be done to have the life of comfort and convenience (relative to centuries ago) that most enjoy. 

5) Robots could do everything and humans could live a life of leisure

Given how hard it is to get 10 people to agree unanimously on something, I don't foresee an entire country agreeing to it and coordinating on the gargantuan effort. The simple act of retrofitting a factory is insanely complicated, time consuming, expensive, and (ironically) labor intensive. As a technophile, the technology is there for perhaps the majority of the means of production, but not 100%. I hope to significant progress towards the automation of the means of production, but only if we install safeguards to inhibit the unequal circulation of money.

\---------------

Overall, I agree with a lot of the complaints in this sub and I've listed a few below but I disagreed with some notions that seem to circulate frequently here as well and I wanted to challenge them. I'm coming from a place of sincerity and interest in internalizing the rationale of other viewpoints and having a healthy discussion - none of my friends can keep a cool head when discussing this stuff and so they aren't really interested in debating it. It's either ""rah rah capitalists are the devil incarnate"" or ""lol, lazy bums"".

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

I agree:

\- Without regulations, a majority of private for-profit businesses would exploit nearly everything they could to make more profit including people and the environment.

\- A fully free market with no restrictions (e.g. libertarian style), would could a lot of human suffering.

\- The inheritance of wealth is a major source of corruption and conflation of incentives.

\- There are basic human necessities that deserve additional protection from exploitation like food, housing, education, transportation, security, and sanitation. Perhaps even a government owned ""basic"" version that challenges private businesses with insane profit margins.

\- CEO / Executive pay is so stupidly high and not proportional.

\- People should not have to spend a majority of their waking hours in any given year just to live a safe and stable life.

Me: You wouldn't be if you knew what you were actually signing up for. But I can re-create the experience of working in an office, so  you'll know what to expect.

Niece: How?

Me: (I put a small table and a chair into a very small closet). Alrighty! Here's your laptop and next to it is a phonebook from 1986. (I open up an Excel spreadsheet for her) Great, now what I need you to do is just copy all the names, phone numbers, and addresses from this phonebook into this Excel spreadsheet. Think you can manage that? Great! And, FYI, you get a 30min lunch break, but you'll need to take it at 1pm because I'm going to need you to back up the receptionist and cover the phones from 12pm-1pm. Any questions?

Niece: Wait, okay, so how do you want me to format-

Me: Thanks! I'll be back to check on you in a few hours! (slams closet shut)

10 MINS LATER

(I open closet door to see her scrolling through Facebook on her phone)

Me: Can I see you in the conference room real quick? (we go to kitchen table) I'm not going to write you up, but we are paying you to work, okay? Not sit and look at your phone. I need workers, okay? You get 2 fifteen minutes breaks if you want to play on your phone.

Niece: Oh c'mon! In real life nobody act like-

Me: I'd hate - I'd hate to have to tell the temp agency that we had to fire you on your first day because you refused to work. Do I need to make a call today? Do I? Or can we agree that you should actually do the work we're paying you for? Great! Also, when I was at your desk earlier I noticed you didn't use any of the formatting in the spreadsheet that I explicitly told you to use when I went over this task with you.

Niece: Whoa! Waitaminute. You never-

Me: It's fine, it's fine! But next time...if you obviously don't know how to do something, just ask! If you had simply asked me, then you wouldn't need to stay late tonight to fix all the mistakes you made. Okay?

3172,I had the weirdest dream / nightmare last night.,"Basically it was found out that large scale companies like Amazon, Walmart, etc were making worker's lives as miserable as possible in order to cause depression, stress, and other health issues that stem from being over worked and working long hours.

I was one of the whistleblowers on this case and living in a remote bunker because of the high price put on my head.

The reason for doing this is, is because they were getting massive kickbacks from the drug companies that were enjoying record profits from sales of anti-depression, anti-anxiety, and a host of other medications. They were in turn using these kickbacks to supplement the wages of the workers, by as much as $10/hr in some instances.

This was also the reason why many of these companies paid such little taxes, they did not want a paper trail showing this.

The reason why healthcare was not made free is because they would lose this incentive.

Weed was made illegal for the longest time because they would lose out on profits if people had a natural substance to consume that would reduce stress. Smoking and drinking were perfectly legal because they would soon cause other health issues like lung cancer and liver disease and they would also make bank on sales of drugs to treat these ailments, especially chemotherapy drugs.",False,nvw6d1,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nvw6d1/i_had_the_weirdest_dream_nightmare_last_night/,13,1

3176,Can work-life balance entertain? (the dilemma behind why so much media glorifies awful workaholism),"I’m an active filmmaker and video producer—I love the form and the practice deeply. Yet I find myself frustrated at how most media glorifies work-worship, unbalanced lives, and workaholism.

Root to this is the tenet that anything that lacks conflict and struggle is boring. We want to see unbalanced people making herculean efforts. Well-adjusted, healthy people don’t make for good ratings.

(That’s why on American daytime TV you always see game show hosts prodding the contestant’s most triggering backstories and struggles—it’s almost like they get a bonus for every tear. But I digress.)

I’ve been trained to accept this as gospel, and honestly still believe it. But I’ve been trying to have an open mind and begin exploring what an “anti-work” school of film and TV can look like. Many works that would qualify already exist—the late 90s were an especially fertile time for movies with “slacker” heroes. But even those still stuck within the traditional hero struggles mightily construct.

Is it possible to create a totally new “anti-work” form and still have it be entertaining?

I joined r/antiwork because my country (the big, narcissistic 3 letter one that has all the nukes) has royally fucked up the definitions of words like ""job"", ""career"", and ""work ethic"". In my country, those words no longer fall within the realm of sanity. 

See, like 50% of the people in my country believe, whether subconsciously or consciously, that unless you dedicate every moment of your existence to some sort of ""grind"", you deserve suffering. 

I had a girlfriend once who I considered a relatively rational person, until she said this to me: ""if you have the option of working, but would rather choose not to, you deserve to be homeless"". And to me, that was a real eye-opener. 

My country has more than enough vacant houses to house every homeless person. We choose not to do it. 

We have the food and the money and the houses and the resources to make this country a ***fucking Utopia***, and every day we choose not to do it. And to me, that's disgusting. 

""Work culture"" in my country is so utterly mutated and fucked up that I do not, and will never support it.  

My country treats workers like slaves who whine about wages too much. My country views unemployed people as sub-human leeches who have to earn the right to stay alive every day. My country views billionaires as God's amongst men who deserve endless blowjobs and for us to all empty our wallets and shower them with our hard-earned money.

As you can imagine it sucks ass. But I have alot of time to think(no body can talk to each other over the noise.) And I've come to a conclusion. There are two main problems that make people, especially uneducated people ok with their shitty jobs. And why they are opposed to socialism( I live in the US by the way)

1. People think they Are middle class, but they are working class. They don't have a grasp on how much more money the middle class has. If you can't afford to take more than 100 hours of work off each year, you are NOT middle class. You are WORKING class. People in the middle class could lose their jobs and be financially alright for a bit, potentially a long time. Middle class people own a home, and can retire at a reasonable age. But many working class people  think that socialism wouldn't help them because they think they are ""the rich, or the middle class"". They feel that they will be crushed underneath massive taxes for something that won't benefit them.

2. People don't comprehend just how little money they actually make. For Example, I make $20 an hour, and that sounds pretty good at first glance. But then you have to take into consideration that I don't have dental. Or that I do such hard work that I have to eat about 4000 calories every work day. Or that I have to replace my work gloves every week. All this junk is expensive,  and is a direct result of my work. I have worked here for almost  a year, and I've managed to save up enough for a used car, a shitty one. After a whole year. Now let's take into consideration how the CEO works. Every friday he comes in for about 4 hours to ""check up"" on things. Last month, he upped our production quota by about 20%. My crew and I had to work overtime almost every day for that month, but we met our quota. And how does our CEO congratulate us? He gave us a one dollar raise, and a box of donuts. And  apparently I was the only one who realized that we did 20% more work, for a 5% raise.

3213,My insane manager,"Our manager keep saying she can't help she's understaffed when she won't go up front and get filled out applications. She would rather spend her time yelling at other workers for not doing it her way, Threatening to write me up every 20 minutes, or talking about her divorce. And when she does hire someone it's usually a 14 year old on their first job. She forgot to  do the order  about two times in a row. She'll ask you to do 10 things at one time when she's only doing one thing.  due to my mental disability I don't get things as quickly as other people. So she had to explain something more than once and she gets frustrated by that and said I had a stupid look on my face. 
Then there's what happened on Feb 4th 2021
There is a really bad snow storm and I couldn't come in cuz my driveway wasn't plowed. So I called in hey saying  I can't come in because I can't get out of my driveway. Manager ( let's call her P) said all that's fine I'll get someone else to cover your shift. She called me back saying I have to come and she's going to have her boyfriend pick me up. ( I'm not comfortable with that) She calls me again after I get out of the shower saying he's outside my house he wasn't outside my house I texted her don't ever lie to me again. Turns out her boyfriend got the wrong person. And at this time my mom (both my mom and dad work from home and I can't drive ) was downstairs and  we were almost at the door she was going to take me to work when P called saying you know what I'll cover your shift have a nice day off. 5 minutes after 12:00( I had to shift 12 to 8:00) she calls me someone's going to pick you up. I just felt like a toy being tugged at. Later that day,  someone up front text your P saying I wasn't making enough pizzas and I was berated over the phone. At this point I was exhausted and crying. By end of the shift she was trying to get on my good side.

3215,Today I learned that we subsidize rich people's donations to Ivy League universities,"(I think this counts as belonging in r/antiwork because these rich people don't have to work while in college while the rest of us have to juggle work with an education and make sacrifices while ALSO giving money to rich people.)

Just a fun little excerpt from Robert Reich's book ""Saving Capitalism"" (©2015).

""Private university endowments in 2014 totaled around $550 billion, centered in a handful of prestigious institutions. Harvard's endowment is more than $32 billion, followed by Yale at $20.8 billion, Stanford at $18.7 billion, and Princeton at $18.2 billion. (In 2013 Harvard launched a capital campaign for another $6.5 billion.) Because of the CHARITABLE TAX DEDUCTION, the amount of government subsidy to these institutions in the form of tax deductions is about one out of every $3 contributed. A few years back, Meg Whitman, now CEO of Hewlett-Packard, contributed $30 million to Princeton. In return she received a tax break estimated to be around $10 million. In effect, Princeton received $20 million from Whitman and $10 million from the US Treasury - that is, from you and me and other taxpayers who made up the difference. And in these endowments' exemptions from taxes on capital gains and on income they earn, the total government expenditure is even larger. Divide by the relatively small number of students attending these institutions, and the amount of subsidy per student is huge. The annual government subsidy to Princeton university, for example, is about $54,000 per student, according to an estimate by economist Richard Vetter. Other elite private universities aren't far behind.""


Oh sweet so rich people get to give rich institutions money that's tax deductable to give already rich families better educations so they can save money on college while the rest of us actually SUBSIDIZE their donations whilst simultaneously going into copious amounts of debt for our own educations. College should not be a scam but it might as well be.",False,nvcnjx,SigourneyWeinerLover,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nvcnjx/today_i_learned_that_we_subsidize_rich_peoples/,4,1

To be fair it was a fairly easy  job and I worked with/served some decent people. The area manager however was horrific. She came to our store once, saw a queue and just the one barista serving behind the bar. She went up to the other barista who was clearly on his lunch break and demanded he help out his colleague 'until the queue dies down, then you can go back to your break'. 

I found out about this and told my colleague he's legally entitled to a 20 minute uninterrupted break for every 6 hours work (UK law). Me and the rest of the staff decided to, once we sat down for our breaks, set a timer on our phone. If we were interrupted by either a customer (usually saying 'GO AND SERVE ARE YOU WORKING OR NOT?!?!') or the area manager, the timer reset. I also printed out numerous copies of the [gov.uk](https://gov.uk) policy on breaks at work for my colleagues to show whenever this happened.

First week working there they lifted the mask policy. I was a bit uncomfortable with this and I felt pressured into not wearing one. I decided to ditch the mask to fit into the culture. Slowly everyone around me started coughing and sneezing. Fast forward a few weeks later and now I’m extremely sick. I think that hating my job so much lowered my immunity and made me susceptible to catching whatever is going around. 

I’ve been thinking a lot lately and I can’t believe this is what you call life. You slave away, pop out a few kids, and then you die. The conversations and small talk I’ve had with the people I work with are utterly dull. You can tell they have no passion for anything, how can they when all they do is work? I can’t imagine spending a large percentage of my time working in front of a computer and basically throwing away my life doing something I hate. When I ask people if they love their job they say they do, what the actual f. I’m not sure if they’re serious or if they’re just telling me that because I’m new. They do pay reasonably large salaries but what’s the point if you don’t have to time to use it on experiences. Their bags are nice, their car is nice, but they’re a slave to their desk. 


To top it all off, they force social interactions and you have to go to outings during the weekend or else you’re not a “team player.” The event this past weekend lasted 9 hours. I was miserable... I typically use my weekends to recharge.

3243,I live on disability. I have to spend the income my government collects from other people in order to stay on disability. This is why I agree with anti-work.,"My total limit of money I can keep in the bank is $2000. Anything over that, *anything* and I risk losing qualification of being on disability. This has been my life for the past 8 years. I live in government approved housing. Which is a shithole. I don't own a car because I've never been able to afford one. Thankfully my city has some public transport and bike paths so I can ride my bicycle. 

I spend my days playing video games, listening to music, drawing, taking bike rides, and programming. I wake up and go to bed when I want to. This all sounds okay, except for the reason I'm on disability in the first place. Which is schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar type 2. 

There's more. 

For the longest time I thought I was just dealt a bad hand in life and wound up in my current situation because of my inability to keep a job. Well, as near as I can tell these days I *developed* the major characteristics of those mental disorders from being forced to work for most of my life. I'm 38. 

I do get Medicaid, Medicare, and food stamps. Last but not least is the constant reminder from the people who manage my case that I need to rejoin the workforce of a broken system that nearly drove me to suicide multiple times. I may not have to currently work, but it doesn't keep the voices out of my head, the feeling that I'm worthless, or fix capitalism.

I work roughly 10 hours a day, on my feet the entire time, from 8am to 6:30pm or whenever work is done (the latest I ever worked was 9pm). I purposefully picked this schedule so I could have more than a measly 2 days off; my husband works 3rd shift (hustling for that overnight differential) so the weekend is really the only time we get to see each other for more than a couple hours per day.


Every night is the same thing. He leaves for work, and no matter whether I try to relax or actually be productive I just cannot get to sleep. There's always one more thing I want to do, one more video I want to watch, one more distraction. Sometimes I'm just not tired. Next thing I know, it's after midnight, and when I wake up in the morning I feel like shit. It's even spilling into my weekends which wouldn't be too big of a deal except that I either wake up early anyway and feel awful, or I sleep so fucking late that I miss out on actually enjoying the time away from work. I'm breaking out, my appetite is all over the place, last night I got about 5 hours of sleep and had so much caffeine this morning that hours later, my left eye is twitching. And I know I should go to bed at a decent time tonight but I have shit to do! Or sometimes it'll take me months to do something because I feel like I don't have enough time to get it done so I never start!


I want out. My husband supports this idea as long as I'm doing something productive with my time and trying to make a little money but as someone who drank the Kool -aid for such a long time, the idea of working part time or on my own and bringing in less money than I make now straight-up gives me anxiety and so much guilt. We're also trying to start a family (I'm 35 and he's 37 so we're running out of time) so I'm even more terrified of the idea of us not having enough money.


I know I need therapy and have been trying to get started with it for months but keep running into issues. In the meantime though I'm slowly killing myself (really smart when you're trying to conceive /s) with stress and anxiety and guilt and sleep deprivation. I want to make a change but after working so hard for so long to get where we are now, I'm terrified of losing it. I don't know what to do.

3257,The ‘anti work’ movement helped me to land a job that I really enjoy and have dreamed of since I was little.,"I began my working career at 16 with a clothes store job. Since then I’ve worked solely in the service industry for minimum wage. I hated every minute.

When COVID hit I lost my job.

I took a hard turn into antiwork. I refused working for any restaurants or supermarkets or clothes stores.

But I needed money.

So while looking for a job, I found a listing for experienced floral designers.

Designing flowers is a hobby of mine, and I enjoy it.

The listing was posted right around Valentine’s day, so I didn’t get the job because they couldn’t train a rookie in Valentine’s Day madness.

But they gave me a job answering phones for them and taking orders. From home too! I didn’t even have to leave the house, and the pay was so good.

So after Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day, (the big flower holidays) they started training me as a florist! Today was my first day.

I got to spend all day playing with flowers, and 2 of my designs sold which means extra money. And they let me pick the music. I got paid to do arts and crafts all day while listening to my favorite songs.  

Because I was working in the back, I didn’t have to talk to a single customer. On top of that, I’m making good money. Way above min wage.

Thank you anti-work movement! You guys taught me my worth, encouraged me to get out of min wage hell, and now I get paid for my passion. Y’all rock, keep preaching.",False,nvib5x,TheNiceWriter,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nvib5x/the_anti_work_movement_helped_me_to_land_a_job/,0,1

Sorry if this isn't the right place to post, but i'm really going through an awful time lately and just growing bitter and bitter by the days.

Long story short, like a lot of people i had no childhood and no teenage years as i'm the child of immigrate parents and had it extremely rough for a long time, coupled with a divorce.

It took years of therapy and sheltering for me to grow back and feel better, and these last 2 years i finally managed to get a driver's license, a car and a degree all by myself.

But now i'm terrified, i never worked before, i didn't ever have time to relax and now i'm told i basically have to wake up every morning to go to some desk job doing computer work (web dev, front end) and spend my life like that. I don't want that, i'm not completely closed minded when it comes to work, but my country is very against working from home even for tech related work and they're super late when it comes to technology.

I'm alone and on borrowed time, as i don't have a paycheck and living from social funds, i might soon get evicted and lose everything, but frankly the thought of losing everything is somehow sweeter than getting locked in a job hell for survival. I'm trying to find works from home anywhere outside of my country, even perhaps move someday, but having never worked is immensely hard as i don't have the right habits.

I need avice, anything, i'm scared to death and i'm not feeling good at all.

3283,What is the solution? Can you help me?,"Hello friends. I feel same way as most of you. Let me explain my thoughts.

I just end my studies on the university and confront the real world.

I had worked on the past on two diferret works for 3 or 4 months some years and hated it.

I don't hate the fact of doing something that requires effort, I like that. I hate the fact that other person gives me orders, that you have to spend most of the day doing it, the fact that you have to put a mask and act on a certain way in order to don't lose the job, the fact that It doesn't  compensate due to inflation, the fact that the government that we know that is corrupt win money due to the taxes that I pay. It kills me inside.

I'm already searching for jobs and here in Europe the things are so bad, normal salary is 1.000€/month. My fathers generation used to win 1.500€-3.000€ on normal jobs. And 1.000€ 40 years ago was able to buy a lot of things but today due to inflation, those same 1.000€in the past  represent 800€ today


My question is. What can we do? How do I scape having to suffer these for the rest of my life?

I don't consider ceating my own business as a valid option because the huge majority of them fail and it is a lost of time, money and energy. 

What can I do friends? How do I avoid these? My environment push me to find a job and they look at me in a bad way. You probably feel the same, people thinks that you are weird because you hate the way these system works and don't want to be part of it

I discovered this thread tonight and just knowing that I'm not alone in my feelings of impotence and hopelessness is one hell of a boon.

I started reading the various memes, posts and screenshots and noticed a predominant theme that reminds me emotionally and powerfully of [the scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBoWtV2bAJM) from A Christmas Carol:

&gt;""It is more than
usually desirable that we should make some slight
provision for the Poor and Destitute, who suffer
greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in
want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands
are in want of common comforts, sir.""

&gt;""Are there no prisons?"" asked Scrooge.

&gt;""Plenty of prisons,"" said the gentleman, laying down
the pen again

&gt;""And the Union workhouses?"" demanded Scrooge. ""Are they still in operation?""

&gt;""They are. Still..."" returned the gentleman, ""I wish I could say they were not.""

&gt;""The [Treadmill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al-30Z-aH8M) and the [Poor Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Poor_Laws#New_Poor_La) are in full vigour,
then?"" said Scrooge.

&gt;""Both very busy, sir.""

&gt;""Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first,
that something had occurred to stop them in their
useful course,"" said Scrooge. `I'm very glad to
hear it.""

&gt;""Under the impression that they scarcely furnish
Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,""
returned the gentleman, ""a few of us are endeavouring
to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink.
and means of warmth. We choose this time, because
it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,
and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down
for?""

&gt;""Nothing."" Scrooge replied.

&gt;""You wish to be anonymous?""

&gt;""I wish to be left alone,"" said Scrooge. ""Since you
ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.
I don't make merry myself at Christmas and I can't
afford to make idle people merry. I help to support 
the establishments I have mentioned -- they cost
enough; and those who are badly off must go there.""

&gt;""Many can't go there; and many would rather die.""

&gt;""If they would rather die,"" said Scrooge, ""they had
better do it, and decrease the surplus population!""

I've felt the same exhausted resignation that many of you have expressed...that death would feel preferable to throwing your entire life away for the pittance you need to survive.

The callous, heartless nature that Scrooge represents suggesting that death is the thing prescribed of us ""idle people"" is no longer as shocking as it used to feel to me, but merely the status quo. The fact that human life and dignity comes second if at all after the thought of maximized profits.

3302,My job is driving me toward a mental break.,"I am a 21 year old recent graduate working at a company that vaguely intersects with my degree.

When I first started here, I loved it, I was getting good pay, having a positive impact on the environment, and creating good connections with my coworkers. Over the past 11 months however, the company has shifted further and further away from caring about its employees and more toward cutting excess and increasing profit.

For example, 11 months ago we had a shift lead AND 7 other workers on our team, totaling 8 for our division. Today, with an even larger workload and greater responsibilities than when I started, we have only 5 team members and no shift lead, as we are now directly managed by the CEO (whose favorite word is “efficiency”).

The work itself is my biggest gripe. It is hard, mind-numbingly repetitive physical labor. I’m talking repeating the same 5 tasks thousands of times a week, and with fewer and fewer team members, more and more work is put upon the individual. I struggle with jobs that I do not feel I am learning and gaining experience in. Within the first week of work I had exhausted all available wisdom.

The only things keeping me tethered to this position are the pay (a little over 2x the minimum wage in my state (which isn’t saying much)) and the fact that it has been practically impossible for me to find an entry level position that I am passionate about without “2-3 years of experience.”

However I have a lot of vacation time accumulated and I would not be eligible for it to be paid out. (I checked the policy). Do you think I should change my request and just request the July 19-30 as vacation instead?  If so, when should I give my notice.

3308,Corporations buying small businesses,"Hi guys, I just wanted to rant. I am annoyed with big businesses buying out smal mom and pop businesses and then ruining the culture and paying less money! Anyone go through this at their companies? Here are a couple examples. I work in information technology by the way.

At my last job I was the first hire after a large merger with a new company. According to my coworkers, before the merger, the company culture was alot more fun and there were a lot of office parties and giveaways and food and stuff. I disclosed my salary after awhile and found out my coworkers all made 20-30K more then me because they were hired under the old company. I felt sad.. like I got in at the wrong time...

I now just interviewed at a company. Their Glassdoor looked great. Everyone said great culture and the owners care. On the phone interview I find out they just merged ! So I look on glassdoor at the NEW company name and same exact shady thing! They pay less  (13-17 an hour instead of 19-21), make everyone work overtime now since the merge, NO MORE PARTIES, and managers are mean and suck.  I now feel like I don't want to even continue with the interview process maybe...

I think it's mostly for people who are actually employed but honestly... ""anitwork"" so...

\----

This got really long but I don't care. I poured my heart and soul into it. Now I know I needed to do this.

\---

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't want to get a job.

I'm going 31 (American age) this year and I was never once employed in my life.

Am I unskilled? Do I need to try harder? Is it because I've never presented myself well enough? I wouldn't know. Because I've never ever once in my lifetime submitted a resume to a company. Not once.

Oh you say I must be a loser who can't even approach the gates (of hell). Bit of a backstory, I'm Korean. Literally Korean - I lived in the states for only about four years-ish.

You know that Asian stereotype about how we're all hardworking, diligent, and disciplined? Well I passed a presitigious school in junior high, dropped out. Got submitted to a nationally renown high school, dropped out again. I thought maybe the US might be different, so I went to a Catholic school. Nope. Dropped out. People keep telling me it's a miracle that I got into one of the best universities in Korea as a high school dropout, especially in Korea. Guess what. Dropped out.

Didn't my family tried to kill me? Sometimes I wish they did. Sometimes I wish they were actually pure evil. Then I could've just not given a shit about what they wanted: good grades, good employment, good wife, etc etc. (I'm gay also. That really didn't help, especially not here.) Maybe then I could've just exploded and ended it all, suicide or murder or whatnot. What happened to me is not a result of a rebellion or a prodigy gone wrong. It's just a result of the elements of life pulling me in all directions, giving me conflicting messages, all just to make me a very productive and useful asset to society.

Thing is... I just don't get it.

Ever since a child I've been taught, especially from the US side mind you (in many ways, you're worse),  that I will eventually find my bliss. Do what you want to do. Find something that you can do for the rest of your life that you can enjoy, and you wouldn't have to work a single day. Huh. That's nice in theory. You know what, call me stupid, but I still want to believe in it. It's that bad.

And THEN from the Korean side, you constantly hear the exact opposite message. Oh you already know. The Asian stereotype. Get beaten for low grades. Get scolded for math... I was really lucky, I was already really good at Math and English. I also have a mother who only used to beat me as a kid (and then got scared of me later) and just really wants me to live that Asian dream life. Doctor. Lawyer. Well paying job. Traditional family. Yeah I know that she really actually does love me. But sometimes I really wish she didn't.

I hate both of you.

There's one thing you don't know about Asians. We complain the SHIT out of life. I mean, sure, it's obvious when you think about it, why would we not when we're expected to work and act like slaves? But you don't hear that one often do you? Koreans. Always working hard, always diligent, alwyas silent and docile. As if. We shit about our co-workers, our employees, our employers, our ""work ethic"", our hideous work hours (9-5 ? more like 9-11), and have the lowest work efficiency among all OECD countries.

I've just heard so many horror stories. So many. I'm not gatekeeping on Korea, please don't think that, I don't think the US is any better. But it's not about that. Ever since I was a kid I did not see the reason to get a well paying job. I'm not gonna marry, you don't even allow gay marriage. I'm not going to have children, I CAN'T and I WON'T. I don't even want a lot of materials in my life, I happily lived in a single room for 2 years just fine. All I need are my internet, music, and games.

For WHAT would I have to work 9-11s ????

You're not even a GOOD society. You're capitalist for crying out loud. You're all about stuff I don't believe in, expensive cars, expensive food, expensive furniture, ridiculous fashion police, sure I do like a good looking house now and then but NOT 9-11 FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE WORTH GOOD. (Not even 9-5). You can sacrifice a LOT of that to help people but you DON'T. I don't care what you call me, your opinions do not matter in the slightest, you're EVIL, why would I have to work just to satisfy the bellies of people like you???

I DON'T understand guys. I just DON'T.

I DON'T want to get a job. My mom is like near literally dying for me to get a job but I just DON'T get it. I love you mom I really do but I will NOT sacrifice my life for... you. She says it's for my own good... lol... what are you even worrying about?? I already told you I WON'T marry (she doesn't believe in it still) I don't NEED a palace or a family or a fashion wardrobe and I don't even have a refined palette. I have other way urgent needs and wants and they all have extremely loose connection to money, some of them none. WHY? I mean why? Seriously why.

Why do I need to get a job.

Oh you think I'm LAZY huh? You think I don't ""like"" work. Well tell me, how many lazy people worked on their own game engine? How many lazy people has put in so much numerous hours into perfecting his skills on programming, composing, and art? When I do what I want to do, making what I want to make, whenever and however I like it, using whatever I method I choose to do, THEN SUPRISE!! I DO IT!! How many can say they work 60 hours a week without any superior telling them to? I even exercise 5 days a week BECAUSE I CHOSE TO. HOW MANY LAZY PEOPLE PULL THAT OFF?? TELL ME!!

I am NOT going to be a corporate slave.

I dropped out of college to make games. I made a complete U-turn with my ""career"" focusing on doing only what I want to do. As you can tell I haven't been successful yet but I don't care. I'm still studying in so many areas. I'm still making games in the ""most inefficient way possible"" like I fucking care. Mom has been begging me, coaxing me, even threatening me since then to use my new skills to at least submit a resume somewhere. Well mom, 1. I made a complete U-turn, remember, I'm still not that good enough 2. I don't really know about the US but Korea really has some really stupid thing against hiring people over the age of 30 without a career (I mean way to go, like I care), and 3. I DON'T. WANT. TO. GET. A. CORPORATE. JOB.

Everytime I work on something I want, I work. Everytime I slightly give into their nasty idiotic mindset of ""needing a job because your neck depends on it (no it doesn't)"" and work on something I don't want that can ""build my portfolio"", I just CAN'T do anything.

I sound like I'm one of those guys who have my own dreams and will follow it no matter what. It's not like that. When I make games, I'm not doing what I love. I do what I hate the least. I actually have another path I love more than making games or even playing games. It just doesn't pay, it's not even a job. (Bliss, yeah right). It's just that when I make games, I actually hate myself the least. In most days, I actually feel neutral about it, a lot of times I'm even proud of it. When I listen to songs I've written or pictures I've painted or even mini games or modules I've made over the years, I'm proud. Yes, that work pride thing is not totally a myth. It does exist in reasonable amounts.

I will throw what's left of all of that and more away when I get a job. I just know I will.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is it like this, why? And why don't people see it? I just don't understand guys. I just don't. I've been actually made to feel guilty about not working and not earning money and not contributing to the economy which has very little of what I want in return in the first place. Why is everyone so materialistic, and most of all, why do I have to be the shunned and abnormal one because of your greed and indecency to humanity?

Why can't I just be left alone to work on what I want in peace? Why do I constantly feel like I have to give into this idea of getting a job and ""building a stupid portfolio"" when I absolutely don't want and don't need it? The only plus side of me getting a job is to earn my money and get the hell out of this nagging place. So it's not a complete null option even now. But that is such... such a dumb reason. Such a dumb fucking reason... just moving from one stupid prison to the next.

3312,"I don't care about being ""productive"". I want to relax, learn about the world and go on walks for the rest of my life.","I've been suffering from stress for years now. Modern life sure has its comforts, but it also comes filled with neuroticism, slavery, and gaslighting. The best experiences I've had were escaping into fantasy, being on my own, working on personal projects. I could easily live 500 years if I had the freedom to just ""be"", sort to speak, and experience the world without the compulsion to slave for others, study, and stress constantly, and submit to the will of whatever authority that comes around.

This pandemic has shown me that getting to even a bearable state of existence is very hard. The pressure never ends, and I'm not sure it's even possible for us millennials to reliably get a ""chill existence"" at all, it feels like a continuous grind, striving for more, getting more certifications, better grades, appearing more social, hiding your introvert personality. For a while now I've been thinking that I hated existence and consciousness, but in the end, I just hate the way society is structured, and how I don't ever seem to fit. I remember a time when I was happy with a simple videogame or a novel. Now I can´t find the will to even play with my friends. Anhedonia. I keep asking myself ""why?"" all the time. I don´t feel like myself, just a corpse going through the motions, waiting for a chance to breathe again.

Why is society like this? We have all this technology, all of this knowledge, and still, we exploit each other, still, our quality of life goes down, still, we pollute our planet, the only place known to harbor life and sentience. We are so disconnected from everything it makes me cry. What could be a life of adventure turns out to be a life of worrying about an abstraction such as money. What could be a motivated, creative person turns out to be an alienated soul, forever escaping. Instead of communities, we have cliques, competition, hatred, resentment. This is not a society in which I would be willing to participate, but sadly I never consented to any of this. I just reproduce the same sickening tendencies on my own, and I´m too afraid to ever revolt or go and live a life of adventure.

Yeah, I´m venting. I think many of you will be tired to hear these stories, but they are a tool, a map to analyze the spiritual collapse of our world. The complete lack of purpose, the ways in which we can(not) deal with capitalism.

3314,How do you figure out what long-term career you want when you don't want to work and would rather die?,"I have no actual work experience, dropped out of University like 2 months ago with depression from emotional baggage that I had for years, having zero motivation or passion for what I was studying, gave up after the first week and attended nothing, felt suicidal in every lecture and practical room. Medication has helped me so much and i'm getting my life back together.

I only care about having a social life, looking good and trying to make it big doing something unrealistic. I just want to have fun. Work and school makes me think about how pointless life is and makes me want to die.  By fun I mean going out, partying, drugs, drinking, sex, smoking weed, going on holiday with friends and just enjoying my youth while I have it.

I work with my parents in their store 7 days a week. The shop is open from 7am-9pm.  They financially support me and pay me for helping them, but life fucking sucks. I look at them and think to myself 'god I'd rather die than live like them'. They have no lives, it's just full-time work. Then they criticise me and say they're worried about me because i'm NEETing and I have no plan other than vague ideas like becoming an electrician which I don't even want to do, or being a chef when I can't even cook.

I look at the people who come into the shop and all they do is complain about how they hate work and their lives. Middle aged people buying alcohol and cigarettes to cope with the realities of life.

I've even gone as far to set a deadline on my life to the age of 30. I'm 19 now. There's no way I see myself working a 9-5 for the rest of my life, that sounds like death.

Unless i'm famous and rich doing something I love, fuck this shitty system.

Why would I want to go back to uni for 3-years for a useless degree? Then have to do further study for a masters or phd because a bachelor's isn't enough. Have an endless CV of entry level jobs with shitty employers. Internships, part-time jobs, volunteering? What's the point in all this?

Am I crazy for wanting to die? School made me suicidal enough. My mind wanders when I stare at a piece of school work and thinks of death repeatedly. I feel like depression is just a normal response to existing in this world.  Not living, because we're not actually living. We're just surviving.

Which brings me back to my question.

3323,I hate society," You know what drives me absolutely nuts?

**The fact that society is always desperately trying to be one-size-fits-all.**

When Covid-19 came, remote work became the norm at plenty of places. I liked that, but many people didn't. When the whole Covid-19 thing is going to end, they're gonna demand that everyone return to the office - and I don't want to.

Why can't society cater to both?

Or even worse: consumerism. 

* First of all, I reckon that we already live in a post-scarcity world, and are merely pretending that we don't. 
* Second of all, I also reckon that we already have the technology to replace most human labour, but there's a big conspiracy to keep us all working *(David Graeber said so too)*.  
* But third of all.... why can't people just chill and enjoy what they have? Why does everyone need a new car, mobile phone, etc.? Why can't we just chill?

Most people want to be rich to be able to afford a villa or an expensive car. Not me. I wanna be rich just to buy my freedom from work. To retire. To have just enough to get by without being forced to be a wageslave.

most people are working at tasks which they hate so
that they can make enough money to stop doing it

to do that. Because what you get with work done in
this way, done heartless and without joy, is money.
And what can you do with it? Supposing you do earn
time to spare and money to spend, what is there to
buy with it? The answer is the other face and joylessly
products made by other people who hate their work.

To there is a certain holiness, a certain lack of
essential quality in almost all the work that we
perform, because the work is done not for the work,
but for money. And play is considered something
separate from work. Work is serious, play is not
serious. In fact, we have a strange incapacity to play

3362,Looking for a quote that exemplifies the spirit of r/antiwork,"Good day r/antiwork!

**I’m looking for a quote that exemplifies some of the spirit of this subreddit.** I’ve been lurking for a long time and the things posted here really resonate with me, but I haven’t done much reading of the theory or philosophy that informs this community.

I work in a large organization and I’ll soon be taking over a team of about 100 employees, a mix of project managers, scientists, admin personnel, etc. As part of my onboarding into the job, I’ll be making a statement; an introduction to the group and I’m trying to find the right words. Essentially my personal ethos concerning work could be summarized as the following somewhat overlapping concepts:

* Mental health is my top priority; this is realized here through organizational culture and the resulting work/life balance (our organization doesn’t really have a “profit” motivation due to the structure and nature of the organization, so this can actually be true).
* Effective work (not necessarily “hard” work) is personally appreciated, and appreciated by your peers, but nothing we’re doing here comes close in importance to your personal well-being, your personal fulfillment, and the well-being of your family &amp; friends.
* Working here is a means to an end (the end being your personal fulfillment either on your own time – or here if you genuinely find fulfillment in your work).

This sentiment needs to be a balancing act between:

* People more like myself, to whom I want to message: “don’t sweat your work; come in, do your best (whatever that is, depending upon the current context of your life), and go home to enjoy your life; don’t let this job negatively affect the important parts of life”; and
* People a little more indoctrinated by the system, to whom I’d like to maintain: “your hard work is noticed, valued, effective towards the organization’s goals, and personally appreciated”.

**Any direct quotes or reading material suggestions would be greatly appreciated.** And if the above makes me appear as a fully indoctrinated, Stockholm syndrome boot-licker, *I’m sure Reddit will let me know.*",False,nufomh,--FeRing--,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nufomh/looking_for_a_quote_that_exemplifies_the_spirit/,6,1

3364,How do I find work I actually enjoy?,"I left my job a year ago mostly due to mental health issues but also due to covid, I was in healthcare; didn't want to deal with that on top of the mental health stuff. I moved back in with my mom as I didn't have any other options. I've been trying to find a new job but every time I look the dread of having to get up for work every day creeps back in, and I give up. I've left every job I've had because of mental health, getting to the point where I feel like it's a choice between quitting and suicide. Thankfully I've been able to choose quitting every time so far.

I just don't really know how to go about finding work that I might enjoy, especially because it's impossible to try certain jobs (requiring certain amounts of education/experience/etc) to see if I would like them. Like, maybe I would absolutely love being a pilot, or UI/UX designer, or physical therapist, or whatever. But how do I find out without first going through all the necessary schooling/certifications/etc and working in the field for at least a month or two? I know at a certain point I just need to pick something and try it but I find the decision incredibly debilitating.  I do have some hobbies that might translate into work if I really try, but I'm worried if I do these things for work I'll come to hate them just like every other job. 

 I know a lot of this can be traced to having depression and the resultant anhedonia, but I'm at a loss for how to overcome it. I've been dealing with depression/dysthymia for more than a decade at this point, so it's hard to remember what it's like not to deal with it. And now I'm starting to feel like a failure for not being able to figure this out and relying on my mom for support, and not feeling like an ""adult"", which obviously isn't helping anything lol. So yeah, I just feel stuck and don't really know what to do about it.  Any advice would be welcome.

3365,The one thing I hate about work,"It's the constant need for 'infinite growth' and I absolutely detest it. 

My boss is never happy just coasting or doing slightly better. It always has to be way better than last month or last year. And if it isn't, does he need to send me back to training, is there something wrong with my strategy, do they need to hire other people, do they need to outsource my job to someone else? It does nothing but stress me out.

After a successful hard working month where we smash our targets, sometimes I just want to chill. Maybe sometimes I do want to coast along and had an easy month. Because I can't run on permanent infinite growth mode. 

When I first started this job 3 years ago I was so determined to change and improve things. And I did and it's better than ever. But as soon as you improve things your boss constantly demands better. And once you've exhausted it you feel like you have nothing left.

I've lost all passion for this particular sector because I gave it my all, improved things drastically and now he just wants it to keep going up and up. 

It's starting to dawn on me that maybe 3 years is enough time to be at a company. You come in, make a big difference, then leave after it starts to stagnate because you can't work on permanent infinite growth mode.",False,nu8rmm,SnooMuffin,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nu8rmm/the_one_thing_i_hate_about_work/,25,1

3367,My (ex) restaurant finally offered to pay its employees to work,"Worked at a restaurant for the last few months that was steadily getting worse. 

Employees kept leaving and so they just scheduled us more and more to pick up the slack with no raises, while simultaneously cutting back our sections and blocking off tables. Schedules would go out the Saturday before, and weren’t ever consistent. 

In three months I went from working 35 hours a week to working 50+ hours a week and making the same amount of money. Constant back to back 12 hour closing doubles. I spent more time there than at home. 

Terrible customers, corporate management, pretty underwhelming money. 

Found a better job with more than double the starting pay ($2.15/H to $5/H) and they give raises after three months. 

Let the old restaurant know I’d be leaving after my scheduled week, not after two weeks. 

They had me scheduled four closing doubles in a row and so on the fourth I just called off to give myself an extra day before starting at the new job. Would’ve worked 48 hours in 4 days if I hadn’t. My life and mental health are more valuable than some job. 

Manager said someone else had already called off so they only had one server and one bartender for the morning and at night they only had one server no bartender and begged me to come in but I said no. 

Got an email saying they were offering cash to come in and work. 

I was shocked, they’re finally willing to pay employees to work for them like what a fucking concept. 

Best part is I gave them a chance to keep me when I asked for a company wide raise and they said that it wouldn’t happen, so I left. I’ll bet they’re considering it now and it’s about fucking time. 

I’m ready to see restaurants either pay their employees or die trying to hold on to the old way.",False,nugfkv,MistrWintr,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nugfkv/my_ex_restaurant_finally_offered_to_pay_its/,3,1

3370,sTiMuLuS cHeCkS pAiD wEeKLy,"I was the manager of this place for a whopping week. Was hired by the owner &amp; asking for my rent to be 1/4th of my income. This place is only a few blocks away from where I live, has been in business for 40 years, and wanted me 6 days/wk 10 hours/day for at least a year. Owner said we'd start at $16/hr and go from there after ""training."" Training consisted of working whatever position, usually hosting or bussing, was understaffed that day. 

The menu was a wreck- things not in sequential order (7, 14, 22, 8, etc for item numbers). He had one register in the back the waiters used that had to be at least as old as me (over 30), and an antique register up front that didn't actually work but we kept cash in it. I could go on and on about how many things were wrong with the place. Basically the guy had been profitable for the last 40 years and put nothing back into the business. The day shift manager (I was to be the evening manager) was more concerned about me learning to cover for her than me learning how to run the place for the shift I was going to be in charge of.

I asked towards the end of my first week if he had brought on any staff for the evening shift. ""No one wants to work because they're making too much on unemployment!!!"" Oh, it's like that. That Saturday he shows up with a $250k classic car in show-ready condition. I hear ""oh, that's just one of his, he's got a whole collection! You should see the same car he has in blue...""

So the beginning of my second week I ask him if he had figured if he'd be able to pay me what I was asking. ""No, I haven't been able to figure out what your real pay will be yet, we're just not making enough money..."" while the place is packed daily. So I walked out and told him to call me when he knew what he could pay me.

Of course I never heard back. Needless to say, I absolutely LOVED it when I saw these signs out a couple weeks ago. I thought y'all would appreciate the laugh. Stimulus checks paid weekly... first of all pay is biweekly, second of all, my check for one week was nowhere near what my check on unemployment was! Get real. Hope his place goes under.

Knowing I only have a few days left at this job makes me feel so much better! 

Unfortunately, not everyone looks at it the same way as I do: my parents and some friends are upset or don't understand my decision, even when I tell them I was so burnout it was already affecting my mental health: ""this is what life is"" or ""you're going to find the same problems in every single job"" are the most common answers I've gotten.

I get so pissed out with this thinking. NO, it is not OK to have suicidal thoughts because of work pressure; it is not OK to work extra hours without being paid; and it is not OK to accept that working +40h in a job that, at best, you don't hate is the only possible life we can live.

3388,"When it comes to workdays, ADD feels like my worst enemy.","Might be a better fit for r/ADHD but basically I work part time (Early morning to early afternoon) from home doing tech support. Basic help desk stuff. 

On paper, and for people from the outside looking in, I have everything I need and more to do that and stay on top of my hobbies. 

On weekends I feel I have more than enough energy and time to do all that. But on workdays (basically Mon-Fri every week) I feel like I have no energy at all.  

For months I’ve been in this cycle where all I do is wake up, work while slacking off, then once work is done jack around doing nothing “productive” for hours until I go to bed and do it all again. 

Repeat for 5 days a week and that’s basically my life. No breaks cause again, part time. 

As the title suggests, I have ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder). 

Long story short, I get easily distracted and put the “pro” in procrastination. And I’m not a “self-motivated” type of person. And god help me if I have to do something I don’t like nor do I feel has any real benefit to me personally. 

Having to do the same calls every day where I might as well be a robot sometimes, it’s exhausting. And you can answer every damn call til the moon comes up and the boss will demand you go faster. 

And I have yet to find any concrete solution other than “make time” (which can easily be dismissed as toxic positivity bullshit bosses give to justify whatever they’re doing.) and doing stuff that only amounts to “just don’t have ADD bro.” 

With all this hustle bullshit, sometimes I wonder if in a way, I’m doing it to myself by expecting to be good at everything right now. At least enough to free me from work. But the older I get the more I feel it’s just a pipe dream. 

I’m almost 20 but too much time has passed with too little skill gained. I’ve only played guitar seriously for only a few years. And everything else I’m just a casual novice. Never even started drawing even if I thought about being a comic book artist to make my own stories. 

Not only that, I feel my attitude towards my hobbies (most anyway) have slightly changed. When I was younger, I saw them as a way to break out of corporate wage slavery and live life the way I want to. Be like those rich and famous celebrities you see on TV. 

But the older I got the more I realized that most celebrities are rich, out of touch assholes who just don’t give a flying fuck about people like me. Their whole job is to pretend that they do. 

I also came to realize that while there is nothing really stopping me from getting good at the hobbies themselves, I would not survive the insane politics and drama that goes on behind the scenes, so to speak. Even as a regular person, I don’t give a shit about that drama and couldn’t tell you what so-and-so did even if you held a gun to my head. 

Lastly, I think turning my hobbies into a job would just make it a job. Where I would be miserable, depressed, and chasing something else. I would be in a position no different than the one I am in now. Which makes turning a hobby into a career all the more difficult. 

It’s late at night and I’m sorry if this rant/ramble didn’t make sense. I just want to get out of the cycle. I want to live my life but feel that even in the least terrible conditions, work just takes everything from me, all cause of the way my broken brain was made.",False,nuwfys,912123123,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nuwfys/when_it_comes_to_workdays_add_feels_like_my_worst/,2,1

I'm worried about disappointing him, as dumb as that sounds. He's very ""Old School"" and I don't think he's missed a day of work in his life. I have a lot of things in my life that are neglected due to having no energy left to attend to them. Financially I could swing being part-time. 

I know my boss wants to ramp up the amount of work we do. It's very physical work and I'm the ""field guy"" meaning I'm always with another person doing outdoor work. When I'm not there, they simply don't go in the field. My boss is talking about running 2 crews. So my desire to go down to 3 days is in direct opposition of where he wants to go. Everyone I work with is older and completely burned out. They also give you endless shit for missing work. I called out today because I just can't do it, and I've stopped caring about the shit I'll get. 

I have very little family left and I don't want to regret not spending quality time with my father. I own a house and my yard, roof and other things need mending. Maybe I could simply tell him that's why I need to go part-time?

If you guys actually want some financial advice, I’ll give it to you.

1.	⁠⁠Work nights. Night shift is often way more relaxed and chill than day shift, and is always understaffed, meaning the employer is forced to pay a much higher amount to night employees than day employees. My last job paid literally double the pay rate of day workers to incentivize people to work nights.
2.	⁠⁠Work weekends. Let’s be real you don’t have plans on the weekend anyway. And as I mentioned before, there aren’t as many people willing to work weekends, so employers who want that will pay more.
3.	⁠⁠Do overtime. I don’t know if it’s the law, but every employer I’ve seen pays time and a half for overtime, which really starts to add up if you pull like 10 hours over 40 per week. Very valuable.
4.	⁠⁠Don’t buy shit you don’t need. Save money each week. Pretty self explanatory.

3403,Just about given up with my job. Need to search my options.,"Yesterday I had the worst experience with my fast food job I had for a year and a half now. Sundays already run on a skeleton crew, but on that one we had 2 call offs that night. When the night manager comes in she's complaining about headaches, a pain reaching from her chest to arm, an eye feeling like it was drooping, and she couldn't lift her arm without feeling out of breath. These are all stroke symptoms so I urged her to get an ambulance. She eventually left and I'm still not sure if she went to the hospital. 

So now we only have 3 people and no manager. They should have closed the store right then and there as we were way too shorthanded to run the store on our own, but instead of doing that, our franchise manager told us to lock the doors and that we can close the store an hour early. We had to shut the food station down and only ran drinks, with the 3 of us scrambling the store to get orders done. This was fine for maybe an hour. Then cars starting taking ten minutes to get through the drive thru. I reached my breaking point when the people at the window started laughing at us. I asked what was so funny, they said they're still waiting for their drinks. I stop what I'm doing and find one of the drinks, so I hand it out. I failed to realize the lid was only halfway on and they pointed it out. I explained how we are very short staffed at the moment and that we are all fucking stressed out. I was so stressed I was accidentally using curse words to customers and sounded incoherent. They were obviously unsympathetic and probably thought I was on drugs. 

On the verge of a mental breakdown, I walked to the back, screamed a bit in the walk in cooler, and put my fiance on the phone to vent about the situation. As I'm sitting in the office, the store phone rang. It was one of the customers in the drive thru asking what was taking so long to get through. I explained how we were very short staffed and how they refused to let us close the store or even send a manager to help, then suggested she should go to our sister location. She said someone should call our corporate center to complain about it, and I told her not to worry, that I was going to call myself (which I still plan on doing).

Eventually the girls working that night yelled for me and said I need to come back to help them. I tried to explain that if I went back to working that line I would have a nervous breakdown, and that if they can't run the line without me we should close the store now. They were unsympathetic, one of them saying the lines ""It doesn't matter, its your job"" more times than I could count, and I'm still having trouble deciphering it. How does my mental health not matter? How can this be worth it? When tensions rise and she demands I come back up front I explode in her face. She ended up calling a bunch of people, telling them I refuse to work under the current conditions. One of them was a shift leader who threatened to kick my ass if I left. I'm still not sure what to do about a blatant threat like that. Another was the GM's wife since he was busy at the time taking a shower. Apparently he said if that I don't keep working and stay an hour after my schedule to help close I would be fired. I had no choice but to keep working or lose the one source of income I had. 

This is probably what messed me up the most. The GM is usually a nice guy and we have had a positive relationship since I started working. I feel betrayed above all else. Forcing me to stay an hour late was unethical, and I'm still trying to figure out if he's even allowed to do that. Now I plan on calling sick on my next workday, but now I'm scared he will use that as a reason to fire me. I am ready to leave this hellhole once I get another job lined up, but not before. And I really don't want to have to go in quite yet.

Their sole existance is a catastrophe for the environment, so? But what's worst is that what they do is just greenwashing. It's just bla bla and they don't do anything actively for the environment. They will do things that save them money, at most. Using less electricity, sending less e-mails (saves work hours and salary), cutting company cars,...

3417,Wanting a new job,"Hi guys,
Currently called in sick and feeling guilty because I did a month ago, too. Planning on probably going in later but definitely having a crisis right now. I really hate my job. And I hated my last one too (same field). Lately I’ve been thinking I’d prefer something that is work-from-home so I don’t have to deal with the public. I currently work four days a week and I love it. I can’t imagine working five days a week. And to be frank I really want to work three if possible. Thankfully my boyfriend helps provide a little more income than I do, so I have a little bit of wiggle room with my income but not much. I have a lot of experience in my current field so I make decent money. The problem is I want to at least try something new (I’ve only had two different types of jobs in my past and hated both of them). I can’t try something new without taking a huge pay cut though. I just feel extremely stuck and unhappy as most of us do. I’m so happy and carefree on the weekends, and feel genuinely happy about life but as soon as Sunday afternoon comes, I go into a deep depression. Usually I can push through the week but lately every week just feels longer and longer and more unbearable than the last. 
This rant has been extremely all over the place but the BOTTOM LINE is: do people who have worked in an office and from home prefer working from home? Does anyone know of any work from home positions that pay decently and allow a flexible schedule? (I know, very unrealistic question). I’m just trying to figure out where to go from here and am so scared of taking risks. But every day I want to walk out on my current job but can’t because I need the money.",False,nuhdwn,linksslut,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nuhdwn/wanting_a_new_job/,1,1

3421,This sub gives me hope,"On paper I don’t have much to complain about as an individual because I’m not struggling for money and I know many are in a much worse position.

But gradually it has become crystal clear to me how pointless my job is. I help make rich people even richer and it disgusts me. I’m an industry where working long hours is an accepted ritual and corporate politics dominate. 

To be honest sometimes I feel so alone when I think about these things but coming here and seeing so many relatable comments from strangers is oddly reassuring. For a long time I felt like something was wrong with me or that I’m just massively lazy. Yet I think most people are only lazy to the extent that the outcome of their job is useless outside of profit generation for capitalists. 

We have collectively extracted so much from the planet and piled in so many hours into ‘work’ and yet no one I know is working less? This seems like a glaringly obvious paradox. It’s a shame that even attempting to question the institution of work irl is pretty much impossible.

3426,Fuck people who say “Just get a side hustle.”,"I was told by my mother about how I should have a “weekend side hustle” (of piano teaching) on top of a full time job, in order to make ends meet.

And as a musician, I tried to explain why that wasn’t so simple (competitive parents want real pianos, not keyboard (don’t have money), need to build a clientele, etc.) , and a very important one was the refusal to stress myself on the 2 days a week that I  have to myself.

See, the thing about those with boomer mentality is that they refuse to see that things that look simple on a surface level are actually impossible in practice. That’s why they can say stupid shit like “go in and talk to the hiring manager to get a job”, “get a side hustle”, etc...they don’t want to believe that it’s not that simple, because it shatters their brainwashed view of what a “simple” world looks like, and they lose their footing that they use to feel superior to the younger generations.",False,nuqdwy,EstrangedNeko,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nuqdwy/fuck_people_who_say_just_get_a_side_hustle/,96,1
3427,"References are ruining my mental health just like having to explain gaps, help?","The thought of ""having to"" list references on my CV is one of the main reasons why I have anxiety. I've had good jobs but even there, there were very few bosses I could trust to give an objective reference about me. Who knows what they will say? I tried to avoid this crap by asking for a written reference when I left but they ignore it. In my country, at least it's illegal for interviewers to call previous employers behind my back, but still. 

All these advise websites tell me to list references on my CV, so I did, but I feel like removing them all because I'm starting to freak out. Most of my jobs were short and these people don't know me well at all. Some of them were mentally unstable... I even left out some jobs cause I hated the place. There's where I have gaps instead, which I also ""have"" to explain but that's less of a problem for me because I realised it's none of their damn business and best I can do is ""I was looking for work"". That's all they are allowed to know about me.

Out of the 8 jobs I've had, I could only list 2 as a reference but one is of a job from 2018 and another of 2019... Luckily a lot of companies don't really seem to bother asking for references. The thing is I switched function in 2020 and I hated it! I started slacking and becoming depressed so I don't think this period would even be relevant as a reference. I became a copywriter while I'm actually a lawyer... Two completely different things. I want to be in the legal field again, maybe, and start over. Definitely skipping those toxic job agencies, they have the biggest tendency to call an ex-employer and might even make you sign a document that you allow them to (and then they cold call your ex employer... yikes!). 

So should we all just stop listing references? Or list the ones from the past? I wish there was a law that stated that employers should write a written reference for every employer that leaves, and you sign it, and everyone agrees and is happy.

3431,"I don’t want to die, I want to live","T/W: suicide

It really makes me sad to see the number of posts that think suicide is the only way out and yet I completely understand. I understand that we all feel trapped in a very cruel and unfair world. 
But what I really wish everyone (or many of us) could understand is that we don’t actually want to die, we want to live. But the 40 hour work week truly robs us of that possibility. 
Raised in a society made to breed working slaves who need money just to survive, it’s hard to feel like there is any other option at this point. 
I, personally, am dating someone who actually enjoys working and thankfully plans to support us both and I STILL have a hard time getting by day-to-day, not knowing when the day I don’t have to work might be, and living in fear of a breakup in which I’d be forced to work the rest of my life. And, honestly as a woman, I feel that I am privileged to be the one in the relationship that is socially acceptable to stay at home. 
I’m so sorry that so many of us don’t have a silver lining to look for in our future. All I want to say is that I really hope you all can find reasons to live. At the risk of being cliche and cheesy, find something that makes you truly happy, find a goal to achieve that will make you feel fulfilled, and chase it. As exhausted as I am, and as we all are from working, I have found that I’m happiest when I’m working towards personal goals. Some weeks it is harder than others to find the time and energy, but remember that there really is supposed to be more to life than working forever. I’m sorry none of us have the solution to it yet, but I hope we can find some happiness in the few hours we get to ourselves. 
Lots of love to those who are suffering from this. I really hope it gets better one day.

How can you show someone who does not see it how bad the current system is for a lot of people? How do you make your family, especially your parents understand how bad it is?

Here is some things I have seen working to convince people at least, who are not voting for the parties that they have been voting for years and are shifting their vote to more sensible parties.

* Sat down with my mother when I had to apply to jobs, because she did not believe me how terrible the process was. She was not full on ""Put on a suit and walk in there"", but she was like just accept any job that pays money for now. I spend several hours going through terrible written job postings, explaining a lot of times why the job description is wrong, why the pay is terrible, show her how they try to reduce pay by offering benefits. First she was like, benefits are nice, but when she saw all jobs offer them, she changed her tune. She saw how many different times I had to type the same thing that I just added in my CV.pdf. I told her how many replies (good or bad) I actually got and how many interview steps and assignments I had to go through for each company. She said anything about me complaining about job searches ever again.
* Tell them about how your management tells you that you need to work overtime, because they did not plan the certain tasks earlier that were much more important than others. Just let them know in a sneaky little way, make sure they know when you usually start working. Then send them small messages like: ""How mom, love you, just got off work."" Especially when you work really late.
* What also helped was having a successful sibling that had to go through the same stuff and got really annoyed at their constant probing. So it was not just me telling them.
* Tell people to try working from home if it is possible. In so many professions you don't need 8 hours to finish your tasks. My friend who had the opportunity to try it said he needed like 2-3 hours for all his reports and then was done for the day, just waiting if a call came in. He loved it and started questioning what was taking so much time at the office. He wondered why he was spending so much time in the office than with his wife and newborn kid.
* Getting depression from your job and have a doctor diagnose you with it. I can't really recommend this one, because damn did I never want to know what depression feels like. It did however make my family much more sympathetic. Especially because I was a happy guy before, but during this time of my depressive episode I had no more energy and lost all joy in life.

3445,1 week into internship and already hated the job,"First of all, this is my first job in my 24 years of life. I work in an IT company and I major study in my uni is most suitable for this job. Anyways, I already get frustrated on this job during my first week.

Most of my uni colleague also work here as a Graduate Trainee. What I heard from them is that, Graduate Trainee will only go through trainings or take some courses on their first month will not be involved in any kind of projects. I thought interns will also be treated the same, but then I was so wrong.

On my second day, I had a meeting with my supervisor. I thought they were gonna give a little brief on how my work would be on the future, what kind of trainings I will go through, etc. But nope, they immediately assigned me to a project. Without giving any context on the project, the supervisor only told me the expected output of the project and wanted me to immediately start working on it.

To clarify, it was only my second day of working and I even haven't done setting up the tools and accounts that will be used for my work. Later that night I contacted my uni colleague who also worked there, only that I know most of them does not even involved in any kind of projects yet. But here I am, paid only 1/3 of a Graduate Trainee's salary and have to start working on something that I have completely no idea of.

I was overwhelmed by the feeling that I cannot complete the task in the whole week. I talked to my family and my colleagues and rant about it. Most of their replies are “it is what is”, “this is how real life work”, “you are being lazy.” The one gets me the most is “if you cannot solve the problem, why do they hired you for?”
I understand that I am hired to work here, but I did not expected that I, an inexperienced employee, would be immediately assigned to a project.

3452,Left-libertarian coming with some sincere questions,"Hi all - as the subject says, I'm a left-libertarian (I realize that could mean a lot of different things, but at a basic level, what I mean is ""freedom as a default, but since it's always more complicated than that, make the policies work for the people"").

Anyway, I'm intrigued by the anti-work community, but had a couple of questions about how it would work on a larger scale.

Biggest one: I struggle with the healthcare aspect.  Assuming we all want there to be surgeons and nurses and people able to respond to pandemics with vaccines... how do we square that with an anti-work philosophy? I'm just wanting not to make it ""anti-work for me but not for thee.""

I've met somebody recently who has been teaching me a little bit about foraging, for example, and I've been thinking a lot about indigenous communities who survive despite capitalism all over the world. Other things I've considered have been to live on a sailing boat and get used to a diet of fish and seaweed; hunting deer and learning how to use every part of the animal; learning how to build shelter. Indigenous living skills or ancestral living skills.

3473,Mixed feelings about starting a new career.,"For the most part, I haven't held a long term, steady job since 2019. My income came from odd jobs like dog walking/sitting, website design, and some general labor jobs. I was able to pay my bills and have food in my belly. 

I've worked customer service for almost 20 years and I vowed to never work in a customer service position ever again after the last one. I decided to attend a pre-apprentice program to get into construction as I'm better suited for it. I'm not meant to sit behind a desk on a computer for 8 hours a day. 

I recently found out that I got accepted into a construction union, which means great pay, benefits, annuity, and a pension. I'm literally looking at 100K salary in the next 4 years.

Overall, it's a good thing and I'm very fortunate. Aside from all of this, I'm still dreading it. 

I'm happy doing odd jobs, but let's be real, in this capitalistic society it's not ideal for long term. While I can pay my bills now, I can't and haven't put away for retirement and I refuse to work past 65. So I feel like I have no choice. 

I am happy that I'll have a career doing something I want to do finally, but holy shit am I not looking forward to the grind itself. I have so many mixed feelings about it.",False,nunbpk,SlugsLoveBeer,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nunbpk/mixed_feelings_about_starting_a_new_career/,3,1

3477,Alternatives to unpaid internships worth way more than unpaid internships. Lets add to and spread this list to end companies taking advantage of vulnerable students.,"These are some alternatives to unpaid internships. All you need is a bit of research skills on what the field you want to go into is. And if you have 6 months to be working for free, you have time to do these:
- build a portfolio
- have a blog/ website
- write a couple on topic articles
- if its software related, help out on GitHub open end projects
- start your own company 
- work on a project
- read books
- publish a book
- start a youtube channel
- work on your soft interview skills
- practice presentation
- interact with professionals who already do the job (directly on forums or read articles)
- take free courses

3486,So... What can one do to actually stop working?,"I love the memes and posts and all the pointing out of the hypocrisy  of employers, corporations and all. 

But seriously, what can/should one do to start a life of non-work?

I'm asking because I've been feeling really down and tired of it all for a while and I know it's because largely due to work. But I have bills, family, debt (luckily not much), but also not much transferability in what I do and no creative talent. 

So really, if I am truly thinking about not working any longer, what options or actions should I consider and take? 

Sorry if I sound ignorant and lost. I just don't know much about anything else other than what I've been doing. It's my first and only job after school and I'm now in it for almost 15 years. And I hate it, but there's never really been anything else outside of this and just going home, playing games, watching YouTube and vegging my brains out till I sleep and then start again the next day.

3489,On the Basis of Repost Bots,"I know many of you are frustrated with the current state of this sub in regards to massive amounts of reposts. The sad fact of the matter is that it is not just r/antiwork that is having this issue. A quick jaunt over into r/modsupport reveals that this is an issue moderators have been begging for help with for the past two months and have recieved no reprieve.

The hard part in developing automod scripts to detect and remove bots is that the bots start understanding why they are banned and then try and circumvent.

This new wave of bots are from accounts that were created from 4 months to over a year ago. They seem to all be waking up at once and finding top level posts, top level comments and reposting the to farm karma. 

This is bad for reddit for two plausible reasons. Farming karma serves two purposes, us, the users often times will look at a person's account and see how much karma they have as a virtue signal of trust. Let's say these bots are designed to farm tons of karma and then bombard country specific and political subs to try and alter public opinion surrounding an election, or they go into financial subs and try to pump up the value of an unstable crypto or stock so they can sell high before a big bust. What I'm trying to get at, is that these bots are not only a nuisance, but they are possibly dangerous.

Sadly we've had posts reach the front page that have been made by these bots and recieved thousands of upvotes before removal. We can't take away that karma from them, reddit wouldn't allow that for obviously good reasons. But now they have it. If they're strategic, out of these thousands of bots, they get us to miss 1 or 2 that really take off. Those are now two high value accounts that can be bought and sold to the highest bidder and used to manipulate.

I know this post has been long but I'd like to end it with some tips on what patterns we've seen with these bots and what to do before interacting with a post.

1. Username patterns are emerging every day and constantly changing, the two most common current patterns are u/ NameName (typically feminine names) and then u/ word*kshekosiejjejhejdjdbwjsj* but the random letters at the end are always a different keyboard smash pattern

2. The accounts are 4+ months old with some being more than a year old.

3. The awarder karma is always 0. These bots aren't giving out awards so they are right at 0.

4. The posts are reposts and the comments are lifted from other top level comments. These are harder to spot unless you're a die hard fan of the sub

5. They typically only post to two to three specific subreddit's within minutes of one another. This may be a way to help them lay low.


I know that yinz are just as stressed and frustrated as I am with these bots. It is making reddit a hard place to browse when the front page of the internet isn't even half human anymore. Right now, the best things users can do is report accounts and be vigilant with which posts you interact with. Before giving out your free reward or paid rewards check the account and see if it's a bot. Hopefully this can get fixed soon but right now we're all in this together. A phrase i know all of you live to hear after these past 15 months.

Please be patient with us as we are trying our absolute best to remove them. Try not to interact with bot posts and report them as SPAM to us.",False,nup46h,rockcellist,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nup46h/on_the_basis_of_repost_bots/,27,1

3494,Perception is King,"After a couple of months of building a case for a salary bump, I finally went and proposed it to my boss. For the past 6 months, due to engineering staff reductions, I have taken on the better part of two additional positions with no increase in pay. This was under the direction that we WILL eventually replace these positions, and it is only temporary. As usual, this turned out to not be true. The rebuttal to my salary increase was that a salary bump wasn't possible due to low sales, and that I don't commit enough extra time to work and only work the ""bare minimum"" aka leaving on time. After inquiring further, I was told that since I leave at 5:10pm every day (my official quitting time is 5pm) and not something closer to 5:30pm, I will never have the opportunity to climb the corporate ladder at this company. I asked if there were any issues with my work, which the answer was no. But, my boss said that if someone needed my help on something at 6pm, I wouldn't be here to assist. I asked if that has ever happened in the past year I've worked here, and he said no. I asked if he ever heard any complaints that I don't support other departments, inside or outside of work, and again he says no. Being salaried, I have my cellphone number plastered all over my emails, and have taken many calls outside of normal work hours. After telling him this, he says he knows, but the PERCEPTION by upper management is that I don't put forth the extra time to complete tasks. So I said, ok, has there ever been a time where I have been late for a project or have not put forth my best effort to complete tasks and again he says no. At this point our meeting was cut short by another meeting, so instead of leaving feeling much better at my current situation, I left feeling frustrated. After sitting at my desk, I realized that if that is the only reason they will not promote me to a leadership position, than that is their loss. I will not sacrifice my free time for a huge ""what if"" situation that I may or may not be promoted. I will not spend my weekends at work like a good drone chasing the carrot on the stick. This is why I am anti-work.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; During a request for a salary increase, my boss said that since I only stay an extra 10min past the end of my work day instead of something closer to 30+min, I will never be considered for promotions in this company due to the upper management perception that I don't work hard enough, although having evidence on projects that prove the contrary.",False,nugeld,xJBxIceman,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nugeld/perception_is_king/,3,1

I really only ever joined this sub because I was looking for like-minded dropouts/losers/bums/rejects/vagabonds/anarchists/work resisters/etc.  I was originally on [Whywork.org](https://Whywork.org) forums/e-mail list/a follower of D. Joanne Swanson, and a later offshoot of that forum (Mike H/Mad Mike, are you out there?), read Brian Dean's Anxiety Culture way back when, read a little Ran Prieur, and even used to e-mail with the guy who made stickers that said ""Fuck Work"", amongst other stickers, in the late 90's.  These were people that always seemed, to me, intent on escaping that system, and not necessarily ranting about it while probably trying to advance in it.  I don't want to advance in this system, and I barely ever did.  I'll never wear a suit.  Barely ever wore one to a wedding.  I'll never work in an office.  I'll never work 9-5 unless it's very temporary and the pay is awesome.  I *don't* meet people who think this way.  It seems to be a very Gen X thing to even entertain, and I'm on the very tail end of Millennial. 

I understand that people take jobs because they have to.  I was just always more invested in... escaping all of this bullshit, especially as I got older.  I was never one of those crust punk, train hopping types, but I admire them.  The friends I have in real life somewhat embody my ethos, but they are sometimes down and out like myself.  I really want to be happy and have meaningful connections with others.  Is there any way to move beyond the memeing anti-work rhetoric into an actual lifestyle?

3505,"I love having people in my life that clearly don't understand, and don't care to even try. (Rant)","My Dad.

He seems to have some of the ideas for antiwork down, like ""laziness is good"". On the other hand, he makes comments such as ""Since you don't have a job, you're not doing anything important"". Because of course, what I want to spend time on doesn't matter. He claims to have good empathy, but then repeatedly proves he doesn't. Or does, and just doesn't use it, which is worse.

This thinking appears to be rooted in me still living with him, and ""You're not paying enough in rent to cover what you use"", so he thinks he's entitled to my time, simply because I'm not spending it elsewhere. If I'm working, he leaves me alone.

I'd love to just tell him to fuck off with his entitled shit, but again, I still live with him, and right now, it's easier to just go along with it than to try to argue with his arrogant attitude.

Employers want a $20 work ethic

Only willing to pay $3 an hour

And that's the more accurate view, if employers weren't so horrible they'd have plenty of workers. But they just can't bring themselves, with very few exceptions, to be better. So they whine and throw tantrums instead of changing their practices.

3536,"Legalized slavery, oligarchy, and the fight to end both","People seem to forget how much work and fighting it took to end legalized slavery, which was an institutionalized crime against humanity that  seemed normal to people for hundreds of years.

The legalized power disparity of slavery allowed slave owners to enact countless policies (from rape and illiteracy to brutal working conditions and denying legal standing) to further subjugate their slaves and entrench their own positions.

Humanity in the 21st century is now in the same position with respect to legalized oligarchy.

Humanity is currently enslaved by an outdated 20th century abomination of a legal system that perpetuates brutal oligarchy and massive injustice, and the system is well overdue for a 21st century anti-oligarchy update.

The power disparity between oligarchs and the rest of humanity allows oligarchs to dictate behavior and policy in countless ways (from exploitative working/living conditions, to land and energy policy/ownership, to tax policy, spending priorities, technology policy, healthcare policy, education policy, corporate law, securities law/enforcement, and so on) that further subjugate humanity while entrenching their own positions.

The difference now is that technology can help empower people and thereby end oligarchy in much less time than was required to end slavery.

Here is what a strategy to do that would look like:

1. A critical mass of the population can de facto [outlaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw) billionaires/oligarchs by [jury nullifying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification) any and all crimes and civil harms committed against billionaires and their obscene property claims.
2. This  should be repeated until the oligarchs enslaving humanity CHANGE THE  FUCKING LAWS to stop the legalized oligarchic enslavement of the human  species.

Oligarchy is, like slavery was, a crime against humanity, and it's time to fucking end it.

Slavery didn't just end, a lot of people had to fight for it to end, and that's essentially the position we find ourselves in today with respect to oligarchy.

Anyone with the intelligence and means to understand humanity's situation has as much moral responsibility to end oligarchy as our predecessors did to end slavery, and it's time to fucking end it.",False,nu55s4,xena_lawless,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nu55s4/legalized_slavery_oligarchy_and_the_fight_to_end/,8,1

3563,Why you need 'FUCK YOU' money and working towards financial independence is the best thing you will ever do," Imagine you had to sign these bloody terms and conditions before choosing to be born, it's just insane:

From the ages of 5-18 you're going to go to school every weekday, get homework, but if you're not great at memorising what underpaid, bored and tired teachers have say to you, well fuck you, your whole life is probably fucked as you're not getting into a good college and you will end up doing important but low as fuck paid jobs for the rest of your life. God forbid you have any special learning needs - you're just going to have to fucking pray that you don't.
You're going to spend the next, best 50 years of the physical prime of your life working, coz if you don't you'll be homeless, hungry and probably sick and die. 
You'll work 40-50 hours a week and get paid less than the value you generate (because that is how businesses work), all the while you're expected to make it look like you're privileged to have this opportunity to not starve and die out on the street.
If you die before you can access retirement age, well sucks to be you, should have lived long enough to take advantage of all that tax you chose to pay your whole life huh, but even if you make it to retirement age, and don't have any debilitating diseases affecting your mind or body, you will spend the final years of your life having finally the time and money but not the ability to do the things you've wanted to your whole life. Skiing trip? Forget about it, Travelling around the world, maybe climbing Everest? No fucking way. You're just there to witness your body slowly fall apart and if you're lucky spend some time with the friends who haven't passed away and your family when they can be bothered to visit you. 
I'd probably nope the fuck out of that agreement right there! 

Just how we know that having to do something - anything, makes it a chore - the freedom to explore and enjoy  your life can only come once you have achieve financial independence - unless of course happened to be plopped out of the right vagina into a family where everything is handed to you. 

I once had this absolute prick of a boss who was so fucking full of himself he treated everyone else below him on the corporate ladder like utter shit, blaming you for his mistakes, lying about work related issues, or just being a rude dick. More than once, the way he spoke to me I wanted to say ""FUCK YOU PRICK"", punch him and leave, but I'd put up with it, tell myself I need that job and he's not that bad, even though I'd spend my morning commute hoping the train crashed just so I wouldn't have to go to work that day.

This was a long time ago now, but, it still makes me seethe, and I never want to be in that position again, thankfully I'm a fair way along in my goal of getting fuck you money, so hopefully I won't have to.

Fuck you money means different things to different people, For some it means having enough money  to say ""FUCK you"" and walk off when your job puts you in an unacceptable situation without having to worry about starving or becoming homeless because you have a few months or a years worth of expenses saved up and you could take your time to find a job you really liked. For others, Fuck you money may mean having enough never to HAVE  to work again, ever, this also falls under the FIRE(Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement that is really popular right now for good reason. That's not to say these people want to sit around and do nothing forever more (although there is nothing wrong with that!) it's just that people want to work on what they want to do, for the amount of time they want to do it , on the days they want to do it on!!

Imagine for a minute, a world where everyone had a FUCK YOU fund and with it the power, at any point, to walk away from their job if you didn't like the way your boss behaved, or if you were overworked, or you simply wanted a change? It would make the world such a better place, it would force bosses to treat everyone with respect and fairness! Imagine if you had fuck you money today, would you still want to be in the same job or would you look for a new job, or even go back to studying, learn some new skills, do charity work or just retire.

While obviously we can't make this change happen on a global scale as great as it would be, but we can, at least make sure we and the people around us that we care the most about have the financial independence that comes with having FUCK you money, so start working towards it today. 

You can not know what you want to do with your life and what your life's work will be until you can stop worrying about survival. There is a reason the greatest philosophers, artists and athletes tend to come from wealthy backgrounds, they're free from the feeling of dread that accompanies each day we have, the hatred of the very thing we so desperately need to survive.

Obviously deciding to work towards FUCK YOU money and actually getting there are two different things, I'll be creating a new post to help others like I've been helped and hopefully, you too will start to see some light at the end of this fucking horrifying tunnel that doesn't involve having wasted the majority of your life generating value for a corporation and it's shareholders.",False,nt9x3i,apparentreality,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nt9x3i/why_you_need_fuck_you_money_and_working_towards/,22,1

I don't think any of us are 18 yet (I'm 17 myself) I work every weekend 5 PM and get stuck being the closer for my position which means I'm the last for my position there, well my coworkers think that means scurry off as fast as possible and leave me there for an hour by myself at night to juggle whatever work is left. One night, a bunch of people from my position clocked out, and came back to eat. I was left there for the rest of the night. Boyfriends and girlfriends run off to be with each other, and basically if you aren't in a little clique, you don't matter. 

I try to be nice to people, but if you cross the line, I'll be sure to make it known. My coworkers yell at me and basically talk to or about me like I'm some retard If I don't do things as they think I should, I just follow whay I remember from training. Today I left with the excuse of a ""family emergency"" and applied elsewhere. I can't take it anymore. It's not worth $8.88/hour. I probably won't bother telling management, because they're disorganized as it is, plus I don't want to deal with a bunch of people running around the workplace telling people I'm a snitch and all that nonsense, I don't have the patience for it.

Work intentionally creates problems and pretends it is the only solution. It distracts you from learning self-sustainable skills like growing your own food or building your own shelter. It removes your time so you have no other option but to hire others to complete those tasks, which only creates more jobs. 

When you are growing up they tell you to follow your “dream.” To associate yourself with a job and think about it so much that you start to believe it. So you work hard in school and go to college, racking up so much debt that you have no option but to continue. You realize early on that this career is not for you.

I feel like as soon as I make a casual hobby into a professional routine that's much more rigid and high stakes, the joy will be sucked out of it.

People have said ""why don't you pick one that you're especially good at and do the rest for fun."" But that defeats the purpose I think, because first of all that's like asking me which one of my children is my least favorite.

I don't do things unless I really enjoy them so it's scary to pick out an interest and possibly begin to like it less and less over time.

People who try to get me to choose a career path always make excuses why it's necessary. The truth is that you can't live without one. It's just strange to me that people make up all of these reasons to justify that. If it was a good system, I don't think people would have to try so hard to justify its existence.

Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nqjzff/handed_in_my_notice_and_things_turned_sour_quickly/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Turns out that I'm not the only person leaving. Three others have told me they have either handed in their notice or are looking elsewhere first. Another colleague has mentioned that he's debating between staying at our current place or moving to another. So I guess that makes four. All four are seniors that I get along with pretty well.

I always felt that I was being exploited as a junior and turned out I was correct. The job posting they announced for my position is two grades above mine which explains why they were angry that I'm leaving. This will likely cost them at least 20k, most likely 30k. Yet they wouldn't give me a raise in my review meeting (despite getting a great overall rating). 

I also got an email after my shift with my official resignation letter stating I've only work for the company for ten months and not two and a half years. Bit of a kick in the teeth but the way things have been going I'm not surprised.

3592,Anyone here truly interested in dropping out/living an alternative lifestyle? Or is this place mostly about venting about shitty jobs?,"Much respect if you are here because your job sucks.  I get it.  9-5, or even 10-4, is pretty outdated.  You won't find me disagreeing with anyone about working conditions, increasing pay, or shortening the work week.  

I should probably do a poll.  I'm just curious to see who is actually posting here.  I really only ever joined this sub because I was looking for like-minded dropouts/losers/bums/rejects/vagabonds/anarchists/work resisters/etc.  I was originally on [Whywork.org](https://Whywork.org) forums/e-mail list/a follower of D. Joanne Swanson, and a later offshoot of that forum (Mike H/Mad Mike, are you out there?), read Brian Dean's Anxiety Culture way back when, read a little Ran Prieur, and even used to e-mail with the guy who made stickers that said ""Fuck Work"", amongst other stickers, in the late 90's/early 2000's.  These were people that always seemed, to me, intent on escaping that system, and not necessarily ranting about it while probably trying to advance in it.  I don't want to advance in this system, and I barely ever did.  I'll never wear a suit.  Barely ever wore one to a wedding.  I'll never work in an office.  I'll never work 9-5 unless it's very temporary and the pay is awesome.  I *don't* meet people who think this way.  It seems to be a very Gen X thing to even entertain, and I'm on the very tail end of Millennial.

I understand that people take jobs because they have to.  I was just always more invested in... escaping all of this bullshit, especially as I got older.  I was never one of those crust punk, train hopping types, but I admire them.  The friends I have in real life somewhat embody my ethos, but they are sometimes down and out like myself.  I really want to be happy and have meaningful connections with others.  Is there any way to move beyond the memeing anti-work rhetoric into an actual lifestyle?  I hope so.",False,ntctc0,DumpsterCyclist,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ntctc0/anyone_here_truly_interested_in_dropping/,19,1

3610,"The Current Rhetoric Surrounding ""Labor Shortages"" is just a negotiating tactic.","  

Please Read. 

Disclaimer: I am not an expert on economics, most of this comes from understanding rhetoric and how media manipulation works

There is a lot of attention on labor shortages right now, mostly stemming from pictures circulating of stores hanging disclaimer signs about lack of staff and retail chains offering sign-on bonuses and incentives. In addition, we have Gov Abbot of Texas ending unemployment benefits in his state to encourage people to return to work, and Montana and South Carolina following suit. These are all in the media to force people to go back to work through negotiating tactics. I’m going to talk about why we need to fight these tactics. This is going to be a long analysis, with a lot of tangents, so buckle up. 

1. No one is willing to make structural change yet. Their “desperation” is disingenuous. 

Think about this. If workers had any more leverage than they currently do, there would be actual incentive in hiring. But there isn’t enough leverage yet to make real change. There was an ice-cream shop that changed their wage to $15 an hour and got 1000’s of applicants. And, adjusted for inflation, the dollar purchasing power, it’s still not a great wage. But it was enough to attract a large enough pool that they could choose anyone they wanted. This benefited the company because it creates trust in the employers, makes them distinct from other businesses, gives them positive attention, and saves them costs from turnover rates. Now why aren’t other companies taking this approach?

2. “Zombie” companies are looking for workers to offload debt and blame onto. 

Forced structural change from Covid-19 caused **fear** and **panic** in corporate America. First off, supply shortages and corporate debt became highly stressed.  It’s why you see the rhetoric right now that we all have to go back to work, to the offices, and can’t keep the benefits we reaped from working at home. We saved money from commuting, got more control over family life, and saved more time. But it wasn’t as directly profitable, and gave us the more control over our lives, so it’s being attacked. 

As for why companies with supposed labor shortages aren’t just raising their wages to attract a larger hiring pool?

I believe it’s because **they don’t have the capital**. This sounds ridiculous, right? How would they not have capital if executives are making 100’s times more than their employees? It’s because since before COVID-19, companies already had this factored into their structure. Finding the cash for executives is a given, but finding it for employees caught them off-guard. They didn’t know how they would be forced to increase wages to attract employees. They can take on more debt, but they can’t lose revenue because many companies are already massively in debt, and only alive because of share prices. Why would Walmart be offering free phones to employees instead of higher wages? Think about it. Rather than considering working for a low wage, let me point out the obvious:

3. It costs more to work than to not work. 

Let’s go to the absolute lowest that we should even consider raising the minimum wage to: $15 an hour. You have to work 100 hours for a baseline of $1500. Let’s say you live in Denver (more expensive I know, but I want to give an example on the higher end). If you work 40 hours a week, you make in a month $2400. After income tax it is $2288.88. Subtract an average rent in Denver ($1200) for $1088.88. Gas on average is $250 per month. $838 – average cost of food per month ($387) $451. After utilities, phone, any debt payments, costs of living, you would be lucky to have any money left to save. You making $15 an hour will still net you debt. But this is not all. 

You lose money by going to work. It costs you in time. That was 160 hours of your life that you reaped almost no benefit from. It will cost you in your health, in trading off time to a company that doesn’t care about your wellbeing for time you could have been doing other things. It took you from your family, from any side-gigs or self-employment. It cost you your humanity if you work in retail or warehouse work. It was not profitable for the time you gave away. You were forced to adopt their wage and their burdens. And you were responsible for any liabilities you took on as a worker. In actuality, a homeless man panhandling is netting a higher profit than your average retail worker. If they aren’t giving you a raise, you are losing money to inflation. The dollar is losing its value and I wouldn’t be surprised if more companies start paying us in alternative currencies.

4. They don’t really want workers. 

Again, there is no labor shortage yet. This current trend is the media and corporate America smelling blood in the water and attempting to coerce us. Don’t, for any reason, give up unemployment for slavery. It is better to be in-control and hold out. I can’t share my political opinions on all of this, but I believe it is better for us to take care of our friends and family who are struggling than to encourage them to sell their lives to a corporation. If you have enough, I encourage you to help with the costs of living others may be struggling with. As long as we can circulate the money between who we know than to allow any more money to be absorbed into the debt of failing corporations. 

Think about this: How can there be a labor shortage when companies are still incentivized to lay off workers? Most have not prioritized workers in any meaningful way. Here is the truth: **Workers are a liability for them.** They do not want to hire anyone! They want us to work for nothing! All of this is a game to get us back under their control. I’ll end it by saying that we must hold the line. They will start playing psychotic games, blaming us for their failures, and yet, offering more incentives. **It is all a trick.** Stay strong and do your best to survive with the money you have.",False,ntxsy3,stagflationthrowaway,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ntxsy3/the_current_rhetoric_surrounding_labor_shortages/,37,1

3614,How to deal with the anxiety of a medium risky career change?,"Hi

so in the last few months I decided to quit the job that makes me miserable and lined up all necessary steps to get trained in something I could do from home. Obviously the nature of that means I can only start job hunting after the additional training, so I did the unthinkeable and quit my job without a new one lined up.   

I do have savings that give me 6 months time to find something new after completing the training (which they said is recommended).  

The anxiety about all that is really not cool anymore. I thought about what exactly I am scared off and it is not so much death as being forced to either starve homeless or find a way to kill myself. I think I'd be much calmer and able to accept my situation if it was like ""In Time"" where you just drop dead once your money hits 0. But in this world if you run out of money you either suffer homeless or have to use more or less violent ways to commit suicide.

3644,Here's why you need to stop blaming yourself for the state of your life.,"Have you ever had a, boss. a partner, a parent or even a teacher who would belittle and hurl abuse at you for the smallest of things, find any excuse to you make you feel inadequate, almost all interaction with them would leave you feeling bad about yourself; But you have this need to win their approval. For me, it was my 8th grade English teacher, she was cold and condescending, but I still found myself striving to try and break past her chronic indifference towards me, to make myself feel ""worthy"" of her attention and approval- looking back, even now, I clearly recall the feelings of anxiety that accompanied each interaction with her. Once in a while they'll do something that makes you think ""Maybe they really do care about me"", and you're so grateful for this, that you keep allowing this cycle of abuse to carry on, just to experience that feeling one more time - then, you're suffering from stockholm syndrome. Yes, that Stockholm syndrome.

Today, you may feel captive in an unhappy life, watching your friends and family get that prestigious job, the large house or the beautiful spouse that you yearn for everyday. You loathe yourself, filled with anguish at the missed opportunities - you lie awake every night imagining how your life would have changed if you'd just taken that leap.

You should know that It's not your fault- it is extraordinarily hard to change your life because, even now, you're suffering from stockholm syndrome that has pervaded itself into every aspect of your life.

What this means is that you've formed a psychological connection with these parts of your life over time and you are fearful of leaving them - it is familiar and comfortable and at some level you feel it is what you deserve - there's no shame in this, but it is something that you need to work on to get on with your life.

So how do you work past this, luckily you can start with the 5 actions below :

Treat yourself as you would, someone asking you for help

Imagine a close friend, or member of your family came to you with a problem that has been plaguing their life for a long time. They are miserable and can't stop thinking about it - negative feelings fill their days and nights due to this problem. I imagine you would set aside everything else immidately, listen to their problem in details, give them a constructive way to solve said problem and then follow up with them to help them through it.

What you wouldn't do is blame them, tell them how stupid they are to be in this position and that they should have done something sooner and it's way too late now- but then why do you say these things to yourself everyday?

Treat yourself as a priority! Think about yourself, your problems, what you want to work on and how you should go about it without free from judgement and negativity. You are your harshest judge but you need to afford yourself the very basic courtesies you would to anyone else!

Once you learn to follow this on a regular basis it will make a powerful change to your life, and rapidly too. This is because any advice you give others, while meaning well, it will always be based on incomplete information but when you apply this exercise to yourself it will have insights no one else can give you.

 Practice saying ""no.""

Is there someone to whom just the idea of saying ""No"" to makes your blood run cold? Maybe it's your domineering boss or a strict parent. Do you see yourself as a ""nice guy"" who doesn't want to ""be a bother"" and always goes along with what your friends/partner/family want to do? Whether it be where to go on dinner or what movie to see or even where to go on holiday.

You may tell yourself you don't really care or that you're just happy going with the majority but the reality is each time you don't speak up on what your inner desire, deep down you feel just a little bit bad.

This feeling of repressing yourself compounds and can get lead to negative consequents

When you say no, you're telling yourself that what you want matters, yourself and others around you will respect you more. Just to be clear, it doesn't mean you need to always get your way, win every argument or only ever go to dinner to a place you choose - you just need to express yourself stop repressing your true feelings and just that simple act,  in and of itself will create a positive feedback loop within yourself to stop repressing your emotions, leading to a happier, healthier you.

Make changes in your life you've been avoiding due to fear of judgement

Think about how, if you did not care what people thought of you, how would you live your life differently? Try not to focus on the past, just on what changes you would like to make and what obstacles you may face in doing so.

For example, If I wanted to stop drinking but I'd be worried about how I'll explain it at the weekly work outings, what reason would I give to those asking me why I'm not drinking? I might worry ""Will they think I'm an alcoholic trying to cut back"" or ""Will they resent me for trying to preach about cutting back"" - and for that reason, just to avoid this,  I might just end up drinking and tell myself ""it's just this one night"" . You see how easy it is to rationalise not making changes to your life for fear of judgement - this can be incredibly harmful in the long run for your physical and mental health.

What exactly this is, will of course vary from person to person, but what is true is that just identifying how you want to change your life and what is stopping you from doing so is an important first step in actually doing so!

Surround yourself with people who have the qualities you want yourself to have.

For better or for worse, people end up becoming like the company they keep. You've probably heard this before but it merits repeating for good reason.

More than anyone else, people are influenced by their closest friends, this is because advice from most sources is unwelcome, even intrusive when compared to just normal conversation and feedback with your best friends. Your views and habits are influenced disproportionately by those of your friends than any other source.

This can of course be a double edged sword, if you have a friend who smokes, you yourself are 61% more likely to be a smoker yourself. This goes for a lot of things, including happiness, health and confidence among other things - so take a look around and make sure you're in the right surroundings!

 Plan, Prepare, Pratice.

There is a reason that virtually everyone tasked with dealing with customers, whether it be telemarketers, salesmen or IT support have pre-made scripts that they follow , it gives them confidence and structure which is important to achieve your goals.

Whatever you want to do or achieve, structure a plan on how to go about it, prepare a series of actions that will let you carry out that plan and practice doing the actions on your list - now do them again, over and over again until you're so confident in these actions that you've ingrained them in your subconscious, you should be able to do them without thinking about them. Once you've done this, you will undoubtedly achieve your goal.

It's as simple as that - overthinking and over-preparation are (shockingly) the bane of a lot of people who want to make changes to their lives - practice your life until it becomes your life.

***Taking part in it is the worst possible thing someone who wants to help stop it can do.***

I know even a lot of people here don't agree with that, but I will forever stand by it. It's *their* system, and I feel no obligation to take part in it to make up for the fact that it allows immoral shit to take place. By defending it they're literally helping extend the amount of time that parents all across the world are forced to be in such a unfair situation.

3692,"""Work hard now, get paid in 5 years""","Young people are brainwashed to work hard now (collage, career) with the expectation that they would eventually be rewarded for that, of course that often does not happen, instead often people work really hard only to find out it was for nothing. 

If you look at the typical company you will become obvious that most people working there now will not get promoted to upper management and the few that do will end up with more responsibilities. 

But it get's worse. Generally when it comes to company management they very much prefer people who own a significant amount of stock since these people will be far more motivated to actually do a good job. Thus if you are not already a major stock-holder you might be effectively locked out from upper management. 

**Higher education**

You shouldn't have to spend years in collage just to get a job. You getting an education should be for yourself, not for some company you have no real ownership or control over.

3694,A bit of commentary about my WFH experience,"So, ever since lockdowns had started in my area (somewhere in Germany) last year, I got some WFH experience and it was absolutely miserable. I was initially doing job training for IT last spring when I was 16, and my boss expected me to work 8 hours a day 5 days a week at home for some reason, which I find very stupid. It later turned out that none of my workmates had woken up at 7:30am like our boss had wanted to (I didn't either, and I don't manage to wake up before 10am at the moment anyways)

There was also some table or something like that online, y'know, in a link my boss had sent to me, in which I had to put in how many hours I worked each day, which I find weird. The second lockdown through last winter became absolutely miserable by six weeks in, with a third lockdown from late April through late May which I found quite annoying

I later figured that I don't expect to work more than six hours a day in a workplace away from home, and three or four hours a day at most if I have to work from home. I also figured that I will set a certain work quota each day, and log off once I'm finished with the work quota. I will elaborate on that last part in my next post",False,nsc1jc,Herobrine190,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nsc1jc/a_bit_of_commentary_about_my_wfh_experience/,2,1

3696,One more downside to the 40 hour workweek: being stuck in a skill set.,"I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and one of the things that really gets to me is how badly being dedicated to one thing pigeonholes you into doing only that thing. You get stuck to one employer because you need insurance, you get stuck to one professional category because it’s hard to get experience in something new once you’ve established skills in an area. They don’t take older people for internships because they just want new college grads. It’s all a real bummer.

So recently my work place (a gas station) got a workplace iPad. Why you may ask? I have no fucking clue. The damn thing has everything locked on it besides a very shitty Facebook rip off called work jam that shares photos and comments that other work places post witch they already made everyone download on our own phones great now I can get notifications when I'm home about useful shit like this floor display looks neat wow this new mop works wonders on the hard wood. The damn thing is basically being used as a very expensive calculator most of the time. So I wandered there has to be some way I can use this thing to make my overnight shifts a little less shitty without eating up all my phones data. YouTube spotify anything as long as I can do it without anyone knowing. The browser is locked I can get to a few sites that they bookmarked and saved to the home screen but the address bar is locked and I can't change it. The ipad is not linked to a iTunes or apple account signing in may give me access to the app store but that will be a last thing I will try Since Its apple and I rather not make an account with them.

3719,"I don't get how people still have a social life, work on themselves, &amp; spend time with family while working full time?","Im literally burnt out everytime I end work for the day. I graduated college 2 years ago, landed my first full time job and have been miserable, struggling to be a functional HUMAN ever since. I work remotely so I am thankful for that but since I started working ive begun to realize how little time I have to myself now outside of work. And during those hours Im not working, I truly feel like those hours dont fully belong to me because I have to plan what I do during those hours with my work schedule in mind. For example, I can't stay out with friends too long on a weeknight because I have work the next day. If I want to work on  myself or my side hustle, I have to say no to seeing friends for a few nights. If I want to see my family, I have to say no to working on myself or seeing friends. With such little time outside of work, it comes down to picking and choosing who I spend my time with and who I don't spend my time with and how long I can spend with them while tryign to balance other things. I dont feel free anymore, im exhausted and miserable everyday. I have lots my motivation for many things i once loved because i dont have much time for it anymore. I dont hate my job, its not extremely stresful, but just having to do the same thing for so many hours per day, every day of the week, with so little free time to  myself and being exhausted during that free time makes me so sad. as each day passes i feel like so much time is being stolen from me. I was not meant to live like this. nobody is, and i cannot see myself being able to handle this for 40 something more years. i want more out of life than this and i am bitter about the situation enough to create a pathway to change. i am picking up a skill that i hope to make money with soon, but its difficult to work on it when im drained from work and have many other responsibilities i need to take care of. i just dont get how so many people are okay with this, of course i understand there are people who love their 9-5 and feel purpose there, but for me, its not it. ive tried different part time jobs too, those arent fulfilling, all jobs sap the energy out of me and if i switched jobs to something that paid higher, the exhaustion it will bring and the time i have to trade for that money wont be worth it. i just want to live comfortably on my own terms, without having to answer to a boss that doesnt care about me in the end and without having someone controlling what i do for 8 hours per day. life is such a cruel joke....",False,nskmm6,yubg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nskmm6/i_dont_get_how_people_still_have_a_social_life/,34,1

3722,My quitting experience from emergency travel to emergency roadside.,"I worked for a company that rhymes with BBB. I was hired to train to become a travel agent in june 2019. I worked at the corporate headquarters for my region handling online travel and phone requests for travel from 1pm-10pm est. It was fantastic learning everything there was to learn about booking travel and traveling. I got the job to support my love of travel and make hella commission on selling cruises and tours. The training was intense and I learned fairly quickly. I was finished with the most basic training within two months but was not allowed to book anything for another two months. So while my colleagues were making boat loads I was making about 3 dollars in commission for every hotel booking. It was frustratingly slow. I could have been using my time to build my business. For whatever reason my boss decided to hold us back for a very long 6months. only booking hotels. OH AND BY THE WAY YOU HAD TO MAKE OVER 2K IN COMISSION BEFORE YOU SAW ANYTHING IN YOUR PAY CHECK. During this time I had many friends and family members look for vacations I couldnt help them with so they refused to book with BBB.

When the pandemic hit we had to rush to become work from home. Travel took a nose dive and instead of figuring out that they needed travel advisers to handle their bookings that were getting canceled and figuring out everything with the vendor for the customer they fired all but like 3 out of  15 travel agents in that office. That was February 2020. Some of us were lucky to be hired by the customer service center and were able to keep using our work from home set ups. We are trained very quickly to handle: emergency roadside, membership management, internet support, insurance claims, hotel bookings (very different style than I learned in travel), car care appointment booking, triptik and tour book ordering, ect. Its a lot. Im averaging 100 calls a day at a 3min service call 5min customer service call time. Im exhausted. There is no leaving the house, the only place I can work is in my room. I always feel like im at work and never at home. I start feeling suicidal and we were given 125 hours in pto to take for the year. When the vaccines came out my discord family decided we would all get vaccinated and go stay at a cabin in the woods in about 6 months. I tell my supervisor about the trip they are excited for me. I try to request the time in advance. Say I have to wait till 3 months out to request time off. Thats fine. Three months is April 2021. April comes, try to request off, days are green no one as taken them, awesome. Put in the request, denied. Ok what the fuck? Email the work  hours department. Email back: "" Short staffed dont have enough hours to have someone take time off."" Ok? How is that my problem? Im requesting time in advance you will have plenty of time to figure it out. 

Supervisor monthly meeting we go over performance and I tell them about my vacation not being approved. They decide to go over the attendance policy. 1 day= 1 point  every day you call out if you dont have it scheduled. 10 points and youre fired. My vacation is about 8 days but I was going to take a few days before hand to move into my new apartment. 10 days. 

So basically Ill be fired if I take the vacation I planned 6 months in advance even though I have the PTO. All because the company didnt want to hire any more people. 

Decided to quit that day. Got hired at a company that pays way more and for just selling lighting and working on online orders. Dropped my two week notice in an email and they immediately terminated me so Id be two weeks without pay. AWESOME. I move in to my new apartment. Everything is ready for my vacation and we drive up to the cabin. Im so happy and stress free I can actually enjoy my vacation. 

TLDR; Got fired from travel and hired as ERS/Sales/Claims/IT support same company. They would not allow me to take my vacation even though I requested months in advance. They said it was due to staffing shortage say Ill be fired if I go on the vacation anyway.  So I quit. Got hired somewhere else getting paid more and doing far less.

3723,Thoughts/reflections/questions about asking to go from full to part time,"I have a performance review at 3pm today and plan to tell my supervisor I’d like to go from full to part time. 

I’ve been at my current job 8.5 years (graphic designer) and have a good work relationship/friendship with my supervisor so I think today I’ll just be floating the idea and discussing it with her.  I don't think we'll get into details of hours/pay today, but I'm not too worried about making less money if it means I can own more of my life. Losing health insurance will be a bummer, but, I’m thinking there will be lots of other positive effects on my physical and mental health if I’m able to work part time. 

At first I was set on asking for M-W, but lately shorter days sound appealing. I think I can get the same amount of work done too, because sometimes 8 hours feels like an eternity and I'm much more focused when I know I have less time to get something done. 

The thought of working full-time another year just crushes me. I want to thrive in my personal life and pursue my hobbies but right now I’m just so exhausted after work and a two-day weekend isn't long enough for me to recharge. I don’t feel like I’m thriving at work, either. I can hardly concentrate or juggle tasks like I used to. I'm hoping working part-time would bring much needed balance. 

Not sure how much of my personal views and struggles with working full-time I should reveal to her, though...it is a big part of my reason for asking, but should I leave that out?

3727,Why do we need to end work ? a gem from zerohedge comments:," “The debt slaves work a currency pyramid scheme of unlimited, created debts, in a state of learnt ignorance. Suffering through lack of knowledge, the modern slave is chained by the law of the land to the Temple of Usury system run by its banking agents and the hidden hand of the lodge. The debtors are born into the captivity of legal slavery, their legal fictions being owned and traded around the world. The planation produces interest and inflation for its owners using created debts and currency debasement as the seed and growing medium. 

The slaves toil away, fetching and carrying from the various company stores, to keep the system of usury producing the cash crops. Currency is created, lent, borrowed, spent, taxed and repaid by evermore increasingly worthless debts. What passes as productive activity, working in its service or pursuing an interest in materialism, is nothing more than self-harm as it tightens the Temple’s grip, allowing power to be further consolidated while methods of control, such as the surveillance panopticon technology is developed. In this system, the life of a planation debtor can only get harder as the few remaining freedoms are taken away in the name of health and safety. 

By definition, truth is weirder than the fiction created to conceal it. The Temple controls the mind of the debtors using inversion and deception. Its political patois is sugar coated poison. Spin and obfuscation produces friendly pain and happy suffering. If it’s painted in counterfeit liberal colours, the debtor is trained to love neo-slavery. Plantation life is a psychological bombardment to distract, corrupt and occupy the psyche to convince the victim to unconditionally accept their enslavement. Behind a mask of faux civility, the plantation is a moral wasteland of despair and loathing, a society based on greed and inequality, corruption, coercion and vice, which shuns wisdom and virtue to celebrate its moral subsidence and malaise of ignorance.   

Truth is the enemy of all conspiracies to deceive. Like having a blind fold removed, it can disrupt and unsettle the flock, prompt some to question, causing dissent, rebellion and maybe emancipation. In the same way that the new born in the field have no knowledge of what lies beyond the fence, debt slavery has been normalised by withholding truth and knowledge using educational indoctrination, reinforced by media programming, to produce a society in collective ignorance, existing in a consciousness distorted like a fairground hall of mirrors, producing a virtual reality operating system which runs the lives the debtors. You don’t have to believe me, if you your gaze, it’s all there in plain view. The system is fundamentally undermined and doomed to failure because it’s fake. It doesn’t have joy, truth or love on its side.”",False,nsex7d,BedriT,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nsex7d/why_do_we_need_to_end_work_a_gem_from_zerohedge/,5,1

3797,My general work experience thus far,"So, in my previous post I talked about my experience with remote working aka WFH (work-from-home). In this post, I will expand to my general work experience

Last year, after the first lockdown had ended last May, I attempted to clock out at 3 pm because that's what I knew at the time. However, I was stopped and told that I have to ask the boss if I can leave, which made me feel awkward. When I asked my boss if I could leave at 3 pm, he told me that I could stay there through the night (!)

Later, the work I was doing became too confusing and I eventually became bored as I couldn't finish my work, so I resorted to just browsing reddit all day as I didn't have the courage to just go home. I guess I didn't want to feel awkward again, so that may have factored into that\*.

After that, I just continued browsing reddit all day, y'know, when I managed to complete my work that time around, so a young woman who was with me at the time (a supervisor iirc) told me to ask for more work from the teachers,\*\* which also felt awkward. I did it reluctantly after resisting slightly, and I feel dumb for that now.

Last September, I was literally raging, as I randomly got a power-tripping woman appointed to be in charge of me, and she was just so freaking annoying. She appeared to be in her 60s, so I guess that she's a boomer (not sure why I added it in this post lol)

Finally, I tried to do the assigned work my way with like 12 attempts mid-October, and every single one of them failed. That's when I realized I was backed into a corner, so I threw a fit, and then left afterwards,

\*I wouldn't ask my boss if I could leave or tell him I wanted to leave because I wouldn't have it with the same response as before, and also it just felt awkward first time around, and I wasn't having that either

\*\*I later figured that I will set my own quota for work to do each day instead of asking for more work once I'm done, since the latter is just unbelievably annoying ime",False,nt3jpi,Herobrine190,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nt3jpi/my_general_work_experience_thus_far/,0,1

3801,"Why ""Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life"" is absolute bullshit that will ruin your life.","Since I was young, my dad always told me ""Follow your passion"" and not to worry about earning money since it'll come if you are good at what you do.

On the surface, this makes a lot of sense right? I spent a lot of my life following that advice, I've been great with computers since I was a kid, I spent all my pocket money from the age of 11 onwards buying computer magazines, memorising computer ""tips and tricks"" and being fascinated about the latest developments in technology.

At the age of 15 I worked a summer job assembling and networking dozens of computers at a local ""cyber cafe"", remember those? I spent my days helping people with issues, troubleshooting computer problems and generally enjoyed myself. 

After a couple of weeks though, I realised I began dreading my time at the cyber cafe, this wasn't a fun activity anymore that I chose to pursue at my leisure, it was something that I HAD to do, every day, and what's worse I didn't get to choose when I did it! The problem with having your ""passion"" attached to your job is that, now, it's no longer a choice! You have to do it! Every. single. day. for at least 8 hours a day. 

No one likes being forced to do anything, doesn't matter what it is, the fact that you're forced to do it takes the fun out of it. Don't believe me? Imagine something you absolutely love doing, it could be anything, but lets pick Sex.

Getting paid to have Sex as a man would be a dream come true right? You spend your days having sex with many, different, beautiful women, and you're thinking - hah no way am I getting sick of this.

But one day, you want to leave early, you'd like to have only 7 hours of sex today, but you can't. You HAVE TO stay, you're forced to stay for the whole 8 hours, even though you don't want to be there. I promise you, that 8th hour, is going to feel absolutely fucking terrible. 

No one likes feeling powerless, and that's exactly what is happening to us 40-50 hours a week, every week. We aren't donating this time out of the goodness of our hearts, we need to do this activity to survive - it's not out of choice. 

But you know people that really genuinely do enjoy their work? These people are either delusional who've convinced themselves this is the case as a coping mechanism and are suffering from Stockholm syndrome or they have fuck you money, meaning they actually are there out of choice, and if they wanted to, could just say ""fuck you"" to their boss and quit on the spot rather than do something against their will like work unpaid overtime - which I am sure everyone reading this has done at some point. Things change when you have fuck you money and that is a subject worth talking about in-depth on its own. 

What ends up happening when you make ""your passion"" your job is that you end up not only dreading an activity you used to once love, you lose something that used to be your escape from work which you now no longer have. The reality is that as long as we are forced to do work to survive, it doesn't matter what kind of work it is, the sheer fact that you are forced to do it everyday without choosing your own terms makes it fucking unbearable!

So, for your own sake, face reality, recognise work for what it is, an unavoidable reality where we trade labour for means to survive - and don't let it corrupt your enjoyment of whatever you're passionate about. ",False,nskclk,apparentreality,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nskclk/why_do_what_you_love_and_youll_never_work_a_day/,30,1

I’m at breaking point. 

I am in my final year of university and I can count on two hands all of the part time menial jobs I’ve had to afford living and studying costs but never managed to retain them because I can just never fit in or I am utterly miserable there.

I don’t know if it’s because I’m neurodiverse but I just do not click in a working environment with anyone else and it’s probably because I’m bad at the jobs I do. I am bad at organising, coordinating, balancing, remembering things (aka table numbers at restaurants etc). Everyone must think I’m an idiot because of it, when I am in fact intellectually not.

The past two week or so I have became suicidal at the prospect of having to work for the rest of my life. What if I can’t get a job in my desired field because of how competitive it is? What if I have to work in menial job environments that make me miserable and I don’t fit in so I change it up annually. What if I can’t provide for my future family? The lack of job security? Not being able to enjoy my free time? Not able to explore my passions fully? 

Capitalism sucks. I’m really, really struggling with the concept of the slave labour we’re expected to provide just so that we can have a roof over our heads, food to eat and heating to keep us warm.

3843,On Optimism and General Strikes,"This sub is a huge fucking bummer. Not because anyone here is wrong-- they're painfully right, in fact. It's just the attitude of being beaten down by capitalism with no hope of getting up.

In spite of how collectively boned we'll all be if things don't get on the right track, I remain optimistic that the world will get better. It has to get better-- otherwise, we're all dead, and if we're all dead, then none of this will really matter, will it? There's nothing to fear, because we have nothing left to lose.

I see signs that things are getting better. People are leeching off unemployment benefits in record numbers, as they should. The Edelman Trust Barometer shows that 80% of people no longer believe that working hard will lead to a better life. We're waking up to the fact that the system is broken, that the economy no longer works for us, and that we're not getting the returns from a society we paid into. The only logical conclusion is to check out and refuse to play the game.

We have to remind ourselves every day that WE have the power here. That the system only functions on the back of OUR labor, that the pigs rely on US to make their product and line their pocketbooks. We can collapse the house of cards in a matter of days-- but we can't do it alone. We can only do it by banding together and never budging, no matter what.

3853,Indeed.com keeps rejecting my honest 1-star review of my old crappy job. Ill just post it here then,"Locations and personal details will be redacted.

""I worked in the **\[location redacted\]** branch for just under 3 years before I was let go due to downsizing. This job is a dead-end endeavor and you will be wasting your time working here. There is no potential for advancement within the company, no overtime, reduced work hours when theres not a lot of work, no potential for a raise, and the benefits are very basic. My mental health took a huge toll at this job with my time here. Many things over the course I worked here had to be axed because management realized they can get away with treating their employees like robots.

Favoritism among specific staff was very apparent. You cannot talk at all during work and you will be let known of it if you do, except if you're a favorite. You will be lectured by upper management for being less than 5 minutes late to work or leaving work 5 minutes early, despite there being nothing to work on. Staff belittles other staff, and sometimes they get chewed out pretty brutally for small and trivial errors. They do not care about the wellbeing of their employees and will extract as much labor out of you as they are able 

There is no training at all for your specific position (in this case mine was document scanner), literally just given a sheet of paper with instructions. You are left with no understanding at all of what you're supposed to do in the grand scheme of things, no idea about the hardware you're using, as well as the software, and told the very basics of how to do the most basic operations of the machine to facilitate the project you're supposed to scan and NOTHING more. Then if any issues cropped up with the documents or machine, you were left in the dark and forced to walk up ask questions. Sometimes the supervisor is not there so you can get left stranded sometimes. It took me a lot longer than it should have how to entirely operate the machine, because they don't have enough people or time to properly train their staff on the plethora of random things/situations that can potentially come up. Sometimes, you are left in the dark on purpose for a specific error, issue or task you need being done, and have to walk up and ask the supervisor, simply because the error is out of your job position/experience. Management is uncoordinated and nobody has the patience to sit down for a few minutes and teach me how to operate a piece of software that other people who have been in the company longer, and also have the same position as me, know how to use.

Heres a specific example. The job requires the file name to be exact and proper for the client. If I, (a document scanner,) make one small typo for the files I have to scan, that's potentially thousands of files outputted that have to be renamed, which is a very time consuming process to rename them one by one. The Windows 7 operating system does not have the ability to let you bulk rename files. There is software that allows you to bulk rename files. I have to, every time there I make a small typo, walk up and ask my supervisor to use the software for me to bulk rename the files. Sometimes the supervisor is not there, and I'm stuck with a folder full of wrongly named files that need renaming. 

If they had just sat down with me for 5 minutes, once, and taught me how to use the program, then I'd never have to walk up and ask for their help or worry about the supervisor not being there when I need assistance.

Two months into me working here, I made a trivial error where there is a label on the entire stack of physical documents that demarcate a specific chunk of documents within the whole stack to be scanned double sided, and not all single sided. Nobody trained me on that when I was working here for the first two months, then immediately when I make the mistake of scanning the whole stack single sided, I get written up for poor job performance and got scolded and blamed for messing something up that I wasn't even trained on or let known in the first place. 

They don't have the time, patience or energy to help you get a better understanding of your job and train you, but have plenty of energy to quickly jump on you if you do wrong, even the slightest. Certain staff have belittled me and made me feel stupid several times for asking questions or trying to get a better understanding of certain aspects of my position. There was a lot of condescension and a overall additute of superiority among higher staff, like to them I am a child who needs every detail explained thoroughly. It's very infantilizing and patronizing.

You often have to do the work of two people in one job. The machines constantly break and they will keep repairing them until they completely break down at the expense of the safety of employees. There a days where this job erodes your mental health and you will get very angry and stressed out with the machines because they will keep breaking down. With the combination of both workload, the machines having issues, and the Prep quality of the work coming to you, it makes you feel hopeless and out of control some days.

There was little to no overtime preceding COVID-19 and they reduced hours significantly if there was not enough work to go share between the whole company. Sometimes you're left doing very menial tasks like sweeping, wiping down desks, folding letters, etc. and having to pretend to work, simply because you are not allowed to leave when there is nothing. It's very degrading to your self worth as a human being. Sometimes you get full days off because of the lack of work which I prefered, as I'm better off doing literally nothing than sweeping a warehouse for 8 hours.

The only thing I regret NOT doing when working here was quitting earlier. This job has taken an absolute toll on my physical and mental health over the time working here, and the only way to make myself feel better for all the time I've wasted, is warning people to not make the same mistake that I did. I apologize for not being professional as I wanted, but if you were at where I was at, you would feel the same way.""",False,nt1mpe,spnzer,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nt1mpe/indeedcom_keeps_rejecting_my_honest_1star_review/,6,1

I am also privileged to live in a country where I receive 21 days of annual leave plus 10 government-assigned mandatory holidays, something all the Americans would kill for. **But I still feel miserable.** Now, I wasn't happy before wageslavery either - I have been depressed for 9 years before that *(and if I had my way, my only interaction with human society would be buying groceries, because I am antisocial and ultra-introverted)*. But it was still such a huge downgrade in my quality of life. Before that, my life was browsing the Internet till 3 AM *(I'm a night person)*, waking up at 11 AM, eating lunch, spending the rest of my day petting my cat, playing video games and browsing the Internet. Compared to that, having to wake up at 7 AM to commute to work, then coming home at 7 PM *(because commute on public transport takes 2 hours, so 9-to-5 really was 7-to-7 for me)* was a huge downgrade. I was already depressed before, but this made me even more depressed. Even after we switched to remote work, I still resent work.

Well, that was an overly long segue.

What I wanted to say is, I came to this subreddit assuming that anti-work just means anti-work. Hatred towards the concept of full-time employment, and a desire to make work optional, e.g. via a Universal Basic Income. However, much to my disappointment, what I found is a subreddit full of hardcore Communists who believe that you can't be anti-work without also being anti-rich, without wanting to redistribute all the wealth, without ending free enterprise, without beheading everyone who has a net worth over $1000.

Who else on this subreddit is anti-work *(in the literal sense of the word, without anything extra)*, but still thinks that Capitalism can be salvaged *(e.g. via a Universal Basic Income that covers the basics)*, or just simply wants to make work optional without the need to eat the rich? **Who else on this subreddit is just anti-work in the literal sense of the word, without anything extra?**

And to all the hardcore leftists on this subreddit: if the rich offered you to make a compromise *(not saying that it'd happen, just saying* ***hypothetically****)* and implement a Universal Basic Income that covers the basics, while automating away all the unpleasant work - why wouldn't you accept it? **Isn't the goal to abolish forced wageslavery?**",False,nsq1ki,Metalhead33,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nsq1ki/anyone_who_is_just_antiwork/,104,1

3878,"My ""dream job"" made me miserable","Hey everyone. I don't know if this post belongs here, so please delete if it doesn't.

I spent years getting a bachelor's then a master's degree to get my ""dream job,"" which was being a mental health counselor. I did this because my ultimate goal was to help people and make lives better. 

Turns out the companies you work for when you're a counselor is a giant machine meant to squeeze as much out of you as it can, before you burn out completely and end up resenting rather than feeling compassion for the people you're supposed to help. 

I worked as a counselor for five months before I was burnt out and suicidal from helping high risk, high acuity clients back to back to back without enough breaks or opportunities for self care. It wasn't uncommon for me to have a ten hour day with five clients back to back without a break in the afternoons. My caseload was upwards of 60 people that I needed to counsel, track, and speak to parole officers, DHS caseworkers, and anyone else involved in their care.

When I got burned out, the company made it seem like it was my fault for not practicing good enough ""self care,"" when really they were expecting way too much from a single person. Now I'm in the same company in a less stressful role, but barely earning enough to pay my rent. Sometimes I get suicidal because it seems like either I figuratively kill myself helping others, or I spend the rest of my life earning just enough to scrape by on.

I'm so tired of living this life where my worth is determined by how much I'm willing to break my back for someone else. I may go back to counseling eventually, otherwise I'll never be able to move ahead financially. But for now I feel so jaded, angry, and betrayed.

3890,I feel like there is only one way out,"i’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. I just graduated university, so i’m ‘coming into adulthood’ now, and the daunting idea of paying income tax, housing tax, bills, healthcare etc (essentially paying to be alive) is looming ever closer.

when i was younger, I had so many dreams of how my adult life was going to be. the adults around me at the time were all so optimistic, and made me believe I could be and do whatever I wanted to do. I was very self assured and confident in my future. But now that I am actually living in that future, and am in that adult world, I feel hopeless. the fact that to be a person you HAVE to slave away in a shitty job, wasting your limited time on this earth, to earn a bare minimum just to stay alive is…. horrendous. the fact that basic necessities like food, water, shelter and healthcare aren't free is atrocious. 

Our society has made it so that even a simple and regular life is basically unattainable. even if you work 9-5, 5 days a week, you still wont be able to afford more than bare minimum. wtf is up with that.

freedom is unachievable. recently I’ve just been wanting to escape to the countryside and become self sustained, but even that costs a LOT of money, and would require years and years and years of working in an unhappy miserable career.

you have to work and be a wage slave in society, or society doesn’t want you. if you choose not to work and go on benefits, everyone else looks down on you and sees you as an undesirable leech. the only way to be truly free of all this is to exit society, and the only way to exit society is to commit suicide. but even that is frowned upon and seen as a horrendous thing to do (it was once a criminalised act!) because they dont want people to exit society! they want everyone to remain as cogs in their system, without freedom. they dont want people to feel as if they have a way out.

honestly though I am starting to see suicide as the only option. I dont want people here to take pity on me saying that, or think I am making a cry for attention etc etc. I literally just think suicide is the only way out of a capitalistic world. I dont want to participate in this society that has been set up, I dont want to work everyday for the rest of my life, but I also dont want to starve or be homeless, so what other option do I have?

I hate that this feels like my only option. I was so excited for the future, so excited for my adult life, but the harsh reality has slapped me in the face and its incredibly stressful and upsetting",False,nraxw4,mushleap,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nraxw4/i_feel_like_there_is_only_one_way_out/,86,1

3900,How to avoid working for someone else FOREVER.,"&amp;#x200B;

Greetings,

I recently joined this group after it was pointed out to me over at Zerohedge.  It was one of those articles where the OP was bemoaning the fact that there were all these jobs yet no one wanted them.  Well, now that I'm over here visiting, I thought I'd drop some wisdom that will help you guys that never ever ever again wish to work for someone else.  Here is how you do it.

Go into business for yourself as I did 22 years ago when I got sick of all the things you guys talk about.  Actually, I had no choice as my sister had bought for me my first ever dog - a female black lab that I named ""Daisy"".  As soon as I had her I decided that I couldn't leave such a cute puppy home all by herself each and every day.  The very next day after getting her I gave my notice.

I decided that I'd do things related to sound - musician, audio engineer, local roadie, house sound guy at a sleazy club, etc.  Sometimes the money was good and sometimes not so good but I can tell you that Daisy spent the last 4 years of her life living with me on a sailboat in S. California.  Hell, I even hired a surf instructor to teach her how to surf which she loved to do.

Here is the best part:  Once you have worked for yourself for a couple of years, no one will ever consider hiring you for anything 9 to 5 related as you are now a walking Red Flag.  I've talked to a number of high-ranking HR people off the record and ALL have told me that any resume with a history of business ownership on it gets immediately thrown into the trash.  I've been told that business owners make the worst employees because they can see every bit of bullshit going on - all of it and they tend to share that info with the other employees.

I've tested this theory dozens of times as (for giggles) I will apply to some job that I am completely qualified for and I never hear back from anyone except for one time.  A video production company needed someone to manage their post-production team and somehow my resume didn't go into the trash and somehow slipped thru.  Anyway, I went to the interview because I was curious as to what I'd earn doing work like that as I've certainly run quite a few crews doing subcontracted media work.  Frankly, it is good to know what you are worth.

So, the owner of the company and I are talking for a few minutes and he interrupts himself mid-sentence to say, ""I can't hire you.  If I hired you, I'd be working for YOU in two weeks' time.""  Of course, I had just answered his silly ""Where do you see yourself. . . . "" question.  My answer was:  I see myself in your chair but it isn't going to take me 5 years or even 5 months because the amount of money you are going to have to give me will necessitate you out hustling for new clients while I run all this.""

So guys, put your money where your mouth is and go work for yourself.  You will be seen as worse than a leper and no one will ever consider hiring you no matter how qualified you are.  You will be Antiwork for the rest of your life.

&amp;#x200B;

When it came around for my work eval, i was told point blank that i almost lost my job because I missed 110 hours of work (which equates to all the days I missed due to husband/baby. None of those days were personal to me) in three months. I was told if I had interest in keeping my job, then i needed to start coming to work more. I lost my shit. I work in water filtration. I understand that my job is important, but fucking shit, you really expect me to just abandon my family to come and clock the fuck in. Hell I'm the type of person that can't even function properly when something is heavy on my mind like oh i don't know, my husband could've fuckin died from a high speed crash and only got put of it with a broken leg.....or my child is sick and husband can't adequately care for her so now it's all me.

3926,What the hell should I do with myself?,"I am at a huge dilemma in my life. I will try to make this as short as possible but please excuse me if I don't. I really need help. 

I originally got a massage therapy license in Texas 7 years ago in 2014 and in 2016 I moved back to California where I'm from originally and I transferred my massage license to California and I let the Texas license expire. I was staying with my mom and stepdad in texas. Well I'm not really making it here in California and things did not go as planned so I think I might have to move back to Texas and stay with my mom and stepdad again. But since it has been more than 3 years since my Texas license expired I need to take the massage licensing exam all over again. It's called the mblex if it matters to you. It will cost $265 to retake the test and then the application fee is $100 plus $35 for this stupid Texas jurisprudence test. This honestly is not worth it for a stupid weekend job at a spa literally only getting paid $15 an hour after taxes and before tips. And I don't know how to market myself worth a shit. I went to massage school, not marketing school. In general I don't like doing massage anymore. 

Are there any licenses that I can get for jobs that are not like a typical job? I was thinking I could get a Texas real estate license. I mean I really don't need to make a lot of money. I would be happy with like $25,000 to $35,000 a year. I have no kids and I'm happily single. I just simply want a job that is not stressful that will enable me to make enough money to put myself through a bachelor's degree program for biochemistry.

I'm not interested in real estate but I'm good at faking things. 

Are there any other licenses or certifications I can get for a job that is not like a typical job? Typical job meaning you have to go to a building for like 6 to 8 hours a day getting paid slave wages.

3966,"MOST workplaces are ""toxic work environments""","Newsflash, it's not news to people that most workplaces in the U.S. are toxic places to work.

When the Ellen Show made headlines last year that the workplace there was extremely toxic and abusive to employees, including Ellen herself who was accused of being the one who fostered that kind of work environment, is it really that shocking?

I feel like most workplaces in the U.S. are nasty, abusive, spirit-breaking places to work with at least one bully of a boss.

However, it won't make headlines if a McDonald's location is a toxic work environment.

I see it all the time reading subreddits like r/jobs, r/hatemyjob, this one, etc.

I can certainly attest to that, having worked in fast-food.

3968,"I love how Capitalists claim that living with our parents is both ""getting what we deserve,"" and also ""totally unfair of us.""","*Which one is it again?* 

Do they think supporting an economic system that has no problem forcing adults to take care of other adults is fair, or don't they? They can't have it both ways. If you don't think it's the responsibility of society as a whole to feed itself, fine, but if that's your belief then why do so many of you get upset at the thought of all the thousands of 18+ year olds living with their parents still? 

Capitalists wanted situations like that to occur all over the world as ""that's whats fair."" Letting humans go without food, water and shelter by default is ""fair"" in their eyes. We're under Capitalism, they're currently getting their way, and yet all they do is complain about how much they hate it. 

If you're a Capitalist, you are directly responsible and in support of forcing parents to take care of their kids into adulthood. That is, like it or not, how your system functions. You can't claim both that it's a ""fair situation"" that is well deserved by us and also a ""totally unfair situation"" that is not deserved by our parents. It's your system.

3998,Any gurus/experts on corporate-speak(bs) willing to help semi-desperate soul out w/paid resume coverletter help? Pretty desperate tbh!,"Sorry, I know this isn't exactly up antiwork's alley, but it's closest to my sensibility overall.

I'm Pro-labor (and human endeavor), and Anti-Work -- Not full on -- 4 days is a minimum acceptable standard w/living wage &amp; some vacation that I could reasonably say is a fairish compromise and reasonable step in the right direction. 6 hours is ideal, and I'm v. unhappy about the jobstyle-creep of 9-5 to 8-5/9-6 w/unpaid lunch, how exactly did that happen?! (\*theystorians I'm not looking for an answer. It happened, is the point, and that's on the ""good"" end of things). And if work is your joy and your about it all the time good for you, do you. (Workaholism maybe can have some good outcomes, but also ""can be a problem that maybe one might wanna address in a best/better case scenario"")

Like a lot of people in this space, I'm very pro-productivity. It's hard to be healthy mentally and emotionally, and arguably is a situational outcome (including biochemical &amp; genetic disposition), and there are many approaches to problem-solving, which is undeniably hard and inherently challenging even if you try and get all tao about it. Consciousness - it's a lot to deal with. Honestly, I'm not trying to point fingers at culprits, bystanders are culpable too and it's thorny to get into how things got off the rails and who's responsible. It's a human tendency, likely pretty biologically rooted, and we're just trying to figure out how to best rock and roll, or dubstep or kpop or whatever, ""make the music happen"" and deal with our demons (collectively), and hopefully maybe intentionally create rather than be beholden to our more screwed up impulses and ignorances. We're in this together at some level and I hope all of you have some small (or great) comfort and joy despite whatever challenges you have, although obviously sometimes that's simply not possible in more extreme situations.

I want to clarify that ""productivity"" isn't an external value, it can be super productive to one's mental health and community values to daydream or even simply veg. There's not necessarily a universal field theory when it comes to human beings, if you wanted to throw that love word out there, that's fine, but clearly we also have a full gamut of emotions (maybe that's a brilliance of gaming) and frustration is clearly a core one we have to contend with (easily leading to lower-hanging fruit solutions of anger and hate) , so the whole thing's very dynamic.

Anyway, back to my own situational ""work"" semi-horrible work-crisis -- I feel like I have to preface this by saying I feel this heavy deal of comparison to very bad/worse case scenarios which frankly feels kind of like messing with my head -- Like yes... human (and animal) suffering has a very deep bottom and if you want to even get all existential about it even we're all going to die and those we are fortunate enough to love will also die - there's some hard truth's out there, although personally perhaps flippantly I find living more daunting then the prospect of dying. All our problems will be over soon enough, until the next life at least... But in the meantime...!

In the meantime, we're tying to make a go of it, and make the best of it, and figure this ish out to the best of our ability, and hopefully grab a little joy out of the experience, hey, maybe even a lot.

So yeah, uh, my job is not sparking joy and I feel this heavy oppressive energy that I should be grateful because it can be and is so much worse for so many... I hope we can collectively navigate to less misery and to greater mental and emotional health. 

But I'm not trying to realize it can be worse - this is worse for me, and maybe as good as it gets but I'm hoping and trying to get out of the path of the blows (not to leave others in the path, but to practice not being beat), and it does feel like there's an element of abuse that it's maybe useful to sidestep. Like in a domestic violence situation, one has to kind of desperately try to extract onesself from that messed up dynamic. And one might need help with that.

Who's fault is it, the larger picture, where's the best pressure points to try and alleviate or address, to some extent we're all here figuring that stuff out the best we can. 

Right now, I'm climbing up a little hill, but it's a big one for me. I know the whole thing is a monster with it's head cut off... I'm trying to put the head back on... maybe the monsters are just really lost folk (to put it mildly). Maybe sometimes lost beyond redemption, but there's vastness that's salvageable if we can learn and create better ways and implement them.

And, we're trying as best we can. We got a lot of untapped potential! Humanity it can be, sometimes, the greatest!! So interesting and passionate and creative and so often times confused.

But, uh, yeah... I'm just looking for someone who might be able to help with a hand up out of a weird and bad situation in one micro situation in a whole lot of macro. I've burned this situation I'm in, it's unsalvageable and I'm trying to minimize the damage at this point. I didn't light the fire, I'm a burn victim here an I'm trying to get out in as healthy a way as possible, if possible. There's a lot of people burned worse, but again I'm trying to aim high and have a healthy relationship - if I can possibly manage to do so.

My relationship with my own self, and my ingenuity and ability to problem solve, again just in this little micro situation. Unfortunately the worst in people has come out, there's a whole little backstory (what's that thing about all good families being alike and all bad ones bad/unhappy in their own way...) but let's just say I didn't have the political skills and charisma/influential techniques to create a pathway for the people around me to vaya con dios, and I'm going away ""with learnings"" but a lot of those learnings are of the things-go-wrong variety... It's definitely been an experience but I'm trying to get out now asap. And I guess I should try and leverage the experience to another hop in the frying pan since I could probably conceivably manage that. I got in the lower rungs of the corporate world, and I'd like to like Homer Simpson fade back in the bushes... down the road I hope I'll be able to contribute to more dynamic and creative solutions, but I'm not kicking the can down the road in saying ""hey, I learned a lot in a way by experiencing this scenario (the 9-5, wait I mean 8:30 to 5:30) and it's probably good I had this experience -- also, it was definitely practical even if it came at a high cost"" and I probably have one more jump in me if I can manage it to make use of the (so very minimal) ""privilege"" and opportunity. 

A lateral jump. Obviously, it's not my scene. It's not anybody's scene although I tend to think most of us really do get off on and get into being productive, but we have those daemons and primitive tendencies to contend with and -potentially hopefully- navigate. I was really into it and tried to be a good egg but obviously the conditions frequently don't support that, and this was not the exception that proved the rule. Overperforming (in my very underperforming way) did not ease the way in the random vagaries of my particular situation, it just set the stage for an untenable bad story. Again, not a unique story or situation, but I do feel like there is some oportunites for learnings there (some idealism remains!) although I'm not sure what exactly. Like how do you be high performing in a healthy way? How do you be that trendsetter in a cultural environment that gets everybody on board to functioning smoothly? I missed a better era of my department (again, a low-level one not fancy w/so-called-privileged)  I was hired at the tail end of an era, which is why I took the job, but then the longstanding (lower level) manager took a hasty exist and ""things changed"" (that's why she took the exit, it's clear). Anyway, I was kind of a virgin even though I'm a million years old and was a kid more than a million and a half years ago, but still, yeah, I did that a little bit for a long time (years! more than one years! multiple years! plural years! )

I should probably do it another year or so, but then again... I'm not a practical person -- and this situation is on it's last legs. I learned the job, plus a lot of other skills (not political, those skills remain pretty flat), and I could do this job in another company. I have one shot at that, possibly, with a jump, otherwise that ship is going to pass, and I'll need some other scenario, maybe better maybe worse. But I might be able to manage a ""practical"" one-more-go-round in a new place without the baggage of the unsalvageable personal relationship drama/trauma. 

This would require resume(s) and cover letter(s), and might be a long shot anyways. My chances would be much better with skilled/professional help -- I could pay (or beg, or beg &amp; pay) for that (finding it's the problem), but I dunno if I have it in me to make a res let alone cover letter, at the best times I'm not gifted at that. So meybe I can pay some one to talk that corporate speak for me in order to make an escape.... Otherwise it's just a waiting of who will blink first, and I'm not sure who I'd put my money on (or what the timeline will be), I just know someone's gonna blink I'm pretty sure... I don't see that situation as sustainable, and it's definitely not healthy for me. I don't see a light at the end of that tunnel and I don't think I'm going to have any epiphanies.

So, I doubt anyone's made it this far, but anyone wiling to take pity and help me with resume/coverletter for same job elsewhere, or any recs for people who do that for $.

Thanks everyone, hope you all survive and really hope you get a some chances to thrive. I think one thing people miss about the value of this space is that it helps just to talk about things. Bringing awareness can add value in itself. I'm not really trying to demonize a system or a group (I can roll with enlightened capitalism, or self-interested altruism, or a system redesign or even incremental change, and worse case scenario at least it was a wild ride and a bunch of people did get to have some good experiences (of course we wish to try to be mindful of those who suffered and try to honor that is some way in the fullness of our souls)). People make mistakes.... sometimes really really really (inconceivably) bad ones. Minimizing harm if one can, and maybe even leaving the door open for redemption and for more optimal solutions to achieving a greater sense of well being seems like one leg of an approach that's maybe worth exploring. There are a lot of ways to try to tackle problems which is really a very basic fundamental of the human condition.",False,nrrxpz,ScientificIteration,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nrrxpz/any_gurusexperts_on_corporatespeakbs_willing_to/,1,1

restaurant complaining about not being able to
hire staff I'm donna go the fuck off and pay for ff
advertising and make a fucking ulcer that makes it
more than clear why you are having these issues
since y'all apparently think complaining about it
and blaming people for not wanting to work in the
shittiest industry (overall, | know there's good jobs
in the service industry they are just very few) is
going to help.

Listen, you pay like shit. You treat your staff like
shit. Your customers treat your staff like shit. To
one has to work for you. Deaf if they are on
unemployment. Good for them for being able to
avoid working for poverty wages for you to bitch
they didn't roll enough silverware after working 8
hours for $4.50 an hour or whatever plus $40
worth of tips. To one wants to do that shit any
more. May better and treat your staff better, like
give them breaks and free food? By job has given
me over $10,000 worth of electronics since
starting 2 years ago. Tucking While's will fire you
for eating a french cry 7 hours into your shift while
you're starving. Luck off with this shit. | really can't
stand this entitled ass older generation who
expects us to keep working ourselves to death all
while staying perpetually miserable. Seriously,
fuck off.

We are told that we should be grateful for the opportunity to be exploited on a daily basis. Why are people having children knowing this is the world we live in? What is the God damn point in that? Why is it like this? Why does it have to be this way? Does anyone really have any kind of solution to this problem? I am on the verge of suicide at this point as I see no other way out than an early grave. I fucking hate whoever constructed this bullshit idea of civilization. We are all suffering with no justification or reason other than human filth and greed. 

The whole concept of life in general doesn't make much sense to me. You're born into this world screaming and crying. Go to school for 12+ years to be trained how to be a good worker so you can make the boss money. Then spend the rest of your life hoping and praying for a retirement that may never come. Living for any second of ""free time"" we get which isn't even half of our waking ours. This is modern slavery, how does everyone not see this? How can we all just accept this for what it is? Rules aren't real, time isn't real it's all just made up bullshit to control the population. Is it just me or does anyone else just want to burn it all down and start over.

My explanation for these people is that they are either employing these workers and don't want to pay more, they are jealous because they have to pay of college (which should not be a thing you have to do, education should be free if we want a better society) or they are basically don't want these people to live in our society.

I brought it up with management and the response was that it's not going to change, and when I told them that I'm not happy and that other people aren't happy either they started a new ""effort"" to emotionally support others with bonding and fun activities, and like an idiot I agreed to be part of it, I thought it would help me and others but I was definitely wrong.

Right now I'm thinking about taking a pay cut and reducing my hours to just 30 a week and even though this would mean that our ability to save money will be dramatically reduced (my wife is working part time already) I don't think it matters, I am miserable every day and can't keep going like that.",False,nrz690,Senuhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nrz690/ive_been_working_remotely_for_6_years_now_and_i/,5,1

First of all, these jobs really prey on people who can’t afford to make minimum wage. I mean for fucks sake, a lot of these jobs require you to do restraints and clients can knock you out and hurt you. I totally understand that it’s not the client’s fault, they have trauma, but Jesus fucking Christ, if there’s a chance I’m going to get my shit rocked, $15/hour ain’t cutting it. 

I was in the second day of my training, and I already could tell it wasn’t going to work out. The training was disorganized as fuck and I could tell that the culture of the organization was “it’s us vs. them” in regards to the clients. That to me is incredibly wrong. The clients were traumatized youth. If that’s the organization’s attitude, maybe the organization shouldn’t exist and gee, I don’t know, maybe you should PAY YOUR FUCKING EMPLOYEES MORE.

I hate having to talk to them all the time and ask questions because I know they're also busy and don't like being interrupted.

But what I'm really terrified of is living every day like this until I'm old. I just can't imagine how all those people can do it without wishing to kill themselves every day.

4064,"Capitalism doesn't care about if you contribute to society, it cares if you make money.","Often our critics wonder how would people contribute to society without the incentive of money? Money is not the only incentive to contribute to society and many people want to contribute to society because they care about their community but they may not care about making money.

Some forms of contributing to society may not be skilled enough to get a job but they are still valuable things to do.

Ways that people contribute to society without making money.

* Being a parent
* Organizing a free store to give away items
* Being a good friend
* Volunteering at a charity organization
* Going to protests and rallies
* Sharing art that you don't want to sell
* Making blog articles

This is why capitalism is bad. It values a person more just because they make more money. A billionaire is seen as more valuable to society because he owns all the factories and makes a lot of products even though he has a monopoly on those products, and he's seen as more valuable than the single mother trying to raise her two kids into functioning members of society.

They believe that, for their reputation, no one should ever know that somebody (me) from their company caught the virus during the middle of a fucking pandemic.

They threatened to fire me because I simply let my _PRIVATE_ group of friends, on my _PRIVATE_ social media account, that I was infected and had to stay quarantined in a hotel.

I don't know if it's due to the collectivism that permeates the culture of the country I'm living in (Japan), but fuck me they're really taking it too far.

Wanna know better?

They've called me every single day of my quarantine to guilt trip me because the people I was interacting with had to switch to remote working for a week which, in their words, caused unprecented chaos and instability throughout the whole company. 

My apologies to them are evidently not enough in their eyes, so what's next?

Kneeling in front of them to receive forgivenes?

What a great example of solidarity towards a fellow worker who did his best to stay indoors and caught the virus anyway.

If it came to this, maybe I shouldn't have given a fuck like all my colleagues do and just went to the office without ever taking a PCR test.

apparently all of the employees quit that day as an organized strike for low pay and bad working conditions.

it appeared as it was the girls first job. 

The guy was yelling at her so bad because they didn’t have enough workers to keep up with consumer demand, so they just closed down for the day.

I've been at my company for nearly 4 years, and haven't really started seriously applying to anything until recently and I have to say:

What the hell happened?

Every job I'm applying for now (mostly using Indeed and Monster) has become a painful slog, and I'm already half tempted to give up and accept my lot in life.

Seems like every employer wants you to create an account on their page, fill out their shitty forms and then, after all of that SUBMIT THE RESUME. Seriously? What is the point of all the extra busy work?

Oh... and don't get me started on the assessments. At least half of these companies are requiring applicants to take some kind of skill/personality assessment. One of the skill assessments I took had 89 questions on it. 

 I even had a fake phone interview yesterday, where I had to record verbal responses to a bunch of dumbass questions such as:

- What motivates you at work other than a paycheck?

- Explain a time you had to deal with a difficult customer/coworker

- Why are you applying here?

Seriously... Filling out a  SINGLE job application shouldn't take me an hour. Especially considering that I'm probably going to be doing 40-50 of them before I get a decent lead.

4136,Managed to break free from 'employment' recently,"It wasn't working out for me. Having been a reader of this subreddit for years, I know y'all know the feeling. The purposelessness of going into work and coming back, getting hooked on to the paycheck that comes in every 2 weeks so you pay rent and bills and go out to dinner with friends and then wait for the next paycheck to come by so you can repeat it all over again, all the while feeling wasted when you're on job.

It took a couple of massive misfortunes for it to hit home, but it did. My employer went under right at the beginning of covid. Found another job, that employer went under about 13 months into covid. I was actually a valued employee at both places. After the first employer going broke, I started frantically looking into side gigs and hustles. Tried a bunch of things, failed at most of them, finally found something that worked for me so I doubled down on it to get more cash from there.

When the next employer went broke, I didn't go out to find another job. I'd had enough of this crap. My side gig was providing rent &amp; food money. It's been two months and I still have a long way to do but I'm not dipping into my small pot of savings to get by. I'm going to put in all my efforts into my hustle and be employed to no one. It is a pretty kick-ass feeling. I make slightly less than half of the paychecks I used to get but I at least don't spend a moment of my day in a dead-end way. I work 25hrs a week and chill the remainder of the time. I plan to go up to 40-50hrs of work a week but again, not a moment of it is going to be purposeless

Many people are in need of different things from antibiotics to major surgeries. I feel as if we didn’t have systems like this where the average human is mostly prone to be a wage slave, the medical issue wouldn’t be a problem since we’d have other remedies and sources to work with.

So with that his money would be enough to retire 470,000 people. Each making that ~$2,000 a month. If each of those people donated $100 a month to a fund to retire more people it would generate $47,000,000. Which would be enough to retire 117 people each and every month, forever. But if each of them also contributed each month more people would be able to be retired each month. And it would continue to increase as long as people contributed until there was no one left.

4146,I need to vent about the slap in the face I got today,"  

Strap-in guys, this post is about to be long, and I don’t care if it gets like 2 upvotes, I just need to get this off my chest.

So about 2 years ago I got this awesome job that was perfect for me. I could work part time in the year while going to school and it was full time in the summer. The boss was great, and I liked the other employees and I felt that they respected me. I had worked in back breaking jobs like a factory before and I hated it, and this was a calm office job with a bit of customer service. I maybe would not have done this for all my life, but I would have at least kept going while I was still in school. Honestly, great experience.

But then the pandemic hit. I worked at an essential service, so work did not stop but everything changed. The old boss quit because of burnout and the new one sucks (probably got here by licking balls). The employees I liked quit and got replaced by people that obviously do not respect me. I got social anxiety, but with the old employees I could still have a decent conversation. With the new ones I say hi and can you pass me the pen and that is pretty much it. These changes sucked, but it was still tolerable.

But then today, the boss tells me to meet him at 2pm (he tells me that at 7am, leaving me stressing all day) and starts the meeting by asking me what I strive for in life. Kind of a weird question, and I give a bullshit answer by saying I like “learning” and “getting better”. He then says he’s thinking of cutting my hours because I don’t have the “drive” or “initiative” for the “mission” when the job is just a repetition of simple tasks and a bit of customer service. He then says I’m not made for this kind of job (which is kinda true tbh, because this a social job and I’m not really social). He says he’s not going to fire me, but only make me work for like 5 days a month (the big days). He also sneakily said that he’s going to make me do things I never done before and that are above my pay grade and he’s questioning if I’ll be able to do them. But then at the end of the meeting he says that he’s not going to cut my hours, if I present him with a letter proving him why I’m “worth” this job. I say present, because I can’t just write the letter and send it by email, he wants me to read it to him and sell myself at the same. He gave me a week to do this. So, to keep my hours, I would have to write a whole letter, then go to the office on a day I’m not working, then “perform” the letter to him and beg for my job, just to have a chance of have the same schedule I had with the old boss. I found that honestly dehumanizing and cruel, I legit almost cried. Oh btw, since this is a student job, the government is literally paying the company to have me full time for the summer so it’s not like it’s a money problem. 

So my options are quitting and going through the torture of finding another job, keep the job but with way less hours or go through his stupid games to maybe keep my hours.

4149,Should we make a GoFundMe for this?,"After following this page for a long time, I have begun to be more open to the idea of asking people for financial help when you could ""survive"" on your own. Technically, we could continue to live out of my in-law's house for the next year or so until we save enough to get a place of our own, but I don't know that that is the best for our marriage. I figured you guys would have an interesting perspective to share on whether or not people would actually donate or if they would see us as lazy. This is what the description of it would be, plus it explains everything:

""After living with Noah's family for 6 months after getting married in January, we are looking for an apartment of our own. Emma's car needs over $1,000 in fixes (plus purchasing it from her parents for a similar amount), Noah's will most likely need that amount or more in fixes very soon, we have medical debt, and we will have to start paying off Emma's $70,000 in student debt within the next couple of months. With $5,000 in the bank currently, there's not a lot to go around. Of course Noah is currently working at a job he enjoys and Emma will be getting a part time job soon. Nevertheless we are very anxious about the future and don't know when we'll be able to afford a place of our own and pay off Emma's debt while still building up our savings (and, ya know, enjoying life).

The reason for asking for $5,000 is because we want to have at least $10,000 in emergency savings before we would feel comfortable saving up for things like a house, traveling, and the possibility of children in the future. 

We don't want to ask for help, but after a lot of contemplating and praying, we have decided to create this GoFundMe, since we had a very small wedding and no one was able to participate in a registry, as is customary.""

I told my mom about this and asked her advice. She said she would be embarrassed if I made the GoFundMe, citing the fact that I haven't gotten a job yet (even though I was a full time until early last month and my car stopped working 3 weeks ago and we haven't been able to afford/find the time to get it fixed). I think it's not a terrible idea to ask for some help, while also finding myself a part time job (since I also take care of all of the cleaning, laundry, and most of the cooking because my husband works full time. Of course she argues that I should get a full time job anyway because ""If I can do it so can you"" ""Yeah but you're miserable all the time, mom.""). What do you guys think?

4162,The labor shortage is backsaw of a wage shortage-LETS GET REAL,"So today i walked into a Chipotle and the 16 year old girl behind the counter was being yelled at by some Chad that was angry the store was out of product like chicken and steak.

apparently all of the employees quit that day as an organized strike for low pay and bad working conditions.

it appeared as it was the girls first job. 

The guy was yelling at her so bad because they didn’t have enough workers to keep up with consumer demand, so they just closed down for the day. 

All i have to say is this: CORPORATIONS ARE SO GREEDY THAT THEY WOULD LITERALLY RATHER LOSE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A DAY BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO PAY MORE. 

It’s not that hard. now i am very unlikely to ever go back, and on top of that production is not being met because worker needs are not being met. 

Capitalism is not designed to work this way and Karl Marx predicted this would happen.

Later when my absolute idiot of a manager exited I realised his miserable disposition was partly due to the excruciating shits he had to endure.

Unemployed folk would pay 99¢, sign up for the service, be presented with a template where they would input their wage, duties that are off the table (removal of human waste, unloading trucks in the rain, etc.), ensure job security, etc. the website would allow for a download of a PDF to be printed; a viable legally binding work contract to be signed by expectant employee and expectant employer.

What would you think? Do you think this would have any success or impact? I know several local businesses near me that would give their left nut for workers.",False,nq2mnk,HippieCorps,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nq2mnk/thoughts_on_a_business_idea_i_had/,8,1
4212,I can never keep a job for too long,"Sorry this is a bit of a vent. I’m 18 and genuinely think I’m cursed. I’m currently working minimum wage at a retail store that I’ve been there for 3 weeks after having to leave a previous job as the work space was not safe. 

Now I check my roster to see if it’s been updated and see that I haven’t been given a shift at all for next week. This is extremely frustrating as it’s so hard for me to find a job since I don’t have a lot of work experience which is why I’ve started doing volunteer work as it’s the only place that would hire me and train me (it is also a retail position, it’s a second hand store). 

It pisses me off that every time i get hired for a paid role, I’m not good enough for them, as I’m either too “slow” or lack experience to be more of an effie by employee that they want me to be. 

I always show up on time and work at the best of my ability, cover shifts when someone has called in sick. And put in a cherry and bubbly and positivism attitude to work. But everytime I always end up on the short end of the stick 

This was a job was I happy and enjoyed working for. Customers were nice, there was always something to do, I’d never get bored but now I’m going to have to go job hunting again. I’m sad because I need the money in order to University next year. If I don’t have the funds I can’t go. It took me five months to get hired I’m sick of this :(

4226,"Current supervisors had my back re: the employer being deceptive about ""overtime""...so I walked","True story from May 2021: I was looking for a weekend job that wouldn't interfere w/ my part-time self-employment. I found, what I believed to be the perfect situation which was as a supervisor at a warehouse for Fri, Sat &amp; Sun. When I interviewed I was told that it would be rare and only in peak season where I would be asked to work four days per week. It's a warehouse so I get it! I negotiated my salary only after confirming it would be a weekend only position without interfering with my schedule/family time during the week and that four day weeks would be rare, if ever. This was confirmed!

Once I began, the training jumped off the rails immediately. They apparently did not realize I was starting on a Monday and believed I would be starting the next day. The HR person in charge of my onboarding was out until the next day. They didn't know where to put me, so they placed me w/ a supervisor to get the lay of the land. After he showed me the basics, I said to him: ""So, tell me what is the worst part of working here.""  He looked surprised, so I said it a different way:

""We are supervisors and we have to look out for each other. What am I really getting myself into that they are not telling me?""

He proceeded to tell me that for the past year and a half they have been working 6 days per week and the weekend shift working 5 days per week. He said that they have been promised that ""things will get better"" for so long that it has become a running joke among the supervisors. He mentioned the high turnover among the supervisors and that management is making decisions based upon not making things better, but because they believe the supervisors are replaceable.

I told my wife this and she said, ""Well, maybe with you there, it will get better."" So, I returned the next day for my onboarding. The HR person was not there and apparently the other 5 HR people had never done onboarding so I would likely be waiting 10-14 days b/c she had contact w/ someone who had Covid. 

Thus, once again, I was on the floor w/  different supervisors. I asked them the same question as I did the day prior and they all said virtually the same thing: ""How can we have record profits and no supervisor support?"" and ""I've been working 60-70 hours per week."" I asked if they pay overtime for supervisors and he said, ""No, you are bought and paid for."" (past jobs, I've received overtime/straight time)

This is what was irritating: I negotiated based upon 3 days and not 5. Each was a 12 hour workday. If I'm going to choose to work someplace, PAY ME FOR MY TIME and don't try to get over on me.

At the end of the 2nd day, I had ""trained"" w/ four supervisors and we all stood around talking. They did not say ONE good thing about the employer. Three of them had been there for years and, as a result, were divorced and living alone. One could no longer see his children because he worked too much. One more had no issue because this was the best job he'd ever had, he was a nationalized citizen from another country and his girlfriend also worked there with him (side note: his girlfriend made more than him because she receives overtime).

The next day, I went back in and asked the Operations Manager about the overtime, what I was being told and how it would affect my weekend shift. I didn't like the answer because it felt evasive.

So, I shook her hand, said the position was not for me and that I feel like they should have negotiated my salary based upon the possibility of working more than the stated schedule. Side note, that manager had been there for four years and developed so much gray hair, she looked older than me....I'm 17 years older than her).

I feel like I made the right decision....and, luckily, so does my wife.

4228,Demoralized,"I just have to get this out of my system anonymously on the internet 

Work has been so demoralizing and the main reason I’ve been thankful for WFH lately is so that I can cry multiple times a day 

I do a lot of admin work - mainly because I’m decent at it but mostly because it’s the work no one else wants to bother to do so it just get assumed onto me because I am the lowest in command and my whole office is only 4 people

I struggled with feeling like my tasks were pointless, but I tried to see things from a different perspective and that I’m still contributing and doing productive behind the scenes work

Every week we have a meeting where we go around and appreciate something notable a teammate did. And with the culmination of all the other crap that I’ve been taking at work, this weeks meeting just broke me.

My one coworker has been working on scoring a HUGE client and she took a lot of everyone’s time to get help, sit in on calls, cover her other work tasks, etc. I definitely wasn’t a main contributor but I DID help her proofread emails (and good thing SOMEONE did because there were so many errors) and cover another weekly task that we are supposed to share 50/50. She went around and thanked everyone for their help and for helping take stuff off her plate…and when she got to me she just said, “thanks so much for always listening to me” (not in an appreciative way, in a “oh wait I have to say something for OP but I can’t think of anything uhhh” way). I almost burst out saying, “ARE YOU SERIOUS?” 

My boss knew I was upset but instead of doing anything meaningful, she just sent me an email at the end of the day that was the equivalent of, “OP I really like how you sign off your emails with ‘kind regards’ instead of ‘regards’ it’s very creative”. One of her main conflict resolution methods is fake/random/ empty “compliments”

Congratulations! You own what Is called an investment property. He're very sorry to hear your
tenants are in trouble. Have you considered lowering or even eliminating rent for your tenants
during this time?

But that means | will lose money! That doesn’t seem fair to me.

In the contrary! Returns on Investment (net profit/investment cost) can be positive or negative.
His is called risk and it is a fundamental part of being an investor. You are not guaranteed to
make money on investments, even housing.

I still don’t think that’s fair. Didn't my tenants agree to risk when they signed on to lease
my house?

That's not quite right! Unless your tenants have a financial stake/control of the asset, they are
not investors and don’t share your risk. They are people who deserve a place to live.

Well then if I'm an investor then I'm entitled to do whatever | can to get the most returns
on my investment, right?

That depends! To you think that includes forcing someone onto the street? Rousing is not a
luxury item; it is a necessity. Are you sure you're allowed to force people into hopelessness
because your investment carried more risk than you thought?

But | have a mortgage to pay off!

You should join your tenants and call on the government for a rent and mortgage amnesty!
Mortgage banks are also investors and are responsible for risk too! On't punish people who
can't afford basic necessities, they are the ones in your community, the banks are not.

| don’t have a mortgage but | still rely on income from my rental properties. That about
me?

Of your income is affected by the crisis then you could try applying for government assistance.
Your tenants are probably doing the same thing right now. Cry asking them for help.

4239,Handed in my notice and things turned sour quickly,"I always thought I was a good worker. I was a junior but I've been doing senior level work and managing projects. My review a while back was very good with not negative remarks. 

I was planning to leave as the work wasn't in the area I wanted to work in, I was very underpaid, little training etc. 

I got a much better offer in a job field I wanted to work in and when I handed in my notice, my manager (director of company) was only concerned if I was leaving for competition (I'm not but it's not prevented in my contract). 

Verbally in the call, 28 days notice was fine. This included additional holidays that had yet to use. However, once I emailed my notice letter to my manager and HR I got a response saying they wish to call me tomorrow to discuss the leaving process. 

Yet days passed and no call. So I decided to ring and was instantly given out to. I was told it is bad form to only give 28 days and not 31, they needed the time to find me replacement. I told them it was discussed that I had planned to include my remaining holidays to bring it to 31 days. 

They told me it wasn't acceptable and if my manager said that was okay. I said we verbally discussed it and they said it's not in writing and they'll call my manager to sort this out and hung up before I could say anything else. Few days later HR email saying they'll only accept my notice for the 31 days. I start the new job a day later and I need to move within that time. This was also explained to my manager. 

Currently trying to sort out the start date for my new place but the mess that's really annoying me now. I've been with this company for years, pulled all the extra hours and did work outside of my field to help them.

What’s your favorite subject? And I told him, no I don’t play any sports. I do theater, I’m in choir, I play the violin and piano, I used to take art classes.

“And he went wow. That’s amazing! And I said, ‘Oh no, but I’m not any good at any of them.’

“And he said something then that I will never forget and which absolutely blew my mind because no one had ever said anything like it to me before: ‘I don’t think being good at things is the point of doing them. I think you’ve got all these wonderful experiences with different skills, and that all teaches you things and makes you an interesting person, no matter how well you do them.’

“And that honestly changed my life. Because I went from a failure, someone who hadn’t been talented enough at anything to excel, to someone who did things because I enjoyed them. I had been raised in such an achievement-oriented environment, so inundated with the myth of Talent, that I thought it was only worth doing things if you could ‘win’ at them.”

4252,"Finally quit a job I've been conditioned to ""be grateful for"".","After 5 years working as a ""creative"" in a corporate environment, I finally pulled the trigger on turning in my resignation this morning. I have no idea what is coming next, but I feel like a massive weight has been lifted from my soul, and I wanted to share my story with the lovely folks of r/antiwork who inspired this decision. A bit of a rant, but I hope my story resonates with someone who is feels tethered to a job which doesn't value them.

In college, I studied Illustration + Graphic Design and have since managed to dabble with videography and eventually animation. Most of these skills were obtained as a side-hustle, while I paid the bills working as a line cook over the years. Finally, I got the call from the big leagues one night as I was clocking out of the restaurant, asking me to be THE in-house animator for one of the biggest health care providers in the world. I took their offer without blinking, feeling like I had just unwrapped one of Wonka's golden tickets. For the past 5 years, I have continued to take on more an more responsibilities in my role, increasing efficiency, constantly educating myself on modern animation techniques, and even getting a Master's degree from one of the nations top art schools in 2019. After graduating with a costly degree, I began asking my supervisors what my future in the company might be... after all, I had begun to exceed the expectations listed in my job description. I was able to arrange a meeting with my manager's supervisor who was in charge of promotions. In short, he told me ""The best advice I could give you is to go find a counter-offer. Without that it will be difficult to justify a promotion to my supervisors."" On top of this, due to it being 2020 with a pandemic looming over the world, and the health care community at large, I was told I should ""be grateful for having a job in the first place.""

This meeting spawned a 2-month anxiety trip as I juggled my daily job responsibilities while feverishly applying to / interviewing for jobs around town. The truly messed up part is that I learned that my supervisor's technique had truly worked, and that I wasn't able to find a job opening with my specialized skills. After being told I was runner-up at 3 different job openings, a realization hit me like a ton of bricks. All of my preconceptions regarding the professional ladder I've been climbing are bullshit and the effort I've put into honing my abilities has effectively left me over-qualified in a field where employers value cheap labor. Like Plato's allegory of the cave, I felt like I had been operating under a false pretense of what my reality was. The ladder is actually a treadmill, and you don't tend to notice when your employer casually turns the pace up over time. After that, you're expected to appreciate the cool new muscles they helped you develop while acknowledging that you are standing in the same place you started.

After feeling defeated by the job hunt, I continued to chug away at my daily work, feeling more depressed and anxious than ever. This went on throughout the entire pandemic, and the workload only increased as I started to receive word of a potential raise around the corner. As my responsibilities increased, my mental health only got worse. Living with epilepsy\* means that I can have seizures purely from stress... something I have learned the hard way. Three weeks ago I had a seizure randomly after finishing one of the most stressful projects I have ever overseen. While recovering, over the following week, a thought crossed my mind: ""You could just quit your job.""

It took two more weeks of mulling over, but the thought of walking away from the job right as they prepare to finally offer me a raise was too poetic to pass up. The truth is, I don't want to work there, or any of the 20 places I interviewed last year. I've saved some money from every side gig I took over the last 5 years, painting murals, filming weddings, making logos, etc. and I'm fortunate enough to have built a nest egg for this sort of ""fuck it"" moment. After setting up a meeting with my boss this morning to turn in my resignation, I could not be happier with my decision. When asked if I wanted to give them a chance to make a counter offer, I said ""absolutely not"".

I've got no idea what I plan on doing from here, but that is a really good feeling right now. I'm on my wife's health care plan, and have several existing clients for design and animation work to help me transition into being my own boss, so I do consider myself fortunate. Grateful to have come across this awesome thread which gave me permission to think outside the box about what defines success and which helped me see the ways that companies exploit their talent. I could fail spectacularly from here operating my own business, but I'm stoked to say I'm done wondering ""what if...""

TLDR:

I asked for a promotion / raise and was told to be grateful for the role that I currently have + to find a competitive offer elsewhere. Looked elsewhere to find a system-wide issue with companies valuing profits over qualified talent. Returned to my boss and quit this morning, and now they are trying to ask me to consider a counter-offer. I said hell naw.

He got a promotion here and taught me how to do my current role. He would briefly mention the man who worked before him occassionally. The previous man left because the business refused to give him a promotion due to his regular mistakes even though it was a safe place to make mistakes. The business was nice to me and hired a part time worker to do half of my tasks. And I took advantage and would take extra bathroom breaks, come in whenever I felt like it, and would leave early. All while the man was working hard in his new position. Well, he quit today and the way my coworker explained it to me shocked me. She said he felt ""entitled"" to have more pay and was beginning to get an ""attitude."" Idk what his pay was, but I got a raise recently and make a gross salary of 31,500.

4289,"""Nothing Personal, It's Just Business""","Next time  you feel guilty or lazy or put down at work, remember that business never feels that way about you ever. 

If you're tired or sad or having a bad day, that doesn't matter to the business because business is business. It's not personal. Your boss can't find anyone to cover your shift? FUCK THEM! That's their problem. They should feel exhausted and overworked without any help from anyone because that's how this system works, you've done this multiple times and it never mattered before. Your boss was a lazy irresponsible little shit. Maybe they should feel like a scolded child for a while. If your manager is upset because they have to work 60 hours because of their own incompetence then they shouldn't have taken the job.

If your manager talks down to you, consider the fact you're both humans and not animals and that the manager most likely doesn't hold any superior intellect to you either, they can also be ignorant. In most authority cases people tend to follow the person most pissed off while working hard. So in a situation with your superiors sometimes it's best if you put them in their place instead of you cowering in fear like a dog submitting to a higher power. Maybe you should have their job because you're better. You should show your bosses boss that you're more capable and that your manager isn't. 

Don't have empathy and get your manager more money because you're a nice person, get yours. You should probably take their job anyways, the business would be much better off with you in charge.

Don't be mad, it's just business. Don't feel guilty, remorseful, or empathetic because they WILL NOT. 

Capitalism is a street that goes both ways, so screw over and backstab accordingly. If they didn't want this system then they wouldn't be using it. They just can't stand if you use the system to your benefit.

If they want to change the whole societal system to something a lot nicer, say like modest socialism where we all pull together to help each other then great. Otherwise this is the system they made so use that system the way it was designed.

i worked 41 hours this week. 12 hours twice a day. for a host! 6 hours for lunch, 6 hours for dinner. i realize how useless my job is. i take people to their assigned tables, anyone could do this job. after my last day of working this week, i cried so hard. i was so exhausted. i cant imagine how hard it must be for people working more than 40 hour work weeks. i was burned out from a part time job. i went into a deeper depressive episode and was mentally and physically exhausted i couldnt leave my bed. i started feeling existential again too. 

it was a rough week. i thought about quitting my job, what am i even working for? i dont want to work this summer, or during my first year of college. i am very privileged i have my family to fall back on, and still live with.

my job consists of standing for 6 hours a couple times a week and taking rich people to their seats. i feel useless and alone in my thoughts. ive come to a recent revelation that our only purpose is to work. we need work to live and we live to work. nobody actually likes their job.

I've always been attracted to who he is and not how much money he has but to them this means I am stupid/naive and incapable of making proper life choices. They won't even acknowledge him as a human being. My mother has gone as far as making me an account on dating websites, trying to set me up on dates with random rich dudes she finds through friends, and bursting out crying that im destroying my life. Then she will start comparing me to her friend's kids who are ""living a life of luxury"" and who are set to marry ""successful men"". I have never believed that your job determines your worth as a person but damn it gets discouraging sometimes when just about every single person you know supports that ideology. Once in a while it even makes me question myself. Why wouldn't I when im excessively being told im a fuck up? Does anyone else deal with something similar to this?

4308,Here is my big rant on human society and the complete insanity of the economy!!!,"Temporary biological organisms such as the primate mammal: 'Homo Sapiens' require certain fundamentals such as food and shelter to be alive. Sadly, in the current age - food and shelter access is only granted through the obtainment of an arbitrary made up fiction called: 'money'.

Money - which has only been in existence for 3 thousand years while the human species has existed for around 300,000 years - and yet the majority have come to view money as some fundamental intrinsic and inescapable aspect of human life, despite it's presence in human life only making up around 1 percent of our time as humans and the fact that it is ultimately an arbitrary man made invention. Furthermore most people view it as sane and acceptable despite the fact that 8 individual men have as much monetary wealth as half the earths human population combined, 25.000 human beings starve to death unnecessarily every single day on this planet not due to any tangible shortages of food or recourses but merely due to a lack of purchasing power which is an unreal made up concept, a famous TV star 'earns' more money in a couple of days of filming a frivolous TV show episode than a full time firefighter 'earns' in over 40 years of life risking service. So because of our economy and thus our society is based on money and the inherent incentive structures associated with such a system - the vast majority of human beings in the modern world have to tragically engage in largely nonsensical, boring, unfulfilling, unpleasant, manipulative and destructive 'jobs' to be allowed to be alive, earning their right to be alive through this submission to work. 

The vast majority of human beings on this planet are not following their genuine passions in their fulfilling careers that help make the world a better place. This whole idea that earning money and they way you go about that defines who and what you are and your value and it is linked to your sincere passions in life is utterly untrue and ridiculous to the vast majority of people on earth. Most human beings in adulthood at least are essentially doing this: Going somewhere they don't want to go, to do things they don't want to to, for many hours at a time, having to be around people they don't want to be around, to perform tasks that are fundamentally nonsensical, unpleasant, often inherently manipulative and/or destructive - all in order to be able to pay for rent and food.  

This entire set up and behavioral pattern of the human species today is fundamentally unnecessary almost across the board in the modern age - due to the incredible potential of science and technology; which if purposefully oriented to emancipate the human species from drudgery through advanced automation methods - producing a global abundance and eradicating poverty and starvation and homelessness entirely - while of course carefully maintaining ecological equilibrium could lead to a kind of world, most dare not even dream about due to the current reality of having to submit to labor for survival and the general misery and hardship of the current world. 

This future possibility and potential is not a utopia or a perfect naively idealistic dream world, but simply a vastly more sane, rational and pleasant world for humankind which is possible indeed - if only a larger majority of the human species in fact had an awareness of the possibilities of the future humanity could move towards and more information and comprehension about the utter insanity of the current socio-economic system. 

I urge anyone who resonates even the slightest bit with what I've written here to look into things like The Zeitgeist Movement, The Venus Project and the concept of a Natural Law Recourse Based Economy  and to listen to or read from for example a philosopher such as Alan Watts talking about these exact topics in great detail in a way that is easy to follow. There are books and talks where he was going through the rational and logic of this kind of thinking - going back all they back to the early 1960's - this can help to get more of an introduction to this train of thought. 

These thoughts I have shared just now are not at all new radical ideas so much as very old yet largely suppressed common sense observations that have become somewhat taboo and thus more and more uncommon especially in the media and in the mainstream. A lot of this common sense thinking of course goes directly against what most of us are largely indoctrinated to accept as 'normal' but as Peter Joseph the film maker and social commentator so often has pointed to - we live in a world where normality indeed has become distortion. The economic system we currently live under is in no uncertain terms fundamentally insane at it's very core and to be somewhat depressed and overwhelmed with it's destruction and insanity is in a paradoxical way precisely a sign of sanity. If you are not utterly appalled and astounded by the horrendous state of human society, more specifically in terms of the economic absurdity and madness - you are fundamentally one of 3 things.

1. Uninformed.
2. Misinformed.
3. In severe denial.  

I hope this finds you well as a fellow human being on this planet.
