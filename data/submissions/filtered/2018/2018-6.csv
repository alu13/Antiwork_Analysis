0,[Serious] Parents do not respect me because I'm not working at the moment,this is a bit of a rant  but i want your take as fellow anarchists in this situation  also  i'm posting here because i don't know of any psychological help subreddit  delete this post if you think it's been misplaced   i'm 21 years old  i'm studying a career and i have a very good average so i can apply for a scholarship to go study abroad in the future  i still not have any work experience  but i will seek to start working soon  6 months-1 year  when studies lighten up a little  my parents said today that they  cannot respect me  or  treat me as an equal  because i was just  exploiting  them  i know i'm privileged  and that i didn't give any fucks about them  they are in a bit of an emotional rollercoaster since my sister went to live with my grandma  escaping all the stress  but i hate the situation  i help around the house  i study a lot and i only absorb stress and bullshit  i don't ask for money either  only for transportation and lunch food when i need it  it makes me feel like real shit and a burden  more so with the economic situation   they work and they just want us to be as exploited and  useful  as them  they want my sister to even wake up at 6 00am to make them feel like they are not the only ones being harassed by the system  it's nuts  i'm considering getting psychological help to even survive and be functional  i suffer stress a lot  or to start working full-time and moving out  but this would kill my academic performance for sure  and my hope   i'm not lazy  but how can i even be motivated to seek work when all they show me is stress  anger and frustration caused by work  how can i go to them with a smile and do everything they want when i know this is not helping at all  they want me to show respect  i'm very grateful in fact  when they think i'm a social parasite or something  i can't stand it   did you ever went through something like this   yeah  i know   first world problems   thirdworldist btw   grow a pair and face the world   go work you lazy shit  etc  etc  i'm sorry if your worldview doesn't fit mine  this shit makes me feel angry and ashamed due to the current work ethic  i ask for your honest help ,8ps4tb
