0,Using capitalism in a world affected by climate change.,we are witnessing the response of our society in capitalism to coronavirus and we see how poorly it is serving us i expect it to be perhaps even worse in serving us as a system when we need to respond to changing conditions on earth due to climate change such as changes in food production and geographical changes we need to implement a system closer to socialism in our society now,fpa1nz

29,"Ctrl+V'ing a rant I just went on elsewhere, about companies taking advantage of WFH during COVID-19.",this pandemic is a chance to prove how valuable working from home truly can be however ive noticed many companies taking advantage of it in my experience since employees are all at their new place of work 247 we can be contacted at any time we have no commute so theres more time to work we cant go anywhere or do anything so we have no excuse not to work in my companys eyes  my workload has been steadily increasing for the past 67 months even while working from home my current workload justifies about 8090 hours a week right now and they dont offer ot pay  i had a hard enough time separating my work life and personal life before all this and its obviously only gotten worse the past two weeks my boss contacts me all hours of the day expecting me to be working if i get everything done thats expected of me in 4050 hours a week im happy and my bosses are happy but even working inappropriate amounts of ot the past few weeks ive fallen behind  i feel guilty every time i take a break and ignore callsemails but im not going to let my company take advantage of me ive decided to cut my time off at 60 hours a week which even then is 20 hours too many if thats not good enough then there are plenty of people looking for jobs right now that they should hire to help me out  if nothing else covid19 is a great chance to prove how viable wfh can be i also acknowledge that 40 hrs of ot is better than no job or income at all but im noticing companies are doing what they can to take advantage of this pandemic as well as their employees and we need to be careful to not let it spiral out of control and not let them use this to squeeze out everything they can from us  thats the end of my rant but im posting here because im curious if others are seeing similar attitudes from their employers i also want to note that im very grateful i still have a job and i dont take it lightly i live with others who werent as fortunate this will be an interesting financial situation to navigate and obviously im doing everything i can to keep us all afloat,friu6d

39,"I am an ""essential"" worker. Most of us are NOT heroes.

129,The problem with anti-work.,well theres not too many problems with this sub i mean its got great memes and im sure all of you are very nice but unfortunately a majority of the people in here are heavily indebted to the system in exchange for their lifestyles this places them in a position where although they would like to quit their job they cant how can you quit your job when you have a family to feed or youre going to lose your house thats not practical right   so most people on this group are against work but this conflicts with the fact that their way of life requires work for them to maintain what we will refer to as values your values are things that are important to you and can be objects people ideas ect money maintains most of our personal values and money has also been implemented as the surrogate provider for most our our basic security values such as food shelter warmth and water   money that we get from working provides us with the means to sustain values that we have acquired a family eating is a value an insurance payment on your new 2015 tundra is a value new strings for a guitar or a dime sack of weed are values ect to sustain these values requires that you must work for them because money is the method you have been given to maintain these things you care about without money we lose the ability to maintain values and this is all very woven into our system   if there was a problem with this sub it would be that most of us who have joined it are caught up in trying to maintain our values in doing so it has turned us into workslaves our prescribedsuggested way of life is hardly free everything has been reduced to you exchanging your hours for the ability to maintain or obtain that which is valued by you we likely would have opted for independence from this system had we been offered a real understanding of social conditioning and the implications of social learning theory but we were not and so now we work     main take away is if you havent already chosen expensive values and want to live freely then choose what you will need to sustain extremely carefully our society insists that having children or we should go to school regardless of the debt or a buy a new 2020 lease but if you wish to live freely these will almost definitely work against that goal most of the people on this sub are so far into trying to sustain such a large list of values that it is impossible for them to just walk away from their perceived obligations the money is no longer an option for those people they must make it or they lose what is important to them   its true that most of us are enslaved not by work but by the need to maintain values which require money to maintain humans have a tendencyand this is not always the case to tell others to do as they have done almost like theyre trying to see validation of their actions in other people do not fall for this use critical thinking to make your own decisions and realize that if youre not careful your list of values that require money and time to maintain will grow out of control going with the grain is expensive and comes with a steep price be very careful with what you choose to value because every single thing you must maintain owns a little piece of you and if you rack up too much too quick thats it game over,fna6sx

147,We need to create a realistic plan of action!,i know there are talks of strikes on 41 to show our growing frustration with the current system but it is not enough for decades we have been ignored conditioned to the point of brainwashing discriminated against looked down on and subjugated now is the time for change the world is not the same place that it was a week ago and it wont be the same this time next week by the time this pandemic is over the world will never go back to the way that it was it is very likely that many of our career politicians will die from this virus which will weaken the power structures that have been forcing us down since my parents were children it provides us with a new opportunity to change those systems and for young progressive people to move into those power vacuums   as many of you have posted the rapid changes made it unmistakably clear that the 1 do not care about us our elected leaders knew about this for months and kept quiet about it telling the public that it did not pose a serious threat to the public while at the same time using their insider knowledge to sell their stocks and profit off of this global crisis right now as i am typing this congress is bickering and squabbling over our lives and our futures president trump in his recent tweets has made it clear that he is willing to sacrifice the lives of the american people in order to preserve the wealth that he and his cronies and hoarded while millions of working class people lose their jobs with no safety nets to help them major corporations are forcing their employees to work despite the pandemic risking lives for the sake of profit  we have been so angry for so long we have been so oppressed for so long now is the time to do something about it there are 100000 people in this subreddit alone and there are more than think and feel the same way we do lets use this time to demand and force permanent change that creates a better world so every single person on this planet and work towards the greater good  changes i am proposing   repeal all legislation that considers corporations as people  comprehensive tax reform that raises taxes on all billionaires and their companies with crippling fines for using off shore companies  stricter insider trading laws and minimum 15 year prison sentences for anyone that uses knowledge not available to the general public to profit off of disasters  universal healthcare  ubi  should probably be determined by current income and cost of living for your geographic location  expanded unemployment and social welfare programs  better pay and working conditions for all employees with a particular focus on the following healthcare workers retail and food service employees truck drivers warehouse amp distribution employees municipal employees including but not limited to water and waste management garbage men  reevaluation of current voting laws to make sure that they are nondiscriminatory for all eligible groups  feel free to add any more in the comments or further details on how we can accomplish this im serious guys people across the internet have been calling for a revolution for years we are probably never going to get a better opportunity than this to tear down the old power structures and rise from the ashes lets come together and use our anger our strength in numbers our time and our hope to create a better world for all,fnsdag

165,Why Bosses Suck: the Use of Knowledge in the Workplace,   during his life economistphilosopher fa hayek was concerned about socialism born in 1899 he grew up seeing the economic chaos that resulted from world war i and the central planning which was adopted as a solution the weimar republic which ruled germany from 1918 to 1933 had become infamous for its hyperinflationary policies which caused people to bring wheelbarrows full of money to buy a single loaf of bread or to burn the money in fireplaces just to stay warm for a night hayek who grew up in austria could not have failed to notice this studying at the university of vienna in the early 1920s and working with fellow economist ludvig von mises helped shape hayeks thought process to be distrustful of government planning while seeing free enterprise in a favorable light  thus it was that in 1945 when hayek wrote the use of knowledge in society for the american economic review journal he was by then focused on proving that that socialism didnt work while suggesting that leaving business up to businessmen rather than politicians who knew nothing about the enterprises they sought to regulate would be more beneficial to society as a whole couched in wellwritten expressive erudite language hayek basically gave government socialists a slap on the wrist  however he was so enamored of private business as being a savior and edifier of humanity that he failed to take his unique ideas as far as he could in the article hayek suggests that those who know any situation best ought to be the ones who make decisions about how to handle it he uses the example of tin production certainly it may safely be asserted that most politicians dont know how to run a tin factory or a mine designed to extract tin from the ground what hayek failed to mention much less understand is that not only do company owners have unique knowledge which allows them to more profitably run their business but that employees even entrylevel employees have unique knowledge that allows them to complete their tasks in an efficient productive manner  this of course only applies to company employees who have been with the company long enough to learn how to become a better worker this is another way of saying practice makes perfecthttpjournalssagepubcomdoiabs1011772372732215624708 the important point to note here is that employees will teach themselves the best way to complete a task without having been told what they are supposed to do provided that they have the mental capacity to do so they are also more familiar than their bosses with how other departments they work with may screw up and how to get around such situations   eventually over the course of time the employee becomes more knowledgeable about the job hes working he is better able to formulate solutions to offer advice on how to increase efficiency the boss manager supervisor or whatever authority is often likely to reject such advice due to a combination of hubris and overwork when bosses are overworked they treat employees less fairlyhttpshbrorg201806researchwhenmanagersareoverworkedtheytreatemployeeslessfairly simply because they dont have the time to acquaint themselves with the particular circumstances that each employee faces when this happens production declines the workplace becomes a bad place to be  bosses who are perceived as being incompetent are ultimately the ones who are least acquainted with the particular knowledge that each employee gains during the course of their employment while there are some bosses out there who are absolutely toxic individuals there are others who are not those who are not toxic who strive to be nice may nevertheless lose the respect of their employees if they fail to notice or completely ignore what people around them have to say bosses who want to want to act in a fair manner may instead act in an unfair manner by enabling that one bad department or person to continually screw up without any consequences no matter how much of a nice person they are no matter how well they actually behave such bosses can nevertheless garner the ire of their employees by simply not knowing how to rectify a situation something that seems blatantly obvious to those who experience it on a daily basis  whats worse upper management types dont even seem to understand that the dynamic between boss and employee ends up breaking on a daily basis rather theyd rather blame the bosss personal failingshttpsdougthorpecom5reasonswhybadbossessucksobad as to why hes not doing well with his employees there doesnt appear to be any selfcritical analysis that ive seen suggesting that some authority ought to be delegated or that asking one human being responsible for an entire department to do everything limits that persons ability to make calm rational decisions that help the company as a whole  rather overworked bosses and even those who are not tend to focus on task completion thats what theyve been put in charge to ensure after all they havent been given a mission statement demanding increased efficiency rather all upper management a group of people who is even further disconnected from the daily experience of the average employee focuses on numbers on production figures on profits many such people are unable to see that rather than hiring organizational development consultants such as these peoplehttpwwwodconsultantscom to tell them how to operate their business better they need only go on the floor and ask their employees what needs to change in order for greater efficiency to be obtained  an organizational development consultant is basically a scammer who uses silly buzzwords and fancy pie charts and graphs to justify their salaries they dress up in nice suits to convey the notion that they know what they are talking about it in fact the acquisition of knowledge does not depend on how welldressed someone is they seem to have all the answers but this is only because their purpose is to gather information that bosses at all levels of authority have neglected to gain on their own they then help develop a specifically tailored game plan for how the company can improve the fact that companies so often fail to do this on their own especially when they stand to make more money after having done it suggests that bosses just downright suck seen in this light they are closer to production facilitators rather than catalysts for growth and positive change  all they would have to do to make their company better would be to listen to what each employee has to say not every employee will be right not every one will have a good idea there will be some employees mixed in who are just punching time cards each day without any interest on helping out anyone but themselves yet there will be honest motivated individuals mixed in if such individuals are ignored they will go elsewhere sooner or later under these circumstances stagnation not only becomes possible but probable  rather than the savior and edifier of human society that hayek envisioned in the previous century it becomes clear that while offering a better alternative to governmentsponsored socialism or communism private enterprise nevertheless tends to centralize power and authority in the hands of a few who ignore the local knowledge that could best help their companies progress had hayek worked in a european factory for half of his life rather than for various think tanks and universities he may have discovered this on own ironically enough he did not possess the local knowledge needed to know how the local knowledge problem was being ignored on a daily basis in capitalist enterprises everywhere,fmi6jj

261,Working from home this week has made me realise just how much busy work we do in our jobz and how much we pretend to work,title says it all and i am sure others have had the same experience  yesterday i did virtually nothing i spend 30 minutes actually working an hour and a half on calls just listening and the other 6 hours of my workday i spent watching youtube videos and dicking around on reddit  i work in corporate it and i know for a fact that one of my 3 immediate colleagues also did nothing yesterday the other two have a little more on their plate but i know that they still spent at least half the day idle both of them signed off early which they never do in the office  without our boss breathing down our necks my team is taking it easy but heres the weird thing theres no consequences at all   you would expect that a sudden lack in busyness would mean that all kinds of shit would pile up and all of our projects would fall apart  but thats not happening at all the necessary work is still being done and our projects are still moving forward as normal   it doesnt make sense at the office everyone buzzes around like anxious bees but now we are working like 2 or 3 hours a day and were getting the same result   my only conclusion is that we only ever work 2 or 3 hours a day even in the office the remainder is simply busy work and pretending   seems very pointless to me for people to spend all day at work and then do nothing but i see now that that is the reality when my colleagues and i are buzzing around the office its all just a display for our boss,fl7m1d

315,Its Happening,what a difference a couple months make  prior to that we were living our life accordingly we had no choice we were conditioned  our societal behaviour ingrained in us from birth a working society where the majority of the workers were living from pay cheque to pay cheque in order to keep the bills paid a roof over thier heads and food on the tableaccumulation of stuff equated to wealth   thats the way its supposed to be it keeps the capitalistic society running like a fine tuned engine we are simply the grease to the machine  money is the fuel eventually social anxiety and hopelessness is the end result another by  product looks like it could be image unconsciousness just check out the vanity posts  markets tank socialism creeps in to muddy the grease or to enhance its performance depending on how you see it this is usually when peak democratic capitalist society comes to a grinding halt  remember that last sentence  this was the trajectory society was on like it or not just not knowing how to enact that change it had to get better  right socialism scares the  hell out of democratic capitalism  then the pandemic arrived things changed  in a few short months weeks even the pandemic  modified our social behavior patterns like nothing we have ever experienced before 200 years of societal behaviour evolution altered beyond recognition in days on a global scale a behaviour that goes against all of our standard norms social interaction large gathering places world travel and physical contact that up until now humanity belived it had to have to survive  we may have been wrong in making that assumption i really hope so  the pandemic erased all of that we are now forced into isolation no physical contact no large gatherings no walking the dog or talking to the neighbor over the fence this goes against everything we are seemingly an overnight 180 degree turn in the expectation of our societies behaviour literally days  it got worse  world wide death uncertainty panic closure of  borders schools and non essential businesses travel bans and overwhelmed medicare systems and financial markets tank currency devalues as its the perfect delivery system for a pandemic touch it and it could kill you online businesses soar our infrastructure was not designed for this   as a result we now see large progressive cities becoming ghost towns martial law is right around the corner this makes it harder to spend our hard earned cash remember that is the only way capitalism survives  no fuel for the machinethe pandemic is not just effecting our social behaviour it is threatening the capitalism model as we know it this is usually when the the peak democratic capitalist society comes to a grinding halt sound familiar  governments cant stop a pandemic history shows us this  governments first response is to soothe anxiety and avoid panic of the people  inevitably changing tactics only when they realize that the pandemic is spreading regardless of their efforts too little too late again history has many illustrations of this   good news   there was a slow shift to get away from the normal rat race anyway our existing model wasnt sustainable  younger generations had that figured out long ago social media was already becoming the communication system of choice alowing us to communicate in real time and without  borders online shopping home delivery services and the ability to work from home and avoid the 5 day a week standard procedure the overwhelming desire for healthcare which the pandemic has proven is woefully inadequate this was going to be a slow process its hard to change overnight and involves  painful job recreation and older societal generations must literally die off before the majority of the population can embrace it harsh for a free societygreat for a pandemic  this pandemic is painful as a society as a human race i know im living it   so save your money or dont invest your money or dont sell your stuff or dont it wont matter this pandemic may have not only triggered the end of the peak capitalistic society model it may have shown use what we can accomplish on the other side to make our society more livablethe society goes on the sun  is coming up tomorrow like it did yesterday and the day before  for levity look no further than hollywood at two quotes that are more appropriate now than they have ever been  wyld stallyns   be excellent to each other  mr spock    live long and prosper,fkfoid

364,Manager Dangling Carrots - And Wanting Free Work - What To Do?,so i walked into a nearby gym spoke to the assistant manager and offered to write blog posts after seeing a posting online they had on indeed looking for a fulltime blogger mind you i called in advance and was instructed to come in and ask to see a manager etc i did this for the side income i needed to invest in my blog   day 1friday  the asst manager there says cool the manager is busy can you wait a bit  me waits for 1 hour  asst manager  well shes to busy to see you and i dont wanna waste your time can you come back on wednesday  here are some red flags he said  also the owner is old school he still believes in flyers but i can convince him   come in on monday well be working alongside together anyways  can you do social media stuff to  even though social media wasnt in the job post  i suggest i bring samples i also say i need 20hr and this includes web design social media and blog posting this is the financial equivalent of an unskilled worker getting paid in trident layers etc   day 2monday  i come with some pretty decent social media samples that i photoshopped and a blog post equivalent to three hours work work that was super impressive for a boomer however it didnt take that long for me because thats my skill think of it like how it takes the average runner 5 hours to run a marathon but an olympian can do it in only 2  so i show him some 5star samples and even do some consulting etc he says that i will be meeting up with the manager on wednesday  later in the day he talked about needing to update his gyms hours and he needed a simple flyer which i did as a show of good faith it was simple to copypaste word editing and formatting but i still did most of the work  every day he says that hes putting in a good word for me to the manager  day 3 tuesday  on day 3 he texts me to call him i call him he talks about the managers love what ive been doing etc then he tells me that they wont be coming in because theyre old and paranoid of the coronavirus but he also needs me to update another flyer  so far i still havent made a dime yet  then he tells me that he is understaffed and would like me to work the front desk and answer calls do sales etc this is temporary because some of his staff are highrisk for coronaviruseg respiratory issues old age but still hasnt even paid me a dime yet i stupidly agreed to start tomorrow at 9 am to increase my chances of sealing the deal  he keeps complimenting me and sweettalking me but i dont give a rats ass i also forgot to ask him what my compensation will be when i work at the front desk because i previously told him that i want 20 per hour  he only told me that i would get commission and thats all but guess what these guys are struggling to get customers and thats why they need a guy like me in the first place   ampx200b  summary  gave free work  keeps dangling carrot and postponing a meeting with the manager for my actual job i applied for  wants me to work a different job then i applied  afraid he wont give me the same compensation for the different job  day 4 wednesdaytoday tbd  ill make an update if you want     my question  even though i previously agreed to come in yesterday would i be an asshole if i changed my mind if i called in advance and asked if he was going to bring my paperwork to get paid upon the first day then if he doesnt i refuse to come into work  because if i decide to quit the day after i still want to get paid for the first day i actually work which will be later today  i honestly was desperate because i lost some clients due to the corona but i feel like im being taken advantage of i already gave them technically over 5 hours of free work  ps hate to toot my own horn im talented and hardworking for my age but also young and look that way late teens to early twenties which might be the reason why he thinks he can screw me  any advice,fkleig

416,Office jobs red flags,i see a lot of posts about people moving from catering or customer service to their first office job and thinking itll be all dandy obviously they can google red flags but ive learned a few myself that arent as commonly discussed  1 if the bosses are all older men doesnt even matter which color this is an old boys club and they will stick to their backward bootstrap ways no matter what  2 if your supervisor or manager has direct stake in the company this is usually true for smaller partnerships your performance will directly affect their profits so they will breathe down your neck whereas if you have a salaried manager its more likely they dont care bc their salary is the same no matter what you do  3 if they literally tell you red flags in the interview yes interviews are a farce with rehearsed answers and questions however if someone repeatedly asks how you deal with conflict or stress there will be conflict or stress nope outta there  4 if they guilt trip you about discussing salary its borderline if not entirely illegal and proves they know theyre underpaying you and are worried they wont get away with it  5 if there is a high turnover in the role speaks for itself question why all those other guys left  also random tips  you are being exploited no matter what however these jobs dont allow unions and you must be your own union always negotiate always push back  gossiping isnt as bad as people say its not necessarily true theyre gossiping about you too sometimes humans need something to bond over as long as its not cruel or damaging fine to engage to make the day go by faster and find someone who will have your back  anyway hope you enjoyed my weird generalizations have i missed anything,fgvbv5

459,Idea for Direct Action for the Environment,   okay so i have an idea for the ways in which we could prevent horrible megacorps andor companies from making profits off of selling products which harm the environment   what if rather than steal or commit some kind of vandalism to the products in stores all of us instead went around and hid them across the store in hardtofind unexpected hardtoreach places   for instance i have found in my current life that the oil companies chevron shell and exxonmobil are fucking up the planet as well as making it harder for me to get a job ill go into more detail in that if you want me to   and so i was thinking of going around walmart and going over to the automotiveoil side and hiding their products across the store or moving their products in one of walmarts big shopping carts from one end of the store to another   in other words   where effectively misplacing or hiding the product will cause the people who normally go over to them in their spot of the store to go oh theyre not here and for walmart and the oil companies to go why are we not making a profit off of these products we put them in the stores  we need to put aside the discourse and start taking direct action against our current dystopia      its nonviolent too so it seems like it should be appealing   if enough of us do this itll change the world   im done w cooperating with the system and thinking that any politician will bring real hope and liberation or is capable of winning against our rigged system im from usa,fj1yqv

467,Office jobs red flags,i see a lot of posts about people moving from catering or customer service to their first office job and thinking itll be all dandy obviously they can google red flags but ive learned a few myself that arent as commonly discussed  1 if the bosses are all older men doesnt even matter which color this is an old boys club and they will stick to their backward bootstrap ways no matter what  2 if your supervisor or manager has direct stake in the company this is usually true for smaller partnerships your performance will directly affect their profits so they will breathe down your neck whereas if you have a salaried manager its more likely they dont care bc their salary is the same no matter what you do  3 if they literally tell you red flags in the interview yes interviews are a farce with rehearsed answers and questions however if someone repeatedly asks how you deal with conflict or stress there will be conflict or stress nope outta there  4 if they guilt trip you about discussing salary its borderline if not entirely illegal and proves they know theyre underpaying you and are worried they wont get away with it  5 if there is a high turnover in the role speaks for itself question why all those other guys left  also random tips  you are being exploited no matter what however these jobs dont allow unions and you must be your own union always negotiate always push back  gossiping isnt as bad as people say its not necessarily true theyre gossiping about you too sometimes humans need something to bond over as long as its not cruel or damaging fine to engage to make the day go by faster and find someone who will have your back  anyway hope you enjoyed my weird generalisations have i missed anything,fgken2

476,a little rant on shopping etc,for the love of all that is holy we need to make a huge effort to stop blaming others for the state of the world and begin to change it by our own everyday choices well not stopping to blame everyone many corporates are predators who literally are at fault learning about humanity and using that knowledge to rob us  im sitting here depressed overweight 0 body shaming in this statement im just annoyed that nestle built this body and not excercise and normal fucking food and overwhelmed yet again that life need to be better than this late stage capitalism  i need to make better choices you do too its tiresome to feel myself opposing big data with a fire yet consuming meat interior design shit books i dont read etc etc its also tireing to see my vegan friends shopping clothes and tech and cute things like theres no tomorrow and my conservative friends sneering at those trying to make an effort or not wanting to take in where the world is actually heading  the world is so so beautiful there is so much kindness in place when we have the strength to bring it out of the world at least we cannot buy into the forces who tell us there is no future there is we are talking globally sharing ideas from what works in other places and feel within ourselves which ideas truly improves a society and by encouraging each other we can slowly build a better world  i want to stop being annoyed at others for making less than perfect choices and instead focus on making my own choices as good as i can and with a kind voice forgive myself when the predatory forces steer me in a bad direction and i would love if the general public tone changed as well we are so many being tricked by bad systems we need to unite and not cast blame among eachother actually not even focus on blame at all just to live a more sustainable life ourselves and take great pleasure from that without fooling ourselves were better than anyone and negatively comparing our efforts with others we all struggle and its never ever shown how much never  when we stop consuming things stop blaming other individuals including ourselves for being flawed and instead start to understand that we are all so so simular and equally unique and that our happiness will always depend on others and the world around us then we know how much better earth us would feel always filled with struggles of course but struggles that were maybe slightly more designed to handle than the soul crushing one of being a rusty screw in a polluted wheel where most of the grease and care is divided on a selected few  its ridiculous and just not true to frame the narrative that those few screws deserved nearly all the grease wouldnt the system run better if we made sure all screws had enough grease   i wish that those who have a lot would see that they will always burn if the world around them does but that would be the simple solution to whish that someone else does the hard work if i start seeing where i can improve its something its literally everything in my tiny tiny world and its one way which would undoubtly bring a brighter future if lots of tiny worlds improved,fi61cq

515,An aspect of capitalism I don't see discussed enough: Capitalistic doctrine is genetic supremacy.,the mythos of capitalism regardless of how much it actually operates this way is that the more capable a person is of providing a service which is useful to the economy the more they will be rewarded for doing so while there is absolutely a large aspect of luck and class advantage that this explanation doesnt address this is the stated goal and there are a few small ways in which capitalism achieves it at least in that a person who wants to do economically valued labor is more likely to be rewarded than a person who doesnt  however i want to point out something about the usage of capable and economically valued  the elephant is the room when talking about peoples capability to provide labor is that not everyone actually has the same capabilities people are born with geneticrelated disabilities and disabilities are not the only disparity in ability that exists between people which can be seeded before birth while its far harder to measure the exact differences in capabilities between individuals without something so obvious as a disability to point them out due to the endless well of other factors at play i also would rather this not be measured as its info that could only realistically be used for evil we do at least know that nature plays a significant role in how a persons behaviors and abilities develop the reality is that we just dont know how big this factor is but we know it exists to some degree even if you take the stance that everyone who doesnt have a clear disability is on even footing genetically the issue still remains of that subsection of people who arent  the problem herein is that the extension of this logic is that some people by circumstance of birth are more capable of being useful to a capitalistic economy than others are regardless of what context you put them in this means that by arguing that a person should be rewarded for being able to contribute to the economy a person is also arguing by logical extension that some people are simply inherently deserving of a better life than others  while support programs for people with disabilities raise the floor for the most adversely affected by this reality somewhat they dont put them on even footing with others and they dont address the core of the issue a capitalistic society believes that they deserve less than others do simply for existing thats the reality one cannot argue for capitalism without accepting that they are arguing this,feqdlk

597,desperate for change,im barely hanging by a thread at this point ive been unemployed for quite a few months now and its ruining me i took a break from work but ive realized there is no way out and my generalized anxiety hinders me in ways unimaginable so far ive only been called for one interview and they havent contacted me since and this was a job i applied for experience in my chosen field but only pays 2030 a day i only found out about the pay on the day of the interview and knew there was no way i could accept an offer like that anyway is this what a college education gets you in america   it hurts to know that this is just the beginning since im still new to the workforce and have so much life ahead of me i dont look forward to life the same way i used to before the academic and financial pressures ive endured throughout high school i dont last longer at a job for more than 4 months at a time and its starting to show on my resume i want to die during moments like these what is the point of all this suffering and toiling for a degree only to walk out of university unemployed and a husk of my former self  i dont know which steps to take next ive been working fast food and retail for so many years now and im dead tired of it all i dont want to go back to that kinda life againi was hoping things would improve after graduating from uni but it seems a degree only made things worse by setting the bar even higher for myself   ive always pushed for excellence in myself whether at school uni or the workplace but now im past the point of no return i hate society with every fiber of my being sometimes but i know everyone is just as much a victim as i am and i think this is largely due to social alienation my whole life ive never been tied to any community and grew apart from extended family my childhood was traumatic and i still cant get over it as a result ive been struggling with severe depression and social anxiety since i was 15 it only adds to the weight upon my shoulders and this is one of the main reasons why i cant stay in these jobs for too long   people fill me with dread and i cannot fathom an existence where i have to work a till and make small talk with people 8 hours a day five days a week any longer than i already have endured i know thats highly antisocial behavior and ive been confronted so many times for not wearing a plastered smile on my face at all times but it hurts to smile it hurts to talk and to reach out for help when youre certain you dont deserve anything good in this life  i wish i was more sociable and inviting and charismatic but im none of those things and never will be what a wretched existence ive found myself in but no use pitying myself its never going to get me anywhere i just wish there was an alternative but no for as long as were alive in this world capitalism will prevail as the dominant economic system around the world and its truly disheartening  i dont believe i should be voicing my opinions at all on here but i wanted to do something to end all this suffering and no i dont mean suicide but direct action against all the big employers and corporations starting with american ones we need to start acting now if were ever going to see change in our lifetimes we cant keep living like thisor can we   anyways thanks for reading my post,feohvt

608,"Relatively new to the sub, my thoughts &amp; observations, etc.",after having been put through the mill by three previous employers and had to leave either by choice or by force because they either carried out immoralillegal practices or allowed a toxic work environments to manifest i have for the last 10 months relegated myself to caring for my immediate nextofkin who both struggle with different disabilities while claiming the relevant welfare with respect to my caring commitments to cover my living expenses and i kinda like it better this way  its not without its drawbacks but at least im not dealing with corporate bullshit on a daily basis   i eventually found myself gravitating to towards this sub because its ideals and what it stood for appeal strongly to me after being on the receiving end of various forms of corporate malice during my time in the workplace  including but not limited to being a victim of corporate surveillance prior to eu privacy laws im in the uk for context personal attacks psychological abuse being overworked being underpaid being undervalued being undermined and being underappreciated   on monday morning i had to go out of the house as i had some personal matters to attend to as this was during rush hour i could not help but sneer at all the worker antscockroachesrats ensnared in this trap are in hurry to get to their to 95s which most of them probably hate all of these people who are so inured to the system need to have the wool pulled from over their eyes but this is not going to be easy with the multiple levels of indoctrination that are in place to keep them in line in check and in compliance unquestioningly  including but not limited to exposure to mass media and propaganda  with regards to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak im hoping that it will be enough to cause substantial damage to the capitalist system weve already seen stocks take a nosedive and help shatter the illusion and idealism that society under a capitalism system is perfect and not without faults along with all of the other lies weve been told a rising tide lifts all boats trickledown economics etc coronavirus also has the potential to be a doubleedged sword for humanity itself  the downside is that people are going to die the procapitalist boomers being the largest atrisk demographic and no one with a sane mind is denying this inevitability the upside is that humanity has the potential to come out the other side far stronger and better than before lastly humanity is long overdue an outbreak to thin the herd  from my perspective at least the line between 80s soviet communism and capitalism is slowly beginning to blur they exhibit disturbingly similar characteristics with greedy elites at the top dictating the wellbeing and the lives of those less fortunate hbos chernobyl goes in to detail regarding this so one could argue that they are both as bad as each other  and either the way the game is rigged two sides of the same coin with humanitys freedom or servitude hinging on either side of the coin if you will  i dont understand why modern day society is so frightened of the word socialism both the words society and socialism share the same etymology or root word for andrew vincent the word socialism finds its root in the latin sociare which means to combine or to share the related more technical term in roman and then medieval law was societas this latter word could mean companionship and fellowship as well as the more legalistic idea of a consensual contract between freemen  wikipedia how has this honestly not occurred to people sooner my guess would be that its owing to decades of indoctrination in the education system and then being further dumbed down by mass media specifically catered to appeal to the lowest common denominator looking directly at you with a death glare murdoch,fgf8wz

627,[Meta] Why has this sub become a place to despise rich people for no reason?,i thought this sub was for pursuing a career away from a 95 workplace and trying to find a life where you can work for yourself   i dont mind the posts about complaining about the 95 life because thats also related  but now almost every post that gets to the top is about having this hate and bitterness towards rich people how is that related on top of that more people whine about how little money they make than talking about how to get away from work life   this sub isnt even about being poor people who make 150k also have the same feelings about work that a minimum wage worker does  and worst of all the people who complain about being poor will hold anyone accountable except for themselves its ridiculous no doubt there are a lot of inequalities in wealth and opportunity but thinking that its impossible to move up in life is absurd i see comments blaming the government for not teaching financial or family planning and thats why people become poor seriously the example they used is that someone leasing a car doesnt know that 9 times out of 10 its a bad idea but they werent taught interest rates seriously were going to blame the government for something like that anyone can fucking learn about it online anyone old enough to buy or lease a car should know that the information is not secret but fuck holding ourselves accountable its everyones fault but ours   the example they gave was that when the government reaches financial planning people benefit well yeah the government could also install sprinklers on every single lawn in the country and grass would benefit but does that mean if my grass dies then i should blame the government for not watering it for me no i couldve just watered it myself   its a terrible mentality to have if youre trying to pursue more in life and pursuing more in life is what this sub is about or what it was about   rant over,ffy2ol

632,Can boring office jobs be better for your mental health?,so i was always under the impression that i could never work in a boring desk job and had to do something creative that i love  well now im 24 years old and ive done the creative jobs i so call love and was miserable in them all on paper they sound amazing but in practise they make me never want to work again   im at the point now where i think ive wasted all my time in college doing a degree and a masters just to find myself wanting a boring office job where i can run out the door at 5pm and not think of work  i hate the thought of wasting 8 hours a day doing something boring and thought if im going to be spending 40 hours a week of my life doing something it may as well be something that has meaning   but  if the jobs i think i want are affecting my mental health is a boring desk job the solution i like the idea of having good colleagues decent working hours and no stress when it hits 5pm i think as well theres something good about being in a place where everyone claims they hate the job but in reality everyone knows its actually fine and a decent company to work for its like were all in this together kind of attitude lol i hate when people pretend they love their job and you feel like the only one who hates it   i always see people on this sub saying that they hate their 95 desk jobs so much as theyre so boring am i crazy for now wanting one has anyone left their original career for a mundane desk job and in turn now have a better quality of life,fg2ruq

636,"Employers should be required to post pay range, and benefits for all positions posted.",there is so much time wasted by companies not being transparent about their job postings its all about what they expect from you with only a very generic list of benefits for you such as 401k health care dental care ect it makes it incredibly hard to compare jobs when you often dont even know how much they pay until the interview and most of the time dont know the full benefits until they make a offer or after youre hired i feel like there needs to be a government mandate that certain information must be provided on any job posted full disclosure of pay and a full disclosure of benefits this would save a ton of money and effort by so many job hunters and prevent companies from playing hide the ball from prospective employees,fdsefe

639,Should I quit?,here is a short summary of my life right now i am 27f still living with her parents finishing my psychology degree will be done next year where i would need to do an internship with another psychologist i am currently working at a office job that makes me miserable and pays me minimum wage i am lucky seeing as i only work from monday to thursday from 8 to 4 with an hour lunch break where a lot of my coworkers work the whole week until 5  here follows some of the problems of the job  paying minimum wage while expecting maximum effort with no prospects of promotion or increase of wages  no benefits because we do not work 40 hours a week going home early on fridays  giving us less vacation days by forcing us to take them when the building is closed anyway in december  had no sanitary bins until today 03032020  terrible management and cheap product because too stingy to use more money  bosses get enough money to send two children to university while anyone else cannot live on their own and need to live with their parents  i would like to quit my job seeing as i do not feel the mental strain it is placing on me is worth it the work is boring and i am merely making other people very rich however seeing as i am still living with my parents their opinion is important seeing as i see them every day and it is never nice to live in a home where someone is disappointed in you my mother is very much against the idea keep in mind she is one of those people who works overtime with no compensation and is fine with it where as i merely see a job as a way to not starve to death and would never do something like that without compensation finding another job will be very difficult seeing as i live in a country with a very high unemployment and i live in a small town that just does not have a lot of jobs i believe that once i have my degree next year i should be able to get a job easier and i cannot stay at my job anyway because i would not be able to take care of myself anyway so finding another job is important  i really want to quit the job and would like to ask your opinion on this matter,fd92v1
640,Non-profit work is still W👏O👏R👏K👏,i gave my notice after many years of working in the nonprofit industry i thought that working to make the world better would lead me to feel passionate about a job all that it has done is make me feel cynical disgusted by the rich and completely burnt out  nonprofits rely on your kindness to a cause so that they can give you lesser pay they rely on your commitment to the mission so that they can overwork you too  most donors at the top of the food chain donate for the tax break and the opportunity to get their name on something stupid you dont have to work for them directly  they own you  executive directors are in the business of sales almost every ed ive encountered has been a snake that changes into a smarmy kiss ass as soon as a millionaire takes out their wallet  with the way that super tuesday is turning out i caution you if youre thinking about joining this industry to combat all the bullshit you see in the world the only way to combat bullshit is by changing the national culture and political system were not there yet    this is the only plan i have left  work for a forprofit company that offers standard hours and a medical care plan fuck whatever retirement package they offer the world is burning  keep a low profile do what im told leave on time  quit buying shit i dont need to alleviate the pain of existence live within my means  seek quality time with family and friends but balance it with alone time  find a hobby that puts me in a state of flow   good luck comrade were in this together,fdbdm3

646,Doing the simple time math on having a full time job and what it means for free time (unacceptable),i work from 95   i wake up at 7 am to get ready and go for the commute to work  i arrive home at 6 pm from my commute back from work  i have finished preparing eating and cleaning up after dinner at 7 pm  now i go to the gym from 8 pm till 9 pm and arrive back home at 930 pm  in order to get enough sleep i need to be in bed by 11 pm if i want my 8 hours of sleep cause im getting up at 7 am  so someone who works a full time job with a reasonably short commute and a single gym routine for health and well being outside the gym  essentially ends up with a maximum of an hour and a half of free time during the day on a typical work week  now i know that some people genuinely enjoy their work and some find fulfillment and subjective meaning in it and they like it and feel pride in it etc but at the end of the day whether that is 50 percent of the adult human population or 5 percent of the population is ultimately very hard to ever prove  because there are people who indeed claim to love their job but to some extent that is a coping mechanism in many cases i would think   better to tell yourself and others that you lovelike your job than to admit that you are forced to doing something that you honestly find rather unpleasant for the majority of your waking hours  in life and the only alternative is starvation on the street  therefore many likely convince others and themselves that they love or at least somewhat like their jobs despite it perhaps not being completely true  i get that things arent black and white life is full of gray area and many nuances back before the existence of money and agriculture and civilization and division of labor etc humans like other animals had to roam around the wild to find food  and the failure to do so or not being succesful in doing so meant starvation and death so its not only due to money and society and the evil rich men who control everything or whatever cliche its also just biological life that quite fundamentally is a ruthless asshole   but to me  ever since i was 10 years old and gradually started getting a sense of how the world worked for adults i was baffled about the whole forced labor for income paradigm where your right to life shelter and food came down to earning money through submission to work it always depressed me and horrified me   later in my teens i got into the venus project and the zeitgeist movement and philosophers like alan watts and many others talking about automating the vast majority of human labor and entirely doing away with this arbitrary man made invention called money they would talk about how through technology and rational scientific application of sane solutions to poverty and food production and distribution  overcoming many of these fundamental problems of scarcity competition and human misery and drudgery would be entirely possible from a strictly technical point of view even decades ago  here i am turning 30 soon and still utterly and completely horrified and sad and angry and depressed with how human society works in terms of money and jobs and all the insincerity pretense manipulation exploitation and fundamental idiocy surrounding this elaborate fiction of money and the made up economy based on nonsensicality   most of us are going places we dont want to go to to do things we dont want to do for many hours a day for reasons we dont believe in with people we dont want to be around all to be allowed to be alive   that is to say  we do shit we hate in order for us to go on doing things we hate such is life  i think it to be rational and sane and valid and reasonable to want to commit suicide considering this laughably insane and atrocious state of affairs that many view as normality   and i have thought like this for 2 decades now i fundamentally despise that we have to work to be allowed to be alive and i do not think that it has to be that way  you need to sell phone subscriptions or sell television sets in exchange for being allowed to eat most actual modern labor is not rational or sane or pragmatically necessary or overall a positive contribution to life   is it possible from a technical point of view to use the best of science and technology to automate the vast majority of  gtgtnecessaryltlt  labor and set humanity free to live our finite lives as we please without being forced to work our short lives away in exchange for a pay check   and is it possible to clothe house feed educate and provide medical care etc for literally every single human being on planet earth through mostly technical automated means in 2020 if that was indeed the explicit clear aim of modern civilization   if not then just get back to work or starve i guess and all you people who claim to love your jobs let me see you do it full time for a few years consistently in the complete absence of junk food cigarettes alcohol coffee etc to numb your authentic feelings of misery and despair,fbyu85

679,I don't know what the F to do,sorry this is just a rant im nearly 30 years old but have no formal job experience since i come from a complicated family situation and ive been struggling with depression and adhd all my life i tried to go through uni until recently when i finally had to quit because i couldnt make it work in my circumstances and it was only worsening my mental health then i met my current partner and came from a small rural town to the biggest city in my country thats supposedly brimming with jobs to live with him and away from my toxic family hoping to find whatever job i could do and live in peace of course thats turning out to not be possible for me either its already been a year since im here living off what little savings i had till now because i couldnt find a single fucking parttime job where theyd hire a careerless 30 year old only fast food and that only lasted me a month since i wasnt fast enough in the kitchen im functional capable of physical work and pretty sociable despite my illness i dont even talk about my mental health when applying because i know thats an instant reject but an empty resume at my age is an instant reject anyway what im supposed to do then today i told my partner that this months rent is all i have left after a year a whole fucking year trying he broke down crying said he doesnt want me to leave i dont want to leave either since i dont really know where i would have it better it broke my heart and it isnt even my fault is it i feel so powerless im a somewhat skilled artist and do commissioned work here and there but that doesnt give me enough to live either i dream of a life in which it does i look for parttime jobs because i know fulltime will absolutely obliterate my mental health like uni did but people react to it like im being picky and not willing to make real effort id rather have my face blasted off my head before admitting that people who are looking to preserve their health and just fucking enjoy their lives are being lazy were just trying to live out here,fdo7y9

682,A concern about this sub,hey guys i love being here with everyone and i have to say that i agree with everything herewell nomostly everything   i dont think this is how far society can advance tons of people having to suffer to make someone rich who doesnt care for his employees unless theyre up in the ladder right with them where employees are thrown to side and seen as being disposable if you dont want to work through hell for little to no pay   that said i have noticed an alarming amount of people who are slipping into this ideal of extreme socialism or even communism and as great as that would be it would only bring about a disaster these ideas are absolutely amazing great theories that can save so many peoples lives and better humanity as a whole however they are just that ideas and theories that sound great but time and time again when theyve been put to the test it only creates even more suffering than what we currently have now with capitalism such ideas will only work in an ideal society and sadly we are very far from that world   reality is cruel and there will always be someone seeking power for themselves and not for anyone else although we all share a common interestgoal we need to be a little more realistic and not leap over boundaries which we cannot reach to hope please try to remember that the step to a better society starts slowly gradually growing an instant jump from capitalism to communism or a similar ideal could lead to disaster and ruin economys i guess what i want to say is that some people here are seeming to become very extreme in their beliefs and the sub as a whole looks as if it is continuing to grow in that direction   we can do better than what we are at now i agree the amount of work we do is absurd they are people literally dying of exhaustion and being overworked but we mustnt abolish what we worked for and learn to keep our minds levelheaded and clear   tldr love you guys great subreddit but please stay calm before we turn into an extremist sub and lose our trail,fc5k6l

685,"Difference between ""Employee"" and ""Slave""",i was looking over google and generally this is what i have found  employee voluntarily enters into a contract with an employer to get paid in exchange for services  slave does not voluntarily enter into a contract but rather is forced to provide service without his consent  there are other differences that they seem to discuss but this is mainly high level ones   whats interesting is when they say voluntarily how is an employee voluntarily entering into a contract if he has to work to stay alive eg pay for roof over his head food clothing etc his condition is leaving him with no choice but to work whats more striking is the idea that the slave and employee are doing work which they dont like and have no choice but to do it  this is where the line between employee and slave seems blurred pretty sure this is why the word employee was invented it was to butter the term slave,fdf6ki
686,Rant: Can't even find a job despite years of hard work.,not really much point to this post other than needing to vent  i went to school for 7 years getting both my masters and bachelors in biomedical engineering i picked this field because it was challenging pays well and was supposedly a hugely growing market fast forward 25 years and i still cant find a job in my field despite having a decent resume and graduate school gpa of 37 i didnt have time to do any internships in college as i was at school 1114 hoursday due to my insane workload and having to schlep part time at a restaurant to pay for school i honestly have no idea where to go from here and im slowly losing my sanity   i dont know how im expected to do this the rest of my life,fd0koe
687,I've finally decided that I'm resigning from my abusive and toxic workplace.,im not going to get into too many details but i have endured this hellhole for 6 years theyve hurt me theyve hurt my family theyve allowed teenagers to take pictures of my body parts that were well covered up by you know proper clothing i just had the audacity to exist and be standing i guess without consequence ive been verbally abused and harassed ive been used and taken for granted part of this is me being stupid enough to believe i was working for some greater good but im not that stupid anymore   i had reached the point where it was either leave and make drastic changes or commit suicide my psychologist diagnosed me with cptsd based on a number of events surrounding and related to my place of work my union has been absolutely useless in this regard and i certainly cant afford a lawyer or anything so the only way i can really make them pay for a lifelong injury like this is to leave them in the lurch which i am absolutely going to do the timing will be perfect  i figured if i was willing to die i should be willing to make a big change which is still kind of scary and at least see if it helps make life more bearable i mean suicide is always there and maybe ill be happier 600 miles away working at retail or a pet store rather than a cog in a broken bureaucratic system stranger things have happened   im not even going to give them the satisfaction of knowing how they broke me im just going to submit a standard 2 weeks notice and disappear so im going to write what i really want to say   fuck all of you none of you give a shit about anyone but yourselves youre all hypocritical liars who have treated me like shit for years just because im different im sure im going to hell but youll be there too nobody deserves the curse of working here which is why you are already scraping the bottom of the barrel to try to fill positions in this shithole good luck replacing one of the most qualified people in your fucking building keep treating people like shit and wonder why you cant find good workers what a fucking mystery fuck you all,fde46e

690,"As a Marxist (Neo-Trotskyite), journeyman Silicon Valley technologist and intentional empath that was raised in a fundamentalist Christian cult, the following content constitutes my ideas as to what compels work and the suffering of work in our lives . (Part 1 - Religion)",1 religion   a prosperity theologyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiprosperitytheology      i prosperity theology is a tract of evangelical christianity spread by people like pat robinson and joel osteen that says that life god will reward those in a deterministichttpsenwikipediaorgwikideterminism way that work sufficiently hard or are sufficiently good in such a way that they will not suffer economic disenfranchisement      ii i find that this paradigm the actual effective reality of individuals toiling under the dynamic is most aptly summed up in the implications raised by the words arbeit macht freihttpsenwikipediaorgwikiarbeitmachtfrei pastors operating under this doctrine actually have the gall to go to communities where in my specific case the average income was 17kyr and tell individuals living in an environment of innate socioeconomic disenfranchisement and irrelevance that the reason they are poor is because they drink and fornicate and do not love god enough regardless of your individual beliefs which i do not seek to take from you and actually just hope enable you to be a kinder and happier person this is a cruelty that we ignore out of what i think is kindness criticizing and attacking religion is in many ways an attack on the spirit of the poor and i am sensitive to that however the fact that this is the case is something intentioned by the parties that benefit from the dynamic existing at all this being the republican party the vague shapeless face of the antiintellectualism movement alternative medicine antivax flat earth the cult of memes that attacks the very definition of what a fact is that can most be most simply qualified as existing in abundance around donald trump the republican partys rejection of science at any point of convenience and corporations that actively prey on the innate vulnerability of the working class for labor      iii god existing at all forces a dynamic where we apply intent and dignity to the phenomenology of poverty this is used to ensure the preservation of a underclass that can be the fuel for the comfort of the ruling class i dont mean to make all of these posts just be an endless allusion to scifi and history but this dynamic is most fully explored in brave new worldhttpsenwikipediaorgwikibravenewworld with its epsilonshttpsstudycomacademylessonepsiloninbravenewworldhtml this slave class creates the basement of experience that acts as reinforcement of the value of the pleasure experienced by the other classes if you were to poll the poorest people in this country the bulk of them would tell you that they believe in god its funny how piety the hope of salvation is only so often seen in the poor ill talk about this more in a future segment of this series but i am very confident in stating that the bulk of us are oppressed because we feel bad at some level for just wanting to do what we want with our only shot at existing or at least that is why i am learning programming so as to have as not miserable a job as possible and reject the capitalist institution at every opportunity     b death apologia      i death apologia can most easily be summed up as any formal defense of death as a necessary component of life as someone that worked at a y combinatorhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiycombinator biotech startup albeit only as a fundraiser for four years and who also identifies as a transhumanisthttpsenwikipediaorgwikitranshumanism i quite happily reject the necessity of death it might necessitate us changing the wayfrequency that people reproduce and doing so might require a greater degree of democracy and agency afforded to the individual we have now the way that we use resources and a renegotiation of economic systems but reality is such that were well on our way to solving the mechanisms of death and halting the syndrome of it in most humans      ii we might re probably not see it in our lifetime but the technological singularityhttpsenwikipediaorgwikitechnologicalsingularity is coming whether it be artificial intelligencehttpswwwmckinseycomfeaturedinsightsfutureofworkaiautomationandthefutureofworktenthingstosolveforpart2 or synthetic biologyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikisyntheticbiology we are nearing the end of material and energy scarcity which i am going to cover in a future installment of this series and must begin to prepare for it now capitalism is such that we will see arguments calling for the intrinsic necessity of scarcity without scarcity what will the wealthy judge their fortunes by      iii to invoke a personal story as evidence of this dynamic i would like to point out that my pastor grandmother has been waiting to die since she was about fifty years old she fundamentally believes that life in the now what we and most rationalist thinkers would call her one shot at existing at all is all window dressing for an eternity spent in worship at the feet of some highly fetishized god she has not savored one moment of her life without feeling sorry for not appreciating the hereafter enough its one of the most tragic things ive ever encountered as i write this i cannot think to call it anything other than eldritch or an aberration for no reason other than her class and the region that she was born into she has effectively wasted her one shot at existing wishing for the hereafter please empathize with the fact that this is a delusion and something that she would have been much better for to be cured of years ago as it stands the symbiote has become the host and vice versa she is mostly religion at this point her sanity sinking into a stew of delusions that she will never emerge from even as i stress constantly the necessity of freedom of religion as a consequence of the pursuit of liberty i recoil from the heinous effect of it in the individual we talk with horror as to the effects of meth but ignore the effect of nonsensical faith in the unknown if i am wrong ill see you all in hell however if i am right as i think i am i dont even get that we stop existing the second were dead and warm and i think it enriches the experience of life in general to speak of it so freely   to cap this off it is important that we start to examine the institutions that oppress our most vulnerable as these are the institutions that are going to rebel against the destruction of work for everyone in the wake of the decline of scarcity this being something that i am going to cover in the next few days im going to leave you off with a couple of posits   do you gain peace by embracing this life as your one shot if not does that scare you  what are policy ideas that you think should be implemented in the near future  what do you think we are going to fuck up integrating into our daytoday life,fc7hwl

Bonus, they found a loophole so they don't have to pay overtime!",so after a period of realization that life isnt worth working at the fluorescent light filled hell hole that was my last job i finally got the inspiration to quit i could write endlessly about how bad it was but take my word for it my old job was everything this sub loathes so after quitting i finally found a job at a really cool tech company they touted a very progressive work culture pay was good all that shit get this they had me install a mandatory program on my computer that tracks time takes webcam shots of me all throughout the day takes screenshots of my computer activity rates my keystrokes and mouse movement and that information is used in my monthly performance reviews which determine pay raises and everything the worst part is i cant afford to quit and as we all know it is so hard to find a decent job i should have known this job was too good to be true im now stuck in an equally bad prison as the one before the company morale is terrible also just think about it for a moment a few minutes go by and in that time a webcam picture is taken multiple screenshots are taken and you have to make sure you are typing and clicking its terrible also i havent even mentioned the worst part yet they basically created a work around for the overtime law so a really intriguing part of this job was that it was salary well with this program you also have to clock in and out and the screenshots and stuff only happen when youre clocked in if you need to get up to go to the bathroom you have to clock out or it will notice your inactivity and deduct 15 minutes as a penalty if you exceed the two 10 minute allotted breaks for the day your paycheck gets deducted however many minutes you missed so for 7 hours and 40 minutes i have to be completely alert or my salary turns into hourly to sum that up if i work more than 40 hours a week i dont get any extra pay but if i work less than 40 hours minus two ten minute breaks daily then my pay gets deducted i hate it,fc8ode

755,Employers try to prevent sick days even more on those specific days: if you don't have the staff to cover sick days hire more staff or don't have them all on at once,             staff note  in days where we are running 3 beams we are maxed out on staff that means if you call in sick there is nobody to take your place  to basically please avoid being sick in general but extra on those days oris and some wednesday     such appreciated ,fdtxao
756,Officers vs. Enlisted,i just saw a picture of my cousin who enlisted in the usaf  he has been advancing pretty decently and i guess his wife has seemed to be pretty proud but when i saw the shot of him working on a plane all i could think was something along the lines of that poor bastard  working on someone elses plane that someone else gets to fly while hes stuck on the ground in grease and probably cuts  maybe im just a piece of shit but i mean how do people reconcile that kind of shit the officers get the nice living quarters and all the fun while the guys who were cursed with a shittier birth have to do all the dirty bullshit  i mean fuck that shit dear jesus am i wrong its like dude fuck you god i am not doing that shit just so this asshole can go have a blast  thank ya for ur service,fdm2tx

758,[Meta] How to never be promoted.,gt be the absolute best at your current position  its counter intuitive but hear me out if the boss promotes the best employee it will only hamper their production and cost the company money  thats why when your employer finally promotes from within its always that jackass that doesnt know his asshole from his elbow it wont hurt production to take that guy off the production line   let me introduce your new boss jack wagon,fdm55z

760,Quitting the job I just started,so a couple of weeks ago i was hired to be a cashier at a large retailer and these have truly been the most miserable weeks of my life thus far  i had intended for this to just be a small gig to make a little spending money while i finish school but the demands of this job have left me with very little time and energy for my studies i applied for it thinking it was going to be a parttime role since it was listed as such but the turnover rate is so high for new hires here and the stores been so criminally understaffed that i have been scheduled for fulltime hours these past weeks and for the upcoming weeks i honestly wish i had quit during the first week along with the half the others in my training batch but as this was my first job i was scared of this shit coming back to bite me if ever i needed another job in the future so i decided to tough it out for just a month and submit my two weeks then    i really dont think i can stand working here for that much longer though customer service is the shittiest and most exhausting acting gig out there i hate the expectation that i have to smile and remain friendly with people that are being rude as fuck to me often for things that are outside of my control granted im a lot slower to ring people up because this is my first time doing this sort of thing but people getting pissed at me over store policy the prices of their items their yearold coupons not working their card getting declined etc holy fuck i did not think it were possible for me to hate entitled middleagedold people any more than i did prior to starting this job i really dont get paid enough to put up with this shit there are so many other things i have to rant about but i really dont want this post to get too long   my grades have already slipped significantly because the hours are so long and the work is so mindnumbing that im just too fucking exhausted both physically and mentally to do anything once i come home after a shift the only times i really have the will to do anything are during my two split days off wherein i spend the entire day just catching up to school running errands and fulfilling miscellaneous other responsibilities outside of work so i really cant even consider those days off per se i just hate that ive been pretty much forced to prioritize this job over my education and i dont even need it because i still live with my parents and theyve been kind enough to cover the costs of my needs again i just wanted the job so that i could have some spending money for going out with friends and other frivolous shit i dont want my parents to have to pay for i no longer have the time to go out and the money feels so pyrrhic that i dont even want to spend it anymore so what even is the point now  i feel so drained and also am getting very anxious about my grades getting worse i already have my two weeks notice written up and i had originally intended to submit it a couple days ago honestly i kind of want to just say fuck the two weeks and quit immediately without notice but i dont want my coworkers to have to suffer for it especially with the store being as consistently understaffed as it is   the thing is though is that there was a problem with my direct deposit and i still havent gotten paid for this last pay period im trying to work with one of my managers to resolve it and i feel like it would be awkward to submit my notice before that happens hopefully it gets resolved today because i really dont want to put it off any longer the mere thought of giving any more of my time to this company is genuinely making me want to kill myself if this gets drawn out any longer would it be fine to just submit a one week notice,fde6wa

766,Brainwashed by Capitalism,heres a list of things i hate when people say  being a gogetter supporting yourself making something of your life following your dreams setting goals finding fulfillment working hard etc im sure theresmore i forgot  my main point is that these tropes are bullshit and they try to frame work as necessary and positive almost as if you arent a full person if you arent workoriented  many idealistic college graduates hold these beliefs and find them crashing down once they get a job by the stark reality of wageslavery,fbtyrq
