2,The Bee Movie is antiwork,i was thinking about the bee movie the other day it shows how the bees labor is necessary for the entire planets ecosystem to function but the culty hypercapitalist system that they live in is exploitative as one of the human villains says they make the honey and we make the money and it also shows how bees are arbitrarily assigned a single job that they have zero passion for theyre brainwashed into thinking working that job for their whole lives is their purpose of living they work until they die and get easily replaced by newly graduated bees and many of them arent paid enough in the end they solve problems by collectively working together not with a profit motive for a large monopoly but with the motive to make the world a better place because their labor makes a real difference  one scene goes like this  and youll be happy to know that bees as a species havent had one day off in 27 million years  so youll just work us to death  well sure try  everyone else laughs,oaigw9

10,Help me build the support networks for a general strike:,look i know i know youve all grown tired of hearing about unactualized general strikes so have i   however i think most of us believe in the need for such an action if not only to raise our depressed wages then also for healthcare our environment our kids for the members of our extended families in not only the first world but also the third  for the immigrant children whove experienced prison even before puberty for the untold numbers of adults who have and still are wasting away in prison for those whove been prayed upon by rehabs and insurance companies and those whove needlessly suffered the world over for some oligarchs profits  i could write a book but it wouldnt bring to light anything you dont already know  specifically what is it we know we know that behind this myriad of issues lays one relatively small group of people and this is true for not just one country but the world over  our issues may be so numerous that it seems too daunting to tackle the issues fair enough lets treat the cause not the symptoms   eventually we strike we demand justice and equality we demand accountability for those whove let our loved ones die with treatable diseases who let us suffer mental health issues while we toil away for unlivable wages and we demand accountability to those whove suppressed science and whove worked to corrupt our governments  but to begin i propose we start crunching the numbers   how many people can a certain population nashville tn for instance expect to participate in a general strike   how long might we expect that to last   how much money would we need to support ourselves throughout such an event   how long might we expect it to take to raise those funds in advance   i want to begin working this out by labor day and with your help i hope to begin opening individual kickstarter accounts for each participating area so a kickstart for nashville for birmingham for omaha for denver for la etc and thats only here in the us  we need to extrapolate on this idea and implement it world wide for if we only strike in the us these multinationals will only redirect profits from the rest of the world to subvert our efforts   we need to stand with honk kong again we need to support chile peru and iran and we need them to support us not so much support us with money but with solidarity and we need to support them we are in this together,ob0dww

37,What I realized recently about my life,this is my story of working life  since i left school i worked in different jobs like retail and call centers for some years now  i had motivation for my first call center job and tried hard to show my best for my girlfriends sake since she demanded more money at some point i didnt feel like myself anymore i felt like some kind of robot who would do and say the same things every day without an ending in sight  the stress of the job by dealing with customers who would insult scream and threaten me was really bad for my health my heart beat quickly my body was stinging so much that i thought i would die and my hands were sweating so much that my clothes would be all wet where my hands were placed i even went to a doctor regarding that pain but he didnt care about it much and didnt seem to want to even take time for me he only said that im young and thats normal  ampx200b  some time went by and i ended the relationship with my girlfriend amp with my job when i finally realized that it was the same as my parents relationship where my mother is only together with my father because of money never understood why people are in relationships when its only for having an advantage and not about love   dad was working the whole time for money was rarely at home and missed seeing his children growing up completely   mother was buying much unnecessary stuff with the money and instead of love there was verbal amp physical abuse at home    at that time i didnt know what was right or wrong since noone told me i was new to this world and i just thought what did i do wrong why am i so bad all the time when i was crying myself to sleep or had suicide thoughts after experiencing abuse  when i grew a little older i realized i never want to end up like adults who are causing pain and are two faced once i visited my grandmas house and found randomly a piece of paper which said human rights opened the paper and read the articles where i started smiling and just thought what kind of world is that i was sure its not the world i experienced so far  ampx200b  i was completely alone again searched for another job since i had no money for paying rent and landed in retail didnt have much motivation when u got noone the motivation is really bad but i still tried to do a good job people were complaining like usual about things i cant change and sometimes they were expecting me to do things where i thought im not getting paid for doing that  after some time in this job i realized no matter how hard i try to do a good job it actually doesnt matter and started thinking every time i tried hard to do something the best i can in the past it always ended really bad for myself  without a single break time and being up on my feet the whole time at a eight to ten hour shift in the job my feet got really painful and it got worse over time decided this isnt worth it that my health is more important and i quit this job who only paid minimum wage anyways  ampx200b  on the advice of my colleague from the retail job i applied for unemployment benefits to get it however you had to write applications on job advertisements so i applied for jobs that are possible where i meet the requirements retail amp call center with hope to get a job without experiencing pain the unemployment benefit i received was below the poverty line but it was enough to survive  ampx200b  got a new job in a call center which i only did for a month before quitting every single day that month i had severe headaches and could hardly concentrate i thought the whole time while at work why am i doing this going to the doctor was no option for me from my past experience so i quit after a month and with the day of the termination of the job the headaches have disappeared   ampx200b  i decided to take a few months off with my savings now without an income since i dont know what to do anymore somehow i dont care much about money or a job mostly giving the money i earned to charitys to help abuse victims if i had to decide between a job which causes me pain and unemplyoment benefits without pain i would always choose the latter though,oalpds

58,Gen Xer here with a few ideas for ya'll,hi i just bumped into this sub and wanted to throw out a few ideas for those who feel like cogs meaningless under paid workers   apologies for the length of this post and lack of links but i hope someone out there finds this useful   have you heard of  intentional living  and alternative things like cohousing  google intentional living  in these arrangements you can trade say 20 hours of work a week on a communal project whatever your talent might be from gardening to help prepare meals to planningand then n return for being part a community all housing and other basic  needs are taken care of but goes beyond just basic needs    i like the ecological communities built around sustainable living  im looking into a few of them now   these communities exist all over the world including two in nyc   im assuming a younger crowd here so this is what i tell my 16 year old nephew whos working part time at subway hes a talented drummer and wants to be a jazz musician i tell him to go for it but theres things that pay a lot of money that dont involve korporate america that can pay the bills until he reaches carnegie hall heh   1 painting interiors andor exteriors i needed a painter a few years ago and couldnt find an affordable one that did decent work and didnt whine about doing some drywall this wasnt a huge job but the prices were surreal if you live in or near a city make up cards and get to know management companies that manage condos coops apartment buildings and building supers the management of our 5 story condo paid something like 40k to have the freakin halls painted  hard to believe isnt it two 5 story sister buildings just the halls    2 electrician  interesting work and no ones going to outsource electricians i need a kitchen monorail light fixed and the going rate to troubleshoot it is 175hr  from past experiences its really hard to find a good electrician  so when word gets out these guys are all booked i cant afford to have it looked at so im just  going to replace this light   my brothers a small time builder hes had projects on hold for weeks waiting for the electrician to have time to show up   3 farriersomeone who shoes horses  dont laugh about 20 years ago i was assigned a land line number that had belonged to a local farrier my phone rang all day long 7 days a week  all these people were scrambling to find another farrier theres a real shortage and farriers make a lot of money sure its hard work but not any harder than working for a general contractor besides horse people are generally nice very appreciative of the farrier and working around horses beats working in retail overhead is low just have to learn the trade   4 it youre a creative type open an etsy store   back in the day i knew this couple who sold sporting memorabilia on ebay it started as a hobby they got so busy they had to both quit their korporate jobs i dont know where they sourced the products i think they had to drive around a bit but they had fun and made more money than their old jobs   5 many of you probably live in areas where you can find deals on mid century modern furniture and related items teach yourself about mid century  modern design drive around to wherever its found in your area then haul it to a city flea market the prices this stuff goes for boggles my mind  example gt i knew these two guys living the beach life in ft lauderdale fl apparently south florida is loaded with mid century modern furniture they started buying it for cheap then theyd make runs about 3 times a year and unload this stuff at the clelsea flea market in nyc  i dont know how much they made but they sure werent slumming it and had loads of time  this hot trend doesnt show signs of going anywhere even after 20 years   6 grow mosses for the aquarium trade look up the prices of various mosses on any site that sells plants for fish tanks a little 3 x 3 piece of moss goes for a fortune and the biggest joke is its not hard to cultivate if i had an extra room thats what id be doing speaking of the aquarium trade look at how much driftwood and various rocks sell for some woods cant be used in fish tanks but plenty can look at the prices  of pieces of wood and rocks used in aqua scaping you wont believe how much money people pay for rocks and wood read up how to treat wood yourself its not hard  if i had an extra room thats what id be doing   especially smaller pieces like for 10 gallon betta tanks a couple of small pieces of spider wood at the pet store or aquarium shop are probably around 3000 havent looked in a while  i know some states have laws against taking rocks from streams so pay attention to local ordinances look on ebay if you want to get an idea of how much rocks are worth lol   just a few ideas for housing and getting off the treadmill  all the best       i really want to move and get into the moss business lol,oan7zg

60,I just started a new job last month and I already am fucking miserable,is there a job that exists that is actually enjoyable or is there any job that exists that is actually fun likewhat the fuck man i have had over 20 jobs in my life and i always end up feeling the same exact way at every job  bored and miserable i need a miracle to happen to me or else im doomed to a life of boring ass fucking jobs,ob8ilk
61,FMLA is going to make things interesting at my job,specifically me going on fmla for a chronic health condition  i work at a retail store where we are pretty much always short one person  thats how they like to run it  now ive gone on fmla before when i was younger but it was at a big call center so it didnt make much difference if i was there or not  however at this job it will hit them hard if they dont hire another person  for those not familiar with fmla it gives 60 days off a year  these days are without pay but it makes sure someone doesnt lose their job because of a health condition theyre dealing with or taking care of a loved one and a couple other scenarios  ive been able to work there so far without much trouble of having to call in sick etc  im planning to go off a specific medication and i know there will be withdrawal and there could even be weeks where i dont come in  the interesting thing about fmla is i dont have to give notice really  and i can even show up late and leave early at my discretion as im doing my best with a chronic condition    the reason im making this post is because i have a feeling i am going to be the one to blame when the store is short handed  certain coworkers wont like it and management wont like it either if the company decides to not hire another person  we have a store manager but in many ways he doesnt make decisions for the store he doesnt decide how many people work there he doesnt advocate for his employees to the higher ups  he is seen as doing a good job by keeping the least amount of employees with the least amount of pay and keeping the store running  its a pathetic way to live your life in my opinion    various coworkers wont understand what fmla is and im definitely going to be somewhat hated on  as far as i know the store management has never had an employee on fmla and it will be new for them too  i can come in every other day  give myself three or four day weekends pretty much anything i want and they cant do a thing about it   im not being paid for when im not working so its not like theyre losing money  but with how they designed the work schedule and amount of employees its going to kill them if they dont hire another person at least part time  there will be more pressure on staff to not take their vacation days etc  i know the simplest solution will be to hire another person full time and theres room for another person with me working there full time right now  but i know how things work there and they would rather everyone suffer for as long as possible before they decide to bring someone else on  ill definitely post an update when this all goes down  now remember im not doing this to fuck with them  i need money i need to work i just dont want to be in danger of losing my job because i ran out of sick days or endanger myself and others by trying to work while in withdrawal or without having slept  but i bet you im going to be looked at as the bad guy  the guy with the chronic health conditions that works when he can yeah thats the guy who is making it so hard on everyone else,oaoqmi

64,Eager to quit the job that’s forcing me to return to in-person. Mistake?,while some might argue i have a good job and that i am lucky to hold i am very eager to find a new one i did a calculation today that if i come in at the number of hours they want me to after they force us to return to the office 4 days per week minimum i would spend 384 hours every year commuting and it makes me really mad despite the security and fairly good salary and decent benefits this does not seem to be worth it to me   i have two options  1 i tell my supervisors that coming in 4days a week is a dealbreaker and that  i will need to look for another job this will undoubtedly piss them off   2 i do it behind their back which will piss them off even more loyalty is a big thing in their view and i also run the risk of finding something with less benefits potentially less stimulating for my brain and also likely less secure in terms of job security longterm   what experience are people having looking for remote jobs currently is the market for those actually as abundant as the internet makes it seem ive been doing a bit of digging and it seems like a lot of the good remote jobs are in engineering and it am i just looking in the wrong places i am specifically looking for administrativecommunicationsgrant adminleadershiphr positions  looking for your helpful comments my antiwork warriors am i making a mistake thinking the grass is greener on the other side one day maybe we will be free after decades of killing ourselves to reach financial independence,oalesa

68,Never give two weeks.,story of my last job we needed a degree experience using software quick skills  they paid 15he no sick days no time off no benefits managers were bosses friends and family all making 400k a year to just check emails basically took commissions off of our artwork all we got was hourly  anyways each christmas break last two weeks of the year the company closed down unpaid so december we would work two weeks get paid then have to take off two weeks no pay and then come back jan first and then work two weeks before getting paid  so we had to go a month without pay and due to the noncompete we couldnt really work another job  in orlando fl rent isnt cheap  the company really liked to fire people on jan first so you would come back after no paycheck for two weeks and then get let go on the day rent is due they would even make you drive to the office as well just let you sit at your desk call you outside to talk fire you and not even let you go back in  imagine driving 30 miles on the highway at 7am to a job that hasnt paid you in two weeks just to be fired  i personally quit didnt like the attitude i was getting and walked out right then and there i was the lead and the quickest took them hiring 4 people to replace me and still never really caught back up,oajssu
69,Why does everything about the human race have to be so complicated? Hear me out...,i have to go back to a job soon sadly and i feel completely empty i dont feel like a human i feel like an empty shell full of dread and despair i am a robot whose sole existence is to provide labor for his employer and i will do so until the day i die sacrificing family time holidays and my time and passions and interests and my very soul in exchange for slips of paper and be happy for the opportunity to do so  i always get told that i have a god complex or that i think im better than anyone else whenever i suggest that humans are inherently evil and stupid or even better their response is youre human too yeah obviously i am what do you expect me to slowly turn to you look at you with wide eyes and realize in that moment that holy shit i am human111 no i realize im a human and that im no better than anyone else that doesnt mean i shouldnt be able to have an opinion about the human race as a whole its possible to step away from yourself and look around and see just why theyre stupid  well for starters were the only living species that passes around green slips of paper that at some point was collectively agreed upon to be a method of trade although its value is completely imaginary we pass around these green slips of paper to be able to have shelter food and water which are basic human necessities we essentially decided to be the only living species to pay to live on their planet  1 we in a greatly exaggerated sense at some point decided to pass around green slips of paper to be able to drink out of a lake after watching deer drinking out of it freely 2 we in a greatly exaggerated sense decided to watch dolphins swim around in the water happily living a simple enjoyable life and decided to make our lives about worrying over numbers on a computer screen in a thing called a bank account dropping below a value of zero 3 we in a greatly exaggerated sense saw the beauty in nature and decided to tear it all down destroying and murdering for the sake of a system valuing infinite profit over human life on a planet with finite resources earth was essentially a paradise and we tore it down making asphalt roads pollution machines of all kinds and treating it like a giant trash can   a green slip of paper that we call a bill is not going to stop a bear from attacking you   a green slip of paper that we call a bill is not going to magically make the water stop drowning you  a green slip of paper that we call a bill is not going to stop that tornado from changing course and barreling over your house why does money matter  money makes things soulless get a job doing what you love is capitalist bullshit you should not have to monetize and profit off of the few things that make you wholeheartedly happy when you apply money to something you will soon hate it you may love to have sex a lot but once youre stuck on a strict schedule of sex 8 hours a day you may only want to have sex for 4 hours a day but have to continue doing it for 8 and if you dont you get kicked out you may love to bake cakes but once youre doing it 10 hours a day on a strict schedule for an ungodly amount of customers every single day youll soon dread it work is a neverending vicious cycle it feels like youre being drowned 5 days a week and your two days off are your attempts to gasp for breath as your head is temporarily pulled out of the water bucket for 40 years until you die or if you survive maybe youll get 12 years of freedom but you wont have the youth or energy to truly enjoy it and with the way things are going my generation cant retire my generations retirement plan as a general rule is to just wait for societal collapse  and politics fuck them i hate politics ive started to realize more and more that there is no left vs right its a tactic to make citizens break apart and fight against each other rather than uniting their minds and realizing the true problems each side just wants to brainwash you into accepting their ideals and beliefs instead of being independent and seeing the worlds biggest problems originally it was supposed to be one side having different ways of tackling issues as opposed to the other side nowadays its oh fuck the right theyre so brainwashed the left are so brainwashed and nobody wants to go back to work politics are rigged the people in power stay in power theres a whole system theyve created to keep the general population brainwashed or at the very least distracted or chained down to keep them from overthrowing them we could have a world thats fair and just with no chance of corrupt individuals rising to power and instead we have a world where everyone has been brainwashed to believe slavery no longer exists stop limiting yourself to thinking of chatel slavery  its what they want slavery still exists its just been sugarcoated and the rules have changed its better than what we had before but its still there capitalism runs on the threat of poverty and the man who bakes a loaf of bread to earn the money to buy a slice of bread is not free  why does everything have to be so complicated we look at dolphins and think were more intelligent than them because weve achieved the wheel new york wars and so on while all the dolphins ever do is swim in the water having a good time conversely the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man for precisely the same reasons hitchhikers guide to the galaxy  how am i supposed to be hopeful and cheerful looking towards my future besides my girlfriend all i see in the future are terrible bosses low wages rising inflation a worsening housing market criminalizing the homeless rich getting richer poor getting poorer and a world not on the brink of collapse but rather already in the midst of collapse i see wars coming i see fascism spreading outside of workplaces i see a greater hell than were already in,ob8q7f

74,Working is Pain - gonna take a Break now,since i left school i worked in different jobs like retail and call centers for some years now  i had motivation for my first call center job and tried hard to show my best for my girlfriends sake since she demanded more money at some point i didnt feel like myself anymore i felt like some kind of robot who would do and say the same things every day without an ending in sight  the stress of the job by dealing with customers who would insult scream and threaten me was really bad for my health my heart beat quickly my body was stinging so much that i thought i would die and my hands were sweating so much that my clothes would be all wet where my hands were placed i even went to a doctor regarding that pain but he didnt care about it much and didnt seem to want to even take time for me he only said that im young and thats normal  some time went by and i ended the relationship with my girlfriend amp with my job when i finally realized that it was the same as my parents relationship where my mother is only together with my father because of money never understood why people are in relationships when its only for having an advantage and not about love   dad was working the whole time for money was rarely at home and missed seeing his children growing up completely   mother was buying much unnecessary stuff with the money and instead of love there was verbal amp physical abuse at home  at that time i didnt know what was right or wrong since noone told me i was new to this world and i just thought what did i do wrong why am i so bad all the time when i was crying myself to sleep or had suicide thoughts after experiencing abuse  when i grew a little older i realized i never want to end up like adults who are causing pain and are two faced once i visited my grandmas house and found randomly a piece of paper which said human rights opened the paper and read the articles where i started smiling and just thought what kind of world is that i was sure its not the world i experienced so far  i was completely alone again searched for another job since i had no money for paying rent and landed in retail didnt have much motivation when u got noone the motivation is really bad but i still tried to do a good job people were complaining like usual about things i cant change and sometimes they were expecting me to do things where i thought im not getting paid for doing that after some time in this job i realized no matter how hard i try to do a good job it actually doesnt matter and started thinking every time i tried hard to do something the best i can in the past it always ended really bad for myself without a single break time and being up on my feet the whole time at a eight to ten hour shift in the job my feet got really painful and it got worse over time decided this isnt worth it that my health is more important and i quit this job who only paid minimum wage anyways  on the advice of my colleague from the retail job i applied for unemployment benefits to get it however you had to write applications on job advertisements so i applied for jobs that are possible where i meet the requirements retail amp call center with hope to get a job without experiencing pain the unemployment benefit i received was below the poverty line but it was enough to survive  got a new job in a call center which i only did for a month before quitting every single day that month i had severe headaches and could hardly concentrate i thought the whole time while at work why am i doing this going to the doctor was no option for me from my past experience so i quit after a month and with the day of the termination of the job the headaches have disappeared  i decided to take a few months off with my savings now without an income since i dont know what to do anymore somehow i dont care much about money or a job mostly giving the money i earned to charitys to help abuse victims if i had to decide between a job which causes me pain and unemplyoment benefits without pain i would always choose the latter though,oatpgf
75,"It seems hypocritical to ban Dan Price tweets but continue to allow Bernie Sanders, AOC, Squad etc. tweets.",dan price is a literal capitalist who writes tweets highlighting the problems of capitalism with the underlying assumption that these problems could be corrected from within the system if only people behaved more morally  how are bernie aoc et al any different  i have found their tweets to be even more disingenuous than dan prices were talking about people who literally voted in favor of the cares act the single largest upward transfer of wealth in history and somehow they have the high ground over some tech entrepreneur when they presided over and without objection supported the flybynight passage of the single most stark looting of the proletariat class by the bourgeoisie that has ever happened  this isnt to say that i disagree with the decision to remove dan prices tweets  but to the same token it seems very hypocritical to do so while continuing to allow content from people who insidiously do more to undermine our cause while actually being in a position of real power dan price is small potatoes next to the audacious mendacity i see coming from bernie and aoc,oaxkq1

25 in a couple of months and im literally at the worst point in my life when im being told by everyone your 20s are the best years of your life enjoy em while you can   no one payed attention to me during school college or work i was being abused at home daily and didnt even know just taking it to be the norm and coming from a family that has 0 communication made me talk and open up to no one even to this day  no one knows whats really happened to me no one knows how deep the past 20 years of my life has been affecting me my first visual memory of my parents i can still remember is them fighting with my 4 year old brother in the middle being tossed around we were underfed unclothed unclean and had to support ourselves from a very young age stealing food and money to get by and fit in with friends and peers to appear normal  there were times that i would try and open up and explain just how im feeling inside which is nothing i feel empty and unmotivated and lacking any sense of self worth my parents school college all knew i have various degrees of mental difficultly but no one really wanted to help a family thats disconnected a history of violence a christian school that i dont remember once even mentioning mental health through the 5 years i was there and an underfunded college treating adults like children still put your hand up to go to the toilet put your phone in a box at the start of class like im 18 fucking years old when will this stop  i was then told at the ripe age of adulthood i need to get a job or get out i hit the age where college funding of 30 a week or whatever wasnt paid to students now and since the child benefits stopped i was no longer paying my way i dropped college left home moved in with someone that turned into a 4 year relationship of lies cheating and a whole other slurry of issues and worked my ass off trying to earn money to get by   i had no one showing me what to do growing up all i had was boomers spewing capitalist nonsense and everyone everywhere telling me work will sort me out tv shows throws themselves into work and fixes every life problem id grown up on the idea that work leads to a better life so i did  i took any work i could get just proud to go out and earn i started cleaning at a cinema chain which i loved as growing up in a dirty household led to many ocd issues as well i was getting up at 4am and going to work cleaning doing my thing and would be home by 12pm having the time of my life feeling shit but feeling motivated then i got into retail fucked me up ever since i was used by management had no mental health support quit education and never dealt with any of my childhood issues they told me i didnt matter and was replaceable within a week that i should be lucky to have a job as it wasnt so easy back in the day   they think now we can sit on our arse through education and university get a degree and a high paying job without lifting a finger while they all cry about coal mines and factories and landlines im sorry i was born into a generation of technology and things are different but it wasnt our generation that built what we have today or asked for it in the first place were used as punching bags for the failure our families before have caused and as were just newer extensions of them we should be able to have the same capacity they did when the world has changed completely  boomers posting about how we dont work hard anymore we play on our phones and videos games and sit of social media all day gossiping we watch netflix instead of the stock market and we watch youtube instead of reading scientific publications they make us feel like were worthless and unuseful from the start so we keep turning the cogs with low paying unmotivating and grueling work not telling us about their failures and how they did pretty much every we did but were a mistake where they are a lesson you worked physically for 8 hours a day or pushed papers walked into work as demand wasnt so much higher than supply any overtime or extra work that was done was for your personal benefit and success where our extra work and overtime is another 21 in the wage with 40 taken off and being screamed at on the phonein person by entitled karens and ians   were treated like slaves and told differently because we now have basic human rights i dont have a basic right to any land or property i dont have basic human rights to water as i need a property to get the water i dont have access to the healthcare i so desperately need i dont have access to any work that will get me out of a horrendous situation because of a situation i had no control over there are thousands of homeless people literally entitled to nothing and people walk by everyday without a care in the world   our world is at a fine breaking point where a while generation is just going to be taken down by mental health suicide self harm aampe admissions hotlines charities are all on the brink unable to cope with the huge demand of all walks of life and ages being treated so unworthy and inhumane theres so much evil in the world hidden behind a silver veil that is soon going to fall when the generations running no longer can no one lives forever and the horrors will be revealed very shortly seeing nearly 3 generations banding together saying this world isnt right this isnt what a perfect life we need change is the only thing keeping me going right now and im sure its the same for a lot of others   we need complete change and we need it soon,oaflsb

138,Any suggestions for someone who would rather die than work?,ok so the title is a little extreme as id be more likely to drop out of society than off myself or something but i have to have a little rant here this is where my mindset is at bare with me its very cynical and probably not healthy  im tired of people saying hard work pays something similar was literally written above auschwitz and the whole cultural mindset that everybody has to be perceived to have a good job claw their way to the top tooth and nail pitted against each other while the bosses are rolling in it hard work pays what sure some cash but youve lost out on some time and health  im tired of capitalism the name even shows its all focused on someones capital while communism regardless of how its been instilled in history is at its core focused in community  so yeah id rather be broke poor and be perceived as a slacker than give in to that game i dont want to be a pawn laboror helping to line a billionaires pocket so as a result im incredibly unmotivitated in a system thats failed me and a lot of us im qualified enough but out of work right now and im at a loggerheads   does anyone have any motivation to get me around this mindset,o9n8zp

149,how should i call off work,so this weekend my friends are having a huge party at their lake house for 4th of july my roommate and myself work together at a bar where we are both scheduled to work fridaysaturday from 3121am however all of our friends are going down on thursday morning so we will have to miss 3 days of the trip two days ago i felt super sick and thought i had covid despite being vaccinated and previously diagnosed with covid so i got a test and it was negative turns out it was just sinus infection i am trying to figure out the best way to call off this weekend so i thought i could just tell my boss i was diagnosed with covid and then my roommate could get off too since she lives with me but my boss turns out to be my mothers best friend who ive known my entire life to set more context the bar is an outdoor bar and is only open when the weather is nice and closes for rain however the past 2 weekends stayed open even though it rained my boss calls people off almost every night as well because there are always too many people scheduled but due to the fact that my boss is like a second mother to me she never calls of me or my roommate bc she doesnt want it to come across as favoritism she also has previously told me that we my roommate and myself will not be called of from her unless her boss says to i really dont want to miss 3 out of the 4 days of our mini vacation we have taken every year for the past 4 years we have been looking forward to it since the moment we left last year should i go through with the lie of having covid or be honest with my boss and ask for the weekend off even though its a mandatory weekend with no call offs and risk her saying no i dont know what to do give me advice,oa14yz
150,What is happening?,    is anyone tired of not being paid their worth i graduated and worked myself to the absolute bone to be the best in computer science i got my first job at a fortune 25 company and i am basically monkey that no longer codes i am constantly barraged with after hours calls and emails i maintain a major system of distribution that maintains the company yet none of it is difficult i work 10 hours a week while pretending to work 4550 ive come to realize all the hard work ive put in is pointless ive seen nepotism push people who know zero go on to make 310x my salary with productivity decoupling from pay since the 70s its clear my work has no value i personally consider it corporate welfare i pretend to work and they pretend to pay me statistics show in real purchasing power the generations before me made 3x as much presumably doing 33 of the work i cannot afford a home i cannot afford a family and yet i must smile i must go to work acting as if it is a good thing to be busy yet even if i were to make myself busy i would reap none of the benefits and follow none of my passions i cannot fathom the absolute euphoria the generations that proceeded me must have felt unknowingly i understand not everyone has the same opportunity and even regardless of the generational differences we all for the most part should feel scammed i am so tired of pretending that all my hard work was worth living in a box alone scrimping pennies to save for a retirement that continuously gets pushed further and further out with each passing generation why is it in real purchasing power generations before me made 3x as much why does 40 of my salary go to rent when generations before me spent lt10 everyone thinks because we live in the age of advanced technology were blessed we live in an age where automation is right around the corner the jones act destroying national commerce for the benefit of one singular big business via lobbyingbribery why do we live in an age where this is acceptable why are people so heavily indoctrinated to believe we are a country for the people it is clear lobbying is to keep corporatism in the forefront of all governmental progress because it boosts gdp look at every nation outside the us the party is quickly coming to an end every single generation borrows from the success of the next one look at the diminishing returns on generational wealth amongst boomersmillennialszooomers and tell me we arent flat lining in prosperity how long can this torment go on where corporate welfare continues to make useless jobs out of explosive productivity pay less and less why is it that things get harder every generation yet when critical thinking says it should be the opposite we live in a post scarcity society and yet we have zero autonomy i was excited that the pandemic gave individual autonomy to work from home yet big business wants to hold us down to protect their bottom line god forbid we didnt have to pretend to work why is it that me sitting in a cubicle doing nothing makes more than the average tradesman in my city why is it that time and time again we see movements to infight rather than form a front against what is this corporate slavery i do not understand why human productivity skyrockets and yet we are stunted by greed what giant is behind the curtain utilizing us as cattle what happened to the days where people were not worked 24 hours a day without due compensation i constantly see so much infighting distract us from what really matters has nobody thought about the fact that all of the worlds major guidelines are utilized to keep the poor poor everyone thinks platforms such as robinhood are some form of an escape from the working class yet 99 of traders fail why is it that individuals en mass are throwing their life savings at ious on a coupon for a dog coin we are so desperate as a society to escape the chains that bind us that we forget most fail by design look at the statistics and the whole market shut down over gme you are a vehicle to be taxed by the government and you enter into a casino unknowingly to change your life while 999 fail thinking youll be the exception all of these structures are in place to separate the haves from the have nots and 999 percent of everyone reading this will be able to agree in some case do you not want freedom why has everything become so unattainable in real terms why is the success of one generation extracted from the next how is it that we statistically as the 99 become so abysmally poor look at the fed statistics and who owns 50 of all assets the 99 have plummeted and we are siphoned ever more through every catastrophe when will it end once everything is mostly automated and corporate welfare willingly comes to an end due to a mass influx of population what is left who will be standing atop the ivory tower looking down at the plebs begging for a little freedom and sustenance,o9yxsb

160,"There Is No Such Thing As ""Lazy""",i think its time for us as a society to get rid of the word lazy or any related vocabulary with the same concept   what makes you not do something the feeling of being blocked this can be for many reasons like lack of physical or emotional energy lack of enthusiasm motivation anxiety or fear mental illness physical incapabilities and others   the word lazy comes prepackaged with shame and shame hurts us psychologically causing us to blame ourselves for the lack of progression this word turns us away from the real answers of the source so lets call being lazy being blocked instead   for example you work 40 hours 5 days a week and cant keep up with house chores sure on the surface you have enough time to clean while not working but you dont because of feeling blocked  what is causing this feeling i dont personally believe anybody wants to live in a messy household so its most likely the absence of emotional or physical energy why are you feeling drained probably emotional and physical stress of working so why is it that we come home tired and not do the dishes you arent lazy for working and not being able to keep everything else up  the same goes for the rich they arent being lazy about helping society getting better or doing any internal work to change they just straight up dont do that because they dont want to they are sociopaths who actively avoid any betterment of society they are exploitative we need to start calling things as they really are    we all come prepackaged with different energy levels that change due to circumstance the work culture in this society wants us to internalize that we are either achievers or lazy nothing in between and that is simply not the truth we are organisms just trying to get by with what we can   id really like to hear everyone elses opinions on this and help me expand this thought more also if you think any other word is just false and just product of this exploitative society to shame us please comment,oacoz4

165,Steal Back Your Life,economy  the domination of survival over life  is essential for the maintenance of all other forms of domination without the threat of scarcity it would be difficult to coerce people into obedience to the daily routine of work and pay we were born into an economized world the social institution of property has made scarcity a daily threat property whether private or communal separates the individual from the world creating a situation in which rather than simply taking what one wants or needs one is supposed to ask permission a permission generally only granted in the form of economic exchange in this way different levels of poverty are guaranteed to everyone even the rich because under the rule of social property what one is not permitted to have far exceeds what one is permitted to have the domination of survival over life is maintained   those of us who desire to create our lives as our own recognize that this domination so essential to the maintenance of society is an enemy we must attack and destroy with this understanding theft and squatting can take on significance as part of an insurgent life project welfare scamming eating at charity feeds dumpster diving and begging may allow one to survive without a regular job but they do not in any way attack the economy they are within the economy theft and squatting are also often merely survival tactics squatters who demand the right to a home or try to legalize their squats thieves who work their jobs like any other worker only in order to accumulate more worthless commodities  these people have no interest in destroying the economythey merely want a fair share of its goods but those who squat and steal as part of an insurgent life do so in defiance of the logic of economic property refusing to accept the scarcity imposed by this logic or to bow to the demands of a world they did not create such insurgents take what they desire without asking anyones permission whenever the possibility arises in this defiance of societys economic rule one takes back the abundance of the world as ones own  and this is an act of insurrection in order to maintain social control the lives of individuals have to be stolen away in their place we received economic survival the tedious existence of work and pay we cannot buy our lives back nor can we beg them back our lives will only be our own when westealthem back  and that means taking what we want without asking permission   willful disobediencehttpstheanarchistlibraryorglibraryvariousauthorsessaysfromwillfuldisobediencevolume12toc23,oa5mf1
166,Technology and Class Struggle,the developments in technology over the past sixty years  the nuclear industry cybernetics and related information techniques biotechnology and genetic engineering  have produced fundamental changes in the social terrain the methods of exploitation and domination have changed and for this reason old ideas about the nature of class and class struggle are not adequate for understanding the present situation the workerism of the marxists and syndicalists can no longer even be imagined to offer anything useful in developing a revolutionary practise but simply rejecting the concept of class is not a useful response to this situation either because in so doing one loses an essential tool for understanding the present reality and how to attack it   exploitation not only continues but has intensified sharply in the wake of the new technology cybernetics has permitted the decentralization of production spreading small units of production across the social terrain automation has drastically reduced the number of production workers necessary for any particular manufacturing process cybernetics further creates methods for making money without producing anything real thus allowing capital to expand itself without the expense of labor   furthermore the new technology demands a specialized knowledge that is not available for most people this knowledge has come to be the real wealth of the ruling class in the present era under the old industrial system one could look at class struggle as the struggle between workers and owners over the means of production this no longer makes sense as the new technology advances the exploited find themselves driven into increasingly precarious positions the old lifelong skilled factory position has been replaced by day labor service sector jobs temporary work unemployment the black market illegality homelessness and prison this precariousness guarantees that the wall created by the new technology between the exploiters and the exploited remains unbreachable   but the nature of the technology itself places it beyond the reach of the exploited earlier industrial development had as its primary focus the invention of techniques for the mass manufacturing of standardized goods at low cost for high profit these new technological developments are not so much aimed at the manufacturing of goods as at the development of means for increasingly thorough and widespread social control and for freeing profit from production the nuclear industry requires not only specialized knowledge but also high levels of security that place its development squarely under the control of the state and lead to a military structuring in keeping with its extreme usefulness to the military cybernetic technologys ability to process record gather and send information nearly instantaneously serves the needs of the state to document and monitor its subjects as well as its need to reduce the real knowledge of those it rules to bits of informationdatahoping thus to reduce the real capabilities for understanding of the exploited biotechnology gives the state and capital control over the most fundamental processes of life itself  allowing them to decide what sort of plants animals and  in time  even human beings can exist   because these technologies require specialized knowledge and are developed for the purpose of increasing the control of the masters over the rest of humanity even in our daily lives the exploited class can now best be understood as those excluded from this specialized knowledge and thus from real participation in the functioning of power the master class is thus made up of those included in participation in the functioning of power and the real use of the specialized technological knowledge of course these are processes in course and the borderlines between the included and excluded can in some cases be elusive as increasing numbers of people are proletarianized  losing whatever decisionmaking power over their own conditions of existence they may have had   it is important to point out that although these new technologies are intended to give the masters control over the excluded and over the material wealth of the earth they are themselves beyond any human beings control their vastness and the specialization they require combine with the unpredictability of the materials they act upon atomic and subatomic particles light waves genes and chromosomes etc  to guarantee that no single human being can actually understand completely how they work this adds a technological aspect to the already existing economic precariousness that most of us suffer from however this threat of technological disaster beyond any ones control also serves power in controlling the exploited  the fear of more chernobyls genetically engineered monsters or escaped laboratory  made diseases and the like move people to accept the rule of socalled experts who have proven their own limits over and over again furthermore the state  that is responsible for every one of these technological developments through its military  is able to present itself as a check against rampant corporate abuse of this technology   so this monstrous lumbering uncontrollable juggernaut serves the exploiters very well in maintaining their control over the rest of the population and what need have they to worry about the possible disasters when their wealth and power has most certainly provided them with contingency plans for their own protection thus the new technology and the new conditions of exclusion and precariousness it imposes on the exploited undermine the old dream of expropriation of the means of production this technology  controlling and out of control  cannot serve any truly human purpose and has no place in the development of a world of individuals free to create their lives as they desire so the illusory utopias of the syndicalists and marxists are of no use to us now but were they ever the new technological developments specifically center around control but all industrial development has taken the necessity of controlling the exploited into account the factory was created in order to bring producers under one roof to better regulate their activities the production line mechanized this regulation every new technological advance in the workings of the factory brought the time and motions of the worker further under control thus the idea that workers could liberate themselves by taking over the means of production has always been a delusion it was an understandable delusion when technological processes had the manufacture of goods as their primary aim   now that their primary aim is so clearly social control the nature of our real struggle should be clear the destruction of all systems of control  thus of the state capital and their technological system the end of our proletarianized condition and the creation of ourselves as free individuals capable of determining how we will live ourselves against this technology our best weapon is that which the exploited have used since the beginning of the industrial era sabotage

231,"I might actually like ""work"" (at least in theory) but I definitely hate jobs",ive been struggling to reconcile the fact that i rail against workworship and that this is my fave reddit ever yet consider myself a hard worker and not entirely begrudgingly yes part of that comes from being conditioned to be a workaholic something im working hard to reverse but often i do genuinely like working  i tend to define work as anything that makes a change in your environment internal or external digging a hole is work as is reading a book since you know things you didnt know before reading itbeing paid or not doesnt factor into this definition many things you do for fun would count and thats the sense in which im happy to work hardif im enthused about something im willing to put a lot of effort and time into it  what many of us usually think of when we think of work youre paid for it it sucks etc i would define more strictly under the term job  id define a job as an arrangement between people around one doing work for another almost by definition jobs are paid most often with monetary currency  its possible to be in a job that involves work youd do for fun but its much more common that the arrangement involves work no one would ever do if they didnt need the payment to survive  jobs strike me as coercive by nature and enforced through survival anxiety and ultimately through shameexternal shame from bossescustomers internal shame inculcated in most of us long ago  i think the problem is that weve been taught to only value work done in the context of jobs    weve arbitrarily decided that work outside of a job arrangement is less worthy than work someone else is paying you for for no good reason we see gardening or writing a book on your own as less characterbuilding than stocking shelves for 10 hours straight just because the latter pays  of course by character i suspect most people mean being amenable to being bossed around shunning your other needs and otherwise being dependable to do a task despite any challenges or indignities im not into that type of character any more      anyway im still definitely down with the antiwork sentiment but i guess if i had to nitpick id define myself as more antijob,oabg0y

241,Ignorant Companies?,today my workplace officially rolled out their return to office plan starting next monday we are all expected to be back 3 days a week starting september 1 we are all expected back full time   there was no consultation with employees no department managers were consulted it came directly from the executive staff  this comes a year after the majority of staff have been working remotely and having no loss of productivity or profits from the companies side in fact our company just purchased a new company to expand their services no doubt due to the huge boom in construction and development projects we have been working on for the past year   yet the optics of having employees back and the large empty offices spaces are forcing us to return regardless of the fact that everyone excelled for the past year  what gives  when does stuff like this end  most of my friends at other companies were presented with an option for having a very flexible in office schedule we are given the option of maybe having 1 day work from home   i had to go back to the office today due to an unfathomable heat wave and its such a depressing bland sterile environment  at least i can job search in the air conditioning,o9r2jc

341,Can I just rant about feeling exploited for a sec?,im a job hopper i cant help it i used to think it happened because of my adhd tendencies but this week i realised its because i absolutely hate working i hate the feeling of my energy and time being exploited for someone else to get rich i hate the fact that i feel that most of the worlds problems could be solved by doing away with our dehumanising capitalistic system  im in consumer charity fundraising for christ sake a job which i think is very noble as we really make a difference for a few amazing charities among which plan international check them out as they do amazing work but still i feel that in my ideal world we wouldnt need charities because in my ideal world the world would be a more fair and more human place  i hop jobs i like meeting new people and learning stuff then when the dust has settled its work again and then i go back to the aforementioned stuff im contributing to a system that so goes against all of my values that i get down and a bit resentful in every job no matter how great the job is  this is mostly just a rant but if anyone has any tips on how to reconcile the inescapable fact that i have to participate in this system in order to have food and shelter  please do share  sincerely a 25yearold thats having a hard time accepting the reality of life without suppressing his inner moral compass,o984jo

370,Working in Jobs that Managers don't understand,i have seen this so many times my experience is mostly with technical and software jobs it is very rare for a managers to understand what you are even doing most times your direct supervisor is from your field so he or she will know what goes into these projects but if you go up the ladder people literally have no clue what you are actually working on and how much work it is  so usually at some point they dont understand your work but are the ones in the position of deciding how good you are doing if you are really lucky your direct supervisor likes you and tries to get you a salary increase if you are doing well i have gotten most of my raises by switching jobs or telling them if i get more responsibility i will only do it for more money  on the other hand if they dont understand you also can tell them some crap sometimes to get more time for tasks if you need work to be slowed down but in general it is really annoying they expect things to be done immediately that take weeks and even when you explain it to them or they force you to cut corners which will make tasks take longer later on and then complain why these things take so long it is just utter garbage,o9ftwk

399,Jobs and recruiters need to just post the damn hourly rate or salary in the job description and stop wasting everyone’s time,my wife is a paralegal and recently updated her indeed information a recruiter for a temp agency reached out to her a few days ago to fill a legal support position for amazon she looked up similar positions on glass door and didnt find exactly what the recruiter talked about but from what she saw she was guessing she could potentially make about 10 more an hour this was after spending a few hours researching debating and us talking about how it might be worth the commute an extra hour a day total travel time  she emailed back saying she was interested in talking about the position and received a phone interview invitation this morning we recently had a baby and my wife is on maternity leave so she has the time available to do the interview during the day and on short notice however i knew she needed me to watch our daughter so i left work early so she could focus on the interview during the phone interview im taking care of our daughter and im overhearing bits and pieces of the conversation it sounds like the normal fake dribble you hear from recruiters and then the awkward moment of wage negotiations i hear something about what kind of compensation my wife would want she initially asks what is the rate theyre hiring for after a nonsensical response from the recruiter my wife says shes looking for 15 more per hour in preparation to negotiate to the 10 or more mark considering this is on track with what she researched i didnt hear it at the time but this lady comes back with saying that the most they could do was basically give my wife 2 more an hour   obviously my wife said thanks but no thanks its just so irritating that this was time energy and my work hours wasted on this bullshit just post the fucking rate so we can say no right away and move on with our lives instead of wasting two days for a shitty offer the way we believe is that we are just as good as the employer offering a job the employer needs a job done we both are good at what we do so we dont settle for pennies a job is just a transaction just like buying food from a restaurant no i dont want to go to a restaurant to look at a menu with no prices and order something only to be charged 3 times what its worth the same with a job i dont want to waste my time doing some interview trying to explain that im a valuable asset that can generate profits to only be offered what an entry level person should be making fuck your culture fuck your growth fuck your family inclusiveness fuck your yearly paid lunch just pay us a wage that reflects how essential we are to the profits made and leave us to do the job as outlined in the job description with no expectation for more we dont own the company we dont get paid to run the company so dont expect us to act like an owner   im not an english major so i apologize for spellinggrammar mistakes,o811ye

402,Working in sales has been... an experience,its almost unbelievable i took the job becausei needed one and the pay was good im decent at it but i lack the drive to really push forward in this branch  why because management expects you to be a slimy asshat peoples boundaries wishes and opinions mean jack if they arent a customer we are only here to make money thats pretty clear we openly discuss how to get customers into situations where we make decisions for them use their previous words against them its basically just plannedout peer pressure our training manual literally stated that part of a wellexecuted sale is creating a problem for the customer  i just wish my coworkers could at least be honest about it my manager presented a strategy to me which i politely asked if he didnt think was a bit rude to a potential customer and he simply diverted it into us employees being caring and doing good work for offering our companys services at all  hes a smart guy so i almost cant believe he has deluded himself into actually thinking this way but if it is the case i can kind of see how the whole business is built around making the individual employee push for the next sale or the next 5 or 10 or 100 etc its possible hes just trying to keep selling me the job but i would its even more likely someone sold his job to him and sold it good  corporate needs us to care about the process of accumulating wealth at the top and they achieve it with commisions and trinkets i can see how it works giving small pointless rewards to break up the monotony of a job that helps nobody and does nothing besides encourage transferring of money i definitely feel better going to work every day if the previous day went well so i can see how people get stuck chasing the next high but the job itself is just so repulsive that i definitely wont stick around  ill admit that it has been interesting to see how many blatantly slimy strategies actually work and are even commended in the business world from an inside perspective and i will also admit that being a successful salesman requires skill the skill of having no shame and no respect for the people you meet even so every day you dont get a sale regardless of skill is just a day of free advertising for the company  you can bet my resignation is on the table the day after my next paycheck arrives,o7zs99

442,The 3 things that happened before I lost my job.,so before the pandemic i worked as a graphic design lecturer at a private college i had been doing this for quite a few years and i was pretty good at my job i was more than qualified i had a high pass rate for my students got along well with my fellow lecturers etc i absolutely lived lecturing thinking it was the best path the improving graphic design in my country as i would be working with young people just getting into the industry now the 3 things that happened the week before i lost my job  first my one work colleague quit and left to move to the uk she was an older woman who kinda looked out for me and kinda made me feel safe their  second i told the manager and the principal 2 different people that i had been living with depression most of my life and just need help to keep my footing l this was right after my colleague left i didnt ask for time off i asked to go see the company psychiatrist who was actually a church leader working from a nearby mega church  last i had to write a program evaluation where i had to go in depth with the courses we offer specifically the ones i give so when i wrote that we should not be teaching adobe animate in 2020 as it is really outdated we claimed it was industry standard and used all over the countryworld for those who dont know adobe animate was literally just adobe flash renamed  education especially private education is so money hungry and driven that we as lecturers were encouraged to lie to students about the industry and about what they needed to even get in like the adobe international certifications are mandatory to get work which we coincidentally also offered one of the grossest things i ever heard and often was first most we are a business i never want to hear that especially not when education is involved   that week i got my walking papers i have not been able to find stable work in my field as graphic designer or lecturer since its been 15 years now pretty much and thank goodness that i have a caring wife who studied while i worked and is now pretty much supporting me while i do what i can  just wanted to share,o7ijq4

452,Feeling Depressed and working two understaffed jobs...help??,so since the covid pandemic my main job has had a hard time hiring employees we hire people then they quit after one week or dont show up for the interview etc the consensus is that some people are doing that to a lot of places to stay on covid relief unemployment payments dont know how true that is but   ampx200b  before this started happening i was only working the office job three days a week and did some house cleaning on the other days i took on the cleaning as a second job around christmas to make extra money and lo and behold the cleaning company started having problems hiring and keeping employees too   ampx200b  i have been the one who is called upon to fill in and cover for the past year after people quit because im the only one who has stayed thus far i have had to give up days off and cancel doctor appointments and other things so i could come to work on days i expected to have off at a moments notice i couldnt help but feel a little upset but i trudged through thinking it would just be temporary my boss will hire someone soon well it has been a year and the situation has only gotten worse we literally cant hire anybody anymore it seems and i am bearing the blunt so my employers are not left high and dry   ampx200b  i am working upwards to 62 hours per week trying to balance working 56 days a week at my main job and cleaning at night at my other job i dont get home until almost midnight wednesday and saturday night i pack my cleaning clothes in my work bag so i can change into them and immediately go to that job after i get off my main job   ampx200b  this was never my plan but i feel sorry for both of my bosses who keep losing people and cant seem to hire anyone who will stay i would feel horrible if i left with without one more worker it would be cruel almost my friends keep telling me to quit but i dont think i could do that to them without feeling like a horrible person   ampx200b  i can count more than the digits on both hands the amount of people they have hired and then left high and dry with me to pick up the slack i actually trained someone last month for a week and then they quit a few days later i am not looking forward to having to go through the training process again with someone new who is just going to quit a week later its getting ridiculous and i have had enough  ampx200b  the truth is im depressed i feel stuck i dont like working the hours i am working i feel like i have no worklife balance anymore i have anxiety and high functioning autism and just feel so burnt out and exhausted the cleaning job is physically exhaustive and i dread having to do it after i get off from my main job i recently lost one of my cats and i have not even had time to grieve him because i am constantly working and on the go i have started to eat convenience junk and fast food because i never feel well enough or have time to cook a healthy meal or go grocery shopping and have started gaining weight again i cry sometimes at night in bed because i look at the clock and know i have to get up at 7am and do it all over again   i cry when i think of how this is life and there is no getting out of it until im dead,o7pv06
453,Wacky theory about slow programs when working from home,i was allowed to start working from home at my new job and have been really happy about it but frustrated at how slow citrix is im not sure what it is since my internet is good and it seems like the speed of the program depends on the day but most of the time its unbearably slow my company allowed people to start working from home full time after the pandemic but im shocked at how slow and inefficient their setup has been for it and i doubt theyre going to improve it maybe they just need to make it better or maybe they do this on purpose because they want us to get sick of working on slow systems and force us back into the office lol thats what im starting to think it sucks,o7s0k9

461,Employers are Ones who Want Something for Nothing,my dad always told me that the key to being successful is acquiring skills that make you valuable to your employer well im here to tell you that is all a bunch of horse shit i am 36 years old have been working since i was 15 and almost everyone of one of my employers have never compensated me for learning new skills outside of my work area what they did was see that i could competently accomplish the new task and i was given more work to do ironically the only place i worked for that had a written policy on pay increase was a mcalisters deli that would give you a 025 per station  i have been working at a automotive conveyor plant for the last 7 years i was hired on as a temp worker in the shipping department with no experience and was just packaging parts within a 4 months i was hired on and became the defacto manager because the other two people in the office quit i was loading heavy machinery organizing truck loads ordering trucks writing up international shipping paperwork and much more after a year i told my foreman that i needed to be the official shipping manager since i was doing all of the work by myself and was only being paid 14hr he agreed and we had a meeting with upper management and they told me that there wasnt money in the budget and they were eliminating that position and my foreman would be absorbing that responsibility so they fucked me and my foreman  i was pissed and quit i was professional and gave a 2 weeks notice and trained my replacement i got a sales job turns out i am not a salesman i talked to my old foreman and he got back on as a temp worker in the mechanical assembly department making 14hr guess what i kicked ass in this department too i learned mechanical print reading mechanical assembly mig welding basic metal fitting and pretty much how to make sure that the conveyor system works before it leaves the shop and how was i rewarded by keeping me a temp worker for 3 fucking years keeping me at 14hr  i demanded that i get hired on permanent and a pay increase to 1650hr i live in mississippi asking for anything more than that would be like asking the plant superintendent if you could raw dog his daughter my foreman goes to bat for me and makes it happen but now that i had the audacity to demanded fair compensation they think they own me they would constantly tell me to go the weld department and help prep steel for fit up and weld out guess what happens next i learn welding fitting im building jigs and doing full fit work  i ask for more money and was flat out refused they told me that the 030 cost of living raise we get every year is all that they could give thats an extra 48 a month for perspective this is a mutlinational company they have plants on almost every continent they just bought a steel mill company and built a new facility to combine that new one and their old one   now i was just going to stick out as i was in the middle of school trying to finish up my bachelors degree then mississippi revoked my wifes disability a whooping 700month apparently having a brain tumor 12 the size of a golf ball removed and having your brain chemistry  irrevocably alter only takes a year to get over we were barely making it with what i was making 1740hr and her disability so i said fuck it and joined the millwright union better bargaining power representation and benefits sucks that i had to stop school again  companies dont give a shit about you you are nothing but numbers in a column to them waiting to get crossed out they will milk every once of productivity out of you and say that you should be grateful for the little bread crumbs that they give you they should be grateful for you with out workers they have no product they cant do all the work by themselves you are selling 40 hours of your life to them make sure you are getting what you feel you are worth,o8aakk

that the labor itself is varied and the pressure of a production plant is nearly nonexistent but i am also temporary employed and working in a 2shiftsystem which is kinda like going to the end of the rainbow and finding a pot of poop ive been lurking in this sub for quite a while and i look over the big pond from time to time which means ive been able to think about some things  ive always enjoyed good quotes and actually like to come up with admittedly tacky ones myself heres what i cooked up during a slow afternoon shift  it were always those who dared those who were driven by the past to look into the future yet chained down by the present and whenever they managed to break free they were always gracious enough to drag us with them despite our constant kicking and screaming  first of all we are not productive for 8 hours straight we are actually just about 3 hourshttpswwwinccommelaniecurtininan8hourdaytheaverageworkerisproductiveforthismanyhourshtml a day productive mentioning a fiveday work week with only 3 working hours a day in this sub is like bringing owls to athens but something is off the weekend wasnt invented by henry ford to recuperate but to consumehttpswwwbbccoukbitesizearticleszf22kmn so would there be a need for a weekend if we would only work as long as our biology allows probably not imagine a world where theres no need for a weekend to numb ourselves with various substances and social media you could wake up and whenever you feel like it  due to home office be productive for three hours a day seven days a week the rest of the day is completely yours because typical office work is now efficient and meaningful thanks to the elimination of bullshit jobshttpswwwstrikecoopbullshitjobs  but what about all the other workers those who need to be onsite we could actually see a massive increase in those fields the administrative sector has absolutely blown up during the past decades but the people who produce fix and care have been squeezed quite literally direct care workershttpseufreepcomstorynewshealth20210504caregivershortage4891001001 have an incredibly demanding work day yet they are deemed lowskilled and the need to love care work was deemed as a substitute to a living wage blue collar workershttpswwwcouncilofindustryorgthebluecollardrought are a huge part of the workforce that keeps countries up and running yet parents will keep telling their children that only a college degree will lead to a better life  i have no doubt that there are young people out there that want to care for others or love to get their hands greasy or wooddusted but they either fear downright miserable pay and working conditions or their parents instill this particular you need a degree mindset into them does that mean that office jobs are going to disappear no they wont and yes blue collar and care taker jobs can and will be backbreaking but if there are more people doing these jobs motivated by encouraging peers and better pay they might relieve each others you know sharing the burden and such things  theres automation this particular economistpaperbuzzword is actually far more complicated than the usual jobs gonepeddling while some articles are delivering grim outlookshttpsengageemployeecomrobotstoreplaceupto20millionfactory others paint a more facetted picturehttpswwwindustryweekcomtalentarticle22025840automationeliminatesjobsnotworknewreport there may be many unknowns regarding this particular aspect of the future but its going to be a challenge for sure the book the last firewall by william hertling is a good read and delivers an interesting take every job there ever was is now automated humanity has now more free time than ever on their hands but chooses to revolt because they are missing the jobs now you may think of the classical baby boomer who build hisher whole identity around the workplace and has no real life you might actually be righthttpswwwthebalancecareerscombabyboomers2164681 so how do we handle automation the right way  simple let growing pains happen we cant make everybody immediately happy but theres maybe something that could offer some help the ubihttpswwwbloombergcomopinionarticles20201003wouldauniversalbasicincomemakeuslazyorcreativegermanystudyexplores universal basic income has become quite the wedge issue im surprised that tucker carlson and his gang of misfits otherwise known as the foul amp the furious arent constantly screaming it along the lines of socialism amongst economists we can expect meaningful data in a few years when the german test run is finished and salvaged but the smaller finnish experiment showed unemployed people receiving a modest amount of money 654 instead of the wellknown unemployment benefits were not only healthier but also more likely to find a job a small calculation if all uscitizen above the age of 18 would receive a monthly check of 600 as a means of pressure relief it would cost the us government just about 15 trillion dollar annually while many wouldnt even notice the extra monthly 600 in their bank account others would be impacted massively by this the working poorhttpswwwcnbccom20200919coronavirushowthepandemicimpactsamericasworkingpoorhtml and the pandemic has only poured oil into the fire  yes unionization and thus wages being raised is going to be faster to come by than an ubi but i strongly hold the belief that with automation cutting millions of jobs people need a safety net to be able to find a new path because if a massive amount of people gets unemployed yet has absolutely zero backup is going to send said people into quite the frenzy  so whats the conclusion of this massive chunk of text quite simple keep organizing keep discussing salaries and quitting jobs that are detrimental to your health be it physical or mental but most importantly keep dreaming the best ideas ive ever had came up during monotone everyday tasks when i spent the time daydreaming dare to askwhat if dare to withstand the bullshit of baby boomers it may feel like small steps but they might be considered gigantic hundred years down the road

480,"I am burned tf out, AMA.",this is pretty much just a rant so whatever i guess fuck everyone im here to talk about and fuck me for having to work with them   i am an electrical and data communications expert and i fully mean expert no arrogance no hesitation i am a motherfucking expert in the conveyance and configuration of electricity and data   which is i promise you not even a very high bar to achieve 99 of everyone i have ever worked around are blithering incompetents   ive seen electricians who couldnt make a data connection to save their lives and data men who wouldnt know the difference between phases if they fucking touched them together even in their designated craft most cant even function enough between their drug of choice to be half competent some of the time the individuals i have met in the large scale commercial and industrial jobs which i have been a part who know even 5 of whats going on can be counted on one hand without a doubt working with these people is the single worst part of doing what i do  than there is the utter meaninglessness of the jobs of which i partake  i exclusively work in commercialindustrial settings huge megacorporations just hurl money at any random company they can find to do the most banal shit i would say that money laundering would have to be the only explanation except that i get paid so much myself to do their bs  the two most common things i see in the data world that take up 95 of these jobs are  1going into a building with existing wiring and replacing the wiring with the exact same fucking wiring  2going into a building with a network of wireless access points and replacing them with different notanybetter wireless access points  utterly pointless wastes of time and money if i had a quarter for every building ive gone to with preexisting cat5e just to replace them with new cat5e and nothing else id probably be a fucking millionaire you want to replace this perfectly functional wireless access point with a different and in no way better one sure whatever where do you want your old ones left up in the fucking ceiling to rot because you dont give a shit since you have enough money to not care the usual then  at least with electricity i have a pretty good amount of power lol to tell someone to get fucked if they want to do stupid bs which is funny because its like the opposite of the data world and i never need to  for some reason that i dont understand there is this dichotomy in the business world that data services are the mystical gift of the gods that just makes everything magically better and theyve got to have it right now no matter the cost meanwhile warehouses full of product are lit with obsolete t12 fluorescent lighting with magnetic ballasts so fucking old and heavy that im afraid colonel mustard is going to use it to murder someone in the observatory   these same companies that shell out so much money for data product that they literally barely even use wont even spare anything other than a sideways glance when you tell them the 480v 2000amp federal pacific panel running all their machinery and heavy duty equipment is probably going to burn their entire operations down one day  and then there are the employers  i dont think i need to explain how employers are fucking garbage in this subreddit  most of what i have done is essentially gig work  what i mean by this is that while i have only ever worked jobs which file me as a w2 employee the turnover is so pathetically high that its really and truly gig work  heres where my problem is ive never been one to put up with bs at the best of times but lately ive been extra hardcore about not being a fucking slave because you know thats what burning out does to you  im registered with a lot of agencies where the only thing i ever hear from them is hey man we got this job over in  and they need you there tommorrow except  is two states away and they want you to stay in a hotel room with 3 other dudes and no per diem and the job is night work so that the business can still run like normal during the day time  get fucked assholes im not some thirsty fucking money virgin looking to ride your dick for a booty call i live in a house with my wife and sleep in my own fucking bed at night ive told them to not even bother contacting me if its not in my city and even then its the same shit they act like the stars and planets have to fucking align just to find work in my large metropolitan city   and they still call me all the time for the jobs ive told them to get fucked for because they somehow dont have anyone else who can do it  im working a job right now that is guess what replacing a bunch of existing shit with the exact same shit i get there and the jackoffs in charge are so ignorant and disorganized that they would rather have me making 30 an hour to be there stand around while they figure out how to make a coax connection  everyone thinks all they have to do is yell money money money and youll jump all over them and than act surprised when they find someone who they cant buy away life happiness from  now for the most controversial part of this rant unions  oh man let me tell you about the unions   long long ago in a galaxy far far awayi put in an application with the ibew for an electrical apprenticeship back when i didnt know shit   i didnt even hear back from them for literal years i went out and just made a career in the time it took for them to even acknowledge my existence they called me for an interview just like a week ago   at this point i would literally be taking a huge paycut to even bother doing it but i went to the interview nonetheless  what a waste of time  the interview was like 5 questions long had absolutely nothing to do with technical skill and was obviously geared towards identifying know nothing greenhorns to wrangle in questions like name a time where you had a problem you couldnt solve and why couldnt you solve it  i worked in my obvious experiences and knowledge into everything they asked me and these two old elitist jack offs straight up said to me in the middle of me talking that your answer doesnt have to pertain to the electrical trade  fuck you doesnt have to pertain to the electrical trade i wasnt aware that this was an interview for fucking walmart id rather make no money than work for a bunch of assholes who would rather hire a know nothing nobody over someone   i cant speak for every union but the ibew in my experience has been known to be uhhh pretty fucking corrupt i cant say that my experiences around them have ever been very pleasant that their people are particularly sociable or that they dont look like a bunch of pyramid scheme scam artists   maybe if they werent also a completely closed club of pick and choose racist yokels with zero pretension towards affordable work towards the common person i would view them more charitably  alas  thats the other emotionally draining part of what i do btw everyone bites like pirahna for big business hurling money at them but if youre just some person in a house trying to get your electricity working or data runs  haha nobody gives a shit about you theres three facts of life death taxes and that no tradesman within a hundred mile radius of where you live gives a flying fuck about you   ghosts are real they just drive work vans and dont answer calls instead of haunting houses  im so fucking tired of it all i mostly quit working altogether last year around novemeber and have just stayed at a home as a house husband ive been growing a garden i made my cats a bunch of bomb ass cat trees its been so peaceful and fulfilling weve talked about it and my wifes been very supportive of me well above and beyond what i would have ever allowed for myself otherwise  but i obviously cant just live without making money ive got it better than many for sure but im bot exemot from having to make money so every so often i trudge out to deal with the same bs for gigantic companies who think im just some money receptacle to do whatever they want whenever they want it  its all bs everything and everyone and im so tired of it,o7zr65

public in the first world at the same time and this sub is the only place on the internet where i dont think the post will get 100 kneejerk hate reactions though i expect a lot of hate from bootlicker types read at your own risk   to my temporary im leaving soon neighbors in the first world never forget you are choosing to live like scum who support thousands of injustices with your daily actions and selfcentered attitudes toward everything you allow yourselves to be ruled by war criminals both sides are the same corrupt bs year in and year out while willfully turning a blind eye to the normalized genocide forced poverty and segregation your leaders perpetuate in all areas of the world the only issues you pay attention to in current events and history are those that directly affect your selfinterest or feed your biases you also create an overinflated ego and sense of selfimportance from your meaningless corporate jobs most of which dont make the world a better place and actively make it worse by hurting the environment and making corrupt dark triad people even more prosperous you are a useful pawn for these people and that is all they will ever see you as imagine thinking youre some big shot credible person with authority for being just another obedient cog in a system of torture and death many of you almost subconsciously look down on the working class illegal and low wage workers in your countries even though theyre literally the backbones of your infrastructure and the main force that allows you to go to that cushy office job every day and buy lunch with no worries of anything falling apart   then in your free time instead of studying things like sociology  spirituality and trying to progress the world toward one of love and equality you get on the internet to bully strangers over trivial nonsense  looks age income intellect disabilities mental health status popularity lifestyle size level of success choosing to stay single or a loner how social they are how many people they slept with or didnt sleep with which religion  spiritual beliefs they have or lack thereof and any personality traits  viewpoints that youve been trained by toxic parents  society to hate and dont conform ad nauseam to your narrow comfort zone and worldview you spend every waking hour online and irl being as callous unempathetic and dismissive toward people and their experiences  feelings as humanly possible ive seen so many instances of people who are genuinely struggling sharing their experiences online only to be blamed for all their traumas by a bunch of privileged overgrown babies who are obviously out of touch with global reality and never faced any real adversity compared to others in those shithole countries they never think about or even compared to people in those rough neighborhoods of their own country that they only bring up when the poor people commit more crime narrative is mentioned never any mention of what causes the poverty though just the blame  shame game left and right and we all know how common fake friendships are in firstworld countries with so many people out there who want to know your deepest darkest secrets just to use them against you or to take advantage vultures ive talked to several people who are either from nonfirst world countries or lived in them extensively they all say that friendships are not like this in other parts of the world its a problem of the west or at least more pronounced here people make frenemies instead of friends regardless of gender and its nearly universal i think the reason for the toxic nature of relationships here is that almost every damn pursuit in western culture devolves to a game of oneupsmanship and getting a leg up on somebody ah theres that good old capitalismfueled competition rearing its head again patriarchy is another cultural disease that adds to the prevalence of hypercompetition as well  victim blaming prejudiced criticisms under the guise of tough love  advice and casual gaslighting of all kinds in all situations seems to be something people in your cultures do for amusement online never thinking about the psychological harm that may have been done to the other person it just shows how fragile your egos are and how they need to be preserved 247 against the slightest deviation all of this insecurity despite the fact that you people go on and on about how you live in the best countries in the world if something doesnt align with your narrow scope of vision you will refuse to consider or even hear a single word that the other person is saying and abuse them for expressing themselves in a way that you dont approve all so you can pretend that the world is aokay that youre not complicit in thousands of injustices that occur everyday and that anyone who gets mistreated abused or even killed brought it on themselves and deserved it its like you deliberately turn off any semblance of humanity and empathy that neoliberal capitalist culture hasnt already sucked out of you   i guess i understand thinking this way makes it convenient to stay working mindlessly like an ant and only caring about your own lot in life never truly questioning why it has to be this way but really why we could literally have a global revolution tomorrow if people really wanted to unite because youre afraid to lose your job you have kids to feed thats part of the problem knowing everything going on in this world and continuing to bring children into inevitable suffering just because everyone else is popping out babies and you dont want to be an outcast or a selfish desire for legacy or maybe you accept the status quo unconditionally because your parents told you its just the way it is when you were children bullshit thats the first time they tried to kill the passion out of you and you let them chances are that most of our parents  adults told their kids deflating things like this to perpetuate the justworld fallacy for themselves and avoid guilt about their own lack of action in making the world a better place then they bring more children into the world and indoctrinate them with the same sick values and the generational cycle of mass suffering continues beautiful isnt it but i know most people will probably say i should go to a shrink for this rant and that im the crazy one for not seeing the value in humanity when this is how we choose yes its a choice not human nature to live  there really isnt much of a difference between the mentality of todays neoliberal consumerist zombies and people like hitlers supporters you neoliberals are just very slick with the way you do things but its all done under the same wicked intentions of oppression and dominance for the sake of dominance we literally have more than enough resources globally to give every human being a house keep them decently fed etc but no the majority of you narcissistic chimpanzees keep insisting competition  hyperindividualism is good survival of the fittest cooperation  collectivism and being kind is for the weak same idiots that go around saying things like respect must be earned not given and telling it like it is to justify their prejudices and discriminatory actions  no asshole im the one telling it like it is and i know you dont like the actual truth because it puts you and your peers everyday shortcomings on a big projector for you all to see   and before anyone complains yes i understand there are hundreds of millions of people in the first world and some very few lets be honest dont go along with the status quo and try to be part of the change they envision for the world this is a rant directed at the middle  bourgeois class majority honestly socalled democracy has proven to be the biggest tyranny of all in other systems there was always a distinct group challenging the authorities at play and they werent completely wiped into silence if they were wiped via violence it was later understood as a cruel act that shouldnt be mimicked but because the word democracy is falsely used to describe this inhumane system and sounds good on paper the masses shut down people who rightfully question how free this illusion truly is and think theyre the real fascists since they dont use violence and just shut these people out of the discussion via cultural power those people have no viable way to make their point without looking like the bad guys and while i dont believe we live in a meritocracy the fact that most people believe we do and their justifications for mistreating the lower end people show me that the concept as a whole is inherently bad for humanity due to the callous mentality it perpetuates we are all slaves to the judgments of the majority no matter how delusional they become   at least with one central leadership figure you have a chance of bringing in someone with a good head on their shoulders and high level of compassion your odds of finding one admirable person to lead are much higher than getting the majority to love and respect one another regardless of differences the majority will always keep an ignorant and inhumane mentality toward anyone not exactly like them and therefore will maintain a cold despicable value system in society  as a result they fall for the lies and deceitful charisma of sadistic narcissists and propel them into positions of power  influence time and time again good purehearted people who mind their business and try not to judge others over personal characteristics are treated like the exact opposite they dont participate in what most call banter so theyre viewed by the majority as lame  soft or too boring  sensitive as a result good people are usually targets of unprovoked bullying abuse and  or isolation why because socalled civilized modern people have become so dumb and backward that intending to be a good person from the beginning without having ulterior motives is viewed as weakness this world wants you to be manipulating and transactional in everything you do and everyone you deal with when people who refuse to play the game are permanently othered and inevitably deemed losers and outcasts the society then acts like it was their fault and they must be truly lacking something inside them to not be able to integrate no these less than 5 of people just couldnt allow themselves to be everyday sadistic sociopaths like the majority   its funny how trump called africa a shithole when from a character standpoint even with their own flaws people there have more redeeming qualities in one finger than your average westerner has in their entire bloodline especially westerners that make close to six figures or more less wealthy people in this country at least try to help each other in limited ways sometimes and tend to have a lot more principles that they live by for better or worse there are many flawed principles but i can respect any principled person far more than the rich and middle class who push this sell your soul and existence to the highest bidder bootlicker mentality on everyone if you refuse to be a part of bourgeois culture and play the game you will be concern trolled and gaslighted by these people theyll say grow up or youll never become successful thinking this way to these people growing up means relentlessly chasing arbitrary standards of prosperity and becoming a compliant worker bee who never questions any of societys authorities well i say fuck you and fuck your mediacrafted definitions of success happiness and prosperity all three are treated like a zerosum game where crabs in a bucket must prevent the others from getting enough for themselves people want to avoid concepts like misanthropy and antinatalism because theyre deemed as negative and divisive all the while deliberately ignoring the fact that even socalled positive concepts have been bastardized by the puppetmasters of this world to keep the masses controlling hostile and hypercompetitive toward one another humans want to continue living in strife despite the fact that true scarcity meaning lack of enough physical resources to support everyone does not exist and will only decrease as technology finds new ways to support sustainability and preserve life at least misanthropy and antinatalism stemmed from concern for the greater environment and a desire to improve life for the people already here people who buy into the cult of individualistic positivity seem to be primarily concerned with selfpromotion and getting recognition above all else even better if its at someones expense and they can feel like they knocked someone down a peg while pulling themselves up the crazy part is that mentalities like this are promoted by society as selflove and confidence cultures of cutthroat scarcity are promoted as inevitable reality while cultures of abundance and compassion are quickly dismissed as childish navet it is all cultural not based on the physical reality that is abundance   at this point im allergic to anyone this heinous society considers successful and want to keep at least three football fields of distance between me and those types of people write me off as a deluded loser if you like i stopped caring about petty bs like that a long time ago i only care about one thing now and thats knowing the true reality things probably wont change but i need to keep my eye out so i can at least avoid the madness myself im a second generation immigrant native born in the usa and im deliberately moving to a remote third world country to live on less money and less stress and to get away from this toxic inhumane social darwinist culture no matter how many peoples lives are ruined by this system the general public continues to go along with its twisted machiavellian values and sweep problems  victims under the rug all to pretend everything is positive and i am in control of everything that happens in my life material difficulties aside at least people elsewhere have a somewhat closer relationship with reality they have to for survival and treat each other more like human beings ill gladly deal with increased material inconveniences over this spiritually bankrupt cultural wasteland we call the west in the first world when people look at you you are a walking currency amount not a breathing human never forget that,o7aj4p
519,Society has always been a hunger games bloodbath,the rich have always exploited the poor in the name of greed slavery has always existed if you live in a first world country today its as good as its going to get   only difference is now the slaves in a capitalist system have access to comforts that have never been available before in history and opportunity to better themselves and improve their situation   is the system fair no but when has it ever been lets be real people are selfish and act in their own interests not all but enough to ruin it for everyone   no one is going to hire you unless they can make profit off you thats why people start businesses to elevate themselves   someone has an idea and starts a business and if there is a demand then they hire people and pay them the least amount possible in order to make maximum profit   whether that business owner had rich parents and could have afforded to fail 10 times doesnt matter life is not fair and never has been we have always lived in a hunger games society this is the most sanitized version of it ever especially if you live in a first world country   what can we do try to escape by moving up the platform we live in a country that gives us opportunity to do that in so many ways   learning a skill or craft or pursuing higher education or starting a business or applying for promotions in the workplace   is everyone going to succeed no life is not fair even under communism everyone is not equal the ones at the top will have everything and everyone below nothing and there is nothing they can do to improve their lot    its just reality we are in a fucked up hell hole brethren best thing u can do is not bring children into this world work brainstorm and try to better yourself and maybe it will pay off and you will be elevated on the platform or maybe downsize work part time and be content to eat rations i dunno the answers god help us all,o6sbz1

526,Recommended readings?,hi everyone   my work has accidentally hired too many new staff and have reduced the hours of everybody working from home which was mandated by the government    so instead of stressing about money i am looking for any recommendations on readings about antiwork topics i have read most of the stuff in this subs library   i agree with what i have read on the antiwork however i find some of it just highlights the issue and provides an ideal outcome but never answers the question how do we get there what policy or solutions are being discussed  so if you have an readings please share,o6mz7c

531,"Quit a job I hated, started a new job &amp; having worse burn out than before",i posted on here a lot a few months back when i was making my exit at my first job post grad school the team i worked with was great and i got to do all of my work remote then expectations from the state im in social services began to put unrealistic metrics on myself and my team of 2  shit hit the fan after terrible management communication and a total of 56 myself included quit  i found a new job at a very similar organization just doing different work the pay was the same amp although i do enjoy what i do more now the stress is killing me the same unrealistic expectations are put on and after a lot of budget cuts my team is down to 3 of us carrying a pretty big load  i fooled myself when i thought starting a new job would somehow change the fact that i work 40 hours a week making 2021 an hour i had suspicions before but now confirmed my beliefs that getting my masters in social work was a terrible decision   the jobs id like to have behind the scenes not dealing with client load just doing data quality assurance type work require years of client facing work   ive only been working full time since last augustnot even a full year and i feel so anxious depressed and generally unwell maybe its time to see a therapist but the reality is that this is my life for the next 4050 years or maybe its time to seriously consider a different line of work even if it doesnt utilize my fancy worthless degree  no amount of therapy or medication will spawn a job that doesnt make me feel anxious to wake up every morning to be overworked and under paid  sorry for the doom and gloom just had to get this out there to someone hope everyones day went well and are excited for the weekend,o7dxhg

563,"References are often required on an application/resume, but are they ever ACTUALLY used?",alright maybe required is a bit strong more like points deducted if you dont comply  its probably just another buzzword for the computers  but seriously ive been suffering through the hell that is applying for jobs for pretty much all of my adult life and i dont know if anyone has ever contacted my references i never had a person who interviewed me mention that they had or would contact my references theres never been a your former boss spoke very highly of you or your coworker seemed to like working with you if references really dont matter then its unfair to judge a potential employee on whether or not they can scrape them up not everyone gets hired by jobs with competent managers or coworkers who would be willing to vouch for you if you leaveget let go from their job i guess theres no harm in lying and giving them your friends info but what if you dont have those either its just another pointless hoop for people to jump through   honestly i would love if my references were used because i have a hard time advocating for myself especially in interviews ive just come to terms with the fact that i have social anxiety and adhd which makes hard for me to be relaxed and confident during interviews itd be great to know that theyd have another source helping them decide if i was worth hiring,o7320m

566,Dear First Worlders...,warning i am a misanthrope who believes humanity doesnt have to be this way though my hope for change dwindles every day and my misanthropy is multiplied by 10 toward privileged people because of their dehumanizing approach toward everyone else this is a very passionate angry rant directed at no one in this sub in particular but directed at the general public in the first world at the same time and this sub is the only place on the internet where i dont think the post will get 100 kneejerk hate reactions though i expect a lot of hate from bootlicker types read at your own risk   to my temporary im leaving soon neighbors in the first world never forget you are choosing to live like scum who support thousands of injustices with your daily actions and selfcentered attitudes toward everything you allow yourselves to be ruled by war criminals both sides are the same corrupt bs year in and year out while willfully turning a blind eye to the normalized genocide forced poverty and segregation your leaders perpetuate in all areas of the world the only issues you pay attention to in current events and history are those that directly affect your selfinterest or feed your biases you also create an overinflated ego and sense of selfimportance from your meaningless corporate jobs most of which dont make the world a better place and actively make it worse by hurting the environment and making corrupt dark triad people even more prosperous you are a useful pawn for these people and that is all they will ever see you as imagine thinking youre some big shot credible person with authority for being just another obedient cog in a system of torture and death many of you almost subconsciously look down on the working class illegal and low wage workers in your countries even though theyre literally the backbones of your infrastructure and the main force that allows you to go to that cushy office job every day and buy lunch with no worries of anything falling apart   then in your free time instead of studying things like sociology  spirituality and trying to progress the world toward one of love and equality you get on the internet to bully strangers over trivial nonsense  looks age income intellect disabilities mental health status popularity lifestyle size level of success choosing to stay single or a loner how social they are how many people they slept with or didnt sleep with which religion  spiritual beliefs they have or lack thereof and any personality traits  viewpoints that youve been trained by toxic parents  society to hate and dont conform ad nauseam to your narrow comfort zone and worldview you spend every waking hour online and irl being as callous unempathetic and dismissive toward people and their experiences  feelings as humanly possible ive seen so many instances of people who are genuinely struggling sharing their experiences online only to be blamed for all their traumas by a bunch of privileged overgrown babies who are obviously out of touch with global reality and never faced any real adversity compared to others in those shithole countries they never think about or even compared to people in those rough neighborhoods of their own country that they only bring up when the poor people commit more crime narrative is mentioned never any mention of what causes the poverty though just the blame  shame game left and right and we all know how common fake friendships are in firstworld countries with so many people out there who want to know your deepest darkest secrets just to use them against you or to take advantage vultures ive talked to several people who are either from nonfirst world countries or lived in them extensively they all say that friendships are not like this in other parts of the world its a problem of the west or at least more pronounced here people make frenemies instead of friends regardless of gender and its nearly universal i think the reason for the toxic nature of relationships here is that almost every damn pursuit in western culture devolves to a game of oneupsmanship and getting a leg up on somebody ah theres that good old capitalismfueled competition rearing its head again patriarchy is another cultural disease that adds to the prevalence of hypercompetition as well  victim blaming prejudiced criticisms under the guise of tough love  advice and casual gaslighting of all kinds in all situations seems to be something people in your cultures do for amusement online never thinking about the psychological harm that may have been done to the other person it just shows how fragile your egos are and how they need to be preserved 247 against the slightest deviation all of this insecurity despite the fact that you people go on and on about how you live in the best countries in the world if something doesnt align with your narrow scope of vision you will refuse to consider or even hear a single word that the other person is saying and abuse them for expressing themselves in a way that you dont approve all so you can pretend that the world is aokay that youre not complicit in thousands of injustices that occur everyday and that anyone who gets mistreated abused or even killed brought it on themselves and deserved it its like you deliberately turn off any semblance of humanity and empathy that neoliberal capitalist culture hasnt already sucked out of you   i guess i understand thinking this way makes it convenient to stay working mindlessly like an ant and only caring about your own lot in life never truly questioning why it has to be this way but really why we could literally have a global revolution tomorrow if people really wanted to unite because youre afraid to lose your job you have kids to feed thats part of the problem knowing everything going on in this world and continuing to bring children into inevitable suffering just because everyone else is popping out babies and you dont want to be an outcast or a selfish desire for legacy or maybe you accept the status quo unconditionally because your parents told you its just the way it is when you were children bullshit thats the first time they tried to kill the passion out of you and you let them chances are that most of our parents  adults told their kids deflating things like this to perpetuate the justworld fallacy for themselves and avoid guilt about their own lack of action in making the world a better place then they bring more children into the world and indoctrinate them with the same sick values and the generational cycle of mass suffering continues beautiful isnt it but i know most people will probably say i should go to a shrink for this rant and that im the crazy one for not seeing the value in humanity when this is how we choose yes its a choice not human nature to live  there really isnt much of a difference between the mentality of todays neoliberal consumerist zombies and people like hitlers supporters you neoliberals are just very slick with the way you do things but its all done under the same wicked intentions of oppression and dominance for the sake of dominance we literally have more than enough resources globally to give every human being a house keep them decently fed etc but no the majority of you narcissistic chimpanzees keep insisting competition  hyperindividualism is good survival of the fittest cooperation  collectivism and being kind is for the weak same idiots that go around saying things like respect must be earned not given and telling it like it is to justify their prejudices and discriminatory actions  no asshole im the one telling it like it is and i know you dont like the actual truth because it puts you and your peers everyday shortcomings on a big projector for you all to see   and before anyone complains yes i understand there are hundreds of millions of people in the first world and some very few lets be honest dont go along with the status quo and try to be part of the change they envision for the world this is a rant directed at the middle  bourgeois class majority honestly socalled democracy has proven to be the biggest tyranny of all in other systems there was always a distinct group challenging the authorities at play and they werent completely wiped into silence if they were wiped via violence it was later understood as a cruel act that shouldnt be mimicked but because the word democracy is falsely used to describe this inhumane system and sounds good on paper the masses shut down people who rightfully question how free this illusion truly is and think theyre the real fascists since they dont use violence and just shut these people out of the discussion via cultural power those people have no viable way to make their point without looking like the bad guys and while i dont believe we live in a meritocracy the fact that most people believe we do and their justifications for mistreating the lower end people show me that the concept as a whole is inherently bad for humanity due to the callous mentality it perpetuates we are all slaves to the judgments of the majority no matter how delusional they become   at least with one central leadership figure you have a chance of bringing in someone with a good head on their shoulders and high level of compassion your odds of finding one admirable person to lead are much higher than getting the majority to love and respect one another regardless of differences the majority will always keep an ignorant and inhumane mentality toward anyone not exactly like them and therefore will maintain a cold despicable value system in society  as a result they fall for the lies and deceitful charisma of sadistic narcissists and propel them into positions of power  influence time and time again good purehearted people who mind their business and try not to judge others over personal characteristics are treated like the exact opposite they dont participate in what most call banter so theyre viewed by the majority as lame  soft or too boring  sensitive as a result good people are usually targets of unprovoked bullying abuse and  or isolation why because socalled civilized modern people have become so dumb and backward that intending to be a good person from the beginning without having ulterior motives is viewed as weakness this world wants you to be manipulating and transactional in everything you do and everyone you deal with when people who refuse to play the game are permanently othered and inevitably deemed losers and outcasts the society then acts like it was their fault and they must be truly lacking something inside them to not be able to integrate no these less than 5 of people just couldnt allow themselves to be everyday sadistic sociopaths like the majority   its funny how trump called africa a shithole when from a character standpoint even with their own flaws people there have more redeeming qualities in one finger than your average westerner has in their entire bloodline especially westerners that make close to six figures or more less wealthy people in this country at least try to help each other in limited ways sometimes and tend to have a lot more principles that they live by for better or worse there are many flawed principles but i can respect any principled person far more than the rich and middle class who push this sell your soul and existence to the highest bidder bootlicker mentality on everyone if you refuse to be a part of bourgeois culture and play the game you will be concern trolled and gaslighted by these people theyll say grow up or youll never become successful thinking this way to these people growing up means relentlessly chasing arbitrary standards of prosperity and becoming a compliant worker bee who never questions any of societys authorities well i say fuck you and fuck your mediacrafted definitions of success happiness and prosperity all three are treated like a zerosum game where crabs in a bucket must prevent the others from getting enough for themselves people want to avoid concepts like misanthropy and antinatalism because theyre deemed as negative and divisive all the while deliberately ignoring the fact that even socalled positive concepts have been bastardized by the puppetmasters of this world to keep the masses controlling hostile and hypercompetitive toward one another humans want to continue living in strife despite the fact that true scarcity meaning lack of enough physical resources to support everyone does not exist and will only decrease as technology finds new ways to support sustainability and preserve life at least misanthropy and antinatalism stemmed from concern for the greater environment and a desire to improve life for the people already here people who buy into the cult of individualistic positivity seem to be primarily concerned with selfpromotion and getting recognition above all else even better if its at someones expense and they can feel like they knocked someone down a peg while pulling themselves up the crazy part is that mentalities like this are promoted by society as selflove and confidence cultures of cutthroat scarcity are promoted as inevitable reality while cultures of abundance and compassion are quickly dismissed as childish navet it is all cultural not based on the physical reality that is abundance   at this point im allergic to anyone this heinous society considers successful and want to keep at least three football fields of distance between me and those types of people write me off as a deluded loser if you like i stopped caring about petty bs like that a long time ago i only care about one thing now and thats knowing the true reality things probably wont change but i need to keep my eye out so i can at least avoid the madness myself im a second generation immigrant native born in the usa and im deliberately moving to a remote third world country to live on less money and less stress and to get away from this toxic inhumane social darwinist culture no matter how many peoples lives are ruined by this system the general public continues to go along with its twisted machiavellian values and sweep problems  victims under the rug all to pretend everything is positive and i am in control of everything that happens in my life material difficulties aside at least people elsewhere have a somewhat closer relationship with reality they have to for survival and treat each other more like human beings ill gladly deal with increased material inconveniences over this spiritually bankrupt cultural wasteland we call the west in the first world when people look at you you are a walking currency amount not a breathing human never forget that,o7aj98

570,"I’m not against “work”, more the conditions in which we work.",i consider myself an anarchosocialist somebody who doesnt really appreciate the government and disagrees with capitalism and believes that change needs to happen right now drastic change not gradual we are doing that and it isnt working thats the bear bones of what i am   but capitalism thats my issue   the conditions of the work environment are not just on a physical level its on an emotional and mental level to you could spend 100k on schooling just to have to compete with people who have a better smile with you even though you have way more potential   then the financial level almost every job has a rank system different workers are on different wage pays i hate the gaps people who perform the same activity have the same qualifications and similar interests should get paid the same no also shouldnt they get paid a livable and affordable price  is it just me or am o the only one who thinks that bosses should be catering to their workers since the workers do the hard labor unhappy workers unhappy clients less money coming into your business its insane the working class gets no respect i feel  also its hard to get a good job without going to college some people are not academically inclined if somebody is working full time at a commercial store to make a living at least pay them like it dont pay them 11 40 hours with tax taken out and expect them to pay for 3 kids and 1500 rent make your workers happy and pay them realistically  im not done i believe that the work force of the civilians put together is essential for society but as an anarchist living in a state where everybody acts accordingly to themselves is not too bad to me but its easier to fix what we have than change the entire thing work is essential but needs to be torn apart and rebuilt  im not gonna grow up and be a wage slave,o7e79z

572,"The stupid, the unaware, the contrarians and the evil. These are the people that prevent progress.",antiwork principles should be obvious yet in the real world they are less popular then you would think i was surprised how few people even heard about these ideas i thought alot about this in a more broader sense and now ive come to the conclusion that for the most part progress as a whole is not constrained by realities of science laws or economics like we are taught to believe but rather by certain characteristics of people that have certain negative traits who combined constitute at least around 5070 of the global population this clash in values ultimately prevents a possible global consensus i believe this global consensus is the basis of good and evil and to a large extent reality itself which is why in the lack of it you have alot of the chaos you do now ive very broadly categorized this 5070 into subgroups    the stupid these people are simply incapable of seeing how they are getting robbed by employers capitalists and companies and how the system is rigged against them these are usually the work hard grind hard type of people who work 80 hours a week for 20 years at mcdonalds to double their salary without ever giving a thought to skilling up to higher hourly salaries or self employment anecdotally it also includes the relegious traditionalists types who dont question narratives and live according to the customs and traditioms of people around its not malice but some limitation in cognitive abilities to be able to fully understand and grasp antiwork flaws of the system and socialist principles there may be a little bit of a chance to change but unfortunately once their simple habits and ideas are set they will not change  the unaware and also the desperate this constitutes the majority of the subsect of people discussed these people are doing everything they can to survive climb the corporate ladder beat the system and secure a life for themselves these are the purest and most distilled form of victims and cattle produced by the capitalist system these are your average joes who simply dont have the time or energy to read a book or go deeper into the philosophical principles there view of the world is narrow not because they arent smart but because they simply didnt have the privilege time or need to broaden their undeestanding of the world after a certain period of time they become numb to the injustice inflicted against them and for entertainment go on blindly guzzling beers and rooting for the millionaire soccer player because he represents him learning this stuff also becomes difficult because their is so much depth go it that jts like learning calculus when you never done subtraction before on the flip side it also includes the very comfortable privileged the suburb kid who became a dentist with loving wife and 2 kids he simply has no need to disrupt this and passively becomes unaware although he too at level is a victim and prisoner just a very well fed one these people i think are still within reach to understanding antiwork principles but they need time and an actual intrinsic interest and will to learn  the contrarians these are the most annoying spineless and vacuous group at least with the evil you know where they stand these are the ones commenting libtard and voting for trump to piss of the libs they have no moral compass and will mould to fit any position as needed as long as it is contrary to the narrative they perceive as popular if suddenly climate change denial will become a left position they will start accepting climate change they will always bring the both sides arguement in blantly obvious cases of injustice these are the dudes in your company saying you shouldnt have wfh just cause despite his reasoning it meets some emotional needs deep down i guess its either hubris wanting to feel special and climb the ladder feel smart or whatever i thought initlaly this was a phase people had in high school but turns out its everywhere and these guys never really grow out of it theres alot of them too as we see time and time again these people are just too toxic to change and they have no interest in advancing progressive causes unless ironically if progressivism becomes what anti progressivism is now the only salvation i find is that  usually these people get exposed for the emotional basis of their position and they typically never get huge systematic support amongst the 50 because they dont stand for anything besides being a troll contrarian for example if you ever browse far right wing forums you suprisngly see that trump of milo yiannopoulos contrarians never gets the respect that someone less popular yet more grounded and with more skin in the game like steve bannonevil or lincoln rockewellevil would get simply because they are contrarian shills  the evil this would be too long if i went into detail but simply put these people possess all the negative traits that shape the anti progressive forces of the world they are the complete polar opposite of what we would see as a moral person also unlike the others these people are grounded in their ways of evil and have a crooked philosophical basis behind it so they arent vacuous like contrarians also generally the machiavelliansim that accompanies becoming evil also lends it self well to other societal valued traits such as intelligence wealth and leadership that are all valuable in the capitalist system these people are your bad bosses who prevent work from home micromanage and make you work 40 unpaid hours just to see you miserable they are the fascist politicians who genuinely believe that those unlike them should be exterminated and these are you billionaires who despite being aware of their burden do not pay taxes or do enough to help i think they genuinely enjoy that like you and i would enjoy sex or get some kind of warmth like a normal person does seeing a homeless person getting a home beyond redemption these people are your enemies and the architects of the system one must do everything in their power and will to stop them  and treat them like an existential parasitic threat on humanity that they   anyways this ultimately how i see the world now at the core of it its a problem not of impracticality but of character as long as these individuals exist and form a high  of the population antiwork ideas may not be popular all you really can do in your lifetime is spread the word and fight agaisnt the evil thats what i try my best to do anyways i do genuinely hope that subreddits and ideas like this one day do lead to a great systematic change where these percentages will shift more and more over a long period of time we probably wont live to see it but i still think its worth the effort,o73q1v

are much higher than getting the majority to love and respect one another regardless of differences the majority will always keep an ignorant and inhumane mentality toward anyone not exactly like them and therefore will maintain a cold despicable value system in society  as a result they fall for the lies and deceitful charisma of sadistic narcissists and propel them into positions of power  influence time and time again good purehearted people who mind their business and try not to judge others over personal characteristics are treated like the exact opposite they dont participate in what most call banter so theyre viewed by the majority as lame  soft or too boring  sensitive as a result good people are usually targets of unprovoked bullying abuse and  or isolation why because socalled civilized modern people have become so dumb and backward that intending to be a good person from the beginning without having ulterior motives is viewed as weakness this world wants you to be manipulating and transactional in everything you do and everyone you deal with when people who refuse to play the game are permanently othered and inevitably deemed losers and outcasts the society then acts like it was their fault and they must be truly lacking something inside them to not be able to integrate no these less than 5 of people just couldnt allow themselves to be everyday sadistic sociopaths like the majority   its funny how trump called africa a shithole when from a character standpoint even with their own flaws people there have more redeeming qualities in one finger than your average westerner has in their entire bloodline especially westerners that make close to six figures or more less wealthy people in this country at least try to help each other in limited ways sometimes and tend to have a lot more principles that they live by for better or worse there are many flawed principles but i can respect any principled person far more than the rich and middle class who push this sell your soul and existence to the highest bidder bootlicker mentality on everyone if you refuse to be a part of bourgeois culture and play the game you will be concern trolled and gaslighted by these people theyll say grow up or youll never become successful thinking this way to these people growing up means relentlessly chasing arbitrary standards of prosperity and becoming a compliant worker bee who never questions any of societys authorities well i say fuck you and fuck your mediacrafted definitions of success happiness and prosperity all three are treated like a zerosum game where crabs in a bucket must prevent the others from getting enough for themselves people want to avoid concepts like misanthropy and antinatalism because theyre deemed as negative and divisive all the while deliberately ignoring the fact that even socalled positive concepts have been bastardized by the puppetmasters of this world to keep the masses controlling hostile and hypercompetitive toward one another humans want to continue living in strife despite the fact that true scarcity meaning lack of enough physical resources to support everyone does not exist and will only decrease as technology finds new ways to support sustainability and preserve life at least misanthropy and antinatalism stemmed from concern for the greater environment and a desire to improve life for the people already here people who buy into the cult of individualistic positivity seem to be primarily concerned with selfpromotion and getting recognition above all else even better if its at someones expense and they can feel like they knocked someone down a peg while pulling themselves up the crazy part is that mentalities like this are promoted by society as selflove and confidence cultures of cutthroat scarcity are promoted as inevitable reality while cultures of abundance and compassion are quickly dismissed as childish navet it is all cultural not based on the physical reality that is abundance   at this point im allergic to anyone this heinous society considers successful and want to keep at least three football fields of distance between me and those types of people write me off as a deluded loser if you like i stopped caring about petty bs like that a long time ago i only care about one thing now and thats knowing the true reality things probably wont change but i need to keep my eye out so i can at least avoid the madness myself im a second generation immigrant native born in the usa and im deliberately moving to a remote third world country to live on less money and less stress and to get away from this toxic inhumane social darwinist culture no matter how many peoples lives are ruined by this system the general public continues to go along with its twisted machiavellian values and sweep problems  victims under the rug all to pretend everything is positive and i am in control of everything that happens in my life material difficulties aside at least people elsewhere have a somewhat closer relationship with reality they have to for survival and treat each other more like human beings ill gladly deal with increased material inconveniences over this spiritually bankrupt cultural wasteland we call the west in the first world when people look at you you are a walking currency amount not a breathing human never forget that,o7aj55

590,"If All Goes According To Plan, I Won't Have To Work Until At Least Next April and Will Still Get Paid",for the most part i wont have to work   im on a leave of absence right now and stopped working in early may due to anxiety and depression and stress the job im at is horrible but before i quit or hopped into another job i decided to use them for their benefits  so i got denied for short term disability due to a pre existing condition clause and because i havent been there at least a year but i did get approved for state disability so im getting paid for the 46 weeks ive been off work the only thing isstate disability pay is a joke and pays less than unemployment so i thought of another plan to get more money and not work  im  going to return within the next week or two and got my doctor to say i was ready to return in my state you can take paid family leave and get paid up to 1000 a week for 12 weeks thats much lower than what i make but is enough to cover bills and to save extra money   so i get to apply for that after the 4th of july but i need to be active to apply so thats why im going back to work   as soon as i get back to work im going to apply for paid family leave i dont see a reason why i wouldnt get approved as my mothers health is fucked up and im going to have her doctor say that im going to be her caregiver   so this will allow me to be off for 3 months12 weeks   if i dont go out right away ill begin the leave at the beginning of august   when i return to work even if im there for july they wont have me doing shit because it will take a while to get me back on board meanwhile since i have been out on leave if they try to fire me for requesting a new leave that will be clear retaliation and my state has a no retaliation policy for requesting paid family leave which is why im going to do it right when i return   so basically i wont have to do shit when i return to work anyway then will be on leave again augustnovember   when i return in november holidays will be approaching again i wont have to do shit but attend meetings at the most run a shitty report   i will request vacation as much as i have available from november to december as well   once the first week of january gets here i will actually qualify for 12 weeks of fmla for 12 weeks and up to 26 weeks of paid short term disability i will at a minimum get paid vacation and sick time for fmla and will just tell my doctor i cant work anymore and have him sign off to go back on std   so basically i dont give a fuck about the company i work for i am going to keep taking leave as much as fucking possible come back for a few weeks then fucking repeat   they can kiss my ass i want to date drink travel and just enjoy my youth   hopefully all goes according to plan fingers crossed,o6rfz5
591,LinkedIn Stories,linkedin is full of narrowminded egotistical people who brags about their success to the point where they think being workaholic makes up their whole personality they are brainwashed into thinking that working towards a dream a sheep under capitalism is the end all more often they so engulfed in their own work that they feel the need to post cliched stories after stories most often sob stories about how their childhood is pitiful and how hard they worked to get where they are the best part is when they brag about being the first generation to graduate even though college tafe and universities have become more and more accessible as a result a lot of people hold degrees in different states so i dont know why they think theyre so special the reality is that without work these people have no personality no stance no nothing because a toxic work culture is all they have ever known they are too indulged  in their own bubble that they can t see the manipulation behind the phrase chase your dreams and find career in something you love how about being a friend a partner a caring and giving human being  how about having hobbies and doing things out of your free time we have been bombarded with the same old 40hrweek 95 job wasting our majority of life on working and working until exhaustion and not being able to do things we love or spend time with those who we love dearly the capitalists are creating a nation of robots that cant take a mental break because mental health is not taken seriously and linkedin is further perpetuating this disgusting workaholic stance  what was meant to be inspiring has turned into a place for a group of smart asses who are indirectly promoting a toxic work culture due to the amount of hardships they faced,o6zexx

605,Dear First Worlders...,warning the world ruled by the callous mentalities created by the global cult of capitalism and illusion of meritocracy has taken me to the point of being a misanthrope yes im honest about it that being said i dont hate anyone as an individual and believe humanity doesnt have to be this way though my hope for change dwindles every day my misanthropy is multiplied by 10 toward privileged people because of their dehumanizing approach toward everyone else this is a very passionate angry rant directed at no one in this sub in particular but directed at the general public in the first world at the same time and this sub is the only place on the internet where i dont think the post will get 100 kneejerk hate reactions though i expect a lot of hate from bootlicker types read at your own risk   to my temporary im leaving soon neighbors in the first world never forget you are choosing to live like scum who support thousands of injustices with your daily actions and selfcentered attitudes toward everything you allow yourselves to be ruled by war criminals both sides are the same corrupt bs year in and year out while willfully turning a blind eye to the normalized genocide forced poverty and segregation your leaders perpetuate in all areas of the world the only issues you pay attention to in current events and history are those that directly affect your selfinterest or feed your biases you also create an overinflated ego and sense of selfimportance from your meaningless corporate jobs most of which dont make the world a better place and actively make it worse by hurting the environment and making corrupt dark triad people even more prosperous you are a useful pawn for these people and that is all they will ever see you as imagine thinking youre some big shot credible person with authority for being just another obedient cog in a system of torture and death many of you almost subconsciously look down on the working class illegal and low wage workers in your countries even though theyre literally the backbones of your infrastructure and the main force that allows you to go to that cushy office job every day and buy lunch with no worries of anything falling apart   then in your free time instead of studying things like sociology  spirituality and trying to progress the world toward one of love and equality you get on the internet to bully strangers over trivial nonsense  looks age income intellect disabilities mental health status popularity lifestyle size level of success choosing to stay single or a loner how social they are how many people they slept with or didnt sleep with which religion  spiritual beliefs they have or lack thereof and any personality traits  viewpoints that youve been trained by toxic parents  society to hate and dont conform ad nauseam to your narrow comfort zone and worldview you spend every waking hour online and irl being as callous unempathetic and dismissive toward people and their experiences  feelings as humanly possible ive seen so many instances of people who are genuinely struggling sharing their experiences online only to be blamed for all their traumas by a bunch of privileged overgrown babies who are obviously out of touch with global reality and never faced any real adversity compared to others in those shithole countries they never think about or even compared to people in those rough neighborhoods of their own country that they only bring up when the poor people commit more crime narrative is mentioned never any mention of what causes the poverty though just the blame  shame game left and right and we all know how common fake friendships are in firstworld countries with so many people out there who want to know your deepest darkest secrets just to use them against you or to take advantage vultures ive talked to several people who are either from nonfirst world countries or lived in them extensively they all say that friendships are not like this in other parts of the world its a problem of the west or at least more pronounced here people make frenemies instead of friends regardless of gender and its nearly universal i think the reason for the toxic nature of relationships here is that almost every damn pursuit in western culture devolves to a game of oneupsmanship and getting a leg up on somebody ah theres that good old capitalismfueled competition rearing its head again patriarchy is another cultural disease that adds to the prevalence of hypercompetition as well  victim blaming prejudiced criticisms under the guise of tough love  advice and casual gaslighting of all kinds in all situations seems to be something people in your cultures do for amusement online never thinking about the psychological harm that may have been done to the other person it just shows how fragile your egos are and how they need to be preserved 247 against the slightest deviation all of this insecurity despite the fact that you people go on and on about how you live in the best countries in the world if something doesnt align with your narrow scope of vision you will refuse to consider or even hear a single word that the other person is saying and abuse them for expressing themselves in a way that you dont approve all so you can pretend that the world is aokay that youre not complicit in thousands of injustices that occur everyday and that anyone who gets mistreated abused or even killed brought it on themselves and deserved it its like you deliberately turn off any semblance of humanity and empathy that neoliberal capitalist culture hasnt already sucked out of you   i guess i understand thinking this way makes it convenient to stay working mindlessly like an ant and only caring about your own lot in life never truly questioning why it has to be this way but really why we could literally have a global revolution tomorrow if people really wanted to unite because youre afraid to lose your job you have kids to feed thats part of the problem knowing everything going on in this world and continuing to bring children into inevitable suffering just because everyone else is popping out babies and you dont want to be an outcast or a selfish desire for legacy or maybe you accept the status quo unconditionally because your parents told you its just the way it is when you were children bullshit thats the first time they tried to kill the passion out of you and you let them chances are that most of our parents  adults told their kids deflating things like this to perpetuate the justworld fallacy for themselves and avoid guilt about their own lack of action in making the world a better place then they bring more children into the world and indoctrinate them with the same sick values and the generational cycle of mass suffering continues beautiful isnt it but i know most people will probably say i should go to a shrink for this rant and that im the crazy one for not seeing the value in humanity when this is how we choose yes its a choice not human nature to live  there really isnt much of a difference between the mentality of todays neoliberal consumerist zombies and people like hitlers supporters you neoliberals are just very slick with the way you do things but its all done under the same wicked intentions of oppression and dominance for the sake of dominance we literally have more than enough resources globally to give every human being a house keep them decently fed etc but no the majority of you narcissistic chimpanzees keep insisting competition  hyperindividualism is good survival of the fittest cooperation  collectivism and being kind is for the weak same idiots that go around saying things like respect must be earned not given and telling it like it is to justify their prejudices and discriminatory actions  no asshole im the one telling it like it is and i know you dont like the actual truth because it puts you and your peers everyday shortcomings on a big projector for you all to see   and before anyone complains yes i understand there are hundreds of millions of people in the first world and some very few lets be honest dont go along with the status quo and try to be part of the change they envision for the world this is a rant directed at the middle  bourgeois class majority honestly socalled democracy has proven to be the biggest tyranny of all in other systems there was always a distinct group challenging the authorities at play and they werent completely wiped into silence if they were wiped via violence it was later understood as a cruel act that shouldnt be mimicked but because the word democracy is falsely used to describe this inhumane system and sounds good on paper the masses shut down people who rightfully question how free this illusion truly is and think theyre the real fascists since they dont use violence and just shut these people out of the discussion via cultural power those people have no viable way to make their point without looking like the bad guys and while i dont believe we live in a meritocracy the fact that most people believe we do and their justifications for mistreating the lower end people show me that the concept as a whole is inherently bad for humanity due to the callous mentality it perpetuates we are all slaves to the judgments of the majority no matter how delusional they become   at least with one central leadership figure you have a chance of bringing in someone with a good head on their shoulders and high level of compassion your odds of finding one admirable person to lead are much higher than getting the majority to love and respect one another regardless of differences the majority will always keep an ignorant and inhumane mentality toward anyone not exactly like them and therefore will maintain a cold despicable value system in society  as a result they fall for the lies and deceitful charisma of sadistic narcissists and propel them into positions of power  influence time and time again good purehearted people who mind their business and try not to judge others over personal characteristics are treated like the exact opposite they dont participate in what most call banter so theyre viewed by the majority as lame  soft or too boring  sensitive as a result good people are usually targets of unprovoked bullying abuse and  or isolation why because socalled civilized modern people have become so dumb and backward that intending to be a good person from the beginning without having ulterior motives is viewed as weakness this world wants you to be manipulating and transactional in everything you do and everyone you deal with when people who refuse to play the game are permanently othered and inevitably deemed losers and outcasts the society then acts like it was their fault and they must be truly lacking something inside them to not be able to integrate no these less than 5 of people just couldnt allow themselves to be everyday sadistic sociopaths like the majority   its funny how trump called africa a shithole when from a character standpoint even with their own flaws people there have more redeeming qualities in one finger than your average westerner has in their entire bloodline especially westerners that make close to six figures or more less wealthy people in this country at least try to help each other in limited ways sometimes and tend to have a lot more principles that they live by for better or worse there are many flawed principles but i can respect any principled person far more than the rich and middle class who push this sell your soul and existence to the highest bidder bootlicker mentality on everyone if you refuse to be a part of bourgeois culture and play the game you will be concern trolled and gaslighted by these people theyll say grow up or youll never become successful thinking this way to these people growing up means relentlessly chasing arbitrary standards of prosperity and becoming a compliant worker bee who never questions any of societys authorities well i say fuck you and fuck your mediacrafted definitions of success happiness and prosperity all three are treated like a zerosum game where crabs in a bucket must prevent the others from getting enough for themselves people want to avoid concepts like misanthropy and antinatalism because theyre deemed as negative and divisive all the while deliberately ignoring the fact that even socalled positive concepts have been bastardized by the puppetmasters of this world to keep the masses controlling hostile and hypercompetitive toward one another humans want to continue living in strife despite the fact that true scarcity meaning lack of enough physical resources to support everyone does not exist and will only decrease as technology finds new ways to support sustainability and preserve life at least misanthropy and antinatalism stemmed from concern for the greater environment and a desire to improve life for the people already here people who buy into the cult of individualistic positivity seem to be primarily concerned with selfpromotion and getting recognition above all else even better if its at someones expense and they can feel like they knocked someone down a peg while pulling themselves up the crazy part is that mentalities like this are promoted by society as selflove and confidence cultures of cutthroat scarcity are promoted as inevitable reality while cultures of abundance and compassion are quickly dismissed as childish navet it is all cultural not based on the physical reality that is abundance   at this point im allergic to anyone this heinous society considers successful and want to keep at least three football fields of distance between me and those types of people write me off as a deluded loser if you like i stopped caring about petty bs like that a long time ago i only care about one thing now and thats knowing the true reality things probably wont change but i need to keep my eye out so i can at least avoid the madness myself im a second generation immigrant native born in the usa and im deliberately moving to a remote third world country to live on less money and less stress and to get away from this toxic inhumane social darwinist culture no matter how many peoples lives are ruined by this system the general public continues to go along with its twisted machiavellian values and sweep problems  victims under the rug all to pretend everything is positive and i am in control of everything that happens in my life material difficulties aside at least people elsewhere have a somewhat closer relationship with reality they have to for survival and treat each other more like human beings ill gladly deal with increased material inconveniences over this spiritually bankrupt cultural wasteland we call the west in the first world when people look at you you are a walking currency amount not a breathing human never forget that,o7aj5t

613,"I only view work as what the ''job'' can do for me, not the other way around.",ive been working capitalistic bullshit retail and food service jobs since i was 14 years old i have been getting bashed by the people around me since then for my inability to hold down a job basically i lived in a small town where everyone kept the same highschool job til they moved for college and all college graduates kept the same job til they retired or died      i however only worked at places where i had friends and i had fun with it and i fucked around because i never took the market seriously and the second my capitalistic sheep managers started giving me a hard time i would quit while i was working constantly i never lasted more than 7 months at a job because i would not put up with anyones shit         so many people say that this is bad looks bad for me and my resume and yet it never impaired me from finding a job wonder why that is maybe because it doesnt fucking matter capitalism always needs new slaves so the way i see it is i got to experience different jobs different levels of bullshit but got to make friends and memories along the way and i intend to keep going        i dont see the point in going to fancy university and getting a fancy degree just to then sit at a desk for 40 years      i see these silly little jobs as much more entertaining and this might sound dumb but they allow me to travel i have 3 citizenships and in any of my countries i can just work a little retail job and afford a garbage little apartment for me and my cat and just vibe and discover places and meet people and make it worth my while and really work fades into the background     so while i hate the idea of selling my soul and body to capitalism as a forever minimum wage worker i definitely see that it can have some advantages and work for me      plus sometimes there are perks or i get a few cents above minimum wage and it all adds to the delusional fun that is working to be able to survive idk anyone else have this attitude that while work is rotted we can make it work for our goals and plans        also retail is bullshit and there is no one more stupid than the customer          rant over pleasant day ,o75xpm

790,I got fired for organizing,this was a few year ago but i thought id share with this community i got a job working with someone i knew from the church i went to as a child he was actually my youth pastor i no longer practice any religion but i think this is relevant to the story he ran a small screen printing shop when i first started there was only about 5 full time employees and the owner rarely ever came in i started at 11 dollars i believe and had to fight for every raise i only got my first significant raise because i was one of two people who knew had to run the automatic press the other person put in his two weeks for a better job and i was looking for better pay myself so i used this as leverage and told my boss i was offered a job with higher pay since he would have nobody to run his most lucrative press he reluctantly gave me a raise to 13 i think fast forward a few years he finally decided to try and grow the business by adding more presses and hiring more people i was eventually promoted to production manager and had clawed my way to 18 an hour i saw all of the work orders and i knew what the business was making and my pay was dismal in comparison and i was the 2nd or 3rd highest paid person in the shop all the while my boss owned a small trailer camper that he maybe used twice a year bought himself a brand new 4runner and owned his house and was raising 4 kids the main reason i didnt quit sooner was that i really liked the production team there and we all got along pretty well they didnt want me to quit either so i decided to try and organize for higher pay and health benefits we had meetings outside of work and i even went as far as to make a budget to show that he could be providing healthcare and paying us significantly better all while still turning a healthy profit for himself well i never even got to share my budget with him because he fired my ass and told me it was because i once said that i was checked out from the job i ended up getting unemployment which was great and was sort of my plan b it worked out better for me in the long run than to just quit your boss needs you more than you need him organize your workplaces and fight for better working conditions as a team,o5bfq3

794,Walked out of work today,now let me preface this by saying im fortunate enough to not be dependable on my current part time job im just using it as a way of financing my masters degree in teaching in ireland and im probably quitting soon  im quiet content where i work in a community leisure centre im fairly friendly with everyone and rarely have issues with management as theyre genuinely nice people that im friends with  so ive been doing tuesday through saturdays at the moment no problem whatsoever the needed me on saturday mornings and said id be off sunday and monday so i could spend time with girlfriend or go for nights away again no problem for me as i usually go out on a saturday night anyways  roster is done on a weekly basis but its almost so routine at this stage that checking it is almost trivial for me  so it finally comes out this sunday which is late because our work week starts monday but one of the managers was hospitalised with illness this week so i could understand   out of curiosity i check it and im due to work at 630am on monday it was 5pm sunday when i got the email so im absolutely fuming i had to look after dogs and chickens as my family are away until tonight   i got into work at 630 as a compromise and said im leaving at 800 so get something sorted  the manager today seemed to take my statement as some sort of plead as she just replied ugh okay ill see if i can find someone  come 745 i ask if they got that sorted and she just replied who am i supposed to get at 7am on a monday so i just told her im leaving she began pleading with me to stay saying i cant do that without cover and i replied a spiel about not caring as i was told i was off on mondays and that me showing up for 15 hours was a courtesy on my part as i had less than 15 hours between the time i received my changed roster to when i was working because god forbid i was in another part of the country drinking with no back on sunday night and wouldnt have made it at all   so i walked out to a very disgruntled manager who will probably be out to get me during the week for leaving her short staffed but it finally clicked to me that im not available to them at a click of a finger and have other commitments outside of work i shouldnt have to even consider giving my work notice when my family go on holidays or shouldnt have to consider taking official holiday leave just to go for a night away with my girlfriend  just wanted to get that off my chest again im afforded the luxury of not being reliant on work for finance but previously i was sacrificing a lot of myself to keep them successful thats no longer the case,o4yi9z

840,"Before claiming how secular your country is, realize the religious fervor it takes to believe in capitalism",humans dont actually need that much to survive and propagate the species we need food clean water shelter and to not be eaten by predators  capitalism doesnt provide any of this directly instead workers are expected to engage in rituals called jobs to gain currency which can then be used in a purchasing ritual  your job probably doesnt create much of the above food access to water shelter security but the superstition is that you add enough to an immaterial entity called the economy that you will be able to support yourself through purchasing rituals  this whole system only works because this shared superstition exists throughout places that believe in capitalism  however a shared superstition is not enough since currencies can become useless and resources can become depleted through mass production  because of this less religious adherents are in a constant state of anxiety  the religion of capitalisn has likely made inaccessible the ability to directly make or acquire food water or shelter without engaging in its rituals,o5k40e

848,Any Max Weber fans?,here is a quick summary from google his books are easy enough to read though  max webers the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism is a study of the relationship between the ethics of ascetic protestantism and the emergence of the spirit of modern capitalism weber argues that the religious ideas of groups such as the calvinists played a role in creating the capitalistic spirit  the point he makes is that we started to associate working hard with being a good person and this lead to capitalism it sums up a lot of people in my view they think they are good people because they work every hour they can its almost a religious holier than thou thing  before anyone points out weber has been disproved what was disproved was that this was specific to protestantism because other cultures adopted the same idea but the idea itself still stands,o5bdbo

908,What AntiWork means to me and why I’m not saying that nobody should have a job,work is a word that can be used in different ways  work is a verb  as a verb its the process of accomplishing a task  eg i worked on my garden  that is not what im talking about when im making an antiwork argument  it can be used in multiple ways as a noun  the first way is to refer to the place that you are paid to do a task  eg im a contractor i drive to work  thats usually not what im talking about either  the second way it can be used as a noun is to refer to a career that is seen as your primary responsibility  eg what do you do for work  this is what im talking about when i make an antiwork argument    i think work being seen as peoples primary role in life causes employers to take too much and employees to give up too much  people who personally identify with their role at their workplace also tend to be very judgmental of people who have chosen different priorities  i think this dynamic is lazy and i dont think its the best we can do,o4aa9g

913,Today Is the First Day of the Rest of My Life,ive done it folks  as of last friday ive quit my office job after eight long years and am now starting my freelance career  i thought i would be more nervous i thought id be shaking and crying and a fearful wreck but so far it seems the anxiety and the tears i was shedding on a weekly  and sometimes daily  basis was actually from spending 40 hours a week at a job i hated  after hearing that i was leaving i had not one not two but five coworkers tell me that they were glad that i was getting away from this abusive environment to head that others felt that way was like a shock to the system i hadnt realized how bad it really was and had in fact started believing that maybe i was a bad worker that i deserved to be berated over minor mistakes to spend my hours having panic attacks to be openly disliked by my manager because this was just where i was stuck for my life i cant even say that the money was worth it  i was making a pathetic salary despite three promotions over the years i was still making a little less than three thousand dollars above starting salary  im 33 i spent eight years at the same company  i started fresh from graduate school and it has been my only professional job  which means that i spent a quarter of my life at that place worse it was never what i actually wanted to do when i first got hired on i told myself that it would just be for a year i would get some experience have that line on my resume and leave as soon as i could one year became two then five and then i found that my identity was wrapped around a job i could barely stand i needed a change  and you know once i decided that i was going to quit whether i lined up a new job or not it finally happened  and believe me id been applying elsewhere for years my new job isnt glamorous but it is in a field that i love its remote at my office job we were supposed to be going back to the office soon and despite having fewer hours it pays only a little less than my previous job  enough that i can survive  and thats what im going to do survive im going to survive and without eight hours a day of dreadfilled stress and work that lost its meaning years ago without a manager who openly despises me and a company that refuses to see that i am a good worker who deserves to be treated as such  without all of that holding me back i might just even thrive,o4tmm5

bucharest magurele and decided to use rantiwork in order to do so mainly since i believe that sharing experiences should alleviate the need of others to fall into the traps that i have fallen into i hesitated on using rjobs but it might be that they have a paytowin thing going on similar to glassdoor or yelp in any case i am not looking for votes or karma and if the content is not appropriate i will be happy to move the content to a different section there is a lot to recount so i will try to break the whole experience into palatable chapters such that the post does not read like a wall of text with no breaks or turns i will try to also break down the experiences to conform to what most civilized countries would expect from an employeremployee relationship i might wander a little into side discussions but only for the purpose of providing background or highlighting the employers connections that would benefit the company profile and frame the testimony in context  please take note that most of this is based on personal experience as well as personal impressions and that i may very well be that the institute is great place to be i am publishing this partly to maintain a record of what happened and to document my experience at the institute i share this freely since i have noticed that there is very little information on the subject of ifinhh aside for a few dodgy reviews on various websites that seem to have been bought for or arranged to be posted nevertheless the reader is encouraged to keep an open mind and take heed that these are personal notes and experiences that might just be factually wrong it is ultimately up to everyone to make up their mind and hopefully not too late to do so   background  the horia hulubei national institute for rampd in physics and nuclear engineering ifinhh note the pompous name started off as a typical communist ambition of thirdworld countries locked behind different forms of embargo with the western part of the world just like other typical endeavors such as the currentday palace of parliament the fountains running through bucharest the emphasis was placed on hyperbola and vanity rather than functionality and as one could imagine at the expense of the people since unfortunately the battle with the western world was economically dumped on the shoulders of the common man that had to double up on labor to fund the lavish dictatorial ambitions it did not matter whether any important research was carried out or whether anything lasting was conceived it just had to stand out and ultimately stick up to the capitalists a lot of the glee was fueled by blingpatriotism or cynical patriotism the employees developing some form of multiple personality disorder where on one hand they would have done anything to jump ship but at the same time any criticism would have been met with repression or victimization a lot of this was carried on over by the romanian diaspora where the same duplicity is observed on one hand romanian citizens living abroad criticize romania and accuse romanians of not fighting for their rights but at the same time they would adamantly refuse to return to romania and actually fight for the rights that they seemingly hold dear to all flash no substance  a lot of this has been carried over from communism and little has changed even in more than three decades since the alleged fall of communism in some ways one could argue that the situation has been somewhat amplified given that the embargoes has been lifted and that funds have been funneled by organizations such as the european union into the hands of the very few that had a good time during communism surely this was not the intended effect yet the result was fairly predictable given the power vacuum left by ceausescu a very archetypal decaying of repressive regimes people that had it well under communism have it well now and now it is bolstered and backed up by funding from alleged allies  most of the staff at ifinhh are former communist party members have been working for the romanian secruitate or have acted as rats or moles for the romanian communist party and mainly for the extra buck and advantages that they hold even to this day very little has been done to oust these people or make them pay for their crimes  as a sidecomment even if it was one of the accession conditions for romania to join the eu very few former files of the securitate have been the light of day i have personally been refused access to the files with an excuse that they do not have the files which in context is absurd for a person traveling abroad during communism in other words the very same people that held communist party meetings in lavish and expensive hotels during communism are the very same people that are now in leadership positions naturally the same froufrou patriotism is carried over where a lot of the staff have made great sacrifices to send their progeny abroad obtain double citizenship so they can jump ship when trouble arises yet perpetually seek to attract young talent to perpetuate more of the same through multiple generations as it would follow from the former paragraphs the same degree of pompousness is carried over when given a context where a lot of rural romania lives in bleak poverty the leadership of ifinhh claim bold plans such as winning the nobel prize   a short moment of glory  for a short while it worked surrounded by potential enemies and under the impeding doom of the soviet republic a lot of the staff got heavily involved with western institutes in particular germany by doing political favors organizing lavish conferences that had little to no purpose other than tourism or sex tourism whilst germany at times lent a hand out of pity as well as other geographic interests nevertheless a belt was formed of fairly talented individuals that ultimately managed to escape by emigrating to other countries or have since long grown old died or retired given the institutes notorious reputation for espionage as well as meager or politicallymotivated wages there has been little interests amongst youngsters to seek employment and more than likely from what i have witnessed with good reason   employment  there is very little accountable employment going on at ifinhh most of institute is familydriven and closed circuit with most of the job positions being dished out to the right people or to spin a phrase the same old good guys being somewhat of an insider my own employment took place more or less the same way even though i consider myself a professional in my domain my future boss asked me to write some interview questions down the same questions where then passed at me during the interview such that there was no room for failure ironically and perhaps hilariously but not surprisingly for communist countries my future boss awarded an interview mark less than the full mark even though i was the one to create the questions to my own interview  a lot of emphasis is set on trust issues  at first i did not understand why but it became clearer further on when i was requested by my employer to get meddled in fraudulent activities although unbecoming of a public institution ifinhh carries a subversive attitude towards employees where most work is carried out in a nontransparent form none of the work even remotely relates to nuclear activity nor is the opaqueness justifiable by the institutes profile but the cloak and dagger attitude as it came much later to my attention is meant  to cover the crass incompetence of the personnel as well as being used as leverage to perform underhand deals for various political gains  it is the case that every single minutia or details gets shoved under the carpet for no good reason for instance when handling a complaint from some of the staff i forwarded the resolution and the message back to the person complaining in order to show that work has been done and that the issue should now be resolved i was immediately accosted by some of the employees claiming that i should not give the rest of staff too many details  even though it was a trivial matter that would have worked to their own benefit once the claimant would have found out that their complaint had been addressed   work environment  there were a lot of underhand deals that one would hear about when talking to the lower tiers of staff for instance a case was heard about ifinhh awarding phds in physics to various wellplaced members of the state such as the police the gendarmerie or the fire brigade for the sake of political leverage in other cases there were rumors of phds being written and awarded to some members of staff that were politically wellconnected such as the progeny of former members of allies of the communist securitate one case in particular comes to mind where one of the managers had their phd written for them and awarded in sweden even though she had little clue of the subject and became a manager at ifinhh for a department that is far away from the topic of the awarded phd a lot of former securitate members had a thing for sweden and for some reason it was a place that a lot of these stasi members either sent their children or desired to emigrate to more along the lines of the froufrou patriotism mentioned earlier  i was offered to complete a phd in physics myself even though i have no clue and little interest in physics initially i thought it was a joke and i told them that i barely know the equations of motions let alone do a phd in physics they told me it would all be arranged and that i would be awarded the degree regardless when appearing visibly uneasy about going down that road they told me that i should do it anyway at least to be able to get better wages in retrospect i could have completed a phd in physics from an institution that claims to be reputable  of course there would have been little i could have shown for myself to back up a degree in physics it is funny but the same people employed at ifinhh that heavily criticised ceausescus wife for holding a bunch of figurative titles were also the same people that would put their wives cousins nephews and what not through programmes to be awarded degrees that they had no knowledge of  intuitively the work environment was a either youre with us or against us sort of arrangement and on the big lines i attribute the attitude to the staff and managements inability to distinguish between life and work just like all powers in romania are mixed up in one large conglomerate with no separation of duties the managerial staff at ifinhh was unable to distinguish business from pleasure there were frequent fights such as one of the senior members of staff writing love poems to the female staff fights in meetings between variously connected individuals on topics such as their wives cheating with each other as well as fully blown fist fights on the corridors between junior and senior staff on various topics most of which as i recount the lack of professionalism to distinguish between life and work touching on the topic one of the bosses hired his wife to work within the same department mostly for the extra benefit of being able to delegate funds though her such that on paper he appeared with a much smaller income one of the same spouses that went off to do a phd in nuclear physics while having only a technical school as her educational background  of course just like my offer a deal that would somehow be arranged and with the hopes of nobody calling them out  the staff had a habit of procuring various apparel via work funds that they consigned though their contract but made personal use of exorbitantly expensive laptops comes to mind  water cooled gamer laptops that really were off the mark and context of research in physics even though it is stooping very low now and it feels mostly embarrassing seeing a sextagenary hauling a big gamer laptop after them in a trolley it is worth mentioning because most of the work requisites were obtained and seen by staff as personal favours for instance the terminology used was i bought you a laptop or i bought you a printer instead of the work requisites being considered as the necessary apparel to carry out work it was all one big favor this attitude bore down starting from industrial apparel that should have been a given since they matched the work being carried out and down to very elementary things such as soap toilet paper or bathroom requisites employees would frequently bring such stuff from home with them because availability of said requisites hinged on the relationship that they would have with their boss refuse to do a phd in physics get no soap in the bathroom stuff like that   i was told by some of the low tier staff that one of the bosses had been hoarding water cooler bottles under his table and refused to share with the rest of the staff the staff that he was responsible for the same person approached me and told me that he suspects what a word though one of my colleagues to be a gypsy told me he was a little black skinned you can imagine that given all the above i just did not know what to say he told me that i should not talk to him much if he is a gypsy on the other hand this colleague was quite productive publishing some papers on nano technology and nobody ever had any issues with him such that i was not sure what to make of the event i suppose that such events usually have to be reported and the institute did have an ethics commission as well as an union however the recently promoted leader of the union was the one to carry the bosses suitcase up the stairs while the ethics commission frequently came to help the various head of the departments and worked mostly against the employees  the top of the cake consisted in an event involving me when one of the bosses and the union leader told me that there is a colleague working in ifinhh that apparently had pirated material on his computer because some company complained that the software phoned home and requested from the institute that the person with the pirated material be apprehended as a side note you can see the dichotomy here as well one one hand the institute claims to be family driven where everything can be arranged to the satisfaction of everyone while on the other hand they would readily rat out their own employees instead of shielding them from external pressure on one hand they claim to be unified while on the other hand their would not even flinch to get their own people in trouble when offered political leverage money or both similarly for the union leader whose alleged prime responsibility is to protect employees and not do the bidding of the bosses who was there with us when the boss extended this request to me i promptly refused the request to ransack a colleagues computer and told them that i do not have the necessary legal power to do such a thing and that if it is really necessary they should follow up with the police or whatever legal entity has the capability of carrying out searches and that it probably has to be done with a search warrant i told them that it is a strange request because such complaints follow with a cease and desist order such that even in cultures that protect ip it rarely goes as far as having to collect evidence right from the get go they were taken aback by my refusal and the boss shrugged it off and told me that he had some money to dish out and thought i would want some money in essence i would have been committing fraud while being paid to do so as well as imagining going through a colleagues laptop that might have contained family photos and god knows what that i had little to do with and would have been little business of mine to see  otherwise there was a generalized attitude of harassment of various personnel and as it was explained to me the harassment was bonus offered to some part of the staff as compensation for the low wages essentially the bosses turned a blind eye to such matters paying staff in satisfaction the satisfaction of bulling coworkers rather than in currency   coworkers  after some of the former events i was considered untrustworthy more on the lines of what was recounted before and the desire to hide any minutia such that i was excluded from most of the activities one of the coworkers got in touch with me probably at the request of my boss to sniff me out and see what i am about you just know that you met a romanian spy when the person you are talking to claims that romanians do not want to leave romania anymore i acted a little surprised oh and played ball anyway to see how bad this was going to get this guy son of a former romanian baron had some of the most flexible mental gymnastics in him than i ever picked up from anyone else he was a bit like that undercover police man that comes to a party and tries to blend in but for some reason he is always a bit off that blows his cover to the entire attendants of the party but nobody tells him straight up because they just play ball and go along with it to see what his intentions are i made sure to bad mouth my boss in every communication with him knowing fully well that he was sent by my boss i called my boss so many names in our private correspondence that i had to look up a dictionary of swear words just to feed him all this stuff   in any case a paranoid individual and a walkingtalking meme and everything that came out of his mouth was along the lines of see ivan he told me a bunch of things about how fear keeps people in check how the masonry destroyed romania how the russians hated romania how the western powers destroyed romania  while listening to him it made me feel like we were angels on a pile of dung it was the best piece of revisionist history that i had ever heard topping up with some russian princess ecaterina that did some things that alas i cannot remember cared little about then and care even less now in his view it was that romania as some innocent victim and that there was a centralized conspiracy in destroying romania i mostly kept my hand over my mouth while listening to most of the drivel that he hurled my way in any case after some weeks he confessed on how he would like to run away from romania so i guess that patriotism was not the main incentive of his little speeches it reminded me of how soviet spies were looking to exchange currency after the berlin wall fell regardless of the generalized scare it made me thinking that the worst enemy of romania is the truth  there is actually little to speak of about coworkers mainly because they refused to cowork and perhaps the main reason was that even though they grouped up when it was beneficial other times they were mostly disjoint every single one of them having various connections and deals that they kept to themselves and were used to justify their position   every single attempt to cowork was met with unfriendliness mainly since it meant that at least in their minds they would have to share the prestige money or position competition amongst them was the runoftheday and a lot of them from what i was told would privately see the boss and demand that some of their coworkers not be placed on the same project for various reasons  a lot of the reasons just made up lies one of my coworkers on a project with cern went right up to the boss from my second day of employment and laid out a whole fabricated story about me that was both hilarious and mind bending to listen to given that it was a fully blown fabricated story with lots of nuances i was even approached by one of the bosses of staff that was equally bewildered by the story and asked me not to tell him about it i eventually did after i resigned but i guess that cowardice comes in large doses  in one instance i was hired as rentacoder to complete an assignment for a foreign student in the uk i wiggled my way out of the arrangement but was told that it was not a singular case and that just like awarding phds for political leverage it was one characteristic of the ifinhh institute to reel in foreign students while hinging their bets on future arrangement possibilities one colleague of mine was reeled in the very same way and got hooked up with the mail order bride of his life while dealing with the ifinhh they tried this on me as well but i suppose i am lucky to appear more stupid than i really am and was left to be just a witness of such arrangements plagiarism in modern day romania is such a flexible term when it suits an arrangement it is permitted otherwise it is used as a political tool by people that have little to do with research in order to incriminate each other one hand washes the other is something that is looked up to rather than looked down at and there are so many reversals that i have been witness to   infrastructure  there was an overextended debate over email being read by staff members in reality the institute mixed research staff with support like nowhere else such that implicitly massive conflicts of interests were generated where control over mail serves was given to a part of staff that had no business and little to no formal qualification in administering the servers for instance the main mail server of the institute was administered by some guy with a degree in bio physics that probably picked up it as a hobby and seemed to have more interest in political gain rather than it overall it was widespread paranoia and a lot of the staff asked around wondering whether emails were being read i was questioned on this point myself and just offered up the technical background on the matter since petty squabbles were another daily event and given that i was personally asked to ransack someones computer it would not have amazed me if they did read emails  most of the staff used thirdparty email services as well as bringing their own internet to work the latter was twofold due to the lack of transparency of the server administration as well as a nonexisting support department as well as the incompetence of the it department to provide staff with a stable and working internet any criticism to the computer infrastructure was met with a defense position from the it department that in order to avoid taking responsibility and this is an ever reoccurring theme for ifinhh would claim that the internet provided to staff is for work usage only and that the complainee most likely used the internet for something else and that is why their internet does not work regardless of that you were mostly on your own in case your work equipment was defective and most departments sought homebrew fixes to their equipment as well as hooking equipment brought from home to compensate for the lack of support  as a general overview of the network infrastructure there was an avoid and voracious desire to bar access to various websites the reason therefore was twofold one one hand the institute spent a lot of money in acquiring expensive network equipment that failed to match the profile of the institute essentially they acquired corporate equipment that is meant for small to medium businesses where employee are expected to focus on productiondriven tasks that do not require research it goes without saying that researching a topic on the internet might take you to various areas of the internet that are either politically motivated carry a degree of risk and so forth nevertheless the firewall was a blocksolution that applied universally and would block both email keywords or websites that were legitimate second it was the desire of the it staff to have employees call them and ask for various waivers for certain restrictions there was a lot of that going on where the it staff tended to hold a monopoly on commongood resources because in doing so made them to be sought after and hence i presume important people  for instance i was asked to carry out experiments on a server that also held the emails of about 800 people my employer could not understand that you cannot carry out experiments on servers that are in production even though i explicitly told him that the entire server might go down if we push the experiments too far as a biophysicist i do not hold it to him but it does beg the question why he was placed in charge of the department if his background and experience did not match his duties  that being said of course aside the insider knowledge that he was by association one of the former communist vips other times he inspired me with pity mainly using one of the coworkers a small step up and more enlightened as his technical crutch because he was so clueless of the job he had to do nevertheless all the selections carry out where politically motivated and if someone with experience would have in spite of the absurd sought employment at ifinhh then they would have been marginalized by the rest of the staff for being too competent and inadvertently stepping on shoes  there is a lot of assignment and reassignment of personnel going on more in general in romania shuffling of individuals from one position to the other such that it becomes diluted and unclear what their specialty is if any at all a late monument of a nonspecialized society where people are hired by the numbers and not by the qualifications or area of expertise i have been once told by a policeman that i am probably the right person to know how to hook up a soundcard which is akin to putting a dj in charge of pyrotechnics and then wondering why the result is a bad outcome   cultural diversity and inclusion  to borrow a quote speaking of such matters at ifinhh is like wiping your behind with silk there have been some checkups performed while i was there mostly from the government bu the checkups are prearranged such that whenever government dignitaries visit they are usually taken around by the shoulders or waist and lead down a prearrange path so they get to enjoy themselves and report to their superiors that everything within the institute is just hunkey dorey in fact right after a colleague threatened to sue to institute for misconduct and a large debacle on the subject too place some government official came to one of the main meetings and expressed her satisfaction nonironically i presume i really dont know anymore and stated how she likes that we all get along so well otherwise as previously recounted while the senior management staff drafts poems to female employees matters of sexual harassment within the institute are met with laughter from the immature coworkers and staff it was thrown at us by one of the coworkers and also a government official  that if we spot a case of sexual harassment that we are free to report it which was taken for granted and met with chuckles from the rest of staff i presume partially since such things are way too fine for the brash attitude of the management staff and because such things go on but for various political reasons never see the day of light similarly topics such as data privacy are also too fine for a society that has long missed its train to civilization  although not the only case one coworker attempted suicide by jumping out of a second story building and luckily just broke a leg in doing so an event that was rapidly covered up and the blame shoved onto the victim his parents are still seeking retribution via lawyers for what had been done to their son but given that the institute is well entwined with the police and the jeandarmerie it goes without saying that such events are easily covered up under duress and threats extended to the individual in question as well as their families to cite a coworker and to summarize  they do things at ifinhh that even the mafia does not do in another case a lady was harassed so much by coworkers downright to calling her names making up stories about her that she cracked under the pressure and got so paranoid that she thought the institute is trying to poison her another matter to laugh at from the point of view of the institute and coworkers no doubt  cultural diversity stops at the point where you know that there is barely any foreign staff employed at the institute personally it stopped for me once one of the bosses mentioned that one of my coworkers was under suspicion of being a gypsy otherwise the occasional student is reeled in provided that they also are accompanied by funds   the eli debacle a societal perspective  just like dropping a cocacola bottle over a preindustrial society the eli project became an object of discontent due to disproportionate wages and cargopretige that was associated with the institute the bottom line is that the working at elinp became the object of veneration for people from low income backgrounds and thus sparked a lot of infighting between the various cliques that ifinhh harbors in general just like kids use to drive expensive cars through a hoodlum elinp was seen by many as an opportunity to raise their standard and flaunt their values to others that have been less fortunate it was trivially clear that romania was not up to standard to be able to harbor such an endeavor just by noticing the large income discrepancy between the common folk and those that would have worked for eli it degraded to a bit of clownendeavor where the general population had trouble getting tap water by contrast to the bold statements of the organizers promising nothing less but utmost excellence there have been words and figures published in the media that were ripped out of an 60s scifi novels involving suspended railways lavish fountains highways tennis and golf courts and the likes all of which of course right next to the piling up garbage that is unable to be picked up somehow a bold statement no doubt for a country that barely has any highways  nevertheless the authorities and various ragtag branches of government bought into this elusive dream so much that from what i am told by firsthand witnesses the government or affiliates went as far as to harass people that spoke against eli and extend death threats and the likes to silence any opposition i was told by one of the coworkers how their family started getting calls during the night police checking up on them from time to time and all sort of oddities going on since they started opposing the project given the above the behaviour of the government is no less than pitiful but given the context it seems to be well explained for a country that lacks any shred of dignity extrapolating but on good grounds and first hand experience given that ifinhh acts so unprofessionally there is grounds and reason to doubt that other institutions of the government are not much better off  as could be predicted nothing of that ephemeral dream came to pass there have been no suspended highways or railways built there are no golf courts the garbage and stray dogs are just piling up and ultimately romania has been excluded from eu funds the initial agreement has been that the eu would find the construction up to a given year at which the economic burden would shift from the eu to romania  and well if you cannot pickup garbage then you probably cannot fund such a large project in what regards eu funding one of the main reason of disagreement has been the use of such funds it was expected by the eu that by funding the elinp project the management would hire local or domestic expanding to the eu businesses in order to raise the level within romania and the eu nevertheless the management used the funds to employ overseas companies from the us or china which did not go well with the plan to infuse romania or the eu for that matter with funds such projects even from the construction perspective itself reach into the billions such that it is understandable that disagreements would have arisen   in closing  one of the last memories i have was stepping inside an office with one of the local kingpins of the institute that was in the middle of an inner political fight with one of the other oldnew kingpin guys over a position of power within the institute since repetition makes the pattern he was concerned about the it department reading emails and asked me if i know anything about that short of rolling my eyes i provided the technical background and stated clearly that i was a persona nongrata already such that it would be highly unlikely that i would be given access to key mail servers that were well under the control of other political figures what struck me though with a modicum of awe was how he mention that if he could he would run as far away as possible  he called it defecting which was a weird word to use provided that we were still talking about a research institute and not a spy agency i remember i stumbled out of the door and made plans to leave the institute at the earliest of opportunities whilst also coming myself under crossfire of various political rivalry defecting  it is my conclusion as well as my own personal opinion just like the rest of this document that ifinhh is a cesspool of mixedup services wrought with inner political wrangling and is very far away from being a research institute i somewhat regret seeing some younger blood around there thinking how eventually they will end up disappointed being perhaps naive in thinking that ifinhh or eli for that matter has any future in romania whenever heads of departments talked about attracting youngsters i thought in my mind better not since romania is barely able to provide even the basic of necessities to its citizens lest contribute in any shape or form to research or bring grandiose plans to completion the mix of politics involvement of security services a seething government chasing wet dreams way above their pay grade and the countrys networth employees with multiple citizenships seeking to defect shady individuals with revisionist and cryptocommunist attitudes and the ever looming piles of garbage just growing and growing makes ifinhh a toxic workplace environment and dangerous place to work for and should be everyones last choice rather than the first,o47ipr

970,What job did you have that taught you how broken the system is?,as the title says   the job that taught me the bullshit of the broken system was my time as a production designerartist  it was my first job out of college  before i finished school  it required really fast drawing skills in adobe ai fast design decision making and much attention to detail our jobs basically required us to create designs for products coins pins patches and so on all the spec to be produced infinite customer revisions and the customer didnt pay a dime til they bought the product so they could literally just keep sending stuff in for years and never buy   as i worked there for roughly 34 years i quickly took notice to this cluster fuck job the pay was awful 1520hr no benefitstime offsick days of any kind super vague noncompete of two years  the company was set up like this big boss has many small companies all doing the same thing all staffed low to avoid benefits each company was ran by a family member  friend profit was split 5050 with them and the big boss  this literally paid them out  after taxes  400k a year and they did next to nothing bare basic customer service work customers just emailed us they boss would print out the email hand it to us we did all the work then they just priced it out  replied to a few basic questions and took the order thats it and they got a 50 commission on the order i got 15 for my work and they got all the profit  orders ranged from 25015k   i did the math while working one day if i made a shit commission of 510 off my work if every order was 250 my pay would have increased over 90k a year vs the 24k a year i was getting  rent for a studio apartment is like 1400   my suite had 3 people getting 400k a year another guy getting 200k and another at 90k the other 15 artist were being paid 15hr  we all sat in the same windowless room so we overheard these fucks constantly talking about spending their money they all had 200k sports cars one guy literally paid for his exes rent  i quit a year later just walked out and never looked back  they had to hire roughly 4 people to cover my basic workload,o4lqmu

974,About one young man apparently handed a sinecure who nonetheless found himself unable to handle the situation [Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber], about one young man apparently handed a sinecure who nonetheless found himself unable to handle the situation  i will begin with a story the following is the tale of a young man named eric whose first experience of the world of work was of a job that proved absolutely even comically pointless  gteric ive had many many awful jobs but the one that was undoubtedly pure liquid bullshit was my first professional job postgraduation a dozen years ago i was the first in my family to attend university and due to a profound navet about the purpose of higher education i somehow expected that it would open up vistas of hithertounforeseen opportunity   instead it offered graduate training schemes at pricewaterhousecoopers kpmg etc i preferred to sit on the dole for six months using my graduate library privileges to read french and russian novels before the dole forced me to attend an interview which sadly led to a job   that job involved working for a large design firm as its interface administrator the interface was a content management systeman intranet with a graphical user interface basicallydesigned to enable this companys work to be shared across its seven offices around the uk  eric soon discovered that he was hired only because of a communication problem in the organization in other words he was a duct taper the entire computer system was necessary only because the partners were unable to pick up the phone and coordinate with one another  gteric the firm was a partnership with each office managed by one partner all of them seem to have attended one of three private schools and the same design school the royal college of art being unbelievably competitive fortysomething public schoolboys they often tried to outcompete one another to win bids and on more than one occasion two different offices had found themselves arriving at the same clients office to pitch work and having to hastily combine their bids in the parking lot of some dismal business park the interface was designed to make the company supercollaborative across all of its offices to ensure that this and other myriad fuckups didnt happen again and my job was to help develop it run it and sell it to the staff  the problem was it soon became apparent that eric wasnt even really a duct taper he was a box ticker one partner had insisted on the project and rather than argue with him the others pretended to agree then they did everything in their power to make sure it didnt work  gteric i should have realized that this was one partners idea that no one else actually wanted to implement why else would they be paying a twentyoneyearold history graduate with no it experience to do this theyd bought the cheapest software they could find from a bunch of absolute crooks so it was buggy prone to crashing and looked like a windows 31 screen saver the entire workforce was paranoid that it was designed to monitor their productivity record their keystrokes or flag that they were torrenting porn on the company internet and so they wanted nothing to do with it as i had absolutely no background in coding or software development there was very little i could do to improve the thing so i was basically tasked with selling and managing a badly functioning unwanted turd after a few months i realized that there was very little for me to do at all most days aside from answer a few queries from confused designers wanting to know how to upload a file or search for someones email on the address book  the utter pointlessness of his situation soon led to subtleand then increasingly unsubtleacts of rebellion  gteric i started arriving late and leaving early i extended the company policy of a pint on friday lunchtime into pints every lunchtime i read novels at my desk i went out for lunchtime walks that lasted three hours i almost perfected my french reading ability sitting with my shoes off with a copy of le monde and a petit robert i tried to quit and my boss offered me a 2600 raise which i reluctantly accepted they needed me precisely because i didnt have the skills to implement something that they didnt want to implement and they were willing to pay to keep me perhaps one could paraphrase marxs economic and philosophical manuscripts of 1844 here to forestall their fears of alienation from their own labor they had to sacrifice me up to a greater alienation from potential human growth  as time went on eric became more and more flagrant in his defiance hoping he could find something he could do that might actually cause him to be fired he started showing up to work drunk and taking paid business trips for nonexistent meetings  gteric a colleague from the edinburgh office to whom i had poured out my woes when drunk at the annual general meeting started to arrange phony meetings with me once on a golf course near gleneagles me hacking at the turf in borrowed golf shoes two sizes too large after getting away with that i started arranging fictional meetings with people in the london office the firm would put me up in a nicotinecoated room in the st athans in bloomsbury and i would meet old london friends for some good oldfashioned allday drinking in soho pubs which often turned into allnight drinking in shoreditch more than once i returned to my office the following monday in last wednesdays work shirt id long since stopped shaving and by this point my hair looked like it was robbed from a zeppelin roadie i tried on two more occasions to quit but both times my boss offered me more cash by the end i was being paid a stupid sum for a job that at most involved me answering the phone twice a day i eventually broke down on the platform of bristol temple meads train station one late summers afternoon id always fancied seeing bristol and so i decided to visit the bristol office to look at user takeup i actually spent three days taking mdma at an anarchosyndicalist house party in st pauls and the dissociative comedown made me realize how profoundly upsetting it was to live in a state of utter purposelessness  after heroic efforts eric did finally manage to get himself replaced  gteric eventually responding to pressure my boss hired a junior fresh out of a computer science degree to see if some improvements could be made to our graphical user interface on this kids first day at work i wrote him a list of what needed to be doneand then immediately wrote my resignation letter which i posted under my bosss door when he took his next vacation surrendering my last paycheck over the telephone in lieu of the statutory notice period i flew that same week to morocco to do very little in the coastal town of essaouira when i came back i spent the next six months living in a squat growing my own vegetables on three acres of land i read your strike piece when it first came out it might have been a revelation for some that capitalism creates unnecessary jobs in order for the wheels to merely keep on turning but it wasnt to me  the remarkable thing about this story is that many would consider erics a dream job he was being paid good money to do nothing he was also almost completely unsupervised he was given respect and every opportunity to game the system yet despite all that it gradually destroyed him  why  to a large degree i think this is really a story about social class eric was a young man from a workingclass backgrounda child of factory workers no lessfresh out of college and full of expectations suddenly confronted with a jolting introduction to the real world reality in this instance consisted of the fact that a while middleaged executives can be counted on to simply assume that any twentysomething white male will be at least something of a computer whiz even if as in this case he had no computer training of any kind and b might even grant someone like eric a cushy situation if it suited their momentary purposes c they basically saw him as something of a joke which his job almost literally was his presence in the company was very close to a practical joke some designers were playing on one another  even more what drove eric crazy was the fact there was simply no way he could construe his job as serving any sort of purpose he couldnt even tell himself he was doing it to feed his family he didnt have one yet coming from a background where most people took pride in making maintaining and fixing things or anyway felt that was the sort of thing people should take pride in he had assumed that going to university and moving into the professional world would mean doing the same sorts of thing on a grander even more meaningful scale instead he ended up getting hired precisely for what he wasnt able to do he tried to just resign they kept offering him more money he tried to get himself fired they wouldnt fire him he tried to rub their faces in it to make himself a parody of what they seemed to think he was it didnt make the slightest bit of difference  to get a sense of what was really happening here let us imagine a second history majorwe can refer to him as antierica young man of a professional background but placed in exactly the same situation how might antieric have behaved differently well likely as not he would have played along with the charade instead of using phony business trips to practice forms of selfannihilation antieric would have used them to accumulate social capital connections that would eventually allow him to move on to better things he would have treated the job as a steppingstone and this very project of professional advancement would have given him a sense of purpose but such attitudes and dispositions dont come naturally children from professional backgrounds are taught to think like that from an early age eric who had not been trained to act and think this way couldnt bring himself to do it as a result he ended up for a time at least in a squat growing

983,Interesting Lie Told to me by a Mass Chain Coffee Shop Employee,my fave drink is currently temporarily discontinued at a certain coffee shop im sure you all know   the guys that work there where ive been buying this drink for a long time said to me one day bad news theres not going to be any more coming in for a few weeks  i said nooooooo but wait why  the guys said it was due to covid that there arent gonna be any deliveries for a few weeks which is kinda weird considering there were no problems during the past year so i asked for another excuse they told me that they might be changing the recipes then they said they ran out of certain products   come on seriously who actually doesnt believe this has 100 to do with the fact they probably dont have people there to manufacture this crap and probably dont have any truck drivers available to deliver this shit to stores in certain regions   meanwhile this chain has produced commercials to be played nonstop specifically advertising all the cool refreshing drinks they are out of for probably the majority of summer   go into one of these shops and try asking them why theyre out of half their menu youll either get one of the excuses i got or maybe some new ones i also find it sad i think all these employees actually buy this shit theyre being fed by management lame ass excuses to cover up the fact nobody wants to work for their company either   im seeing people posting pictures of completely empty aisles in stores like target walmart grocery stores its a bit scary but at the same time i kinda feel good about it we all know that many people in this country have had it and an actual effort is being made to turn the tables on employers and as a result there is literally no stock in retail stores coffee shops have no fucking coffee restaurants are closing half the week or totally   ive been acting pretty lackadaisical on the job and simply dont care who doesnt like it  after all im one of the only people they still have in there and it feels good to have so much less stress so much more freedom to call the shots in my own life i hope its a trend that gets bigger   maybe ill even get a raise for it,o3zto6

988,What does antiwork think about fluoride?,fluoride theories have always been shut down by everyone around me as a crazy conspiracy but i have done research papers about fluoride in my neuroscience classes and found good evidence that it floods your brain cells and makes them perform improperly its not exactly understood what the overall impact is on us but its definitely not good the way it effects our brain cells it is classified as a neurotoxin in many parts of the world  i know people will claim that its natural and we used to get it from spring water that is true but the fluoride in our tooth paste and drinking water is synthetic its not the same also its difficult to control how much fluoride you consume because its just put in the water without your consent   people claim that fluoride makes us more docile and more susceptible to influence and persuasion i saw a post on here today talking about how he feels like everyone looks at him crazy when he talks antiwork do you think that fluoride theories have any legitimacy or are they are all nonsense crazy lunatic conspiracies is it a good thing that we have no choice but to drink fluoride and have no control over how much  i remember years ago i saw a bunch of news stations warning about not using fluoride they were talking about how fluoride free toothpastes were the best sellers on amazon the whole fluoride is good for your teeth is about as valid as milk is good for strong bones theyre just lies told to us by lobbyist to sell their products but thats just my opinion whats yours,o4kvpk
989,I never believed in UBI until the pandemic. Now I see that it is the key to a genuinely free and fair market.,i still dont support 15hr minimum wage or any minimum wage for that matter but ubi imo has been now experimented in the usa for over a year unemployment via covid and its done what minimum wage never could given people the freedom to choose  with ubi every human being in the country would have a choice between employers businesses usually think of competition as between other businesses onlywhich means maximize profits at all costs  but ubi introduces a new kind of competition competition for employees no matter how menial or unskilled the labor you need is youre forced to compete with ubi to offer compensation which means you may need to reassess your business model   imagine being able to tell an employer that 15hr is garbage for what they want when you could earn 13hr by sitting on your butt or doing whatever you want  in short its an unexplored  avenue for ensuring a more free and equal opportunity market and the businesses that adapt will succeed and those who dont will failand theyll go down kicking and screaming about how it isnt fair that they cant hire legal slaves anymore,o3zzi5

1027,Working fulltime in a meaningless job and living frugally relying on a 401K/retirement to live more comfortably when you’re old is a WASTE OF LIFE.,ok to be perfectly honest its entirely possible that this idea may actually be popular and people simply pretend that working for retirement is great simply because they have to and its just slightly less painful to lie to yourself and pretend that its a great life  am i saying that saving and planning for retirement isnt important not at all i simply dont care about it because im 25 and been missing out on life im talking about things that most people experience even without makinghaving a lot of money but being rich would guarantee i could experience and enjoy these things sure you may be open to a flood of gold diggers and fake friends but on the poor end you cant even really afford yes literally to take those chances  advice like live below your means is common live in a ruralremote area or the dangerous part of the city buy second hand clothes have a flip phone really dumb because a lot of jobs expect you to have an iphone or android smartphone now and you cant even get an uber ride to get home or go to work without a smartphone eat only ramenricebeans and tell yourself that youre still better off than people in third world countries so its selfish and greedy to desire more in life american dream and that sht  living below your means is simply sometimes necessary for survival but living so bare minimum your entire life working and waiting for retirement one youre wasting your entire life and two plenty of elderly cant even survive and are still working or have to go back to being a dry cookcashierjanitor the jobs that might as well be automated because they dont pay a living wage and the work itself serves no meaningful purpose the entire point of working is so you can live since were brought into this world without our consent and were only worthy of survivaldecent comfort if we not only work but have skills that can make the rich even richer  no skills or skills that are more hobby basedfreelancing and will likely only be able to generate a living income if youre the best of the best in your niche then youre worthless to society you dont deserve to live  you see the problem is that modern societycivilization is incompatible with naturebiologyevolution when humans created modern societycivilization it did do a lot of good for a lot of people but it also just threw everything out of balance causing new chaos  at this point the only solution is to keep progressing advance and automate technology as much as fcking possible not suppress it just to keep these worthless jobs that arent supposed to pay a living wage anyway and keep religion the fcking h3ll out of the government and politics you right wing extremists yes going too far left can be dangerous too im not denying that both sides can suck keep ruining everything and preventing true progress from occurring like keeping prostitution illegal and unregulated and keeping healthcare behind a very expensive paywall  this whole gmeamcmeme stock thing is taking wealth back from the 1 as should happen be careful and dont invest money you cant afford to lose though its a slippery slope like gambling   nobody should be so desperate that they have to resort to gambling risking the little they do have for the chance not guarantee at escaping povertyabusive householdsrelationshipsemployers or just to be able to afford lifesaving surgery or medication that they need and hopefully getting enough money on gofundme  does anybody even care to hear what i have to say am i just stupid lazy entitled or even outright delusional  i like to think that im woke at least a lot more than most people are  drops mic lol friday night funkin reference,o3vog8

1128,Going through the motions again..,hey all so i just moved to a new city and possibly landed a new job so exciting i know its waitressing at a local pub and i have never done this before so if anyone with experience would like to share their stories id love to hear   anyways i had a sort of trial shift yesterday and im not sure how it went my overall impression of the job is that its somewhat degrading and soul sucking im encouraged to flirt with customers for tips dress sexy gotta deal with obnoxious people drinking and the girl i was shadowing was running around constantly and barely had 5 mins to even take a piss do i want this to be me maybe theres a reason i stayed away from serving other than the fact no one ever aspires to do that i went to trade school originally and im fed up with that shit too   what put me off was how they had me come in at 9am didnt even say how long my shift would be or if i should bring a lunch etc do they even have a staff room who knows so i was anxious the night before and hardly slept and anxious in the morning so i didnt eat i threw up when i finally got home just from stress i have been pretty isolated during the pandemic so it was quite overwhelming to be interacting with so many people and having everyone stare at the new girl i have some social anxiety so i push myself into it sometimes but i just wanted to die when i was there   so as soon as i ask how long my shift is the guy goes why there somewhere else you gotta be and i said that i have a right to know so i can be prepared and take care of myself etc and i just have a right to know how much of my time i have to give up to you before getting back to my life and i was pissed like fuck off none of your business for one and two yah i got a million places id rather be than here i only thought the last part in my head lol im in my 30s been working since like ten with paper route and babysitting then steadily working since 15 im fucking burnt out i just need money dont expect me to kiss ass they probably saw that as a negative thing like im not super stoked to be there we will see if they call back   thanks for listening to my rant guys i love you all in this community and i hope we can fucking change something someday,o2j2zq

1133,Just sharing that I quit my job and some of my own perspective on working.,i quit my contractor job paying 20hour this rate may seem pretty good for some of you but i live in a major city and the the taxes on contract work is crazy high i basically make a few dollars more than a mcdonalds worker where i live previously i was making 32hour as a web developer but that job burnt me out so bad and the commute was a 3 hour total every day which was why i pivoted my career and starting working from home with my contractor job basically i had decent paying jobs throughout my life and comfortable environment i had the privilege of not having to suffer at a amazon facility and peeing in a bottle with no breaks or flipping burgers and having crazy people throw nuggets at me yet i am still on this subreddit because i think something is not right with working the way we do  for some background i am not white or living in the suburbs i am a brown asian whos parents fled here from a thirdworld country and i grew up in a gang infested neighborhood i busted my ass to get myself in the corporate world and it fucking sucks ever since i started working there is no time for creativity art or working on your own projects or living your life you are not free you are a corporate slave this is not a life any of us wants to live my biggest accomplishments in life happened when i was unemployed and had mental time to think freely and make things  ampx200b  some of my accomplishments when i was unemployed   wrote a javascript tutorial article which blew up to monthly thousands of views for some time   went to new york on my own savings after i quit my previous job and wrote an article about my experience which also blew up and gained thousands of views   got super fit and was the top post on rbrogress for a few weeks when i posted my before and after pics   i made a few youtube videos on web development which broke above 1000 views each consistently whenever i uploaded   i made electronic music and shared them on the internet with positive feedback   i was able to breathe and get 810 hours of sleep everyday  unfortunately my savings did run out and i had to get another job which is the one i am currently working until my last day next week  none of these accomplishments would have been possible if i never quit the jobs i held and i was employed there is simply no time for these things most of these accomplishments happened during odd hours like 35am because my mind gets creative at odd hours i uploaded videos wrote articles made music and created posts always after 12am midnight when im employed my brain becomes mush and i just become  demotivated and it feels like im on a drug that just numbs my whole life down like a creative person that jumps on ritalin or something on top of this it is impossible for me to pretend like i care about a company so many people at work act as if the company is their life and then weeks later they vanish either from being fired or they just jump ship and go to another company its all fake and im not a great actor im never a culture fit at my jobs im just the quiet dude that gets work done hopefully one day we all find a way to get our bills paid for without having to slave away our time its possible we just have to find our own path to get there,o2gv18

1139,worker co-ops doesn't fix any issue with capitalism,the issue with the capitalistic system is not really companies taking advantage of workers the issue is special interest groups and corporation getting benefits for themselves at the expense of the larger society   the worker coop model is problematic since then the people building up the company will not have proper ownership over it the people who build up the company will not really be rewarded for it httpsvintologicomthreadsfinance890post5297httpsvintologicomthreadsfinance890post5297  getting stock ownership when working on a company can work out very well see facebook but often it will not work out too well since most startups fail   being a partowner in the company you work for exposes yourself to double risk since then if they company fail you both lose a big chunk of your savings and your job furthermore often the owners of a company have to keep eating up losses hoping it will eventually become profitable,o2l1u6

1167,"You don't even buy a house anymore, you are competing in a sealed bid auction.",gt a sealedbid auction is a type of auction process in which all bidders simultaneously submit sealed bids to the auctioneer so that no bidder knows how much the other auction participants have bid  the highest bidder is usually declared the winner of the bidding process   weird when a home has 10 offers all at the sellers disposal then you really arent even purchasing a home you are having a sealed bid auction and higher offers due to fomo are increasing home values which to me is going to lead to a crash  honestly i dont even think there is a shortage of homes instead of one person making one offer on one house you have 10 people making an offer on 10 houses and 100 offers makes it look like there is more people trying to buy than there actually is,o2bxwe

1208,Honest Review of my old McDonalds job,appreciate the downvotes good to know people support corporations treating employees like slaves i posted this to indeed by the way  i worked at mcdonalds for a month before i voluntarily quit over the phone the training was very barebones they had you sit infront of a very old and dilapidated pc and made you go through basic legaleseosha stuff as well as very basic rudimentary ways of operating the equipment i should have took this as a sign to leave earlier  no overtime they choose your hours and you cant even take a photo of the schedule you have to call and ask what time you come in you will be overworked and underpaid  the real training they had you do was nonexistent because there was no real training you are literally dropped right into the heat of battle mostly clueless and guided by another employee who isnt even a trainer just another long time employee there all they do is demonstrate how to do the tasks a couple times then they expect you do mimick that perfectly then they get mad if you mess up or ask for details the person training me barely spoke english so there was a huge language barrier and i couldnt even ask a question  the term crew member is vague as depending on the day theyll have you either doing 1 thing or literally everything drive thru cashier grill etc given the option of either cashier or grill at the time i applied the existing employees there saw i was new and immediately used that to assign me as the person to operate the grill and putting the food in the holding cabinets which is the dirtiest hardest and fastestpaced part of the job some days its very slow and other days you just cannot keep up everyone else got to do the easier work while they shirked the harder responsibilities onto me i was the only employee out of all of them to be forced to take out the trash and clean the floorsgrill grease trough as well sometimes if someone more experienced is not there that day you have to take their place ie putting together the sandwiches and wrapping them up on top of the work i already have to do i explained earlier  in my particular case because of the work i was assigned i had to walk in and out of the walk in freezer a lot and sometimes you will have to take out several heavy boxes at once and be in there for extended periods and despite that theres no point in putting a layer on to warm up because as soon as you walk out of the freezer the rest of the floor is staggeringly hot from the heat being output from the grills  management has no respect or value for their employees in the slightest bit  if you look new naive or like a pushover they will take advantage and you will be treated like a slave several times there have been situations where one manager will tell me to do one thing then as i am doing that thing another manager will ask me do do another thing while i am already in the middle of doing the first thing then the other manager will tell me to do another thing until you get to the point where you forget the first task you were supposed to do  you get 2 10 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch which is never enough time sometimes youll be standing hours on end and your feet will be sore sometimes you will be lifting for hours on end every day was different and unpredictable and i dreaded going every time  overall i outright felt like a slave working there and nobody should have to put up with what i put up with please have dignity please have selfrespect  do not work here this job impacted my mental health greatly and has forever tainted my perception of what an actual good job should be,o2a8k7

1224,Work won yesterday (again),i work from home full time currently and have done for the last year or so i woke up yesterday at my normal time having had an horrendous dream where i witnessed something very traumatic my alarm woke me up before what happened in my dream was resolved so i was very disoriented when i woke up and actually in some distress crying at what id seen and so shaken i went to the toilet and was retching for about five minutes i wont go into detail about the dream its not ptsd as what happened didnt happen and cant happen now in reality  i considered taking a sick day but knew i had a couple of meetings i needed to attend and some work i was supposed to catch up on due to us being very short staffed like a fool i logged in but struggled to concentrate during the first few hours so didnt get much done i attended the meetings as normal and barely contributed all i could think about was why the fuck have i worked today it got to around the time i go for lunch and i received an email advising i had been unsuccessful in a job application for an internal vacancy in another department i was still shaken so it barely registered  when i went for a walk at lunch to clear my head i realised id been an utter fool realising i cant control what i cant influence and ive been stupid worrying about the impact that missing one day of work would have on my workload i shouldnt have much to complaint about im reasonably fit and healthy and in a job i actually find interesting but should pay better the job application was only really for doing a similar role with a bit more responsibility for more money its not what i want to do longterm which is teaching so i wasnt really disappointed about not getting it  my problem is self inflicted im pushing myself hard for work  ive used one years leave allowance over almost two years but work couldnt care less about me im just another person with a staff number i live on my own so have been almost ever present online during covid and work know ill just get on with whatever im given  no more im taking leave and when i come back im no longer taking extra cases or volunteering for projects to help out im making the most of flexible working and building in a couple of hour long breaks in the day with a workout rather than working long days to get stuff done and building up flexitime to not use for months on end  my work will be working on me,o2f8vj

1235,There's a system in Germany wherein employees have the right thru the works constitution act to elect fellow employees into a works council that has right of co-determination in a bunch of matters. Sad that this doesn't exist pretty much anywhere else in this format.,in germany codetermination at establishment corporate level refers to the representation of employees of one company in relation to their employer the employee representatives who are elected by the staff have participation and codetermination rights in the employers decisions forms of codetermination at establishment level include   rights to information   rights to be consulted   rights to give advice   rights of veto   rights of initiative and   codetermination rights  german employee representatives participate in decisionmaking  todetermination at corporate level is a comparatively powerful instrument in the possession of the elected employee representatives because the employer and the employee representatives have the right to decide at equal level within the  statutory limits socalled principle of positive consensus  a decision taken by the employer without the compulsory participation of employee representatives for example may be legally ineffective and hence incapable of effectively shaping the legal relationship with the employees socalled theory of conditional effectiveness according to which the effectiveness of any measures taken by the employer is conditional upon the  implementation of codetermination rights  in an extreme case the employee representatives could in fact paralyze a business unit in germany eg by objections to the work  schedule prepared by the employer ,o2smaj

1292,Guilt over 2 weeks: what is wrong with me?,let me start this off with saying that it is mainly the clients and understaffing but otherwise i really enjoy my workplace and coworkers but this job is draining me is so many ways i am at the point where i lose sleep to the anxiety i have with this job  this is an it company and i am the help desk dispatcher i am highly praised and i feel like i really was foundational for the team ive been here for less than a year but i not only coordinate technician appointments their communication large scale projects technicianclient questions or concerns as well as ticket inputmanagement manually my responsibilities grew because a majority of my peers will not handle these responsibilities   the manager for the team does not manage the team at all he just advises on their ticket and thats if i put these issues directly in front of him morning meetings are buddy sessions and otherwise he is handling lvl 1 techs because he doesnt have the spine to demand more employees ive been demanding for our superiors to get more employees further management but because they are all buddies nothing is done similar aspects for the project manager  i honestly like them all as individuals and i had been communicating for months all of the shortcomings of my team but it doesnt go anywhere only recently has it started gaining traction our clients walk all over us with their demands and my already understaffed technician team can not only keep up but then put their frustrations on to me finally ive put in my two weeks and now everyone is upset with me i want to cry because of how frustrating this situation is but because the ceo far removed from the real labor and work my team puts in has prioritized growing this company and profits   i know internally that i shouldnt feel guilty i need to prioritize my mental health and wellbeing but i still feel like somehow i made a mistake i know i want to go but i feel so guilty im thinking of recanting my 2 weeks i have savings for a few months but my family did chastise me for not jumping into another job immedietly   i would appreciate any wake up calls and positive words from others who have learned to shake off the work guilt thank you for going through this rant with me as well already feeling better just stating this all out,o1bpop

1296,I’m not a slave to my debt,i went to grad school almost 10 years ago and i have six figure debt i dont want to sacrifice my life at work and kill myself to pay off this debt   i feel like im the only one among friends acquaintances and others in my field that is not living to pay off student loan debt and thus not letting this stupid number define me  that stupid number on a screen doesnt mean anything to me its not real i dont get why that intangible number dictates peoples lives in such a strong way  one of my friends is proud of the fact that she works a full time job and has a weekend per diem job to make more money she has worked 14 days in a row before no thanks shes way closer in paying off her loans than i am but idfaf a single fuck like i said it doesnt mean anything to me  i dont know if this is naive of me but i feel like im watching all the people mentioned above on a conveyor belt to work their life away just to get rid of that number  does anyone else think similarly to me in this regard is anyone else not willing to be a slave to work just to erase a number in 30 years time that at the end of it all no one thinks to themselves on their death bed man im glad i worked so many hours to pay off my loans,o1om20

1308,My desk job is slowly destroying my soul (and my body),ive been working a sedentary desk job for three years this august i worked retail before this job for 25 years and while i had some issues with lower leg pain from standing stationary for several hours a day its nothing compared to this job   when we were still in the office i experienced migraines headaches and eye strain on an almost daily basis it was a combination of staring at a bright computer screen along with the ugly unflattering fluorescent strip lights then we were sent to work from home because of covid and because it was unexpected i had to do a makeshift setup at my dining room table it worked okay for a couple months and then i started to experience lower back pain to the point where it was difficult to walk without a limp i switched out the dining room chair for an office chair and it improved a bit  by that point my roommate had moved out so i was able to make her old bedroom into my office space was able to get a legit desk and make the set up a little more comfortable again for a while i felt a bit better but fast forward one year the headaches improved because i could keep my house darker than the office   i am now having some sort of neck or back pain on a daily basis i get headaches and migraines and eye strain almost constantly i feel much better on the weekends and it comes back almost immediately on monday morning i gained a ton of weight last year but so far this year im down 15 lbs   things i am doing to try and alleviate it again adjusted my set up so its perfectly ergonomic according to articles online wear a posture harness thing to make sure i dont slouch wear blue light blocking glasses i dont wear glasses normally so it hurts my ears and getting up from my desk once an hour to stretch and walk around im on the phone for 9 hours a day and the headset hurts my ears and the constant audio exacerbates the headaches   ive been sitting at my desk for less than an hour this morning and im already nauseous from a brewing migraine   were simply not built to sit or do any sort of highly repetitive movements for 40 hours a week were meant to be doing a variety of activities each day after 3 years of working this job im at the point where i almost cant physically do it anymore and im only in my mid20s im looking into jobs that are a mixture of sedentary and physical work so i can get a variety of movement into my day but its hard,o1w77m

1361,"Rate of pay shouldn't just be about ""skill level.""",rate of pay should take into consideration the amount of stress that workers take on this should be based on social factors in regards to customer interactions and interpersonal relationships between coworkers im more so thinking of customer interactions as they can be far more stressful and labor inducing than that of dealing with coworkers  the higher up you go in a job setting the less work those people have to actually do those jobs are to mainly check that the work the people below them is correct they often time get upset if they find an error and spend more time reprimanding a mistake that doesnt usually occur than just fixing it it takes away from their free time of sitting around and talking to other people on their level about nonwork stuff  anyone can learn a set of skills some sets are bigger and some sets take longer to learn however there is a skill of learning to deal with social factors which is neglected and should be part of pay consideration,o1sl10

1485,Learned The Hard Way About “Hard Work Pays Off” By Devaluing My Worth,hello folks although hard work can pay off when it comes to the corporatejob world thats not so true however it can pay off if were talking about personal goals that youre working hard to accomplish  i used to work my ass off waking up 450 am working 1213 hours working two jobs at the same time etc unfortunately i was a gullible teen off of high school who had not experienced reality yet      right out of high school at 17 literally the day i graduated i moved and went to work in roofing the next day we would work 67 days and would work up to 13 hour days at times pretty hard brutal work i might add however i did gain useful skills for future use from this     the people i worked with highly encouraged hard work and kept pushing and pushing more and more upon me at some point i had become the best worker and a jack of all trades in my field i had learned how to do everything but i had the working force of 3 men due to the fact i was always being pressured to work harder i tried to become quicker and stronger to shine above the rest i could lay out roofing shingles for three guys at once remove a roof at the speed of three workers so on and so forth     my hard work did not pay off however and i never got a raise and i was never allowed to move up even though i had learned to do everything and faster and quicker than everyone else and more efficient they realized moving me up to a shingle roofer position would cost them more money of course i did shingle roof sometimes but my main job was every job removing the old roof removing old nails cleaning up gutters and ground putting the new shingles on top putting the new roof on putting all work tools up and packing us up meanwhile everyone elses job was to remove the roof and put the roof on and they were being paid more     my coworkers were being paid more even though i done their jobs and more work too but i was being paid less even when i asked for a raise multiple times i was refused      after working in roofing for almost three years i left and moved into my own place i did not realize moving would cost so much and now i had to work two jobs to make up expenses so i worked as a mattress deliverer for a company and at the amazon fullfilment center at the same time i was working seven days straight with no days off which when compared to 6 days a week in roofing is not so bad when i first thought of it      i would constantly work hard and try to over achieve at both amazon and the mattress company for months without a single off day however nothing good would come from this it was now about 4 months without a single off day and i had not even a single raise from all my hard work and i was perplexeddid my hard work not pay off       i suffered from being anorexic from losing so much weight from working 4 months straight and working out that i essentially quit both jobs to try to recover from it during this time i turned to gig work and came across the reality of companies fortunatelyat this point i had spent three years of my life with almost no off days working my ass off and over achieving and all i got in return were thank yous and youre a hard worker no raises and being extorted by being given more work    all my life i had been taught the lie about hard work pays off and companies will notice oh yes they did notice but guess what all they did was thank meessentially me doing more work for less money essentially lowered my value as a worker in the workforce which is ducking depressing for me to realizeover time i started to realize that time is valuable and living the life you want to live should come first i shouldnt have to work my ass off until im 60 which i may add is about the average life expectancy in america just so i can retirethese companies really want us to work until the average life expectancy in america until we should retireessentially they want us to literally work to death or the life expectancy we are expected to die how the hell can i go on working 6080 hour weeks knowing were in a cycle of working to the average life expectancy in america that literally shows how much value is put on our lives here    of course i still work however i do gig work currently and plan on staying that way to make more time for myself i truly value my life but i can not believe i really wasted the first three years of my life after high school being extorted by the systemin turn devaluing myself as a workerwork hard but only work hard if its to a personal goalthese companies will make you feel like you should be ashamed if you dont want to over work yourself to meet a companys goalbut in the end is meeting their goal really beneficial for your future     tldr  have you ever heard of the statement hard work pays off of course you have  unfortunately i had to learn the hard way about this and learned that hard work only pays off towards a personal goal  i was a fooli went to work the day after graduationworking 1213 hour days for nearly 6 days a week at my first job in roofing i learned to do every part of the job even better and quicker and more efficient than the ones who i worked with unfortunately they handed me more work and pressured me to work harder which i complied with and became a three man work force in oneeven though i had to do more work than anyone else in my job they refused to move me up and pay me more as it would save them money to just have me do everyones jobs  after working in roofing for three years i moved and upon moving worked two jobs at once 7 days a week at amazon and a mattress company i worked my ass off and did not take a day off for nearly four monthsi ended up becoming anorexic and had to learn the hard way that all my hard work got me no raises and actually devalued my worth as a worker,o0x64m

1542,At the intersection of Antiwork and Collapse,ive been thinking a lot of this  these days it feels less like we are a species on the verge of some great awakening or social movement and more like a species at end of life in desperate need of hospice care  any widespread faith in the system is dead what is left are people who are simply going through motions because it is what they are familiar with  this is a common response to natural disasters and wars survivors will still attempt to go through the motions of their daily lives even as everything falls apart around them  the rhetoric around labor in the first world has shifted starkly away from hopeful planning for the future to how to exist as comfortably as possible for as long as possible  this is a key symptom that should be familiar to anyone who has gone through depression  the bleakness of ones life obscures the potentialities of that persons life they no longer have the energy or vigor to plan long term  when we experience this as a species however it probably is no longer the irrational pathology that therapists and doctors will be able to pull us out from  it is the true form of the world through sober eyes  work always sucked but generations of people pushed through it to be able to see some kind of net benefit in their life it was a potential for the future that would motivate them through the monotony of work  this generational hopelessness is widespread and it really is not even irrational  you could shut up and follow the rules and get your degrees or invest properly or work for yourself you could get it right in whatever that means in your worldview and die in a pandemic or a blizzard  you could just lose it and the delusion of keeping it accumulating it being able to pass it on to your family or those you care about is fading fast  people may gaslight you and keep calling it depression but its only really treatable depression if it is founded on an irrational reality  a lot of people are anti work because there is not even the potentiality for any flourishing anymore  that fluorishing is important because there is no point to work without being able to build up something greater it is only wasted effort it is only survival that could be better spent on just surviving  food is exploding in price the very idea that capital or money could keep you from being starved or cold or healthy is shattering  there are millions of people looking for the way out through investments or businesses but it is becoming wasted effort and even if it worked it would only hasten the fall  even if you become one of the 0001 that could afford a bunker when the time comes you will starve within a year once the climate catastrophies that wipe out the other 999999 hit  do you or anyone around you have any hope for the future  do any of us have actual plans or are we all just squirrels stockpiling nuts for a winter that might never end,nzltvx

and grow seeds of all the variety of plants it is honestly the only solution i can think of to get people out of the system and becoming less dependent on capitalism i have created rseedsociety for people to share information on how to transition to this lifestyle   seeds seeing everyone eat disrupts society  i could go on a huge rant about how this would literally solve all of the worlds problems but i have more to say and i will save that for anyone interested  i realize that this is not an instant solution i realize that not everyone has the means to grow their own food i realize that not everyone wants to spend their life gardening   earth loves all  i have come up with a movement called earth loves all basically the movement is about spreading awareness and doesnt attempt to motivate people to do anything  the idea is that the earth provides us with all of the resources that we need and we should not be forced to work for them because resourciopaths sociopaths that hoard resources a word i made up created a society that strips us of everything and make us compete for basic necessities  the earth loves all phrase was thought up to be an incomplete sentence on purpose it could become earth loves all africans or any other group humans create groups through instinct and i wanted to create a group that encompasses all people the one thing everyone has in common is that we live on the earth  so now that i explained the name let me explain what earth loves all supports believe in   the earth is our home and we should not destroy it in fact we should actively rebuild the earth  all humans have a right to food housing healthcare and education  thats it it seems simple but for some reason humans have been developing advanced civilizations for thousands of years and yet most people are forced to work their entire lives  i have created rearthlovesall which actually got up to 100 members very quickly it is not active but please go there and start posting memes ideas and rants i also have a website earthlovesallcomhttpswwwearthlovesallcom that i have not put anything on if you are interested go ahead and write up an article and send it to me at moneylovesmiserygmailcommailtomoneylovesmiserygmailcom i will post it onto the website if i think it supports the movement   about me  i dont know if you care but if you read this far maybe you do i am just a guy who has been passionate about trying to solve mental health issues for the past 10 years i have a degree in psychology with a minor in sociology i am an advocate for psychedelics because psilocybin mushrooms cured my depression i have been poor my whole life and i have even lived in my car for 6 months before i make all of my money through the internet by teaching english and doing other random things like testing apps and websites i want to find a way to spend my time making a difference in peoples lives and influencing humanity in a way that stop destroying the earth and actively relieves people of all possible misfortunes  im thinking that the best way for me to have an influence is by using social media i have a youtube channelhttpswwwyoutubecomchannelucnk9jkoxt6xvhkggfrvvfywfeatured that you can check out and see my face if you want i havent used social media since around 2014 but ive made profiles on twitter instagram facebook pinterest and tiktok that you can follow by searching psilipijiphili i hate social media but i think its the best way to reach people  tldr rseedsociety is a new community that will help people learn how to use seeds to become less dependent on capitalism rearthlovesall is an awareness movement that aims to stop destroying the earth and ensure that all people have food housing healthcare and education rantiwork has 330k members and we can come together to make a change memes are fun but we can do more,nyczx7

1848,Why I Quit My Job and Became Anti-Work,i just recently discovered antiwork and im glad to surround myself with people that feel the same way i do about living to work i have a life story to tell about how ive grown increasingly antiwork  in 2017 i was laid off because the company i worked for eliminated my position due to downsizing fortunately i just accepted a creative services director position for a local tv station within the same week of my termination i negotiated a pay rate that doubled my previous pay so i was very happy and thankful i thought life was sweet because i had a higher paying job and my family could settle down in a new place and lay some roots the downside we would be moving out of state with no family or friends nearby it was just my wife and two kids ages three and one we were fortunate enough for my wife to stay home with the kids while i worked the job was stressful fast paced and i was constantly working under pressure to meet deadlines i was struggling internally i felt alone because i worked all day and was missing out on spending time with my family i was missing watching my kids grow my wife helped me feel better by sending videos and pictures of her and the kids it was a sad reality knowing my family was literally down the street but i felt so far away because im stuck in an office for at least 9 hours a day sometimes i would cry in the bathroom because i missed my family and i felt like i was missing out on so much the pictures brought me joy and happiness but i felt saddened too knowing my family is without me i had to push my feelings aside because we lived off a single family income so i grudged along this went on for three years until i finally quit  more of that later   my wife and i added a new addition to our family late 2018 she had a difficult pregnancy and raised the family alone a majority of the time because i was working to save pto for my sons birth my absence was very hard on our relationship we had no help from family or friends and i was juggling a worklife balance i regretted leaving her alone while she battled severe morning sickness but i didnt know what else to do because we lived on a single family income some days i would sneak out of work to come home but i couldnt keep this up because i eventually got caught my gm told me i needed to figure out my worklife balance better giving me a stern warning that disciplinary action would be taken if didnt figure it out these words came from a man that put his work before family living hours away in another state separate from them theres no way he would have compassion for my situation its always about the bottom line and whats best for the company paid parental leave is nonexistent in america so i ended up using the remaining pto i had to care for my wife and kids after my son was born my wife almost died in the hospital from birth complications because she became septic thankfully she recovered and we were discharged after 5 days in the hospital she needed help even more now but i had to return to work because i used up all of my pto i wish i could have stayed home to help and care for my wife and kids i think its disgusting that paid parental leave is not required by law its sad to think that puppies can not be separated from their mother no sooner than six weeks yet in america its ok for women to go back to work two weeks after giving birth she had to do it alone again this time with a newborn with colic my wife and i began fighting more frequently now because we were tired stressed out parents eventually things got better for us as we developed a new routine and she recovered postpartum  its now 2020 and started the year off with a new gm another boss that puts work before family theres an annual company trip to vegas and i wouldnt be able to make it because my son has a rare medical condition that requires special treatment at cincinnati childrens hospital its a trek a 7 hour drive oneway its important to keep the scheduled visit because the hospitals schedule is always full and rescheduling can be a nightmare i told my gm i would not be able to make the company trip because his medical appointment conflicts with the scheduled company trip she told me that my attendance is mandatory and if i declined to go her boss will get involved i viewed this as a threat so i walked away wondering how i will make this work thankfully the trip was canceled because of covid19   i always rallied for promoting good and safe health precautions when covid19 began and thats also when the issues became worse my gm told me that it was a democratic agenda and there would be no action taken for health and safety precautionsmy wife became sick with covid19 symptoms on march 31st and her doctor ordered us to isolate at home for 14 days my gm would not allow me to quarantine so i used pto for the first part of the isolation at that point someone close to me made an anonymous call to the gms boss which resulted in my gm calling me a few hours later to tell me to stay home per cdc guidelines every morning afternoon and end of my work day the gm would call wanting updates on my wife as well as my children she then asked for medical records for my family and when i said no i was contacted by hr gm and the corporate hr they told me that if i dont provide my families medical records they would contact their doctors and the health department to obtain thembecause i said no considering i dont have access to my wifes personal medical information my gm said that i had to break quarantine and come back i show up at work ready to social distance and ended up leaving again because my baby became sick living in east tennessee the healthcare is very poor we always had problems with inadequate care and negligence we packed the family in the sedan and drove four hours away to kentucky ill never forget that moment driving 100 mph down the interstate with my hazards on as i looked over at my wife in the passenger seat holding my son for dear life as he had trouble breathing and his fever spiking to 104 we rushed him to the er and the medical staff saved him they tested him for covid19 but the results came back inconclusive because they could not get a good sample up his nose the er doctor diagnosed him with covid19 and discharged us ordering us to quarantine i was forced to use pto again and still could not work from home while under quarantine i ran out of sick time and had to go back to work because my gm did not approve working from home   i was in my office when another employee came to me and asked for help outside of my department and nothing that i am required to do within my job and i said i couldnt as my baby is being treated for covid19 and i am supposed to isolate the employee asked the gm why i wasnt allowed to quarantine and the gm brought myself and hr in and yelled at me saying i will not self isolate and that i am getting my office taken away and will work around my staff i am the only department head without an office now and felt like i was retaliated against the gm said she will determine when and if i need to self isolate and she said verbatim that i was crying wolf over my baby she said she does not think anyone is sick and that i need to stop isolating unless she tells me to go get tested immediately following that i submitted fmla papers and a couple hours after doing so i was written up for not working while using my sick time my fmla request was ignored and it had been a week or more before hr finally approved it  my gms intentions were to drive me away because i was a strong advocate for workplace safety and following cdc guidelines she wrote me up two more times gave me a bad review and was constantly nagging me about work i had enough and on july 2020 i quit my job and walked out it was a liberating feeling   we moved back to kentucky and are now surrounded by friends and family im  working a different job and dont make near as much money but that doesnt matter because family is more important than wasting away for a job that doesnt care for the well being of its employees i find work culture and hustling to be very toxic especially in america i take no pride in working my ass off at the expense of losing out on enjoying life and missing familyfriends time if i could change things i wish i didnt take the job in tennessee but i didnt know what else to do since i was laid off with no safety net my wife was so strong through it all and continues to be the best wife and best mother for our family i couldnt ask for more because she continues to amaze me everyday i am blessed to have her in my life   i wish there were better workplace laws in america like paid parental leave higher minimum wage and healthy severance for termination also it would be nice if employers would provide more pto for its employees its a disgusting rat race and ive become jaded about society rewarding people for living to work anyway family always comes first and dont work for assholes,nxhwsi

1870,I have a friend who is being hopelessly exploited and its heartbreaking to watch.,so as ive posted on here before i used to work for a horrific company that absolutely took advantage of and abused its employees the owner and all upper employees were unbelievably narcissistic completely lacking in empathy and viewed all of their employees as pawns and lesser beings i left and was able to find something much closer to my ideal work environment  a good friend of mine still works there and has taken over most of my responsibilities and title though her salary is substantially less than mine was they are currently in the midst of their busy season and the abuse and exploitation of their employees is just staggering  this woman is working 60 hour weeks with a salary well below the minimum federal salary overtime threshhold and the company lies and says they have a small business exemption to avoid paying overtime the business regularly picks up last minute events and does a terrible job scheduling their employees so as a manager shes frequently made to hunt for people to send to events at the last second with the implication that its her responsibility if no one is available   she has been fending off a foot injury for awhile and yesterday was told to come in and she could spend her whole shift at her computer even though this time of year often involves lots of manual labor from every employee she went in and was promptly sent to work in the basement on her feet  she has a doctors appointment this afternoon and her whole leg is swollen she called them to let them know she wasnt coming in because she can barely walk and they basically told her she had to come in anyway and guilttripped her about all the things in her wheelhouse that needed to get done  things that there is no good reason another employee couldnt do  through all of this ive encouraged her to stand up for herself especially today i reminded her that if she has decided she is too injured to work they have no right or even real ability to override that decision beyond what she gives them   i felt so good about finally quitting and leaving that place behind and they were furious with me when i left so i have an idea of the kind of pressure she is dealing with she is aware of the fact that she is most likely not overtime exempt but through all of this the fact is that she lives meagerly paycheck to paycheck and even though shes miserable and is completely aware of how much shes being exploited and abused she cant really afford to rock the boat or quit shes working so much and is so exhausted when he has time off that its difficult to organize a job hunt i know thats a poor excuse sometimes but i suspect we can all sympathize with that feeling i try to refrain from nagging her about finding a new job because i know what that can feel like  all of this to say fuck that system and fuck those business owners who treat their employees like objects and are unable to see beyond the next dollar they might make peddling their overpriced crap no one needs,nxizbb

1925,NEVER let your body be destroyed and degraded for work.,my mom just had a new friend m seemed to be 50 lets call him guy sleep over at her house i talked to guy this morning and he told me about how he had worked 2 jobs over some 10year period just to make it in our economy   later on i saw guy painfully walking into the hallway to which i naturally asked what was wrong what he admitted to me didnt surprise me but it shocked me inside how truly painful it was for him both of his knees and both of his shoulders were essentially shot guy had at least 3 surgeries for them which understandably and officially left him permanently disabled  i then bring up to him how much our society has lost its principles given how long we have accepted this abuse from the system to which he agrees with my take    bottom line speak up and against all forms of abuse no matter how small its never just your shortterm happiness thats at stake its your entire future and livelihood too,nwxpx6

1944,Working part time is the perfect middle ground.,i was working full time from 8 am to 6 pm 5 days a week then i needed to take an exam for my future plans to study for that exam i needed time from work for 2 months talked to my boss lowkey threatened to completely quit if not delivered what i want to get and the short i started working part time from 8 am to 12 am for 2 months  its absolutely the best because working full time totaly fucks me up and i am literally dead when i arrive home but not working at all and spending all your days at home is not so good neither because then i oversleep and do absolute nothing but working part time gives me a reason to wake up everyday and start my day early and be productive for the rest of the day and when i am staying in home i honestly never wake up before 12 am anyway but when working part time i leave the office at 12 am and i still have my whole day it feels like i dont work  and the best part is i still get paid its less than normal of course but they give me 23 of my normal salary eventho i only work for 45 of my full time so thats weird but i am totally fine with it     so in short try to work part time instead of completely quitting if you have the chance not working at all is turning into a lazy lifestyle at some point and its frustrating economically but working part time keeps you getting paid and gives you a reason to wake up everyday but still feels like you dont work and sets you free as early as 12 am which is earlier than i normally wake up on my holidays,nx17fv

1979,"I'm done with 9-5, I'm going to begin enjoying my life again",im 36 work in a busy hospital worked in person through the pandemic caught covid recovered and went right back to work as soon as i was cleared my hospital sent us a hero bonus which was5 whole n95 masks sent to my house thanks a fucking lot i literally steal more n95s than this every week  yesterday i decided that i need to reclaim my own life my mental health has seriously suffered since the beginning of 2020 obviously due to covid lockdowns work shit and the loss of my sister last june due to cancer she had two kids my niece and nephew ages 4 and 1 though my nephew was only 3 months old when she passed ive been extremely depressed borderline suicidal tbh and it seems like the only thing keeping me around is that i cant imagine leaving my niece and nephew without their only uncle and leave my parents with no kids out of two   i get home from work exhausted both mentally and physically which leaves me basically no energy or capacity to cook dinner dishes laundry housekeeping etc i dont even have the energy or motivation to do things that i used to enjoy like reading gaming or golfing its taking a toll on my relationship with my gf since she is feeling the burden of having to try to pick up my slack i do still cook and clean stuff but ill be the first to admit that shes doing more of it shes very understanding of my situation im very lucky to have someone so supportive but its getting to her as well my mood energy level lack of interest in most things anymore including sex most of the time its having a negative impact on both of our lives and it cant continue like this  when i got home yesterday we had a great conversation about our situation in particular my work situation as she knows how miserable i am i told her i want to quit my full time job and do freelance writing jobs and gig work like delivery and she was completely supportive i cant continue working in a place that feels more like a punishment or prison sentence than a means to support my survival i cant continue asking permission for a day off or a break to run an important errand or attend a doctors appointment like im a fucking child i had to basically plead for extra bereavement days off when my sister passed and they acted like xerxes the generous god for giving me 3 extra fucking days this isnt how were supposed to live and now im ready to do something about it  my sisters death actually made me realize that you can do everything the right way get a career work your ass off pay for your health insurance sacrifice things that are important to you to get ahead in your career and then lose everything with one phone call we had to crowdfund her last couple rounds of chemo because she lost her employer sponsored health insurance due to the fact that she was dying of cancer and couldnt fucking work and therefore was deemed uninsurable what the fuck america  so im dipping out im not sacrificing the remaining best years of my life when i can be active and actually enjoy life before my body begins to break down even faster in order to keep up with the status quo thats clearly not working for me in any way to die early having not achieved really any of my own personal goals or realized any of my potential as a fucking human being not as a wage slave sacrificed at the altar of profit and productivity i have a sick dual screen phone that is pretty amazing for office productivity fuck that im watching youtube on one screen and reading rantiwork on the other screen fuck your productivity metrics  so yeah sorry for the long rant but im quitting at the end of the month im going to do some freelance writing and work on some old projects that id shelved a long time ago do some delivery driving where i can take breaks whenever i want go to the driving range or fuck it do a full 18 in the middle of the weekday and i wont fucking feel bad im going to stay up late when i want and sleep in when i want book vacations when it suits me and my gf and not ask permission to someone who doesnt give a single fuck about me in any way and only cares about the empty chair where i used to be im done being afraid to ask for things and accepting what im given im going to make money on my own terms even if that means taking home a bit less if the tradeoff is that my mental health improves and i can begin enjoying my life again then its a trade im willing to make   fuck your 9530 unpaid lunches micromanagement denial of time off requests need a doctors note for a sick day employer sponsored

1981,Traveling,just want to preface this with two things  1 i posted on here the other day and never got around to replying to any of the comments and now it feels like its been too long for me to go respond now so thanks anxiety ig  and 2 im on mobile sorry   now im still young ive got a lot of life to live and things to learn but i do know two things for sure right now those two things are that i have absolutely no goals in life other than to be as happy as possible and that working is just not going to make that happen for me this sub has helped me so much in feeling recognized in my distan for capitalism and being just a cog in its machine and i really appreciate that i guess my reasoning for this post is is it a reasonable idea for me to try to save up as much money as i can from the job i currently have and depending on the pay and how much it costs might be quitting in october in order to buy and restore an old vanbus and travel the us in it does anyone have a rough idea how much that would cost or would that be a better question for rvandwellers i know the van life probably wont be one that ill commit to for the rest of my life but i hear too many older people saying they wished that they wouldve travelled more when they were young rather than putting it off until they put aside enough money to do it because lets face it the working class is never going to have enough money for traveling im not looking for any sort of 5 star living while in a van i know its going to suck sometimes i know every day wont be an amazing adventure i just want to go out and see what there is to see and meet friends along the way am i missing any sort of big picture with this kind of thought process,nwbpne

back walls of the cosmos  this is just looking at one side of the ledger in a kind of global doubleentry accounting book a logically equivalent way of looking at it is that gdp is a metric of economic exchange required for survival in society as it exists you can say that some area produced 1 billion of output sounds good but you can just as easily say that 1 billion was required for that area to sustain itself sounds bad these two are simply logically equivalent   living on 1 a day  lets dive into the gestalt when you hear that a family of eight lives on less than a dollar per day ppp adjusted you might wonder how they manage to actually do such a thing would require buying large bags of rice for the whole family eat only that and live in free cardboard boxes  the reality is that that often uttered phrase means that they use less than 1 a day in the general economy while the rest of their livelihood is offthegrid or selfsufficient they may grow food in a family farm hunt for food and most of their daily needs from cooking oils to plates to pottery to soap are often made at home as well  there is still an economy but often one that is barter based or socialist in the real presocialist sense of the word mediated by direct facetoface social titfortat between neighbors and friends none of this mediated by currency being exchanged thus it is not part of the gdp  if you read about some bangladeshi village where the only product is textiles that doesnt mean that everyone there makes textiles all day and without a textile company everyone wouldve starved to death it means that the only onpaper measurable global industry practiced there is textile manufacturing other villagers might farm hunt even do some kind of gathering in some places they will produce the arts and crafts and live the way people live when you leave them alone if your view of the world is mediated by gdp youre only seeing the extremely small sliver that pops into existence when people exchange something involving legal tender  this is extremely difficult for us modern bugpeople to understand because to be a bugman in a large city is to produce absolutely nothing on ones own and buy literally everything you need from the store to us nonproductive people gdp means income which means survival but the further out of bugmanville you go the clearer the vacuousness of gdp becomes when you realize that most of human wealth is unmeasured by gdp you realize that whig history and steven pinkerism is based on shaky foundations   example  a minor example we had a large thanksgiving feast near my uncles house in very rural florida as it got cold in the night we had a fire in a repurposed old sugar cane cooking vat artfully standing on used symmetrical cinderblock pieces a bugman hipster might pay two hundred dollars or more for a similar looking authentic piece of equipment those 200 would be counted in the gdp a bugman hipster might have also bought or rented chairs for the event contributing more to the gdp but my uncle as part of the local wholesome church community simply borrowed some from the church thus our event produced basically no gdp output in goods or services despite being functionally equivalent to some similar but expensive and ergo productive friendsgiving practiced by urbanites in reality we are richer than the bugmen hipsters who blew hundreds of dollars on a fauxfolksy party in this case we owned the firepit and had easy access and permission to the chairs thus we are more economically flexible than they are that gdp that they producedexpended is evidence of deeper reliance on the economic system that gdp output is a marker of fragility reliance on the conditions of the outside economy in the same way that a village of bangladeshis who abandon their traditional way of lives to work on textiles are more fragile despite being able to save up for iphones   what gdp really measures  most of the increase in gdp across the world is simply the movement from local partiallysocial partiallyunderthetable economies to economies mediated by taxable currency an economically selfsufficient village with close social relationships and a barter economy has 0 gdp a township of entrepreneurs and artisans you partially barter and partially use currency which they dont report has 0 gdp all of these people are in poverty and earn less than a dollar a day and if you want to be truly selfsufficient that means having a personal gdp of zero  more than that pretty much everywhere gdp is a strong indicator of social upheaval if you think that gdp is some eternal goodness remember that everything good about industrialization shows up in the gdp while at the same time everything bad about it will not show up or sometimes bad things are registered as positive economic growth urbanization has caused massdisease and if that means a market for new medical services and pharmaceuticals great the gdp just went up the ganges is polluted due to the textile plant that just means more opportunities for local entrepreneurs to sell bottled water the gdp just went up are people being pushed out of fishing or other subsistence occupations because of it even better now they have no choice but to contribute to the gdp with every passing year in fact more and more of the gdp is produced by dealing with the problems that our higher level of gdp have caused  at the end of the day gdp is only a measurement of how reliant a place or country is on the global economy selfsufficiency has a gdp of 0 wasteful consooomerism has an extremely large gdp   planned obsolescence  i have one of my great grandfathers early electric circular saws it has a bunch of gunk in it but it still works although i recently took it apart to replace some old screws and springs and other little parts to be careful they literally do not make circular saws like it its all metal while even the fancy modern stuff is mostly plastic  the unfortunate thing about it and other durable tools is that its bad for the economy especially the gdp since that thing has been around since maybe the 50s or 60s thats as long as 70 years the economy has gone without the stimulation of us having to buy another saw  viewers of my technology videos which would be better for the world if everyone used the material equivalent of a classic americanmade ibm thinkpad or some apple laptops that are unfixable computers made of mostly batteries designed to conk out right before the new version comes out regardless the apple macs that cost thousands a piece are much better for the economy  thats what i mean if you have quality tools and do not need to constantly throw money at the system to buy things fix things and otherwise waste money you are going to be having a lower gdp thats just how it is   the propagandistic role of gdp  when you dont think things through like this gdp is supposed to appear as an objective measure of economic goodness youre supposed to be looking at those gdp charts and saying wow my life might be terrible i am not free i am subject to forces out of my control and i am told i have to participate in massconsumerism to survive but these charts are the facts and the facts say that things are better now so i believe them  its legitimately surprising to me how big of a boon the idea of increasing gdp is for whig history and npcs of many different ideologies people of the left and right will matteroffactly tell me that a plastic based economy taking over the world is still good because the line is going up ive heard it as a justification for everything  gtdont like globalization   youre wrong the gdp is going up   dont trust statefunded institutionalized science   youre wrong the gdp is going up   dont want child drag queens   youre wrong the gdp is going up   dont want everything to be made of plastics and other petrochemicals   youre wrong the gdp is going up   dont want mass pornography   youre wrong the gdp is going up   dont want free sugary drinks since infancy   youre wrong the gdp is going up  when you abandon the illusion of gdp you are suddenly able to ask whether massive technological progress has actually been good for real human life and human pychology,nwgq7h

2035,Could Ending Remote Work Be Consider An OSHA Violation?,ending remotework and forcing normal humans back into corporate cages almost feels like an osha violation to me every other post here is from people who describe their current mental state as depressed anxious or even suicidal and all because they have bosses andor work cultures that are dehumanizing exploitive or emotional abusive in some way ending remote work  which many companies seem desperate to do as soon as possible  would just force people back into that crazymaking hunger gameslike environment at least with remotework there is some safety and control some dignity even yes the work is monotonous and meaningless pointless but at least being at home you can salvage some autonomy and arent exposed to the misery and abuse of other coworkers forcing people back into their prison cells and forcing them deal with other prisoners seems unnecessarily cruel is there any kind of osha requirement that can help workers stay at home some sorta mental health exemption,nw09ym

2091,a newbie babbling,hey everyone  fist of i hope this is allowed if not please delete  ampx200b  i am pretty new to the antiwork sentiment it started about 15 years ago when my roommate told me she wasnt going to work full time after her degree partly because full time positions are not very common in her field partly because she said she just didnt want to  now for me as a business major this was completely mindblowing up until that point i was naturally very career focused it was what they taught us to be i had done two internships was just starting out a parttime job and went to every career fair and free career workshop i could find i had accepted that i would never have a dream job but i was still planning on shooting for the quickest and most efficient way up planning my route through a prestigious masters to a top professional qualification in my field all this while i knew that my internship grinding away at one of the worlds most well known accounting firms had been far from a great experience for me mentally  ampx200b  then covid happened and i started working and studying from home i failed my last exam which added another year to my undergrad and i watched some people of the people on youtube that have recently popping up that talk about how capitalism work sucks now i am here and these are some things ive learned  1 i dont want a career any more ill be ok with working a fourday week to get by but only if it accommodates my needs  2 number one need being work from home at least half the time i dont know the antiwork communitys stance on wfh in general but i love it no time wasted on commute comfort of your own home and avoiding toxic office culture sounds great to me and instead of spending the times i dont have anything to do or short breaks everyone needs from time to time pretending like im busy i can fill these precious minutes with small household chores so i am free after work ends   3 and lets be clear here i still do my work but ive come to realize that time i save by being extra efficient which is definitely a bit more stressful doesnt automatically belong to my employer as long as they dont reward my heightened productivity with extra compensation i dont see anything wrong with just taking that extra time for myself and that is just a lot easier to do when youre not constantly being watched by your boss  4 and the work getting is done is really all they care about they dont care about you i mean ive always kind of known this especially because as a parttime employee and student on the side i dont bring much value to the company nevertheless i always felt bad if i had to leave a job was very apologetic for wanting time off and always made sure to coordinate everything i did with my boss but it seems like he really doesnt give a flying freak what i do he never asks how im doing working at home he rarely realizes what im even working on at the moment and doesnt even make sure i have enough work so why should i care ive completely stopped checking in with him regarding my work schedule etc if he has a problem with that he can come talk to me its taken some time but ive learned not to stress about it any more  5 especially since i know how little they pay me for what i do since i work with clients and part of that involves invoicing i happen to know exactly how much money im making them and how much they pay me in return ive been wanting to ask for a raise for a while im too shy but in the meantime i will put in the effort that suits my compensation  ampx200b  i honestly havent come far in my journey yet i dont know how i want to spend my life i still feel like i can never truly relax because it feels unproductive ill be spending the next two months on a retreat and i really hope itll help clear my mind a bit and show me what life without any work is like if youve got any reading recommendations that you think might help id be glad to hear them   anyway i am happy i found this r and a happy very early weekend to you all,nvzkrx

2139,I'm interested in hearing more about the anti-work rationale (Genuine),i confess i dont know all the nitty gritty details of all the arguments behind antiwork philosophies but i tend to agree with some of them and disagree with others   ampx200b  thus id like to get hear the additional reasoning behind some of the points i dont agree to see if i would change my mind i visit this sub occasionally 25mo and dont really get to see much rational argument  just a lot of rants please comment respectfully on some or all of the points below if you disagree with me  ampx200b  1 wageslave   or some variation of it this term seems overly bombastic and almost certainly not meant to be literal slavery has such a complex and serious history and meaning that you cant honestly compare employment to it with a job you are voluntarily agreeing to do something in exchange for an income   2 capitalists are evil  i agree that many aspects of how the market and its participants function are reprehensible i think the strongest argument ive every heard for why the complaints of business over regulation is hyperbole is child labor we use to have it then we passed laws banning it we still have a functioning market today without it nevertheless the core idea of private citizens owning capital in terms of money or assets in terms of land buildings stocks etc is not inherently evil there is a core incentive to improve the efficiency but guardrails have to be put in place baseball players are incentivized to knock the ball out of the park but a referee is there to make sure they dont use an air cannon  3 working hard or hustle culture is dumb  lets draw a distinction between people that are motivated solely for an income to sustain themselves and people that are motivated for other reasons eg achievement altruism i agree that at a baseline nobody should have to be overworked to live a safe and stable life i do subscribe to the idea that we could probably have a 4 day work week standard and every worker could earn enough for i food ii sheltersanitation iii healthcare iv education  v security and vi transportation however i disagree that hustling or working hard or putting in overtime or working 70 hours a week is inherently bad when the primary motivator is the worker themselves ive had friends that have started businesses i myself have worked long hours not because i needed to but because i worked for a company where i believed in what they did and wanted us to succeed and improve i derived satisfaction from our purpose like someone might derive satisfaction from playing the guitar  4 we could all just buy a farm and live off the land  you could but youd have to give up every modern convenience like cell phones tvs automotive tractors refrigerator etc  to be consistent in your logic each product of convenience we use in our life is the result of thousands of other people working in interwoven supply chains again theres a distinction between an individual wanting to live is isolationindependence and thinking that the whole of society could work still needs to be done to have the life of comfort and convenience relative to centuries ago that most enjoy   5 robots could do everything and humans could live a life of leisure  given how hard it is to get 10 people to agree unanimously on something i dont foresee an entire country agreeing to it and coordinating on the gargantuan effort the simple act of retrofitting a factory is insanely complicated time consuming expensive and ironically labor intensive as a technophile the technology is there for perhaps the majority of the means of production but not 100 i hope to significant progress towards the automation of the means of production but only if we install safeguards to inhibit the unequal circulation of money    overall i agree with a lot of the complaints in this sub and ive listed a few below but i disagreed with some notions that seem to circulate frequently here as well and i wanted to challenge them im coming from a place of sincerity and interest in internalizing the rationale of other viewpoints and having a healthy discussion  none of my friends can keep a cool head when discussing this stuff and so they arent really interested in debating it its either rah rah capitalists are the devil incarnate or lol lazy bums  ampx200b  thanks  ampx200b  i agree   without regulations a majority of private forprofit businesses would exploit nearly everything they could to make more profit including people and the environment   a fully free market with no restrictions eg libertarian style would could a lot of human suffering   the inheritance of wealth is a major source of corruption and conflation of incentives   there are basic human necessities that deserve additional protection from exploitation like food housing education transportation security and sanitation perhaps even a government owned basic version that challenges private businesses with insane profit margins   ceo  executive pay is so stupidly high and not proportional   people should not have to spend a majority of their waking hours in any given year just to live a safe and stable life  etc,nvbqlu

2146,I had the weirdest dream / nightmare last night.,basically it was found out that large scale companies like amazon walmart etc were making workers lives as miserable as possible in order to cause depression stress and other health issues that stem from being over worked and working long hours  i was one of the whistleblowers on this case and living in a remote bunker because of the high price put on my head  the reason for doing this is is because they were getting massive kickbacks from the drug companies that were enjoying record profits from sales of antidepression antianxiety and a host of other medications they were in turn using these kickbacks to supplement the wages of the workers by as much as 10hr in some instances  this was also the reason why many of these companies paid such little taxes they did not want a paper trail showing this  the reason why healthcare was not made free is because they would lose this incentive  weed was made illegal for the longest time because they would lose out on profits if people had a natural substance to consume that would reduce stress smoking and drinking were perfectly legal because they would soon cause other health issues like lung cancer and liver disease and they would also make bank on sales of drugs to treat these ailments especially chemotherapy drugs,nvw6d1

2178,I have figured it out (Sorta),ive been working in an industrial facility where we make cement my job is the shovel hot dust buildup onto conveyer belts for 10 to 12 hour shifts as you can imagine it sucks ass but i have alot of time to thinkno body can talk to each other over the noise and ive come to a conclusion there are two main problems that make people especially uneducated people ok with their shitty jobs and why they are opposed to socialism i live in the us by the way  1 people think they are middle class but they are working class they dont have a grasp on how much more money the middle class has if you cant afford to take more than 100 hours of work off each year you are not middle class you are working class people in the middle class could lose their jobs and be financially alright for a bit potentially a long time middle class people own a home and can retire at a reasonable age but many working class people  think that socialism wouldnt help them because they think they are the rich or the middle class they feel that they will be crushed underneath massive taxes for something that wont benefit them  2 people dont comprehend just how little money they actually make for example i make 20 an hour and that sounds pretty good at first glance but then you have to take into consideration that i dont have dental or that i do such hard work that i have to eat about 4000 calories every work day or that i have to replace my work gloves every week all this junk is expensive  and is a direct result of my work i have worked here for almost  a year and ive managed to save up enough for a used car a shitty one after a whole year now lets take into consideration how the ceo works every friday he comes in for about 4 hours to check up on things last month he upped our production quota by about 20 my crew and i had to work overtime almost every day for that month but we met our quota and how does our ceo congratulate us he gave us a one dollar raise and a box of donuts and  apparently i was the only one who realized that we did 20 more work for a 5 raise    people need to start thinking about how much they get ripped off by their employers and need to realize that they are the people who would be paying for the health care or the food banks or any other aid to the poor not the workers but the owners would fund social services,nvkedj

2181,Today I learned that we subsidize rich people's donations to Ivy League universities,i think this counts as belonging in rantiwork because these rich people dont have to work while in college while the rest of us have to juggle work with an education and make sacrifices while also giving money to rich people  just a fun little excerpt from robert reichs book saving capitalism 2015  private university endowments in 2014 totaled around 550 billion centered in a handful of prestigious institutions harvards endowment is more than 32 billion followed by yale at 208 billion stanford at 187 billion and princeton at 182 billion in 2013 harvard launched a capital campaign for another 65 billion because of the charitable tax deduction the amount of government subsidy to these institutions in the form of tax deductions is about one out of every 3 contributed a few years back meg whitman now ceo of hewlettpackard contributed 30 million to princeton in return she received a tax break estimated to be around 10 million in effect princeton received 20 million from whitman and 10 million from the us treasury  that is from you and me and other taxpayers who made up the difference and in these endowments exemptions from taxes on capital gains and on income they earn the total government expenditure is even larger divide by the relatively small number of students attending these institutions and the amount of subsidy per student is huge the annual government subsidy to princeton university for example is about 54000 per student according to an estimate by economist richard vetter other elite private universities arent far behind   oh sweet so rich people get to give rich institutions money thats tax deductable to give already rich families better educations so they can save money on college while the rest of us actually subsidize their donations whilst simultaneously going into copious amounts of debt for our own educations college should not be a scam but it might as well be,nvcnjx

Need advice",hey guys  sorry if this isnt the right place to post but im really going through an awful time lately and just growing bitter and bitter by the days  long story short like a lot of people i had no childhood and no teenage years as im the child of immigrate parents and had it extremely rough for a long time coupled with a divorce  it took years of therapy and sheltering for me to grow back and feel better and these last 2 years i finally managed to get a drivers license a car and a degree all by myself  but now im terrified i never worked before i didnt ever have time to relax and now im told i basically have to wake up every morning to go to some desk job doing computer work web dev front end and spend my life like that i dont want that im not completely closed minded when it comes to work but my country is very against working from home even for tech related work and theyre super late when it comes to technology  im alone and on borrowed time as i dont have a paycheck and living from social funds i might soon get evicted and lose everything but frankly the thought of losing everything is somehow sweeter than getting locked in a job hell for survival im trying to find works from home anywhere outside of my country even perhaps move someday but having never worked is immensely hard as i dont have the right habits  i need avice anything im scared to death and im not feeling good at all the future is uncertain and with every little shit going on with the word and people ignoring it i dont know even myself how can i ever afford to have a life with a family of my own if i cant even take care of myself,nv97rw

2229,What is the solution? Can you help me?,hello friends i feel same way as most of you let me explain my thoughts  i just end my studies on the university and confront the real world  i had worked on the past on two diferret works for 3 or 4 months some years and hated it  i dont hate the fact of doing something that requires effort i like that i hate the fact that other person gives me orders that you have to spend most of the day doing it the fact that you have to put a mask and act on a certain way in order to dont lose the job the fact that it doesnt  compensate due to inflation the fact that the government that we know that is corrupt win money due to the taxes that i pay it kills me inside  im already searching for jobs and here in europe the things are so bad normal salary is 1000month my fathers generation used to win 15003000 on normal jobs and 1000 40 years ago was able to buy a lot of things but today due to inflation those same 1000in the past  represent 800 today   my question is what can we do how do i scape having to suffer these for the rest of my life  i dont consider ceating my own business as a valid option because the huge majority of them fail and it is a lost of time money and energy   what can i do friends how do i avoid these my environment push me to find a job and they look at me in a bad way you probably feel the same people thinks that you are weird because you hate the way these system works and dont want to be part of it  i would like to read your messages if you can help me or bring light to my situation it will be awesome tbh with you im having the worst feelings of my life i cant imagine when if i finally have to start working for someone in a shit job,nvfiu2

2244,My job is driving me toward a mental break.,i am a 21 year old recent graduate working at a company that vaguely intersects with my degree  when i first started here i loved it i was getting good pay having a positive impact on the environment and creating good connections with my coworkers over the past 11 months however the company has shifted further and further away from caring about its employees and more toward cutting excess and increasing profit  for example 11 months ago we had a shift lead and 7 other workers on our team totaling 8 for our division today with an even larger workload and greater responsibilities than when i started we have only 5 team members and no shift lead as we are now directly managed by the ceo whose favorite word is efficiency  the work itself is my biggest gripe it is hard mindnumbingly repetitive physical labor im talking repeating the same 5 tasks thousands of times a week and with fewer and fewer team members more and more work is put upon the individual i struggle with jobs that i do not feel i am learning and gaining experience in within the first week of work i had exhausted all available wisdom  the only things keeping me tethered to this position are the pay a little over 2x the minimum wage in my state which isnt saying much and the fact that it has been practically impossible for me to find an entry level position that i am passionate about without 23 years of experience  rant over thanks for reading,nvynph

got really long but i dont care i poured my heart and soul into it now i know i needed to do this    ampx200b  i really dont want to get a job  im going 31 american age this year and i was never once employed in my life  am i unskilled do i need to try harder is it because ive never presented myself well enough i wouldnt know because ive never ever once in my lifetime submitted a resume to a company not once  oh you say i must be a loser who cant even approach the gates of hell bit of a backstory im korean literally korean  i lived in the states for only about four yearsish  you know that asian stereotype about how were all hardworking diligent and disciplined well i passed a presitigious school in junior high dropped out got submitted to a nationally renown high school dropped out again i thought maybe the us might be different so i went to a catholic school nope dropped out people keep telling me its a miracle that i got into one of the best universities in korea as a high school dropout especially in korea guess what dropped out  didnt my family tried to kill me sometimes i wish they did sometimes i wish they were actually pure evil then i couldve just not given a shit about what they wanted good grades good employment good wife etc etc im gay also that really didnt help especially not here maybe then i couldve just exploded and ended it all suicide or murder or whatnot what happened to me is not a result of a rebellion or a prodigy gone wrong its just a result of the elements of life pulling me in all directions giving me conflicting messages all just to make me a very productive and useful asset to society  thing is i just dont get it  ever since a child ive been taught especially from the us side mind you in many ways youre worse  that i will eventually find my bliss do what you want to do find something that you can do for the rest of your life that you can enjoy and you wouldnt have to work a single day huh thats nice in theory you know what call me stupid but i still want to believe in it its that bad  and then from the korean side you constantly hear the exact opposite message oh you already know the asian stereotype get beaten for low grades get scolded for math i was really lucky i was already really good at math and english i also have a mother who only used to beat me as a kid and then got scared of me later and just really wants me to live that asian dream life doctor lawyer well paying job traditional family yeah i know that she really actually does love me but sometimes i really wish she didnt  i hate both of you  theres one thing you dont know about asians we complain the shit out of life i mean sure its obvious when you think about it why would we not when were expected to work and act like slaves but you dont hear that one often do you koreans always working hard always diligent alwyas silent and docile as if we shit about our coworkers our employees our employers our work ethic our hideous work hours 95  more like 911 and have the lowest work efficiency among all oecd countries  ive just heard so many horror stories so many im not gatekeeping on korea please dont think that i dont think the us is any better but its not about that ever since i was a kid i did not see the reason to get a well paying job im not gonna marry you dont even allow gay marriage im not going to have children i cant and i wont i dont even want a lot of materials in my life i happily lived in a single room for 2 years just fine all i need are my internet music and games  for what would i have to work 911s   youre not even a good society youre capitalist for crying out loud youre all about stuff i dont believe in expensive cars expensive food expensive furniture ridiculous fashion police sure i do like a good looking house now and then but not 911 for the rest of my life worth good not even 95 you can sacrifice a lot of that to help people but you dont i dont care what you call me your opinions do not matter in the slightest youre evil why would i have to work just to satisfy the bellies of people like you  i dont understand guys i just dont  i dont want to get a job my mom is like near literally dying for me to get a job but i just dont get it i love you mom i really do but i will not sacrifice my life for you she says its for my own good lol what are you even worrying about i already told you i wont marry she doesnt believe in it still i dont need a palace or a family or a fashion wardrobe and i dont even have a refined palette i have other way urgent needs and wants and they all have extremely loose connection to money some of them none why i mean why seriously why  why do i need to get a job  oh you think im lazy huh you think i dont like work well tell me how many lazy people worked on their own game engine how many lazy people has put in so much numerous hours into perfecting his skills on programming composing and art when i do what i want to do making what i want to make whenever and however i like it using whatever i method i choose to do then suprise i do it how many can say they work 60 hours a week without any superior telling them to i even exercise 5 days a week because i chose to how many lazy people pull that off tell me  i am not going to be a corporate slave  i dropped out of college to make games i made a complete uturn with my career focusing on doing only what i want to do as you can tell i havent been successful yet but i dont care im still studying in so many areas im still making games in the most inefficient way possible like i fucking care mom has been begging me coaxing me even threatening me since then to use my new skills to at least submit a resume somewhere well mom 1 i made a complete uturn remember im still not that good enough 2 i dont really know about the us but korea really has some really stupid thing against hiring people over the age of 30 without a career i mean way to go like i care and 3 i dont want to get a corporate job  everytime i work on something i want i work everytime i slightly give into their nasty idiotic mindset of needing a job because your neck depends on it no it doesnt and work on something i dont want that can build my portfolio i just cant do anything  i sound like im one of those guys who have my own dreams and will follow it no matter what its not like that when i make games im not doing what i love i do what i hate the least i actually have another path i love more than making games or even playing games it just doesnt pay its not even a job bliss yeah right its just that when i make games i actually hate myself the least in most days i actually feel neutral about it a lot of times im even proud of it when i listen to songs ive written or pictures ive painted or even mini games or modules ive made over the years im proud yes that work pride thing is not totally a myth it does exist in reasonable amounts  i will throw whats left of all of that and more away when i get a job i just know i will  ampx200b  why is it like this why and why dont people see it i just dont understand guys i just dont ive been actually made to feel guilty about not working and not earning money and not contributing to the economy which has very little of what i want in return in the first place why is everyone so materialistic and most of all why do i have to be the shunned and abnormal one because of your greed and indecency to humanity  why cant i just be left alone to work on what i want in peace why do i constantly feel like i have to give into this idea of getting a job and building a stupid portfolio when i absolutely dont want and dont need it the only plus side of me getting a job is to earn my money and get the hell out of this nagging place so its not a complete null option even now but that is such such a dumb reason such a dumb fucking reason just moving from one stupid prison to the next  what the fuck can i do except ignore the hell out of the

2323,Just about given up with my job. Need to search my options.,yesterday i had the worst experience with my fast food job i had for a year and a half now sundays already run on a skeleton crew but on that one we had 2 call offs that night when the night manager comes in shes complaining about headaches a pain reaching from her chest to arm an eye feeling like it was drooping and she couldnt lift her arm without feeling out of breath these are all stroke symptoms so i urged her to get an ambulance she eventually left and im still not sure if she went to the hospital   so now we only have 3 people and no manager they should have closed the store right then and there as we were way too shorthanded to run the store on our own but instead of doing that our franchise manager told us to lock the doors and that we can close the store an hour early we had to shut the food station down and only ran drinks with the 3 of us scrambling the store to get orders done this was fine for maybe an hour then cars starting taking ten minutes to get through the drive thru i reached my breaking point when the people at the window started laughing at us i asked what was so funny they said theyre still waiting for their drinks i stop what im doing and find one of the drinks so i hand it out i failed to realize the lid was only halfway on and they pointed it out i explained how we are very short staffed at the moment and that we are all fucking stressed out i was so stressed i was accidentally using curse words to customers and sounded incoherent they were obviously unsympathetic and probably thought i was on drugs   on the verge of a mental breakdown i walked to the back screamed a bit in the walk in cooler and put my fiance on the phone to vent about the situation as im sitting in the office the store phone rang it was one of the customers in the drive thru asking what was taking so long to get through i explained how we were very short staffed and how they refused to let us close the store or even send a manager to help then suggested she should go to our sister location she said someone should call our corporate center to complain about it and i told her not to worry that i was going to call myself which i still plan on doing  eventually the girls working that night yelled for me and said i need to come back to help them i tried to explain that if i went back to working that line i would have a nervous breakdown and that if they cant run the line without me we should close the store now they were unsympathetic one of them saying the lines it doesnt matter its your job more times than i could count and im still having trouble deciphering it how does my mental health not matter how can this be worth it when tensions rise and she demands i come back up front i explode in her face she ended up calling a bunch of people telling them i refuse to work under the current conditions one of them was a shift leader who threatened to kick my ass if i left im still not sure what to do about a blatant threat like that another was the gms wife since he was busy at the time taking a shower apparently he said if that i dont keep working and stay an hour after my schedule to help close i would be fired i had no choice but to keep working or lose the one source of income i had   this is probably what messed me up the most the gm is usually a nice guy and we have had a positive relationship since i started working i feel betrayed above all else forcing me to stay an hour late was unethical and im still trying to figure out if hes even allowed to do that now i plan on calling sick on my next workday but now im scared he will use that as a reason to fire me i am ready to leave this hellhole once i get another job lined up but not before and i really dont want to have to go in quite yet i really need more time to think about this situation,nutrlx

2334,Wanting a new job,hi guys currently called in sick and feeling guilty because i did a month ago too planning on probably going in later but definitely having a crisis right now i really hate my job and i hated my last one too same field lately ive been thinking id prefer something that is workfromhome so i dont have to deal with the public i currently work four days a week and i love it i cant imagine working five days a week and to be frank i really want to work three if possible thankfully my boyfriend helps provide a little more income than i do so i have a little bit of wiggle room with my income but not much i have a lot of experience in my current field so i make decent money the problem is i want to at least try something new ive only had two different types of jobs in my past and hated both of them i cant try something new without taking a huge pay cut though i just feel extremely stuck and unhappy as most of us do im so happy and carefree on the weekends and feel genuinely happy about life but as soon as sunday afternoon comes i go into a deep depression usually i can push through the week but lately every week just feels longer and longer and more unbearable than the last  this rant has been extremely all over the place but the bottom line is do people who have worked in an office and from home prefer working from home does anyone know of any work from home positions that pay decently and allow a flexible schedule i know very unrealistic question im just trying to figure out where to go from here and am so scared of taking risks but every day i want to walk out on my current job but cant because i need the money,nuhdwn

2339,"References are ruining my mental health just like having to explain gaps, help?",the thought of having to list references on my cv is one of the main reasons why i have anxiety ive had good jobs but even there there were very few bosses i could trust to give an objective reference about me who knows what they will say i tried to avoid this crap by asking for a written reference when i left but they ignore it in my country at least its illegal for interviewers to call previous employers behind my back but still   all these advise websites tell me to list references on my cv so i did but i feel like removing them all because im starting to freak out most of my jobs were short and these people dont know me well at all some of them were mentally unstable i even left out some jobs cause i hated the place theres where i have gaps instead which i also have to explain but thats less of a problem for me because i realised its none of their damn business and best i can do is i was looking for work thats all they are allowed to know about me  out of the 8 jobs ive had i could only list 2 as a reference but one is of a job from 2018 and another of 2019 luckily a lot of companies dont really seem to bother asking for references the thing is i switched function in 2020 and i hated it i started slacking and becoming depressed so i dont think this period would even be relevant as a reference i became a copywriter while im actually a lawyer two completely different things i want to be in the legal field again maybe and start over definitely skipping those toxic job agencies they have the biggest tendency to call an exemployer and might even make you sign a document that you allow them to and then they cold call your ex employer yikes   so should we all just stop listing references or list the ones from the past i wish there was a law that stated that employers should write a written reference for every employer that leaves and you sign it and everyone agrees and is happy it would solve so much,nup3e3

2344,What can we do?,i have seen a few threads of people asking what we can actually do about the current work culture and the current system how can you show someone who does not see it how bad the current system is for a lot of people how do you make your family especially your parents understand how bad it is  here is some things i have seen working to convince people at least who are not voting for the parties that they have been voting for years and are shifting their vote to more sensible parties   sat down with my mother when i had to apply to jobs because she did not believe me how terrible the process was she was not full on put on a suit and walk in there but she was like just accept any job that pays money for now i spend several hours going through terrible written job postings explaining a lot of times why the job description is wrong why the pay is terrible show her how they try to reduce pay by offering benefits first she was like benefits are nice but when she saw all jobs offer them she changed her tune she saw how many different times i had to type the same thing that i just added in my cvpdf i told her how many replies good or bad i actually got and how many interview steps and assignments i had to go through for each company she said anything about me complaining about job searches ever again  tell them about how your management tells you that you need to work overtime because they did not plan the certain tasks earlier that were much more important than others just let them know in a sneaky little way make sure they know when you usually start working then send them small messages like how mom love you just got off work especially when you work really late  what also helped was having a successful sibling that had to go through the same stuff and got really annoyed at their constant probing so it was not just me telling them  tell people to try working from home if it is possible in so many professions you dont need 8 hours to finish your tasks my friend who had the opportunity to try it said he needed like 23 hours for all his reports and then was done for the day just waiting if a call came in he loved it and started questioning what was taking so much time at the office he wondered why he was spending so much time in the office than with his wife and newborn kid  getting depression from your job and have a doctor diagnose you with it i cant really recommend this one because damn did i never want to know what depression feels like it did however make my family much more sympathetic especially because i was a happy guy before but during this time of my depressive episode i had no more energy and lost all joy in life  if you have any other ideas or experiences i would love to hear what helped you make people realize how bad the system is currently,nujizs

2382,On the Basis of Repost Bots,i know many of you are frustrated with the current state of this sub in regards to massive amounts of reposts the sad fact of the matter is that it is not just rantiwork that is having this issue a quick jaunt over into rmodsupport reveals that this is an issue moderators have been begging for help with for the past two months and have recieved no reprieve  the hard part in developing automod scripts to detect and remove bots is that the bots start understanding why they are banned and then try and circumvent  this new wave of bots are from accounts that were created from 4 months to over a year ago they seem to all be waking up at once and finding top level posts top level comments and reposting the to farm karma   this is bad for reddit for two plausible reasons farming karma serves two purposes us the users often times will look at a persons account and see how much karma they have as a virtue signal of trust lets say these bots are designed to farm tons of karma and then bombard country specific and political subs to try and alter public opinion surrounding an election or they go into financial subs and try to pump up the value of an unstable crypto or stock so they can sell high before a big bust what im trying to get at is that these bots are not only a nuisance but they are possibly dangerous  sadly weve had posts reach the front page that have been made by these bots and recieved thousands of upvotes before removal we cant take away that karma from them reddit wouldnt allow that for obviously good reasons but now they have it if theyre strategic out of these thousands of bots they get us to miss 1 or 2 that really take off those are now two high value accounts that can be bought and sold to the highest bidder and used to manipulate  i know this post has been long but id like to end it with some tips on what patterns weve seen with these bots and what to do before interacting with a post  1 username patterns are emerging every day and constantly changing the two most common current patterns are u namename typically feminine names and then u wordkshekosiejjejhejdjdbwjsj but the random letters at the end are always a different keyboard smash pattern  2 the accounts are 4 months old with some being more than a year old  3 the awarder karma is always 0 these bots arent giving out awards so they are right at 0  4 the posts are reposts and the comments are lifted from other top level comments these are harder to spot unless youre a die hard fan of the sub  5 they typically only post to two to three specific subreddits within minutes of one another this may be a way to help them lay low   i know that yinz are just as stressed and frustrated as i am with these bots it is making reddit a hard place to browse when the front page of the internet isnt even half human anymore right now the best things users can do is report accounts and be vigilant with which posts you interact with before giving out your free reward or paid rewards check the account and see if its a bot hopefully this can get fixed soon but right now were all in this together a phrase i know all of you live to hear after these past 15 months  please be patient with us as we are trying our absolute best to remove them try not to interact with bot posts and report them as spam to us,nup46h

2386,Perception is King,after a couple of months of building a case for a salary bump i finally went and proposed it to my boss for the past 6 months due to engineering staff reductions i have taken on the better part of two additional positions with no increase in pay this was under the direction that we will eventually replace these positions and it is only temporary as usual this turned out to not be true the rebuttal to my salary increase was that a salary bump wasnt possible due to low sales and that i dont commit enough extra time to work and only work the bare minimum aka leaving on time after inquiring further i was told that since i leave at 510pm every day my official quitting time is 5pm and not something closer to 530pm i will never have the opportunity to climb the corporate ladder at this company i asked if there were any issues with my work which the answer was no but my boss said that if someone needed my help on something at 6pm i wouldnt be here to assist i asked if that has ever happened in the past year ive worked here and he said no i asked if he ever heard any complaints that i dont support other departments inside or outside of work and again he says no being salaried i have my cellphone number plastered all over my emails and have taken many calls outside of normal work hours after telling him this he says he knows but the perception by upper management is that i dont put forth the extra time to complete tasks so i said ok has there ever been a time where i have been late for a project or have not put forth my best effort to complete tasks and again he says no at this point our meeting was cut short by another meeting so instead of leaving feeling much better at my current situation i left feeling frustrated after sitting at my desk i realized that if that is the only reason they will not promote me to a leadership position than that is their loss i will not sacrifice my free time for a huge what if situation that i may or may not be promoted i will not spend my weekends at work like a good drone chasing the carrot on the stick this is why i am antiwork  ampx200b  tldr during a request for a salary increase my boss said that since i only stay an extra 10min past the end of my work day instead of something closer to 30min i will never be considered for promotions in this company due to the upper management perception that i dont work hard enough although having evidence on projects that prove the contrary,nugeld

2414,"Legalized slavery, oligarchy, and the fight to end both",people seem to forget how much work and fighting it took to end legalized slavery which was an institutionalized crime against humanity that  seemed normal to people for hundreds of years  the legalized power disparity of slavery allowed slave owners to enact countless policies from rape and illiteracy to brutal working conditions and denying legal standing to further subjugate their slaves and entrench their own positions  humanity in the 21st century is now in the same position with respect to legalized oligarchy  humanity is currently enslaved by an outdated 20th century abomination of a legal system that perpetuates brutal oligarchy and massive injustice and the system is well overdue for a 21st century antioligarchy update  the power disparity between oligarchs and the rest of humanity allows oligarchs to dictate behavior and policy in countless ways from exploitative workingliving conditions to land and energy policyownership to tax policy spending priorities technology policy healthcare policy education policy corporate law securities lawenforcement and so on that further subjugate humanity while entrenching their own positions  the difference now is that technology can help empower people and thereby end oligarchy in much less time than was required to end slavery  here is what a strategy to do that would look like  1 a critical mass of the population can de facto outlawhttpsenwikipediaorgwikioutlaw billionairesoligarchs by jury nullifyinghttpsenwikipediaorgwikijurynullification any and all crimes and civil harms committed against billionaires and their obscene property claims 2 this  should be repeated until the oligarchs enslaving humanity change the  fucking laws to stop the legalized oligarchic enslavement of the human  species  oligarchy is like slavery was a crime against humanity and its time to fucking end it  slavery didnt just end a lot of people had to fight for it to end and thats essentially the position we find ourselves in today with respect to oligarchy  anyone with the intelligence and means to understand humanitys situation has as much moral responsibility to end oligarchy as our predecessors did to end slavery and its time to fucking end it,nu55s4

2429,Why you need 'FUCK YOU' money and working towards financial independence is the best thing you will ever do,imagine you had to sign these bloody terms and conditions before choosing to be born its just insane  from the ages of 518 youre going to go to school every weekday get homework but if youre not great at memorising what underpaid bored and tired teachers have say to you well fuck you your whole life is probably fucked as youre not getting into a good college and you will end up doing important but low as fuck paid jobs for the rest of your life god forbid you have any special learning needs  youre just going to have to fucking pray that you dont youre going to spend the next best 50 years of the physical prime of your life working coz if you dont youll be homeless hungry and probably sick and die youll work 4050 hours a week and get paid less than the value you generate because that is how businesses work all the while youre expected to make it look like youre privileged to have this opportunity to not starve and die out on the street if you die before you can access retirement age well sucks to be you should have lived long enough to take advantage of all that tax you chose to pay your whole life huh but even if you make it to retirement age and dont have any debilitating diseases affecting your mind or body you will spend the final years of your life having finally the time and money but not the ability to do the things youve wanted to your whole life skiing trip forget about it travelling around the world maybe climbing everest no fucking way youre just there to witness your body slowly fall apart and if youre lucky spend some time with the friends who havent passed away and your family when they can be bothered to visit you id probably nope the fuck out of that agreement right there  just how we know that having to do something  anything makes it a chore  the freedom to explore and enjoy your life can only come once you have achieve financial independence  unless of course happened to be plopped out of the right vagina into a family where everything is handed to you  i once had this absolute prick of a boss who was so fucking full of himself he treated everyone else below him on the corporate ladder like utter shit blaming you for his mistakes lying about work related issues or just being a rude dick more than once the way he spoke to me i wanted to say fuck you prick punch him and leave but id put up with it tell myself i need that job and hes not that bad even though id spend my morning commute hoping the train crashed just so i wouldnt have to go to work that day  this was a long time ago now but it still makes me seethe and i never want to be in that position again thankfully im a fair way along in my goal of getting fuck you money so hopefully i wont have to  fuck you money means different things to different people for some it means having enough money to say fuck you and walk off when your job puts you in an unacceptable situation without having to worry about starving or becoming homeless because you have a few months or a years worth of expenses saved up and you could take your time to find a job you really liked for others fuck you money may mean having enough never to have to work again ever this also falls under the firefinancial independence retire early movement that is really popular right now for good reason thats not to say these people want to sit around and do nothing forever more although there is nothing wrong with that its just that people want to work on what they want to do for the amount of time they want to do it  on the days they want to do it on  imagine for a minute a world where everyone had a fuck you fund and with it the power at any point to walk away from their job if you didnt like the way your boss behaved or if you were overworked or you simply wanted a change it would make the world such a better place it would force bosses to treat everyone with respect and fairness imagine if you had fuck you money today would you still want to be in the same job or would you look for a new job or even go back to studying learn some new skills do charity work or just retire  while obviously we cant make this change happen on a global scale as great as it would be but we can at least make sure we and the people around us that we care the most about have the financial independence that comes with having fuck you money so start working towards it today  you can not know what you want to do with your life and what your lifes work will be until you can stop worrying about survival there is a reason the greatest philosophers artists and athletes tend to come from wealthy backgrounds theyre free from the feeling of dread that accompanies each day we have the hatred of the very thing we so desperately need to survive  obviously deciding to work towards fuck you money and actually getting there are two different things ill be creating a new post to help others like ive been helped and hopefully you too will start to see some light at the end of this fucking horrifying tunnel that doesnt involve having wasted the majority of your life generating value for a corporation and its shareholders,nt9x3i

2459,"The Current Rhetoric Surrounding ""Labor Shortages"" is just a negotiating tactic.",    please read   disclaimer i am not an expert on economics most of this comes from understanding rhetoric and how media manipulation works  there is a lot of attention on labor shortages right now mostly stemming from pictures circulating of stores hanging disclaimer signs about lack of staff and retail chains offering signon bonuses and incentives in addition we have gov abbot of texas ending unemployment benefits in his state to encourage people to return to work and montana and south carolina following suit these are all in the media to force people to go back to work through negotiating tactics im going to talk about why we need to fight these tactics this is going to be a long analysis with a lot of tangents so buckle up   1 no one is willing to make structural change yet their desperation is disingenuous   think about this if workers had any more leverage than they currently do there would be actual incentive in hiring but there isnt enough leverage yet to make real change there was an icecream shop that changed their wage to 15 an hour and got 1000s of applicants and adjusted for inflation the dollar purchasing power its still not a great wage but it was enough to attract a large enough pool that they could choose anyone they wanted this benefited the company because it creates trust in the employers makes them distinct from other businesses gives them positive attention and saves them costs from turnover rates now why arent other companies taking this approach  2 zombie companies are looking for workers to offload debt and blame onto   forced structural change from covid19 caused fear and panic in corporate america first off supply shortages and corporate debt became highly stressed  its why you see the rhetoric right now that we all have to go back to work to the offices and cant keep the benefits we reaped from working at home we saved money from commuting got more control over family life and saved more time but it wasnt as directly profitable and gave us the more control over our lives so its being attacked   as for why companies with supposed labor shortages arent just raising their wages to attract a larger hiring pool  i believe its because they dont have the capital this sounds ridiculous right how would they not have capital if executives are making 100s times more than their employees its because since before covid19 companies already had this factored into their structure finding the cash for executives is a given but finding it for employees caught them offguard they didnt know how they would be forced to increase wages to attract employees they can take on more debt but they cant lose revenue because many companies are already massively in debt and only alive because of share prices why would walmart be offering free phones to employees instead of higher wages think about it rather than considering working for a low wage let me point out the obvious  3 it costs more to work than to not work   lets go to the absolute lowest that we should even consider raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour you have to work 100 hours for a baseline of 1500 lets say you live in denver more expensive i know but i want to give an example on the higher end if you work 40 hours a week you make in a month 2400 after income tax it is 228888 subtract an average rent in denver 1200 for 108888 gas on average is 250 per month 838  average cost of food per month 387 451 after utilities phone any debt payments costs of living you would be lucky to have any money left to save you making 15 an hour will still net you debt but this is not all   you lose money by going to work it costs you in time that was 160 hours of your life that you reaped almost no benefit from it will cost you in your health in trading off time to a company that doesnt care about your wellbeing for time you could have been doing other things it took you from your family from any sidegigs or selfemployment it cost you your humanity if you work in retail or warehouse work it was not profitable for the time you gave away you were forced to adopt their wage and their burdens and you were responsible for any liabilities you took on as a worker in actuality a homeless man panhandling is netting a higher profit than your average retail worker if they arent giving you a raise you are losing money to inflation the dollar is losing its value and i wouldnt be surprised if more companies start paying us in alternative currencies  4 they dont really want workers   again there is no labor shortage yet this current trend is the media and corporate america smelling blood in the water and attempting to coerce us dont for any reason give up unemployment for slavery it is better to be incontrol and hold out i cant share my political opinions on all of this but i believe it is better for us to take care of our friends and family who are struggling than to encourage them to sell their lives to a corporation if you have enough i encourage you to help with the costs of living others may be struggling with as long as we can circulate the money between who we know than to allow any more money to be absorbed into the debt of failing corporations   think about this how can there be a labor shortage when companies are still incentivized to lay off workers most have not prioritized workers in any meaningful way here is the truth workers are a liability for them they do not want to hire anyone they want us to work for nothing all of this is a game to get us back under their control ill end it by saying that we must hold the line they will start playing psychotic games blaming us for their failures and yet offering more incentives it is all a trick stay strong and do your best to survive with the money you have,ntxsy3

2485,Here's why you need to stop blaming yourself for the state of your life.,have you ever had a boss a partner a parent or even a teacher who would belittle and hurl abuse at you for the smallest of things find any excuse to you make you feel inadequate almost all interaction with them would leave you feeling bad about yourself but you have this need to win their approval for me it was my 8th grade english teacher she was cold and condescending but i still found myself striving to try and break past her chronic indifference towards me to make myself feel worthy of her attention and approval looking back even now i clearly recall the feelings of anxiety that accompanied each interaction with her once in a while theyll do something that makes you think maybe they really do care about me and youre so grateful for this that you keep allowing this cycle of abuse to carry on just to experience that feeling one more time  then youre suffering from stockholm syndrome yes that stockholm syndrome  today you may feel captive in an unhappy life watching your friends and family get that prestigious job the large house or the beautiful spouse that you yearn for everyday you loathe yourself filled with anguish at the missed opportunities  you lie awake every night imagining how your life would have changed if youd just taken that leap  you should know that its not your fault it is extraordinarily hard to change your life because even now youre suffering from stockholm syndrome that has pervaded itself into every aspect of your life  what this means is that youve formed a psychological connection with these parts of your life over time and you are fearful of leaving them  it is familiar and comfortable and at some level you feel it is what you deserve  theres no shame in this but it is something that you need to work on to get on with your life  so how do you work past this luckily you can start with the 5 actions below   treat yourself as you would someone asking you for help  imagine a close friend or member of your family came to you with a problem that has been plaguing their life for a long time they are miserable and cant stop thinking about it  negative feelings fill their days and nights due to this problem i imagine you would set aside everything else immidately listen to their problem in details give them a constructive way to solve said problem and then follow up with them to help them through it  what you wouldnt do is blame them tell them how stupid they are to be in this position and that they should have done something sooner and its way too late now but then why do you say these things to yourself everyday  treat yourself as a priority think about yourself your problems what you want to work on and how you should go about it without free from judgement and negativity you are your harshest judge but you need to afford yourself the very basic courtesies you would to anyone else  once you learn to follow this on a regular basis it will make a powerful change to your life and rapidly too this is because any advice you give others while meaning well it will always be based on incomplete information but when you apply this exercise to yourself it will have insights no one else can give you  practice saying no  is there someone to whom just the idea of saying no to makes your blood run cold maybe its your domineering boss or a strict parent do you see yourself as a nice guy who doesnt want to be a bother and always goes along with what your friendspartnerfamily want to do whether it be where to go on dinner or what movie to see or even where to go on holiday  you may tell yourself you dont really care or that youre just happy going with the majority but the reality is each time you dont speak up on what your inner desire deep down you feel just a little bit bad  this feeling of repressing yourself compounds and can get lead to negative consequents  when you say no youre telling yourself that what you want matters yourself and others around you will respect you more just to be clear it doesnt mean you need to always get your way win every argument or only ever go to dinner to a place you choose  you just need to express yourself stop repressing your true feelings and just that simple act in and of itself will create a positive feedback loop within yourself to stop repressing your emotions leading to a happier healthier you  make changes in your life youve been avoiding due to fear of judgement  think about how if you did not care what people thought of you how would you live your life differentlytry not to focus on the past just on what changes you would like to make and what obstacles you may face in doing so  for example if i wanted to stop drinking but id be worried about how ill explain it at the weekly work outings what reason would i give to those asking me why im not drinking i might worry will they think im an alcoholic trying to cut back or will they resent me for trying to preach about cutting back  and for that reason just to avoid this i might just end up drinking and tell myself its just this one night  you see how easy it is to rationalise not making changes to your life for fear of judgement  this can be incredibly harmful in the long run for your physical and mental health  what exactly this is will of course vary from person to person but what is true is that just identifying how you want to change your life and what is stopping you from doing so is an important first step in actually doing so  surround yourself with people who have the qualities you want yourself to have  for better or for worse people end up becoming like the company they keep youve probably heard this before but it merits repeating for good reason  more than anyone else people are influenced by their closest friends this is because advice from most sources is unwelcome even intrusive when compared to just normal conversation and feedback with your best friends your views and habits are influenced disproportionately by those of your friends than any other source  this can of course be a double edged sword if you have a friend who smokes you yourself are 61 more likely to be a smoker yourself this goes for a lot of things including happiness health and confidence among other things  so take a look around and make sure youre in the right surroundings  plan prepare pratice  there is a reason that virtually everyone tasked with dealing with customers whether it be telemarketers salesmen or it support have premade scripts that they follow  it gives them confidence and structure which is important to achieve your goals  whatever you want to do or achieve structure a plan on how to go about it prepare a series of actions that will let you carry out that plan and practice doing the actions on your list  now do them again over and over again until youre so confident in these actions that youve ingrained them in your subconscious you should be able to do them without thinking about them once youve done this you will undoubtedly achieve your goal  its as simple as that  overthinking and overpreparation are shockingly the bane of a lot of people who want to make changes to their lives  practice your life until it becomes your life  i hope these help you  and if youd like feel free to reach out and leave a comment about your

2516,A bit of commentary about my WFH experience,so ever since lockdowns had started in my area somewhere in germany last year i got some wfh experience and it was absolutely miserable i was initially doing job training for it last spring when i was 16 and my boss expected me to work 8 hours a day 5 days a week at home for some reason which i find very stupid it later turned out that none of my workmates had woken up at 730am like our boss had wanted to i didnt either and i dont manage to wake up before 10am at the moment anyways  there was also some table or something like that online yknow in a link my boss had sent to me in which i had to put in how many hours i worked each day which i find weird the second lockdown through last winter became absolutely miserable by six weeks in with a third lockdown from late april through late may which i found quite annoying  i later figured that i dont expect to work more than six hours a day in a workplace away from home and three or four hours a day at most if i have to work from home i also figured that i will set a certain work quota each day and log off once im finished with the work quota i will elaborate on that last part in my next post,nsc1jc

2576,My general work experience thus far,so in my previous post i talked about my experience with remote working aka wfh workfromhome in this post i will expand to my general work experience  last year after the first lockdown had ended last may i attempted to clock out at 3 pm because thats what i knew at the time however i was stopped and told that i have to ask the boss if i can leave which made me feel awkward when i asked my boss if i could leave at 3 pm he told me that i could stay there through the night   later the work i was doing became too confusing and i eventually became bored as i couldnt finish my work so i resorted to just browsing reddit all day as i didnt have the courage to just go home i guess i didnt want to feel awkward again so that may have factored into that  after that i just continued browsing reddit all day yknow when i managed to complete my work that time around so a young woman who was with me at the time a supervisor iirc told me to ask for more work from the teachers which also felt awkward i did it reluctantly after resisting slightly and i feel dumb for that now  last september i was literally raging as i randomly got a powertripping woman appointed to be in charge of me and she was just so freaking annoying she appeared to be in her 60s so i guess that shes a boomer not sure why i added it in this post lol  finally i tried to do the assigned work my way with like 12 attempts midoctober and every single one of them failed thats when i realized i was backed into a corner so i threw a fit and then left afterwards  i wouldnt ask my boss if i could leave or tell him i wanted to leave because i wouldnt have it with the same response as before and also it just felt awkward first time around and i wasnt having that either  i later figured that i will set my own quota for work to do each day instead of asking for more work once im done since the latter is just unbelievably annoying ime,nt3jpi

2607,On Optimism and General Strikes,this sub is a huge fucking bummer not because anyone here is wrong theyre painfully right in fact its just the attitude of being beaten down by capitalism with no hope of getting up  in spite of how collectively boned well all be if things dont get on the right track i remain optimistic that the world will get better it has to get better otherwise were all dead and if were all dead then none of this will really matter will it theres nothing to fear because we have nothing left to lose  i see signs that things are getting better people are leeching off unemployment benefits in record numbers as they should the edelman trust barometer shows that 80 of people no longer believe that working hard will lead to a better life were waking up to the fact that the system is broken that the economy no longer works for us and that were not getting the returns from a society we paid into the only logical conclusion is to check out and refuse to play the game  we have to remind ourselves every day that we have the power here that the system only functions on the back of our labor that the pigs rely on us to make their product and line their pocketbooks we can collapse the house of cards in a matter of days but we cant do it alone we can only do it by banding together and never budging no matter what  so with all of that said how does one organize a general strike over the internet does it start here whos willing to step up all thoughts and feedback welcome,nsanjw

2615,Indeed.com keeps rejecting my honest 1-star review of my old crappy job. Ill just post it here then,locations and personal details will be redacted  i worked in the location redacted branch for just under 3 years before i was let go due to downsizing this job is a deadend endeavor and you will be wasting your time working here there is no potential for advancement within the company no overtime reduced work hours when theres not a lot of work no potential for a raise and the benefits are very basic my mental health took a huge toll at this job with my time here many things over the course i worked here had to be axed because management realized they can get away with treating their employees like robots  favoritism among specific staff was very apparent you cannot talk at all during work and you will be let known of it if you do except if youre a favorite you will be lectured by upper management for being less than 5 minutes late to work or leaving work 5 minutes early despite there being nothing to work on staff belittles other staff and sometimes they get chewed out pretty brutally for small and trivial errors they do not care about the wellbeing of their employees and will extract as much labor out of you as they are able   there is no training at all for your specific position in this case mine was document scanner literally just given a sheet of paper with instructions you are left with no understanding at all of what youre supposed to do in the grand scheme of things no idea about the hardware youre using as well as the software and told the very basics of how to do the most basic operations of the machine to facilitate the project youre supposed to scan and nothing more then if any issues cropped up with the documents or machine you were left in the dark and forced to walk up ask questions sometimes the supervisor is not there so you can get left stranded sometimes it took me a lot longer than it should have how to entirely operate the machine because they dont have enough people or time to properly train their staff on the plethora of random thingssituations that can potentially come up sometimes you are left in the dark on purpose for a specific error issue or task you need being done and have to walk up and ask the supervisor simply because the error is out of your job positionexperience management is uncoordinated and nobody has the patience to sit down for a few minutes and teach me how to operate a piece of software that other people who have been in the company longer and also have the same position as me know how to use  heres a specific example the job requires the file name to be exact and proper for the client if i a document scanner make one small typo for the files i have to scan thats potentially thousands of files outputted that have to be renamed which is a very time consuming process to rename them one by one the windows 7 operating system does not have the ability to let you bulk rename files there is software that allows you to bulk rename files i have to every time there i make a small typo walk up and ask my supervisor to use the software for me to bulk rename the files sometimes the supervisor is not there and im stuck with a folder full of wrongly named files that need renaming   if they had just sat down with me for 5 minutes once and taught me how to use the program then id never have to walk up and ask for their help or worry about the supervisor not being there when i need assistance  two months into me working here i made a trivial error where there is a label on the entire stack of physical documents that demarcate a specific chunk of documents within the whole stack to be scanned double sided and not all single sided nobody trained me on that when i was working here for the first two months then immediately when i make the mistake of scanning the whole stack single sided i get written up for poor job performance and got scolded and blamed for messing something up that i wasnt even trained on or let known in the first place   they dont have the time patience or energy to help you get a better understanding of your job and train you but have plenty of energy to quickly jump on you if you do wrong even the slightest certain staff have belittled me and made me feel stupid several times for asking questions or trying to get a better understanding of certain aspects of my position there was a lot of condescension and a overall additute of superiority among higher staff like to them i am a child who needs every detail explained thoroughly its very infantilizing and patronizing  you often have to do the work of two people in one job the machines constantly break and they will keep repairing them until they completely break down at the expense of the safety of employees there a days where this job erodes your mental health and you will get very angry and stressed out with the machines because they will keep breaking down with the combination of both workload the machines having issues and the prep quality of the work coming to you it makes you feel hopeless and out of control some days  there was little to no overtime preceding covid19 and they reduced hours significantly if there was not enough work to go share between the whole company sometimes youre left doing very menial tasks like sweeping wiping down desks folding letters etc and having to pretend to work simply because you are not allowed to leave when there is nothing its very degrading to your self worth as a human being sometimes you get full days off because of the lack of work which i prefered as im better off doing literally nothing than sweeping a warehouse for 8 hours  the only thing i regret not doing when working here was quitting earlier this job has taken an absolute toll on my physical and mental health over the time working here and the only way to make myself feel better for all the time ive wasted is warning people to not make the same mistake that i did i apologize for not being professional as i wanted but if you were at where i was at you would feel the same way,nt1mpe

2625,Anyone who is just anti-work?,im pretty sure this post is gonna get downvoted into oblivion but whatever last time i saw a lot of people complaining about the ancaps on this subreddit so here is my response  so you see i hate work work makes me miserable admittedly i am a very privileged man as im a software developer working from home but 40 hours is still too much for me i am also privileged to live in a country where i receive 21 days of annual leave plus 10 governmentassigned mandatory holidays something all the americans would kill for but i still feel miserable now i wasnt happy before wageslavery either  i have been depressed for 9 years before that and if i had my way my only interaction with human society would be buying groceries because i am antisocial and ultraintroverted but it was still such a huge downgrade in my quality of life before that my life was browsing the internet till 3 am im a night person waking up at 11 am eating lunch spending the rest of my day petting my cat playing video games and browsing the internet compared to that having to wake up at 7 am to commute to work then coming home at 7 pm because commute on public transport takes 2 hours so 9to5 really was 7to7 for me was a huge downgrade i was already depressed before but this made me even more depressed even after we switched to remote work i still resent work  well that was an overly long segue  what i wanted to say is i came to this subreddit assuming that antiwork just means antiwork hatred towards the concept of fulltime employment and a desire to make work optional eg via a universal basic income however much to my disappointment what i found is a subreddit full of hardcore communists who believe that you cant be antiwork without also being antirich without wanting to redistribute all the wealth without ending free enterprise without beheading everyone who has a net worth over 1000  who else on this subreddit is antiwork in the literal sense of the word without anything extra but still thinks that capitalism can be salvaged eg via a universal basic income that covers the basics or just simply wants to make work optional without the need to eat the rich who else on this subreddit is just antiwork in the literal sense of the word without anything extra  and to all the hardcore leftists on this subreddit if the rich offered you to make a compromise not saying that itd happen just saying hypothetically and implement a universal basic income that covers the basics while automating away all the unpleasant work  why wouldnt you accept it isnt the goal to abolish forced wageslavery,nsq1ki

2637,I feel like there is only one way out,ive been thinking about this a lot lately i just graduated university so im coming into adulthood now and the daunting idea of paying income tax housing tax bills healthcare etc essentially paying to be alive is looming ever closer  when i was younger i had so many dreams of how my adult life was going to be the adults around me at the time were all so optimistic and made me believe i could be and do whatever i wanted to do i was very self assured and confident in my future but now that i am actually living in that future and am in that adult world i feel hopeless the fact that to be a person you have to slave away in a shitty job wasting your limited time on this earth to earn a bare minimum just to stay alive is horrendous the fact that basic necessities like food water shelter and healthcare arent free is atrocious   our society has made it so that even a simple and regular life is basically unattainable even if you work 95 5 days a week you still wont be able to afford more than bare minimum wtf is up with that  freedom is unachievable recently ive just been wanting to escape to the countryside and become self sustained but even that costs a lot of money and would require years and years and years of working in an unhappy miserable career  you have to work and be a wage slave in society or society doesnt want you if you choose not to work and go on benefits everyone else looks down on you and sees you as an undesirable leech the only way to be truly free of all this is to exit society and the only way to exit society is to commit suicide but even that is frowned upon and seen as a horrendous thing to do it was once a criminalised act because they dont want people to exit society they want everyone to remain as cogs in their system without freedom they dont want people to feel as if they have a way out  honestly though i am starting to see suicide as the only option i dont want people here to take pity on me saying that or think i am making a cry for attention etc etc i literally just think suicide is the only way out of a capitalistic world i dont want to participate in this society that has been set up i dont want to work everyday for the rest of my life but i also dont want to starve or be homeless so what other option do i have  i hate that this feels like my only option i was so excited for the future so excited for my adult life but the harsh reality has slapped me in the face and its incredibly stressful and upsetting,nraxw4

Those who oppose work have to remember this isn't as easy a choice for poorer people &amp; that political action is needed for it to happen,a tiffanyferg v 16 hours ago edited happy to see dentist philosophies like these treading totally agree the emphasis has to be on class solidarity and support of labor movements rather than individualistic solutions      know sometimes people dont like hearing wealthier people join these discussions because their struggles are nowhere near the same as what lower income people experience but id rather have the more privileged people on our side than to see them align with the interests of the owning class working class people should lead the movement but the support from wealthier people can be very useful  think  of we can collectively work together toward stronger social safety nets and increased wages people would be able to work less afford to live comfortably and have spare time for hobbies leisure community work and activist the possibilities  how less ,nrby89

2712,Any gurus/experts on corporate-speak(bs) willing to help semi-desperate soul out w/paid resume coverletter help? Pretty desperate tbh!,sorry i know this isnt exactly up antiworks alley but its closest to my sensibility overall  im prolabor and human endeavor and antiwork  not full on  4 days is a minimum acceptable standard wliving wage amp some vacation that i could reasonably say is a fairish compromise and reasonable step in the right direction 6 hours is ideal and im v unhappy about the jobstylecreep of 95 to 8596 wunpaid lunch how exactly did that happen theystorians im not looking for an answer it happened is the point and thats on the good end of things and if work is your joy and your about it all the time good for you do you workaholism maybe can have some good outcomes but also can be a problem that maybe one might wanna address in a bestbetter case scenario  like a lot of people in this space im very proproductivity its hard to be healthy mentally and emotionally and arguably is a situational outcome including biochemical amp genetic disposition and there are many approaches to problemsolving which is undeniably hard and inherently challenging even if you try and get all tao about it consciousness  its a lot to deal with honestly im not trying to point fingers at culprits bystanders are culpable too and its thorny to get into how things got off the rails and whos responsible its a human tendency likely pretty biologically rooted and were just trying to figure out how to best rock and roll or dubstep or kpop or whatever make the music happen and deal with our demons collectively and hopefully maybe intentionally create rather than be beholden to our more screwed up impulses and ignorances were in this together at some level and i hope all of you have some small or great comfort and joy despite whatever challenges you have although obviously sometimes thats simply not possible in more extreme situations  i want to clarify that productivity isnt an external value it can be super productive to ones mental health and community values to daydream or even simply veg theres not necessarily a universal field theory when it comes to human beings if you wanted to throw that love word out there thats fine but clearly we also have a full gamut of emotions maybe thats a brilliance of gaming and frustration is clearly a core one we have to contend with easily leading to lowerhanging fruit solutions of anger and hate  so the whole things very dynamic  anyway back to my own situational work semihorrible workcrisis  i feel like i have to preface this by saying i feel this heavy deal of comparison to very badworse case scenarios which frankly feels kind of like messing with my head  like yes human and animal suffering has a very deep bottom and if you want to even get all existential about it even were all going to die and those we are fortunate enough to love will also die  theres some hard truths out there although personally perhaps flippantly i find living more daunting then the prospect of dying all our problems will be over soon enough until the next life at least but in the meantime  in the meantime were tying to make a go of it and make the best of it and figure this ish out to the best of our ability and hopefully grab a little joy out of the experience hey maybe even a lot  so yeah uh my job is not sparking joy and i feel this heavy oppressive energy that i should be grateful because it can be and is so much worse for so many i hope we can collectively navigate to less misery and to greater mental and emotional health   but im not trying to realize it can be worse  this is worse for me and maybe as good as it gets but im hoping and trying to get out of the path of the blows not to leave others in the path but to practice not being beat and it does feel like theres an element of abuse that its maybe useful to sidestep like in a domestic violence situation one has to kind of desperately try to extract onesself from that messed up dynamic and one might need help with that  whos fault is it the larger picture wheres the best pressure points to try and alleviate or address to some extent were all here figuring that stuff out the best we can   right now im climbing up a little hill but its a big one for me i know the whole thing is a monster with its head cut off im trying to put the head back on maybe the monsters are just really lost folk to put it mildly maybe sometimes lost beyond redemption but theres vastness thats salvageable if we can learn and create better ways and implement them  and were trying as best we can we got a lot of untapped potential humanity it can be sometimes the greatest so interesting and passionate and creative and so often times confused  but uh yeah im just looking for someone who might be able to help with a hand up out of a weird and bad situation in one micro situation in a whole lot of macro ive burned this situation im in its unsalvageable and im trying to minimize the damage at this point i didnt light the fire im a burn victim here an im trying to get out in as healthy a way as possible if possible theres a lot of people burned worse but again im trying to aim high and have a healthy relationship  if i can possibly manage to do so  my relationship with my own self and my ingenuity and ability to problem solve again just in this little micro situation unfortunately the worst in people has come out theres a whole little backstory whats that thing about all good families being alike and all bad ones badunhappy in their own way but lets just say i didnt have the political skills and charismainfluential techniques to create a pathway for the people around me to vaya con dios and im going away with learnings but a lot of those learnings are of the thingsgowrong variety its definitely been an experience but im trying to get out now asap and i guess i should try and leverage the experience to another hop in the frying pan since i could probably conceivably manage that i got in the lower rungs of the corporate world and id like to like homer simpson fade back in the bushes down the road i hope ill be able to contribute to more dynamic and creative solutions but im not kicking the can down the road in saying hey i learned a lot in a way by experiencing this scenario the 95 wait i mean 830 to 530 and its probably good i had this experience  also it was definitely practical even if it came at a high cost and i probably have one more jump in me if i can manage it to make use of the so very minimal privilege and opportunity   a lateral jump obviously its not my scene its not anybodys scene although i tend to think most of us really do get off on and get into being productive but we have those daemons and primitive tendencies to contend with and potentially hopefully navigate i was really into it and tried to be a good egg but obviously the conditions frequently dont support that and this was not the exception that proved the rule overperforming in my very underperforming way did not ease the way in the random vagaries of my particular situation it just set the stage for an untenable bad story again not a unique story or situation but i do feel like there is some oportunites for learnings there some idealism remains although im not sure what exactly like how do you be high performing in a healthy way how do you be that trendsetter in a cultural environment that gets everybody on board to functioning smoothly i missed a better era of my department again a lowlevel one not fancy wsocalledprivileged  i was hired at the tail end of an era which is why i took the job but then the longstanding lower level manager took a hasty exist and things changed thats why she took the exit its clear anyway i was kind of a virgin even though im a million years old and was a kid more than a million and a half years ago but still yeah i did that a little bit for a long time years more than one years multiple years plural years   i should probably do it another year or so but then again im not a practical person  and this situation is on its last legs i learned the job plus a lot of other skills not political those skills remain pretty flat and i could do this job in another company i have one shot at that possibly with a jump otherwise that ship is going to pass and ill need some other scenario maybe better maybe worse but i might be able to manage a practical onemoregoround in a new place without the baggage of the unsalvageable personal relationship dramatrauma   this would require resumes and cover letters and might be a long shot anyways my chances would be much better with skilledprofessional help  i could pay or beg or beg amp pay for that finding its the problem but i dunno if i have it in me to make a res let alone cover letter at the best times im not gifted at that so meybe i can pay some one to talk that corporate speak for me in order to make an escape otherwise its just a waiting of who will blink first and im not sure who id put my money on or what the timeline will be i just know someones gonna blink im pretty sure i dont see that situation as sustainable and its definitely not healthy for me i dont see a light at the end of that tunnel and i dont think im going to have any epiphanies  so i doubt anyones made it this far but anyone wiling to take pity and help me with resumecoverletter for same job elsewhere or any recs for people who do that for   ampx200b    ampx200b  thanks everyone hope you all survive and really hope you get a some chances to thrive i think one thing people miss about the value of this space is that it helps just to talk about things bringing awareness can add value in itself im not really trying to demonize a system or a group i can roll with enlightened capitalism or selfinterested altruism or a system redesign or even incremental change and worse case scenario at least it was a wild ride and a bunch of people did get to have some good experiences of course we wish to try to be mindful of those who suffered and try to honor that is some way in the fullness of our souls people make mistakes sometimes really really really inconceivably bad ones minimizing harm if one can and maybe even leaving the door open for redemption and for more optimal solutions to achieving a greater sense of well being seems like one leg of an approach thats maybe worth exploring there are a lot of ways to try to tackle problems which is really a very basic fundamental of the human condition,nrrxpz

2753,"Capitalism doesn't care about if you contribute to society, it cares if you make money.",often our critics wonder how would people contribute to society without the incentive of money money is not the only incentive to contribute to society and many people want to contribute to society because they care about their community but they may not care about making money  some forms of contributing to society may not be skilled enough to get a job but they are still valuable things to do  ways that people contribute to society without making money   being a parent  organizing a free store to give away items  being a good friend  volunteering at a charity organization  going to protests and rallies  sharing art that you dont want to sell  making blog articles  this is why capitalism is bad it values a person more just because they make more money a billionaire is seen as more valuable to society because he owns all the factories and makes a lot of products even though he has a monopoly on those products and hes seen as more valuable than the single mother trying to raise her two kids into functioning members of society how is that fair,nqcbrl

2815,I need to vent about the slap in the face I got today,    strapin guys this post is about to be long and i dont care if it gets like 2 upvotes i just need to get this off my chest  so about 2 years ago i got this awesome job that was perfect for me i could work part time in the year while going to school and it was full time in the summer the boss was great and i liked the other employees and i felt that they respected me i had worked in back breaking jobs like a factory before and i hated it and this was a calm office job with a bit of customer service i maybe would not have done this for all my life but i would have at least kept going while i was still in school honestly great experience  but then the pandemic hit i worked at an essential service so work did not stop but everything changed the old boss quit because of burnout and the new one sucks probably got here by licking balls the employees i liked quit and got replaced by people that obviously do not respect me i got social anxiety but with the old employees i could still have a decent conversation with the new ones i say hi and can you pass me the pen and that is pretty much it these changes sucked but it was still tolerable  but then today the boss tells me to meet him at 2pm he tells me that at 7am leaving me stressing all day and starts the meeting by asking me what i strive for in life kind of a weird question and i give a bullshit answer by saying i like learning and getting better he then says hes thinking of cutting my hours because i dont have the drive or initiative for the mission when the job is just a repetition of simple tasks and a bit of customer service he then says im not made for this kind of job which is kinda true tbh because this a social job and im not really social he says hes not going to fire me but only make me work for like 5 days a month the big days he also sneakily said that hes going to make me do things i never done before and that are above my pay grade and hes questioning if ill be able to do them but then at the end of the meeting he says that hes not going to cut my hours if i present him with a letter proving him why im worth this job i say present because i cant just write the letter and send it by email he wants me to read it to him and sell myself at the same he gave me a week to do this so to keep my hours i would have to write a whole letter then go to the office on a day im not working then perform the letter to him and beg for my job just to have a chance of have the same schedule i had with the old boss i found that honestly dehumanizing and cruel i legit almost cried oh btw since this is a student job the government is literally paying the company to have me full time for the summer so its not like its a money problem   so my options are quitting and going through the torture of finding another job keep the job but with way less hours or go through his stupid games to maybe keep my hours this fuckin sucks,nq39xq

2817,Should we make a GoFundMe for this?,after following this page for a long time i have begun to be more open to the idea of asking people for financial help when you could survive on your own technically we could continue to live out of my inlaws house for the next year or so until we save enough to get a place of our own but i dont know that that is the best for our marriage i figured you guys would have an interesting perspective to share on whether or not people would actually donate or if they would see us as lazy this is what the description of it would be plus it explains everything  after living with noahs family for 6 months after getting married in january we are looking for an apartment of our own emmas car needs over 1000 in fixes plus purchasing it from her parents for a similar amount noahs will most likely need that amount or more in fixes very soon we have medical debt and we will have to start paying off emmas 70000 in student debt within the next couple of months with 5000 in the bank currently theres not a lot to go around of course noah is currently working at a job he enjoys and emma will be getting a part time job soon nevertheless we are very anxious about the future and dont know when well be able to afford a place of our own and pay off emmas debt while still building up our savings and ya know enjoying life  the reason for asking for 5000 is because we want to have at least 10000 in emergency savings before we would feel comfortable saving up for things like a house traveling and the possibility of children in the future  we dont want to ask for help but after a lot of contemplating and praying we have decided to create this gofundme since we had a very small wedding and no one was able to participate in a registry as is customary  i told my mom about this and asked her advice she said she would be embarrassed if i made the gofundme citing the fact that i havent gotten a job yet even though i was a full time until early last month and my car stopped working 3 weeks ago and we havent been able to affordfind the time to get it fixed i think its not a terrible idea to ask for some help while also finding myself a part time job since i also take care of all of the cleaning laundry and most of the cooking because my husband works full time of course she argues that i should get a full time job anyway because if i can do it so can you yeah but youre miserable all the time mom what do you guys think would anyone donate or would they look down on his for not pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps and being miserable for months just so we could have a home and food,nq6udt

2865,"Current supervisors had my back re: the employer being deceptive about ""overtime""...so I walked",true story from may 2021 i was looking for a weekend job that wouldnt interfere w my parttime selfemployment i found what i believed to be the perfect situation which was as a supervisor at a warehouse for fri sat amp sun when i interviewed i was told that it would be rare and only in peak season where i would be asked to work four days per week its a warehouse so i get it i negotiated my salary only after confirming it would be a weekend only position without interfering with my schedulefamily time during the week and that four day weeks would be rare if ever this was confirmed  once i began the training jumped off the rails immediately they apparently did not realize i was starting on a monday and believed i would be starting the next day the hr person in charge of my onboarding was out until the next day they didnt know where to put me so they placed me w a supervisor to get the lay of the land after he showed me the basics i said to him so tell me what is the worst part of working here  he looked surprised so i said it a different way  we are supervisors and we have to look out for each other what am i really getting myself into that they are not telling me  he proceeded to tell me that for the past year and a half they have been working 6 days per week and the weekend shift working 5 days per week he said that they have been promised that things will get better for so long that it has become a running joke among the supervisors he mentioned the high turnover among the supervisors and that management is making decisions based upon not making things better but because they believe the supervisors are replaceable  i told my wife this and she said well maybe with you there it will get better so i returned the next day for my onboarding the hr person was not there and apparently the other 5 hr people had never done onboarding so i would likely be waiting 1014 days bc she had contact w someone who had covid   thus once again i was on the floor w  different supervisors i asked them the same question as i did the day prior and they all said virtually the same thing how can we have record profits and no supervisor support and ive been working 6070 hours per week i asked if they pay overtime for supervisors and he said no you are bought and paid for past jobs ive received overtimestraight time  this is what was irritating i negotiated based upon 3 days and not 5 each was a 12 hour workday if im going to choose to work someplace pay me for my time and dont try to get over on me  at the end of the 2nd day i had trained w four supervisors and we all stood around talking they did not say one good thing about the employer three of them had been there for years and as a result were divorced and living alone one could no longer see his children because he worked too much one more had no issue because this was the best job hed ever had he was a nationalized citizen from another country and his girlfriend also worked there with him side note his girlfriend made more than him because she receives overtime  the next day i went back in and asked the operations manager about the overtime what i was being told and how it would affect my weekend shift i didnt like the answer because it felt evasive  so i shook her hand said the position was not for me and that i feel like they should have negotiated my salary based upon the possibility of working more than the stated schedule side note that manager had been there for four years and developed so much gray hair she looked older than meim 17 years older than her  i feel like i made the right decisionand luckily so does my wife   ampx200b  tldr dont give up your life for a company spend as much time as you can with your family and if its looking bad at the beginning dont live to regret your decisionbounce,nqrj15

2869,Investor Q &amp; A the,i  own a house but my tenants cant afford the rent because of the crisis that should do  congratulations you own what is called an investment property here very sorry to hear your tenants are in trouble have you considered lowering or even eliminating rent for your tenants during this time  but that means  will lose money that doesnt seem fair to me  in the contrary returns on investment net profitinvestment cost can be positive or negative his is called risk and it is a fundamental part of being an investor you are not guaranteed to make money on investments even housing  i still dont think thats fair didnt my tenants agree to risk when they signed on to lease my house  thats not quite right unless your tenants have a financial stakecontrol of the asset they are not investors and dont share your risk they are people who deserve a place to live  well then if im an investor then im entitled to do whatever  can to get the most returns on my investment right  that depends to you think that includes forcing someone onto the street rousing is not a luxury item it is a necessity are you sure youre allowed to force people into hopelessness because your investment carried more risk than you thought  but  have a mortgage to pay off  you should join your tenants and call on the government for a rent and mortgage amnesty mortgage banks are also investors and are responsible for risk too ont punish people who cant afford basic necessities they are the ones in your community the banks are not   dont have a mortgage but  still rely on income from my rental properties that about me  of your income is affected by the crisis then you could try applying for government assistance your tenants are probably doing the same thing right now cry asking them for help ,nqll4x

2884,"Finally quit a job I've been conditioned to ""be grateful for"".",after 5 years working as a creative in a corporate environment i finally pulled the trigger on turning in my resignation this morning i have no idea what is coming next but i feel like a massive weight has been lifted from my soul and i wanted to share my story with the lovely folks of rantiwork who inspired this decision a bit of a rant but i hope my story resonates with someone who is feels tethered to a job which doesnt value them  in college i studied illustration  graphic design and have since managed to dabble with videography and eventually animation most of these skills were obtained as a sidehustle while i paid the bills working as a line cook over the years finally i got the call from the big leagues one night as i was clocking out of the restaurant asking me to be the inhouse animator for one of the biggest health care providers in the world i took their offer without blinking feeling like i had just unwrapped one of wonkas golden tickets for the past 5 years i have continued to take on more an more responsibilities in my role increasing efficiency constantly educating myself on modern animation techniques and even getting a masters degree from one of the nations top art schools in 2019 after graduating with a costly degree i began asking my supervisors what my future in the company might be after all i had begun to exceed the expectations listed in my job description i was able to arrange a meeting with my managers supervisor who was in charge of promotions in short he told me the best advice i could give you is to go find a counteroffer without that it will be difficult to justify a promotion to my supervisors on top of this due to it being 2020 with a pandemic looming over the world and the health care community at large i was told i should be grateful for having a job in the first place  this meeting spawned a 2month anxiety trip as i juggled my daily job responsibilities while feverishly applying to  interviewing for jobs around town the truly messed up part is that i learned that my supervisors technique had truly worked and that i wasnt able to find a job opening with my specialized skills after being told i was runnerup at 3 different job openings a realization hit me like a ton of bricks all of my preconceptions regarding the professional ladder ive been climbing are bullshit and the effort ive put into honing my abilities has effectively left me overqualified in a field where employers value cheap labor like platos allegory of the cave i felt like i had been operating under a false pretense of what my reality was the ladder is actually a treadmill and you dont tend to notice when your employer casually turns the pace up over time after that youre expected to appreciate the cool new muscles they helped you develop while acknowledging that you are standing in the same place you started  after feeling defeated by the job hunt i continued to chug away at my daily work feeling more depressed and anxious than ever this went on throughout the entire pandemic and the workload only increased as i started to receive word of a potential raise around the corner as my responsibilities increased my mental health only got worse living with epilepsy means that i can have seizures purely from stress something i have learned the hard way three weeks ago i had a seizure randomly after finishing one of the most stressful projects i have ever overseen while recovering over the following week a thought crossed my mind you could just quit your job  it took two more weeks of mulling over but the thought of walking away from the job right as they prepare to finally offer me a raise was too poetic to pass up the truth is i dont want to work there or any of the 20 places i interviewed last year ive saved some money from every side gig i took over the last 5 years painting murals filming weddings making logos etc and im fortunate enough to have built a nest egg for this sort of fuck it moment after setting up a meeting with my boss this morning to turn in my resignation i could not be happier with my decision when asked if i wanted to give them a chance to make a counter offer i said absolutely not  ive got no idea what i plan on doing from here but that is a really good feeling right now im on my wifes health care plan and have several existing clients for design and animation work to help me transition into being my own boss so i do consider myself fortunate grateful to have come across this awesome thread which gave me permission to think outside the box about what defines success and which helped me see the ways that companies exploit their talent i could fail spectacularly from here operating my own business but im stoked to say im done wondering what if  tldr  i asked for a promotion  raise and was told to be grateful for the role that i currently have  to find a competitive offer elsewhere looked elsewhere to find a systemwide issue with companies valuing profits over qualified talent returned to my boss and quit this morning and now they are trying to ask me to consider a counteroffer i said hell naw  epilepsy is different for everyone and my biggest factors are stress and diet,nq0ouj

2923,Here is my big rant on human society and the complete insanity of the economy!!!,temporary biological organisms such as the primate mammal homo sapiens require certain fundamentals such as food and shelter to be alive sadly in the current age  food and shelter access is only granted through the obtainment of an arbitrary made up fiction called money  money  which has only been in existence for 3 thousand years while the human species has existed for around 300000 years  and yet the majority have come to view money as some fundamental intrinsic and inescapable aspect of human life despite its presence in human life only making up around 1 percent of our time as humans and the fact that it is ultimately an arbitrary man made invention furthermore most people view it as sane and acceptable despite the fact that 8 individual men have as much monetary wealth as half the earths human population combined 25000 human beings starve to death unnecessarily every single day on this planet not due to any tangible shortages of food or recourses but merely due to a lack of purchasing power which is an unreal made up concept a famous tv star earns more money in a couple of days of filming a frivolous tv show episode than a full time firefighter earns in over 40 years of life risking service so because of our economy and thus our society is based on money and the inherent incentive structures associated with such a system  the vast majority of human beings in the modern world have to tragically engage in largely nonsensical boring unfulfilling unpleasant manipulative and destructive jobs to be allowed to be alive earning their right to be alive through this submission to work   the vast majority of human beings on this planet are not following their genuine passions in their fulfilling careers that help make the world a better place this whole idea that earning money and they way you go about that defines who and what you are and your value and it is linked to your sincere passions in life is utterly untrue and ridiculous to the vast majority of people on earth most human beings in adulthood at least are essentially doing this going somewhere they dont want to go to do things they dont want to to for many hours at a time having to be around people they dont want to be around to perform tasks that are fundamentally nonsensical unpleasant often inherently manipulative andor destructive  all in order to be able to pay for rent and food    this entire set up and behavioral pattern of the human species today is fundamentally unnecessary almost across the board in the modern age  due to the incredible potential of science and technology which if purposefully oriented to emancipate the human species from drudgery through advanced automation methods  producing a global abundance and eradicating poverty and starvation and homelessness entirely  while of course carefully maintaining ecological equilibrium could lead to a kind of world most dare not even dream about due to the current reality of having to submit to labor for survival and the general misery and hardship of the current world   this future possibility and potential is not a utopia or a perfect naively idealistic dream world but simply a vastly more sane rational and pleasant world for humankind which is possible indeed  if only a larger majority of the human species in fact had an awareness of the possibilities of the future humanity could move towards and more information and comprehension about the utter insanity of the current socioeconomic system   i urge anyone who resonates even the slightest bit with what ive written here to look into things like the zeitgeist movement the venus project and the concept of a natural law recourse based economy  and to listen to or read from for example a philosopher such as alan watts talking about these exact topics in great detail in a way that is easy to follow there are books and talks where he was going through the rational and logic of this kind of thinking  going back all they back to the early 1960s  this can help to get more of an introduction to this train of thought   these thoughts i have shared just now are not at all new radical ideas so much as very old yet largely suppressed common sense observations that have become somewhat taboo and thus more and more uncommon especially in the media and in the mainstream a lot of this common sense thinking of course goes directly against what most of us are largely indoctrinated to accept as normal but as peter joseph the film maker and social commentator so often has pointed to  we live in a world where normality indeed has become distortion the economic system we currently live under is in no uncertain terms fundamentally insane at its very core and to be somewhat depressed and overwhelmed with its destruction and insanity is in a paradoxical way precisely a sign of sanity if you are not utterly appalled and astounded by the horrendous state of human society more specifically in terms of the economic absurdity and madness  you are fundamentally one of 3 things  ampx200b  1 uninformed 2 misinformed 3 in severe denial    i hope this finds you well as a fellow human being on this planet all i can really say is i invite you to not passively accept the current economic system which is always expressing itself around you as sane or acceptable because it is anything but if you actually look at it with even the slightest bit of critical analysis,npzgq9
