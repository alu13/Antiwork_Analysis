0,Have to quit my bullshit job,"I have posted about my job before. I really dislike it, I‚Äôm a glorified administrator working on a military base. 

Before the base closed, my line manager (a military officer and all round dickhead) said I am in stage one of the formal disciplinary process as he is concerned I‚Äôm not working my full time hours. Nor do I have the formal qualification for the job. A boring health and safety certification. So why hire me then idiots? I never pretended to have the qualification but they‚Äôve decided I need it. 

As I don‚Äôt want to be dismissed after their little kangaroo court, I resigned and turned in my 4 weeks notice on the spot which he looked really surprised at. 

The kicker is, he said my work is of very high quality. I spend 90% of my time at work reading my Kindle, playing games on my iPad or browsing the Internet. Sure I take long lunches and I don‚Äôt have any timesheet or anything to track my hours.

2,[Discussion] I quit my job after one day of work.,"Hey everyone. I am really curious to know How many hours a week do you work? 
I accepted a job that was 1 hour away (each way) for pretty good money. But I‚Äôd be working 5 10 hour days of physical manual labor (and half saturdays!). A part of me feels guilty but it was so hard! Leaving at 6 am and coming home at 630pm still having to make dinner and prepare for the next day. Id never see my family as I would be in bed at 9.

It was too much. I was on my feet all day landscaping.  My co workers were so happy to work 50 hr weeks-it‚Äôs just....so sad! Do you not have a family or hobbies? Others would call it laziness....but I am too young to work my life away while my body and health are in good shape. I want to walk in the parks, garden, do things FOR ME!

3,Do you discuss work with with your significant other?,"My wife and I usually talk about our days when we get back home from work. We both think that it's good to know how your partner's day went. Over the years, however, we can go through periods of time where work was too much to bear, and we tell each other to not even ask about it. We've lived it, and don't want to spend time talking about it. 

I'm conflicted on how to feel about this. On the one hand, when work has particularly sucked that day, the last thing I want to do is talk about it, but on the other, if I can't talk about it, have I given work too much power over me?

10,What have you internalized?,"""I am a hard worker.""

I was rummaging through some of my elementary school assignments, and found this as a common theme in how I described myself. And, it's very much true. I always chuckle whenever I read a post about how much so-and-so hates the super productive worker; the worker who goes above and beyond; who voluntarily takes on extra work; who sacrifices their self-interest for the betterment of the group (the Company). Because I was that person.

I started working once I was legally able to do so -- at age 14. I worked a minimum of 31 hours weekly. I was so loyal and productive for the Company that I'd even voluntarily work through my break time. Years later, when I landed a factory job, I remember feeling very useless and irritated whenever there was nothing for me to do.

This has all changed recently after a few life experiences and realizations.

The psychological influences that shaped my behaviour are so complex that I can't possibly write it all out here, but to put it simply:

I feared alienation. All the environments I grew up in, the culture was: Your value is what you produce, what your status is, how useful you are, and how closely you obtain what *we* deem valuable. You needed these things to be 'accepted' and 'humanized'; otherwise, you were an outcast. And, that disconnect from community, your peers, hell -- even from your parents and family, leaves a deep psychological scar. So, I learnt and internalized to accept authority, and to submit to its demands. I learnt that everything that I was to be had to be aligned with others' values. I internalized that my worth and value as a human being was solely derived from my economic output, my productive labour, and attaining those things which others ascribed social value to.

So yeah, that's a very, very simplified version of my experiences. What have you internalized?",False,bj1plq,Shadows-of-Hiroshima,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bj1plq/what_have_you_internalized/,5,21

13,Found this comment under an 80s Japanese funk song and it reminded me of this sub,"Charlie At 11 months ago

Oh yes, Japan in before the bubble burst in the early 1990's. It was the beginning of the
end of Japan's infallible economy. Everybody, including the Japanese thought it would
never end. Only a few short years later, Japan's economic bubble would pop and
lifetime employment as they knew it would be over. Suddenly, we found that the
Japanese workers were not so much unlike American workers or British workers or
other workers. They didn't necessarily enjoy being owned by the company and giving all
of their lives to the company either.

Most Japanese men of that generation retired with few hobbies or interests beyond
work, yet they were forced to retire young. They were like living ghosts. The Japanese
workforce of today is not like this. They are much more like their western counterpart -
working to live instead of living to work.

21,Anyone ever had a problem getting a job after a period of being able to not have to work?,"So me and my wife both hate work.  Just the concept of how it's structured is so terribly demoralizing that I wonder how I'm going to make it through the rest of my life.  I've had several kinds of jobs and they are all terrible.  The bosses, corporate, bootlicking employees, etc.  You guys know the drill.  

Over the past 6 years me and my wife have taken turns at being the sole provider while the other takes some time off, usually 5 months to a year, to try to enjoy the better aspects of life.  We have 6 animals but no kids so we are pretty good at budgeting to accomodate the sort of lifestyle we find worthwhile.

I got laid off from my last job and got a pretty nice severance package plus unemployment.  At the same time my wife got a decent paying job so I've lived without the burden of work for the past year and a few months. The times coming up though I can tell my wife is really starting to hate her job so I'm on the depressing quest to pick it up from my end.  

I'm a little worried about how to get another job with a 14 month period on my resume where I can't account for.  ""Playing with and raising newborn kittens while exploring artistic endeavors"" unfortunately doesn't appeal to HR or hiring managers.

Do I lie on the resume? And if so, how?  What do you guys do? I didn't even get Walmart to call me back about a position and a lot of my resume is filled with grocery and grocery vendor experience. 

Anyways thanks for reading. I wish all you the best, comrades.

23,"Has anyone here read ""Homo Ludens""? - a book on the profound use of play (opposite to work?)","What really is the root issue I take with work is how it claims to be meritocracy but actually perpetuates toxicity and misanthropy. Instead it's a broken meritocracy that values how well you fit as a cog in the system, how obedient you are even at the expense of skill, quality or wisdom, and how likely you are to willingly bully those under you if you move up in the chain. To me, being so anti-autonomy in work culture is ultimately anti-play and destroys purpose. If I discover enough workplaces are this way, which appears true in the 7 years I've worked, then my goal is to boycott and do something valuable based on true wisdom that actually is supportive to the lives of other people. I won't go to work everyday, I'll go to play.   


"" In Homo Ludens, Johan Huizinga defines play as the central activity in flourishing societies. He identifies five characteristics of play: it is free; it is not ‚Äúordinary‚Äù or ‚Äúreal‚Äù life; it is distinct from ‚Äúordinary‚Äù life both as to locality and duration; it creates order; it is connected with no material interest, and from it no profit can be gained.

So I totally get it. 

But I was just wondering if there were any circumstances where you'd either like or could live with your current job or if there's any kind of work that would make you not feel that way.

I know I'm rather 'privileged' in a sense that I've never had to do work I hate to keep a roof over my head (privileged in quotes because the reason for that is that I'm eligible for a bunch of financial support from the state for disabilities). I've never had more than the absolute bare minimum either, but that was trade-off I was willing to make. I'm opposed to the concept of work on an ideological, intellectual and emphathetical basis, not emotionally from personal experience. I delivered mail for 4 years which I honestly loved, pretty much total freedom, but I do think the fact that it was only 10 hours a week contributed a great deal to me not getting fucking sick of it. I'm back in school now getting my high school diploma because I never finished because of the aforementioned disability, and I'm planning to go into teaching, which, if the disinterest for a subject I love from teenagers that don't want to be there doesn't make me want to kill myself in 3 months, would seem like a pretty fulfilling job.

Would any of that apply to you? Would a substantial reduction in hours make it at least bareable? Would you hate your job and work in general as much if it was only 20 hours a week or 10 and you'd still have enough to live?

I think most industries and positions within most industries are mindless rat mazes to ensnare working class people so that they are too tired to pose any threat to the leisure class. However, jobs like mine aren't so easy to say ""Lets reduce the hours to off set the increased production."" Children deserve people who care watching over them.

&gt;!I related alot, those men in prison, not being free, and that hunger for freedom. And Brooks on the other hand, being in prison so long he became institutionalized. I cried during the movie... It made so much sense. !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

But work is no different, its slavery, I can't take it any longer. Im also sad to say that for me too ""everyday is the worst day of my life"".

&amp;#x200B;

I just worked 10 hours today and im mentally fricking drained, not only I worked 10 hours but I dont feel much satisfaction from it, basically 0, Instead of feeling atleast some sense of accomplishment I just look at the mistakes I made today and hope I can get thru till friday to I can finnaly rest up a bit before another inevitable shitstorm.

&amp;#x200B;

Well let me think up my options, being a 21 year old who just started working an have been for like 9 months now that im done with school.

&amp;#x200B;

1. save up money, buy land, spend as little as possible, make some money from the land (honey, eggs, vegs etc.), and just try to sell an ammount so I can cover my basic bills or whatever i'll have to pay up, like taxes to the scam government or whatever.... who knows.... Too bad when I mention this or come remotely close to saying it to my parents they just shrug it off like its some silly nonsense. I like this option the best, it involves living without a job or atleast working 2-4 months out of the year to pay for may basic needs and save a small bit for the future. Also maybe get on unemployment/welfare from time to time.
2. Run off to the woods/drop out of society completely. Scary one.
3. Suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont see any more options really, sticking it out is not a smart thing to do, it would eventually drive me to the breaking point and god knows what will happen then. I wouldn't last long working anyway, pension is not an option.

&amp;#x200B;

God damn work sucks I bitch everyday about it but its true. I also deeply hate people who think that it's peoples own problem they are unhappy/unfulfilled, like they need to change themselves and suddenly by accepting wage slavery they will be happy. Bullshit. I understand and agree with Accepting things as they are but I will not settle for wage slavely longer than I have too.

49,I used a coworker's computer to do our project.,"I am no longer at this job, but I was reflecting on this job that I had where I was an Office Support Technician and my coworker was a complete and utter shithead asshole. The job was pretty chill and stress free; all you had to do was maintain and service clients' printers in 5 huge corporate AT&amp;T offices, and sometimes service their computers. The job got plenty of downtime.

I really don't feel like going into detail because every time I tell the whole story I get pissed off all over again, so to make a long story short: I held down that job site by myself until this doofus came along. I trained him and yet he was a complete and total rude jackass to me; yelling at me because I didn't say ""good morning"" one morning, telling my supervisor (who was stationed in another state) lies about me to try to get me fired, etc etc.

So we had a project we had to work on, and the project was to split up the corporate buildings and go on each floor to count how many HP and Canon printers were being disposed of. At the end of the day we had to meet up to put our recorded information into Excel. After we finished the the spreadsheet, my coworker was supposed to be the one to email it to the supervisors who were all in Georgia. 

I was still counting printers since the buildings I had contained more printers, and he sent me a text to my work phone telling me that he already entered his information and he wanted to meet up so we can work on the spreadsheet together. At this point, because he had been being a total dumbfuck asshole, I no longer wanted to work with him. So I came back to our office and used his laptop to attach my spreadsheet to his and then I emailed it to the supervisors.

I get chewed out by the supervisors for using his laptop and pretending to be him sending the email. They ignore the fact that I had been telling them about his jackass behavior for like 3 months and yet they still wondered why I didn't want to work with this dweeb. They all talked down to me, and they even let my coworker call me names during the conference without even letting me tell my side of the story.

The job is very low pay and has a high turnover rate. I wish I would have known that shit about the high turnover rate before I signed up for the job.

55,The current way of living makes it hard for people to leave the big cities in favour of living closer to nature and off the land,"I am a 32 year old dude who wants to leave the slave temple that London is, and move somewhere warmer in europe, closer to nature. My plan is to find a small town that would allow for me to buy my own old traditional house and refurbish it, then grow vegetables, chicken etc.

BUT the only big problem is that there are mostly no young people living outside the huge cities of europe. 
Society has brainwashed the current generation of young people into moving and working like slaves for the rest of their years in the big cities, with promises of high status, consumerism, promising careers and whatnot. This young generation cannot even fathom the idea of ever leaving their ‚Äúimportant‚Äù cubicle jobs, for a life of peace where they would do something meaningful alongside their family, in nature, as people used to do.

In light of this, it makes it hard for the rest of us to do this because we, the younger ones, dislike the idea of living in town or villages with old people, without a great energy and a youthful vibe. 

My prediction is that the powers that be‚Äôs plan is to eventually have everyone living in big citadels, where everything is controlled and monitored, and where going out in nature would only be allowed for a very short time and only based on some reward system based on how obedient and productive you were.  Living in nature would be off limits for us, but not for the elite, obviously.

Why cant kids just be kids?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Because work is unnecessary except to those whose power it secures, workers are shifted from relatively useful to relatively useless occupations as a measure to assure public order. Anything is better than nothing. **That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt go home just because you finish early.

&amp;#x200B;

It's both obvious and insightful.  It's something everybody knows is true - that workers are forced to pretend to be busy or make up bullshit to do rather than just leave or do their own thing when there's no actual work to do, and even much of the actual work is made up as an excuse to occupy them.  It's also something most people don't think about in that way.

I used to be an assistant manager at a clothing store and most of our employees were teenagers, they would constantly call in sick and I could never fathom how they had the balls to do that. Which I know is silly. I can count on one hand how many sick days I've taken in the last 2 years.  However whenever I do have call in or even if I'm late to work due to traffic I feel guilty as hell. Even if my coworkers don't actually guilt me. I had to call in sick yesterday because I came down with something over the weekend and my boss never even responded to my texts, so that ate at me all day.

83,[Rant] Just got back from a very frustrating interview,"Ok, so I'm looking to change jobs since the one I'm currently pays really below average to the point its hurting by ability to support myself.

I go in for this interview today, which is the 3rd round already, with the Marketing Director. So I take my time to prepare, research, all that bs.

I get there 10min early (the interview is scheduled for 8h30am). It is 8h50 and they haven't called me yet, when another candidate shows up (maybe it was the one scheduled for 9h00am?)

When it is like 9h05 they call me, and I'm already pretty pissed at this point. Turns out, the Marketing Director is too busy to interview me, so a manager comes and guess what: she haven't even read my resume, so I have to lose several minutes explaining my experiences. 

Out of nowhere the Marketing Director comes and I have to start explaining things again (turns out que didn't read my CV either...) when his phone rings and he abruptly leaves the room.

So after I finished the interview I know I pretty much bombed it as the manager has no further questions and wants to check if the Director has any. 

So she leaves the room and I proceed to wait another 10min until the director comes and ask me a very dumb question and thanks me for my time. I leave confused while I overhear they talking in the background that I'm not what they were looking for (no wonder, they didn't even read my CV).

Maybe I'm overreacting, but I never felt more disrespected in an interview. I'm seriously considering writing about it on LoveMondays (our version of Glassdoor) and even complaining to their HR (which will accomplish nothing, I know).

I tried speaking to a couple of my other former coworkers about this, but they seem to blame this coworker for not asking for help. But upper management knew that handing someone three jobs would be extremely stressful, and they chose not to hire anyone else and also put a lot of pressure on this young woman.

94,Ok so I thought I liked our VP at first but he‚Äôs watching us like a hawk,"He was really cool and laid back it seemed. He didn‚Äôt want us staying late or doing too much when we didn‚Äôt need to. 

But today I found out that he got onto a coworker for coming in late.. which makes no sense because she has been coming in between 8-9 for the entire year that I‚Äôve been here. And now suddenly it‚Äôs a problem? I usually leave early on Fridays when no one is here but my coworker warned me that the VP is watching us. So I guess if he leaves I‚Äôll sneak out and get back online from my laptop before he gets home so he thinks I‚Äôm still there lol. 

He also told us we have to take our laptops home every single night. This pisses me off because not only is it just an annoyance to have to pack it all up and lug it to and from my work to my car, then my car to my apartment, but it makes me accessible at all times. Which, they can always reach me by phone. Except now they can reach me by phone to tell me to do something after hours. It moves all my icons to my laptop screen which I literally don‚Äôt use bc it‚Äôs too small and then when I hook it back up to all my main monitors the icons are all fucked up. And I have them in a specific spot and order for easy navigation. So it‚Äôs a waste of time because I have to sit there and move it all back. I understand having us take the computers home when there‚Äôs a big storm or something... but every night? ‚ÄúJust in case‚Äù? That‚Äôs ridiculous. 

My manager has also been snooping through all the emails. Yesterday she was like ‚Äúso I saw in the __email that you have no more stuff to upload‚Äù I‚Äôm like... whyyyy are you going through my regions email when I‚Äôm the one who handles that region... you legit have no reason to be looking through it. 

Pro tip: if your company has a Skype for business IM system... change your settings to wear it doesn‚Äôt save any of your conversations.

Another pro tip: on Skype for business you can change the settings to where it doesn‚Äôt go inactive for hours at a time. I have mine set to indefinite so I can be ‚Äúworking from home‚Äù and just leave and my computer will show that I‚Äôm online. Also works when you wanna take a long lunch.

3)I don‚Äôt like that I‚Äôm being forced to move regions

To concern 2) he said the goal is to finish as early as possible but then basically said that there‚Äôs nothing he can do. Then insinuated letting the temp employee go. I said.... uhhhh ‚Äúhaving only 2 employees in that region won‚Äôt work‚Äù, he sort of back tracked by saying ‚Äúyeah I know but‚Äù and then made excuses instead of offering solutions. Then said ‚Äúwell if one region isn‚Äôt finished there shouldn‚Äôt be one person staying late every day‚Äù... so if they don‚Äôt finish their job I have to do it for them and stay late? Do I need to reiterate again how much I DONT plan on staying late every week? 

To concern 3) he said I need to learn the other region... which like... I get. But I don‚Äôt need to do it every week permanently to learn it. The manager is taking my region and giving me hers because mine is more manageable.

99,It's 3pm on Sunday and I'm crying because tomorrow is Monday,"Sigh.

I'm 20. I'm a chemical engineering student. I did really well in my classes in school, and got hired for a ""co-op"" position at a nearby chemical plant. These positions are very highly regarded and competitive, everyone in school, my school, and the employer told me it was such a great opportunity. Basically, it's like a long-term internship that you take time off of school to do. Because working hard in school does pay off ...right? Right??

It's been 4 months now and I'm quitting pre-maturely. I was initially signed on for 12 months. My supervisor changed roles, a month into me being there, and essentially stopping providing any help or mentorship from that point onwards. I had a co-worker who was sexually harassing me and trash-talking me to others. I did my best to separate myself from her and move offices away from her, but I still see her every week day. She has been incredibly cruel towards me. 

My hours are 7:30am-4pm. But factoring in commute, I'm pretty much busy from 6:30am-5pm each day because of my job. Because I need to get up so early, I need to be asleep by about 10pm. So that's a daily 5 hours of sentient free-time on this planet when usually, a person has 16 hours (with 8 for sleep). That's fucking thievery.  I see my co-workers more than I do my boyfriend, who basically is my family. Isn't that messed up? 

I really just don't give a fuck about my job. Management and people issues aside, why the fuck would I care about making more plastic (our main product), faster and cheaper? In fact, I realized that in order to add value to our planet, I should actually sabotage any efforts of this very chemical plant! To provide ANY value in the situation, I should do the absolute bare minimum and get paid to fuck around, and make things more complicated and more costly for others! Maybe donate a good chunk to some environmental groups. What a crazy situation!

Because the ""co-ops"" here don't have degrees yet, they've also classified us weirdly. We're ""salaried"" workers to prevent us from unionizing (like the blue-collar workers here do), but with no health insurance, vision, dental, PTO, or vacation. I make good money, \~$50k/year, but what is that worth without healthcare, without any time off, with a pushed back graduation date, and basically no free-time in my life anymore? The past two weeks I've just been laying in bed whenever I'm not at work. I've lost a lot of weight. I've felt really trapped. I do not feel valued at all. Additionally, I'm doing what I could get paid $70k/year to do with a degree. I don't care about the money primarily, but I should get a fair wage. 

In school I was living on about $22k/year. I was happy. Even with the crazy difficulty of my courses, I had time to see my friends, my boyfriend, and be amongst like-minded and caring people. I wasn't tired. I wasn't depressed. I did things that mattered. 

\-

I did psychedelics for the first time, a little before I started my job, which is perhaps how this whole thing started. I know it sounds really crazy, but it was probably the most meaningful thing I've encountered in my life. It showed me all of the connection that I had to myself, to others, to every living creature and the planet. It helped me heal so many wounds. 

However, I honestly want to bawl, thinking of the billions of pounds of plastic that I have helped produce while working here. I am so sorry to the Earth and the plants and the animals. Please forgive me, please. I am lucky to be gifted with a school-minded brain but I feel as though I have used my power for evil and for destruction. I cannot believe how much I have helped to destroy our planet. 

Wednesday is my last day at this job. In a couple weeks I'll continue my schoolwork. 

It's at the point where honestly when I get up tomorrow morning, it's going to take everything in me, to not keep driving past the plant, and into the nearby woods and lay down amongst nature and do something actually meaningful and exist there instead. All just to keep a stupid bullet point on a stupid resume to get another stupid job like this, to looks good and smart and to make good money, that'll again get in the way of doing something meaningful. 

It would take some maneuvering but perhaps post-undergrad I could do something useful. I'd love to become an academic researcher, with more of a medicinal-chemistry bent. I'd love to help the legalization and propagation of psychedelic medicines. I know it sounds a little nutty. 

But is it more nutty than selling away my life to be a human-cog in a slow-burning machine built to destroy our planet and sell it out for human greed? That'll sell me out as well, when it gets too greedy?

I worked for a retail chain for a little over seven years. During that time I slowly climbed the ladder from a cashier up to an assistant store manager. It was a long and arduous process, but it was also my first and only job during that time. I started off at minimum wage of 7.35 and made it to 12 during my time there.
The way our stores were oriented only allowed two, and on rare occasions three, employees in a store on a day to day basis. My day‚Äôs were a constant waiting and worrying that the next employee would even show up to work. Everyone wanted a pay check and not a job. A concept I didn‚Äôt understand until now....but at the time it helped add to the pile of mental anguish I had to endure. 
Towards the end of my work life, I was working 60-70 hours a week. Paid overtime is a perk, but it wasn‚Äôt worth my mental health anymore. So I finally decided to quit. 

I enjoyed seven months of a job free life. I had a nest egg that helped supplement my life with my girlfriend, but it only lasted so long until I needed to get back into the market. 

So I started a job at another retail chain. They started me out at the same twelve an hour I was making before doing twenty times less work...


But the problem now is that I‚Äôm having panic attacks everyday. I feel forced to do this just to be able to live my life. I feel forced to do this to provide for the woman I love. And all of these things combined drive me insane everyday and I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself to cope with it. 

I want to quit, but I feel so stuck. 
I have dreams of maybe making video games someday, maybe try twitch streaming. I just want to do something with my life that I enjoy and can sustain me at the same time and I feel like I‚Äôll never get to that point.

133,Bullshit Jobs (book) by David Graeber,"My first post here, I just discovered this sub. 

I recently read this book Bullshit Jobs
Has anyone else read it?
I highly recommend it to everyone in this sub.
It goes really in depht to pointless jobs and why they exists. 

Personally, the book just blew my mind
I'm kind of perfectionist who would probably keep myself busy even without job, and I have been so frustrated with every single job I had. 

I'm studying programming because I think it as best way to make ends meet and have possibility to change jobs and spend longer periods of time unemployed and work at home. And I'm actually interested in it. 

I feel like all my previous jobs have just drained my energy and creativity to make something actually meaningful. Now I have been unemployed for 9 months thanks to social security system in my country and some money I inherited and never before have I been so focused on my personal goals and needs so much in my life. 

I believe this kind of chance to explore one self with enough time should be possible for everyone. I understand it wouldn't work if everyone just stopped working, but everyone should have a year in their life when they can focus on themselves and figure out a plan for their future that they don't hate.

I would love to hear your thoughts about the book or your relationship with this world where everyone is expected to grind all their life.",False,bhnp7n,S13Ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bhnp7n/bullshit_jobs_book_by_david_graeber/,5,21

135,"Private to Public Industry- Same Grind, Different BS","I'm a guy who will be turning 30 at the end of this year. Since I graduated college at 22 I've worked in the private sector. For the past couple years I've been feeling burnt out. I began to resent the fact that my time/efforts are sacrificed to afford a select few the luxe life and those same few will always want more.... often at an expense to me. So when my former employer sold the company and the new corporate overlords came in handing out the kool-aid while slashing benefits such as 401k matching I peaced out.

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking it would be a great way to remedy the burn out I've been experiencing I sought out employment in the public sector. Specifically within public education. I now work for business services at a local school district. My thinking is at least now my time is sacrificed towards supporting educational opportunity for the community. The position is also represented by and union and has what I would consider good pay and benefits. In theory, I'll even be able to retire with a pension.

&amp;#x200B;

However, since starting a little less than a month ago I am beginning to see the shortfalls of the position. From an operational stand point (what I deal with on a daily basis) I find it insane that my agency is often legally obligated to obtain goods and services from vendors who do not provide the best deals. This is a direct result of the public bidding process. A laughable bureaucratic nightmare I'm willing to ignore since any chance of meaningful change would need to start with state lawmakers improving regulatory policy. For now I will wag my finger at teachers purchasing office supplies from Amazon instead of buying the same product at a higher price through a state contract approved vendor. My motives behind accepting the position remain the same. Don't sacrifice my time making someone else rich, support the community instead while making a decent living. 

&amp;#x200B;

My real issue with the position came to surface just this past Friday. Most the people I work with are 20-25 years older than me and empty-nesters. Not to say there's anything wrong with that. I just don't have a lot in common with my new coworkers. As such I've kept pretty much entirely to myself. I've participated in exactly zero seconds of water cooler talk even though there's plenty of it happening.... Most of it is just run of the mill friendly coworker stuff with a side dish of bitter, old, public employee grievances. The biggest Negative Nancy happens to be the employee who's in the same position but senior to me. She has spent enough time complaining about how things used to be and how close she is to retirement that within the first week I adopted a ""watch out around her"" mindset. On Friday she stopped by my desk on her way out and expressed her opinion of ""I know young people, their phone is their life but you spend too much time on your phone and you really shouldn't be doing that."" Complete with scrunched nose facial expression and all. It took everything in my power to not ask ""Are you f\*\*\*ing serious right now?"" Instead I said OK and told her have a nice weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest I figured this was going to be an issue. On several occasions I've finished my lunch at my desk and taken the rest of my break in my car to escape her leering. I got the impression she was probably counting the seconds I spend on my phone without actually knowing when my break starts or ends. 

&amp;#x200B;

So... now my plan is on Monday to speak to my manager. My thoughts are I'm going to suggest I keep my phone in my car because I don't want this to be an issue for Negative Nancy but more importantly for me. But also the way Negative Nancy approached me with with the ""youngin's"" comment makes me think she just has a personal problem with me (biased towards young people) and there's always going to be a next ""you shouldn't be"" situation with her. I'm fine with the dogma of ""while you're being paid you should be on task"". But it needs to be applied evenly not just for phone usage. I doubt if I approached Negative Nancy and said something along the lines of ""I know you're old and don't like change but you shouldn't be gossiping about how things used to be and how much you're looking forward to retirement while you're on the clock"" she'd like that very much or see the merit in it even though the principle is the same. I figure at least if I talk to my manger there's some record of it and I'm expressing my own concern on the matter instead of letting Negative Nancy dictate the situation. Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Bitter public employee who spends her days complaining about change tells younger coworker(me) he spends too much time on his phone. I think her statement has no merit and she just has prejudice towards anything that isn't the status quo.

136,Have you ever broke the rules at work because you didnt want to work with a bad coworker?,"I am no longer at this job, but I was reflecting on this job that I had where I was an Office Support Technician and my coworker was a complete and utter asshole. The job was pretty chill and stress free; all you had to do was maintain and service clients' printers in 5 huge corporate AT&amp;T offices, and sometimes service their computers. The job got plenty of downtime. I was reflecting on the job because I liked how low stress and chill it was. But I had to leave because some stupid dipshit that came to work there.

I really don't feel like going into detail because every time I tell the whole story I get pissed off all over again, so to make a long story short: I held down that job site by myself until this doofus came along. I trained him and yet he was a complete and total rude jackass to me; yelling at me because I didn't say ""good morning"" one morning, telling my supervisor (who was stationed in another state) lies about me to try to get me fired, etc etc.

So we had a project we had to work on, and the project was to split up the corporate buildings and go on each floor to count how many HP and Canon printers were being disposed of. At the end of the day we had to meet up to put our recorded information into Excel. After we finished the the spreadsheet, my coworker was supposed to be the one to email it to the supervisors who were all in Georgia. 

I was still counting printers since the buildings I had contained more printers, and he sent me a text to my work phone telling me that he already entered his information and he wanted to meet up so we can work on the spreadsheet together. At this point, because he had been being a total dumbfuck asshole, I no longer wanted to work with him. So I came back to our office and used his laptop to attach my spreadsheet to his and then I emailed it to the supervisors.

I get chewed out by the supervisors for using his laptop and pretending to be him sending the email. They ignore the fact that I had been telling them about his jackass behavior for like 3 months and yet they still wondered why I didn't want to work with this dweeb. They all talked down to me, and they even let my coworker call me names during the conference without even letting me tell my side of the story. I am still trying to repair my self esteem from what happened and I think I have a long way to go.

140,Tired of being shafted,"I seem to only be able to find jobs that need me there all the time or that suddenly and without warning cut my hours down to shit (10 - 15 a week). I'm a college grad that got ""lucky"" and landed a job from an internship I did my last year of school. I'm an English major  so i was pretty happy to find something applicable. Working in social media wasn't my highest ideal, but it paid well and gave me a lot of time to dick around at work. 

Fast forward to actually getting employed by that company and having a conference out of state, the VP of the company (who was a total control freak) tracked me down and asked me why we hadn't made any of the days posts on Facebook. I told her I do end of the day updates for Facebook and live updates for Twitter. We never came up with a plan, but that was my first mistake in thinking she was a reasonable person. 

She started screaming at me about how no one uses Twitter and it's all about Facebook. That wasn't true at all, I had the analytics to show how engaged people were and Twitter was better for live events. Didnt matter though, she started railing on me in front of my boss who happened to be doing some other work in that conference room. Pretty much said she regretted even bringing me on this trip because I was useless and she could have done my job better than I did.

That conversation set the tone for the entire 3 years I worked there. I was so afraid of seeing her like that again, which happened from time to time. I did everything I could to stay out of her hair, but something was always my fault. 

Towards the end, my uncle passed away and we shared very si.ilar philosophies at one point. Work less, play more. Be creative, buy your own land to have sustainable living practices, etc. Having that happen made me really angry at myself for wasting so much time and money just dealing with my job, so I put in my two weeks once I found a writing gig online.

Got laid off three weeks in because they claimed they hired too many people, so I delivered pizza. Anything to avoid going back. I'm a really hard worker, but very few places have really appreciated that. Got made fun of a lot in the high school mentality environment at the pizza place, so I worked at the university in a temp position. Thought it might get my foot in the door.

It didn't. I've applied to so many jobs from janitorial to admin at that school (the one I graduated from, by the way) and all of them ended up in an ""I'm sorry to inform you"" rejection letter. 

Each job I've had either works me to the bone or is pretty doable but janks my hours without warning, leaving me in a crisis. This last crisis  I had a revelation: why not spend very minimally and work very minimally? I was alone in that idea, but it has been very healing. 

Lately, however, I've been cut to 15 hours a week at my retail job. Found another job at the tourist trap in town as a supervisor which would also allow me to sing and play the accordion on the boats. I had this job back in college  so it feels like wearing an old shoe. 

Just found out I'm getting 11 hours a week, even worse than before. My new boss claims that May will be a short hours month, but I don't know about this. 

I'm just tired of being seen as the creative weirdo who is really only worthy of minimum wage work. The nice jobs ive had had limited timelines or psychotic people running it. Found this sub last night and I feel I've finally found my people. I felt so alone in my philosophy about work, the only one who thinks like I do is my mom. When we talk about it, it's like belonging to a secret society because everyone around gets mad at the idea of working less and being creative. 

I just want you to know I plan on participating here and I look forward to the excellent ideas being shared here.

TL:DR Long career of being shafted, either in respect or hours. Really hard worker that never seems to catch a break. Develop a philosophy of anti work and felt like it was a small  secret society with my mom who is the only one I could talk to about it.

I know this would seem very minor and insignificant compared the problems many other people face but please try not to be too judgmental towards me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night we had dinner with my, aunt, uncle, and my mom's cousin's daughter's daughter. They all say some pretty social darwinistic right wing reactionary type things on occasion even though there is an unspoken no-politics rule between them and my household for obvious reasons. Sometimes though the type of stuff I hear is so reactionary (and sometimes straight up ableist) that I can't keep quiet and I usually would make a very subtle comment that is not explicitly political, then we would drop it. 

It started small at first. My uncle said something about ""whiny millennial snowflakes"" like he always does, which admittedly, I pretty much meet that stereotype through no fault of my own as I am actually autistic, my motor and speech skills were pretty messed up in my early childhood and my neurology is quite different. I responded with something non-confrontational that I thought wouldn't start a fight (I forgot what it was). He responded back, and this went back and fourth with us making comments at the table. Each time it got a little more political and hostile, for example he once said that there should be a war where ""millennials"" would have to fight so the majority of them don't come back alive, which was pretty much saying that I should go and die without him actually saying that explicitly. It finally got to the point where we were talking about the current state of the world under capitalism, my uncle's position was that things have been the best they've ever been because the news says so. I worked with him on coming to the conclusion that the mainstream news presents a worldview that serves the economic interests of those who own it. I was hinting at the fact that the whole reactionary worldview he has is propaganda to justify the rule of those in power. I remember the look in his eyes, it almost seemed like ""you know, you make good points."" For a brief moment, I felt a moment surprise and hope. Had I done the impossible and started to bread-pill my Reagan worshiping boomer uncle?

Then my aunt had to chime in, instead of engaging with what we were talking about she decided to be nasty and attacked me for currently being unemployed, which there are of course good reasons for, being autistic gives a whole array of resulting problems, I'm studying so I could do something meaningful, I'm lucky enough to not have to wage-slave away where I'm literally no use to anyone else. I figure, that if I'm going to contribute to a capitalist system, I might as well do it in an unalienated way where I won't want to kill myself. I'm very lucky that my household is well off enough so it's not a problem and they are very supportive/on-bored with the plan I have for my life. My aunt and uncle don't see it that way though, ""every job is useful, nothing useful exists outside of the job market and anyone who doesn't have a job is choosing to do so out of a desire to play video games all day."" is the over simplistic line of thinking that everyone is encouraged to take up.

At first it doesn't sound too bad. You see, my aunt's attitude can be so arrogant and un-emphatic, her tone of voice, so full of hierarchy and dark fascist energy that instead of calmly and rationally unpacking her criticisms so as to give her an actual understanding of myself, my body language apparently got aggressive, I raised my voice and, apparently accused her of wanting me dead (which makes a lot of sense from my perspective but not to someone like her who does not know me very well.) There was a lot of background to explain, a lot of myths to debunk, etc, etc but I had completely lost my ability to act calmly and make sense. 

I felt the temples in my head become super-heated, my visual perception changed, my hands started to shake and twitch as I went into shock. Despite all this, I tried my best to still talk coherently and I tried talked to talk about the workers who live meaningless, completely alienated lives and whose beautiful souls are imprisoned by a system that processes human beings into economic units of commodified labor. To their credit, they did not just give me the usually 'facts don't care about your feelings' shit and they asked me to explain what I meant more precisely, but I was obviously not in the mood to explain alienation theory and the current situation. Verbal conversations like this are always rigged against me for this reason.

My mother's cousin's daughter's daughter asked the table what other options there are besides working at a job with a hint of hatred in her voice. I wanted so much to be able to talk calmly to explain some core ideas of anarcho-communism, to get her to understand that we could have a world where everyone works, is self-autonomous and unalienated but I was worried about causing a scene at the restaurant so I said to them ""I'm not talking to you"" and I closed my eyes and completely disengaged myself from external reality. 

I opened my eyes a few minutes later and suddenly began trying to explain while I was still in shock how I was not against labor or work itself, that would make not sense, but I was against how labor is organized in a system where the means of production are gated off as private property. I said something like ""Everyone needs to work, but it's different when things are walled off."" I wanted desperately to explain to them that we can live in a world of free labor, where everyone is free and in control, but I was still in shock and I was not making as much sense as I could have. My stepdad who was beside me, in a sympathetic and kind voice said something along the lines of ""it's okay, you don't have to explain it,"" I told him that my ability to explain things well was compromised (as if they couldn't already see that) and I shut myself down once again. I had to leave early because I couldn't stop my tears. As I left, I wanted to tell them something to the effect of ""I don't have a problem with you, I have a problem with what made you believe all the false things about life"" but I knew better than that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm glad I made the decision to move away from here next year where I would get another chance at formal education having a social life, maybe even some work aligned with me. I will be staying with my dad then, while he is not a leftist like myself, he is a Bernie-loving social democrat who always takes the time to understand me. At least I have plans to move to away, which is good. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel ridiculous because people go through so much worse and just deal with it. There was something about my Aunt's queen-of-the-world-lecturing that I hope none of you have to experience. In the moment, I felt as if I was among enemies who wanted to kill me and my fear of being born into a world of complete darkness where no one in the world was there to hear me out had come to pass. I even felt like I was going to die, even though that's ridiculous in hindsight. I thank you for taking the time to read this. Writing this has been hard, but it made me feel a lot better afterwords.

172,"I'm in IT, a support engineer. My entire profession has no merit, and probably shouldn‚Äôt exist. Here's why:","I recently came to the conclusion that my entire profession has no merit, and probably shouldn‚Äôt exist. **I get paid a lot** to do this, and for years I‚Äôve been struggling to put the reason for my frustration into words. I‚Äôm probably shooting my own feet here, but it‚Äôs true.

I‚Äôm in IT, a ‚Äòsupport engineer‚Äô. In the past 6 years, I worked in a few level 1-3 support roles, in the beginning - directly with customers, and later on, with more advanced trouble tickets that could not be solved by call centre staff etc. I no longer talk to customers directly, I get a problem description in writing and tackle that instead.

I supported the following products in my career insofar:

1. Cable and DSL **modem-routers**, VoIP phones (entry level position, talking to end users directly). 
2. Business **web-hosting** plans (more advanced than the above) - email and websites. Helping people upload new pages and images to their websites. Helping people configure and troubleshoot their Outlook.
3. **Linux servers** for an ultra-famous cloud provider (this required the highest level of technical proficiency). 
4. A VoIP and **video-conferencing app**, including hardware my current employer provides to use with it.

In my career, I dealt with a lot of people calling/ticketing a certain product that was misbehaving. They always called and asked ‚Äúare your servers down?‚Äù before even trying to turn anything off and on again. They never believe when you say ‚Äòno‚Äô, and it‚Äôs often confrontational, even when they‚Äôre polite.

Here is the main reason why this profession is useless:

# If something works for everyone else, but doesn‚Äôt work for you - then YOU are the problem, and not the company‚Äôs software, hardware, network servers etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

To put it simply, if your website is down - it‚Äôs a LOT more likely that your code has a bug in it, or you misconfigured something, than the company's servers being down. If your VoIP calls are disconnecting, it‚Äôs not going to be our servers‚Äô fault in 99% of the cases - it‚Äôs your network that‚Äôs slow. 

This means that only 1% of my work brings any benefit to society. The rest is of my time is spent on pushing back on nonsense: user mistakes, complaints about unsupported third-party software/gadgets I can‚Äôt help with remotely, missing features that you might really really want - but we don‚Äôt, etc.

The only real merit I‚Äôve seen to call center tech support was: when many customers rang up at the same time to complain about something, there might have been an outage that our monitoring had missed somehow. It allowed us to detect it. But the detection is based on call volumes. You don‚Äôt even need the support guy on the other line for this.

There are a few maybe-reasonable counter-arguments to the above debunking of the entire tech support establishment:

**The education argument:**

Not all calls are complaints about something broken. Tech support has a supposedly educational value - you teach customers how to do things over the phone. I

 would argue that **phone calls are the LEAST effective way to teach** someone technical skills. If your grandma is unable to check her email because she doesn‚Äôt know how to use her iPhone (most of the callers on my first support roles were, unsurprisingly, elderly), then calling support is a very cumbersome way of equipping her with the necessary skills to live in an increasingly-technological world. 

I could think of much better ways to help the elderly. In a world where everyone gets universal basic income, and people would have time to volunteer, techies like me would go to nursing homes for a couple of hours a week maybe. This way, you can sit with a person and see the gadget you troubleshoot while you do it. You get to interact with a person in a natural, less-forced setting.

**The ‚Äúbut the one time, I called and I was right‚Äù argument:**

In most cases, if there‚Äôs a real outage - you don‚Äôt need to call, the company knows.  The support reps can‚Äôt do anything but tell you to wait patiently for it to be fixed. When? We never ever gave a customer an ETA. No point in calling, really.

You probably have a story about the one time you called tech support, and only after a lot of arguing with the incompetent support representative, you proved you were right - and the company eventually fixed something for you (maybe). You must be proud of your diagnostic and technical skills, even if you didn‚Äôt get the fix.

But this proves my point even more: tech support don‚Äôt have the ability to fix problems that are non-trivial, and that you would have solved anyway by looking up the error message on Google. Tech support were not equipped to help you in any way, so that the 1 out of 100 legit complaint they got - they couldn‚Äôt even identify properly. Once they were convinced you‚Äôre right and there‚Äôs a bug in the code/server issue - they did NOT fix it themselves. All they did was submit another internal trouble ticket to someone else, i.e. a network engineer or a software developer, who never spoke to you directly. 

To summarize my point, tech support just blocked you and delayed you from reaching a solution. By the way, you might not be fully aware, but when very big customers have trouble - they don‚Äôt call tech support. They have an account manager that skips the offshore call center, and goes straight to the devs who can fix it.

\*\*\*

Suppose you agree with me, and acknowledge that dealing with angry customers, and being put in a confrontational position where you have to prove people wrong (‚Äúour servers are fine, it‚Äôs your configuration that‚Äôs causing the error message, sir‚Äù) is unhealthy/stressful for employees and brings no benefit to any of the parties involved. That would beg the question, **what‚Äôs the alternative?** Here‚Äôs what I suggest:

1. **Automation** \- my web hosting job entailed a lot of over-the-phone domain registration (imagine people spelling their-company-name.com to you over a bad line), or email hosting plan signups. You could do these things online too. Why is it ‚Äògood‚Äô customer service to do it for them? It‚Äôs just prone to spelling errors, customers don‚Äôt know the radio alphabet. Companies allow that just because they see these calls as upselling opportunities. Many companies these days don‚Äôt even let their call center staff take credit card details over the phone anyway for security reasons, the customer gets transferred to a system that allows them to key in the number. The customer might as well have done the whole process online. The same trend is already happening with password resets.
2. **Monitoring (again, automation)** \- companies keep very close track on server traffic, error messages etc. Don‚Äôt waste your time calling, and waiting on the line for 25 minutes with thousands of other affected users, to ask ‚Äúare your servers down?‚Äù. If something is down, the alarm bells are heard already.
3. **Just Google it** \- official and unofficial product documentation. You learn better by searching ‚Äúhow do I connect to an AWS EC2 instance by SSH‚Äù and following the guide, then calling and have someone remotely connect to your laptop and click the buttons for you. Whatever is the issue you‚Äôre struggling with, you‚Äôre not the first one. Many others had the same problem, and there are free videos and guides all over the web. I‚Äôve seen so many people in IT who had no real education in the field - they learned it all online. Users don‚Äôt have to have the same level of proficiency, but there are ways to get help for your specific problem without calling. Easily.
4. **Nothing** \- some products/services don‚Äôt need tech support at all. I‚Äôve had a @gmail.com address for 14 years and it works fine. I never considered calling Facebook customer service, or Netflix. Whatever I needed to do in my gmail/Netflix account, I did online without calling. I don‚Äôt know if they even have call centers. If they do, they‚Äôre probably offshored, have no server access, no ability to help and just recite answers from the website that I could have looked up by myself. 
5. **Better technical education** \- see above grandma example. Give everyone universal basic income. Those who like teaching tech would find other venues to do it, instead of wasting their time in flak-catching jobs, absorbing customer anger till they grow bitter and cynical.

Sure IN THEORY you'll get fired, but their misery doesn't end there as now they gotta replace you numb nuts with a whole bunch of new people who don't know what they're doing, and do it quickly.

Pull the fire alarm. You're an employee, you say you smelled smoke, they have no choice but to believe you, hashtag believe employees lol. Big distraction and cuts into profits.

What I'm basically saying is if people are too antisocial to organize workers unions, atleast herd like a bunch of cats to bring contempt and pain to others.

182,I don't give a fuck about work ethic and I cheat the system every time I can,"I originally posted this on the confession sub but I think it fits better here


TL;DR I don't feel any bad about cheating but being around passionless drones seems to be bad to my wellbeing. I'm not from the USA.

I work in HR I'm a recruiter/administrative. My CV says that's I have 3 years of experience, all a lie, well, technically now I have 8 months of experience. I'm very good at faking it in the interview and in my CV, I only need maximum 2 weeks to get a new job. My degree is a easy but very creative trick. I went to university but for a very different degree.

I've fired 4 times this year, either because I stopped caring to pretend that I do the bare minimum or because management caught me before. I spend not more than 2 months in every job. I don't give a flying fuck about my job or anything related to it, at the beginning it was fun to watch how most of my coworkers cared too much about their ""bullshit"" job while I just chilled and said fuck it. But now is starting to be a burden; seeing how my coworkers don't have a life of their own, seeing how they are just drones that think that their bullshit job is appreciated outside of their meaningless circle of ""human resources bullshit"" now it seems an insult to life, an insult to living a life that is worth living.

Those bullshit jobs are just a stepping stone to me, I only need a little more money (2 months more) to invest and then I'm going to stop working full time, I'm going to use most of time on my personal projects and maybe in some eventual part time jobs. Being a bartender seems interesting. I do this kind of jobs because they are easy to get and I can slack most of the time. Getting a job related to my degree might take more time and maybe I will have to work seriously.

Have you received one of those annoying calls where someone try to sell you some garbage that you don't need and you clearly see how what they are selling is garbage and they are just waiting to get someone dumb enough to buy their garbage? I'm in the HR department in charge of this kind of positions. My coworkers think that finding someone desperate enough to take this kind of disgusting job is somehow and important duty.

I don't feel bad about cheating to get a job, I'm proud of finding holes in any kind of system and exploit them to my benefit (...and hoo boy, I've exploited a lot of different holes).

190,"""It is a civilization of noise, smoke, smells, and crowds of people content to live amidst the throbbing of its machines""","It is a civilization of noise, smoke, smells, and crowds of people content to live amidst the throbbing of its machines; the smoke and smells of its factories; the crowds and the discomforts of the cities of which it proudly boasts. 

The places in which the people work are noisy. The factories are filled with the recurring, though not the rhythmic, noises of machines and the crash and clatter incidental to their operation. The offices, too, are noisy with the rat-tat-tat of typewriters, the ringing of telephones, the grinding of adding machines. The streets on which the people move about, and around which they work and play, resound with the unending clatter of traffic - the roar of motors, the squeaks of brakes, the shrieks of sirens, and the banging of street cars. And even the homes in which they are supposed to rest are noisy because they are not only packed close together but built tier on tier so that the pianos, phonographs, and radios in them blare incongruously above, below, and on all sides of them. 

The people of this factory dominated civilization accept its noisiness. For noise is the audible evidence of their prowess; the inescapable accompaniment of their civilization's progress. The greater the noise, the greater the civilization. Above all, this civilization is ugly because of the subtle hypocrisy with which it persuades the people to engage in the factory production of creature comforts while imposing conditions which destroy their capacity for enjoying them. With one hand it gives comforts - with the other hand it takes comfort itself away. 

The servitude to the factory which it enforces uniformly upon all men harnesses skilled workers and creative individuals in a repetitive treadmill which makes each muscle in their bodies, every drop of blood in their veins, the very fibres of their being, cry out in voiceless agony that they are being made to murder time - the irreplaceable stuff of which life itself is composed. For America is a respecter of things only, and time, why, time is only something to be killed or butchered into things which can be bought and sold.

191,Changed jobs 3 times during my 8 year career - interviewer said a job hop too much.,"Ok, so this is more of a rant than anything, but certain notions in the head of HR interviewers are getting ridiculous. 

I don't get this notion that we have to be loyal to a certain company for no good reason. It is obvious that if a company pays their employees well enough and provide a good work environment, they won't be changing jobs. But usually they don't do neither.

Of course, I can see why it would be convenient for companies if employees just stuck working with them ignoring the job market, but it is not fair when they will 100% fire you in less than a month's notice if you don't perform or behave according to their expectations. 

This kind of thing is one important factor why most office workers are so unhappy - they are literally chained to their jobs as later it will be frowned upon at interviews if they just decide to quit or if they change jobs frequently. 

I'm absolute sure I'd be more happy if I could work for, say, two years, quit my job, travel for six months and then work two years more &amp; repeat this ad infinitum.

208,I'm tired of people being fed nonsense about college and the role that it has on their lives,"Society harasses people into going to college and honestly I'm sick of it.  High school students always hear this nonsense from their ""guidance"" counselors and parents about how they need to go to college after they graduate.  They just promote it like it's the end-all to all the troubles in life.  These kids are being fed BS.  When I was a freshman in high school, instead of being mislead for 4 years by the assumption that I needed to go to college right away, I much rather would have had someone telling me to take a gap year to figure out what I wanted to do with myself. 


As someone who has spent the past 5 and a half regretful years in college, the best advice that I can give to anyone younger than me is to take a year off after high school and to do some serious introspection.  Figure out who you really are, what you want your life to look like, what you're good at, and what going to college really means. Don't let society, your friends, or even your parents harass or guilt trip you into going to college.  What nobody tells you is the following:


**1.) Nobody is going to be helping to pay off your student loans.  And thanks to predatory practices, you'll be paying them off until you die.**




**2.) Nobody tells you about how more than half of your college experience is a repeat of high school courses that you don't need.**




**3.) Nobody tells you how it physically, mentally, and emotionally feels to be a holder of debt.**




**4.) Nobody tells you how even after wasting your mind, body, and soul on degree, that you're not entitled to any job opportunities or a sustainable living.**




I cannot stress enough, if you have a skill that will allow you to operate outside the norms of this system, please find it and hone it.  This isn't a post telling people not to go to college, this is a post telling people not to let society guide that decision for them without considering their options first.  There's too many people who think they need degrees when all they really need is their individuality and creativity.  You don't need a degree to highlight pre-existing talents, you just need to find them.

217,"Choice, Consent &amp; Disappointment","First of all, **thank you** for this sub ‚Äì it‚Äôs been a relief to come here after a long day at work to find validation, or blow off some steam watching other people blow off their steam.  I've learned a lot, and ya'll are the best üòä 

&amp;#x200B;

I find myself on [r/antiwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork) due to three central themes in my life:  choice, consent, and disappointment. I came from an abusive family growing up, so control is important to me, choice is important to me.

Growing up, my dad‚Äôs rule was, once you started high school, you get a job. There was no explanation given as to why; more importantly, I wasn‚Äôt given a choice. My dad didn‚Äôt *ask* I wanted a job, he *told* me to get one. I didn‚Äôt know why I needed a job ‚Äì my friends and I didn't need much money to have fun (we went to each other's houses or walked around the local Wal-mart, lol), and as for college, well, I was just going to get scholarships and financial aid. No, the issues was, choice was taken away from me in the process. I might still have wanted a job if I had the option to, but it‚Äôs not something I GOT to do, it‚Äôs something I HAVE to do. That's still true today. (I've also realized that, in public school at least, I could get some of my social-emotional needs met from teachers. My teachers *loved* how polite and hardworking I was, and how well I paid attention in class. I got some of what I didn't get at home at school. I don‚Äôt even get a fraction of that at work.)

As I‚Äôve grown and matured into a healthier adult, the issue of work has festered in my mind. It‚Äôs plagued me. I‚Äôve beaten my head against the wall, trying to solve this Chinese finger puzzle: why do I struggle so much with work? Why? The harder I pull against this idea, the more I‚Äôm snared in this trap.

In maturing, I‚Äôve learned that choice is incredibly important n relationships. I‚Äôve learned that I don‚Äôt have to be in any relationship I don‚Äôt want to; not only does that keep me safe, it makes the good relationships that much better because they are a choice. I GET to be friends with nice people and have a nice partner because they make ME feel GOOD. If someone treats me poorly when I‚Äôm honest and vulnerable with them ‚Äì like my family - I owe it to myself to PROTECT MYSELF and WALK AWAY. Is it hard? Does it hurt? Yes, because then I have to rebuild another area of my life and find another way to support myself, but like removing a sliver from my finger, it‚Äôs best in the long run. I‚Äôm an active person, and I love to be busy. I very well might CHOOSE to have a job if it was a CHOICE, but I CAN‚ÄôT. Therefore, until it's a choice, I believe I can never really know if I would actually want a job. It‚Äôs an apparent paradox: how can I ever really know if I want something if I'm not allowed to leave it whenever I want?

This leads into my latest introspection as to why I struggle so much with work: disappointment. I went to college wanting to do well and setting high expectations for myself, and I take some responsibility for not doing as well as I wanted. I know I was capable of getting straight As, but wasn't aware of the tools and support I needed until after college; at age 29, I feel like I‚Äôm just gaining the awareness of what I need and skills to ask for those things *now*. But even as I‚Äôve grown into a healthier, more mature person, job after job continues to disappoint. I trust myself more now - I've done the work - and I'm beginning to believe it's not me.  It's the job system that continues to disappointment me, time after time. 

I want to honor the belief I once had of what jobs, career, and life after college held. They were the epitome of promise and hope. But after five years in college and seven years of job-work - not to mention time spent in high school, even before that, envisioning what this life would be like...I‚Äôm at a point in my life where it just can't be me anymore. Part of it is the unrealistic expectations I set for myself, but I was also raised with the belief that if you do well in school, go to college, and get a degree, you‚Äôll easily get a job in your field ‚Äì and then, you‚Äôll be happy. This *can't* be it - *this* can't be what I was looking for and working toward, for thousands of hours and years of my life.  There's nothing here, it's just...life; there is pot of gold or light at the end of the tunnel.  And I absolutely *refuse* to believe it's because of me - because after literally thousands of hours of work and effort, I've been ""doing it wrong"" this whole time?!   *Jobs* are disappointing me. I *loved* going to school ‚Äì friends, learning, what‚Äôs better than that? *Jobs* have been **so** disappointing to me. In what other relationships or experiences in my life do I get so few social-emotional needs met? Where else do I have to confront authority head-on? I‚Äôm not an authority in any other relationship in my life, nor do I answer to one. Seriously‚Ä¶this is it? 

&amp;#x200B;

These days, I'm faced with the reality that I will need to adjust my expectations for what I job is, and maybe what a job can be, to survive and live a happy life. It feels like my experiences at a job are, more or less, what they were in high school ‚Äì a way to make money, fun at times, boring at others, but not the main event of my life. That was fine in high school, but that *still* feels like how they are today. That wouldn't be a problem, but they were built up over the years as being this big, colossal thing, and compared to what they *really* are, they feel like such a disappointment and let-down.  I am very grateful to be among a community of people who get it, so we can grieve this loss together.

220,Henry Miller was antiwork,"While I was reading Tropic of Cancer I came across this interesting section and just wanted to share it with you guys;

""In everything I quickly saw the opposite, the contradiction, and between the real and unreal the irony, the paradox. Even as a child, when  I lacked for nothing, I wanted to die: I wanted to surrender because I saw no sense in struggling. I felt that nothing would be proved, substantiated, added or substracted by continuing an existence which I had not asked for.

Everybody around me was a failure, or if not a failure, ridiculous.

What was most annoying was that at first sight people took me to be good, to be kind, generous, loyal, faithful. Perhaps I did possess the virtues but if so, it was because I was indifferent: I could afford to be good, kind, generous, loyal and so forth,since I was free of envy.

From the very beginning I must have trained myself not to want anything too badly. From the very beginning I was independent, in a false way. I had need of nobody because I wanted to be free, free to do and to give only as my whims dictated...

In my bitterness I often search for reasons to condemn them, the better to condemn myself. For I am like them too, in many ways. For a long while I thought I had escaped, but as time goes on I see that I am no better, that I am even a little worse, because I saw more clearly than they ever did and yet remained powerless to alter my life.

At a time when others were getting themselves comfortable berths I was taking one misarable job after another, and never enough in it to keep body and soul together. Almost as quickly asI was hired I was fired. I had plenty of intelligence but I inspired distrust. Whereever I went I fomented discord- not because I was idealistic but because I was like a searchlight exposing the stupidty and futility of everything. Besides, I wasn't a good ass licker. People could tell at once when I asked for a job that I really didn't give a damn wheter I got it or not. And of course I generally didn't get it. But after a time the mere looking for a job became an activity, a pastime so to speak. It was a way of killing time, no worse, as far as I could see, than work itself. I was my own boss, I had my own hours, but unlike other bosses I entrained only my own ruin, my own bankruptcy. I was not a corporation or a trust or a state or a federation or a polity of nations-I was more like God, if anything.

This went on for a while, well...until one day I was trapped. Finally the day came when I did desperately want a job. I needed it. Not having another minute to lose, I decided that I would take the last job on earth...""

Like all of you, I'm sick of working and work absolutely destroys my mental health, work-life balance, and literally everything in my life. And I'm also not a morning person so imagine going to work everyday not having enough sleep. Last month, I called it quit and I have been unemployed since. I really needed the break and decided that I should take at least one month off before going back to work (I only have savings to survive two months comfortably, four months uncomfortably). Unfortunately, being normalized to capitalism, ever since day 1 of being unemployed, I've been so worried sick about not being able to secure my next employment and all the fears around not having money (being homeless etc) that I have not been enjoying life at all. I literally am looking up online for job postings everyday and have been applying non-stop. A friend told me that I should consider doing part time side gigs, physical or online, but I have no idea around how to do it or if it's enough to support myself financially during this time. For what it's worth, I really only need a side gig to delay my next employment because I really need this time off. Have any of you done this before? If so, does it help financially? And how do you do it?

Honestly, if I have the choice, I would love to just not work but we all live under the supreme reign of capitalism so we have to work. To me, I don't mind working so much (actually I do mind), I really just hate the whole 9-5 thingy and I work best at my own pace and time.

253,I walked out of a $21/hr union job after 8 years and it was the best decision I‚Äôve ever made.,"I worked my way up from minimum wage in a large retail company. For a few years I was enthusiastic about drinking the corporate kool-aid, moving up the ladder and just ‚Äúdoing what you gotta do,‚Äù but as the years went by I was more and more miserable. I felt stuck, no college, no other experience, company healthcare, 40 hour guaranteed etc. After about 5 years I was offered a management position (hourly) that I was dreaming about in my kool-aid drinking days. I went for it with out thinking because I felt like this was my only shot at success in life. 2 years later with a middle class income I was just as miserable as ever. I had no work life balance, few friends, high stress. After another fucking day of corporate visits I came to a crossroads in life and decided ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never going to work this hard again, I have to change this somehow.‚Äù I took a lower position to have less responsibility but everyone knew  what I could do so that didn‚Äôt really pan out like I thought it would. I had the same work load with less money. Some of my superiors wanted me to go back to my old position but I just couldn‚Äôt stomach that life any longer. Keeping with my new mantra one day I told the manager, ‚ÄúI need a higher hours budget to give people, this work load makes me want to quit.‚Äù He said ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs just a decision you‚Äôre gonna have to make,‚Äù and walked away. So I made my decision, got in my car and drove away. (I then rolled over my 401k when I got home). I left my old life behind, moved back home, and worked at a gas station for about 7 months.

254,I haven‚Äôt had a job where the environment wasn‚Äôt abusive,"My first job at 16 I worked on a small organic farm. Was working by sunrise and went home at sunset. Got $70 a week. 

My next job was for a fast fashion retailer. It was my first ‚Äúreal job‚Äù so I was eager to please. They used my naitivite to their advantage and forced me to do extra work every day, all for minimum wage. 

My next job was for a non-profit. They exploited my youth and enthusiastic energy to make the world a better place to pay me like garbage.

I worked as a hostess for a few months. Predatory old men were the usual crowd I dealt with. What is with this trend of senile old fucks thinking they can trick young women into having sex with them? Do you want a table or not, sir? Don‚Äôt wink at me, your wife is standing right there. But I‚Äôm the hostess, I‚Äôm supposed to be sexually appealing so dumb bastards like that come buy overpriced entrees prepared by underpaid undocumented men in the kitchen working three jobs to support their families and the owners alcohol addiction and his elite friends‚Äô unpaid tabs.

I worked at a cookie chain known for being open late in my freshman/sophomore year. All my colleagues were sexual predators and I was the only girl who worked there. Seriously, one of the delivery drivers was 68 with a 19 year old wife. Whenever my manager was at the store he sat in a stool reserved for customers (we were written up for using them or sitting down in general, and they were always watching us on camera and would get calls from corporate telling us to stand up) playing fantasy baseball while we had lines of customers out the door. I ran the store by myself most days. My manager made sexual comments daily. 

I worked for a local bar and grill that had just opened since my friend was moving and she needed someone to replace her there. The most toxic work environment by far. The owner was a fucking creep. He would verbally abuse us (all young women) in front of customers daily. He was always high on pills and/or coke. He made sexual remarks constantly. He was okay with ‚Äúregulars‚Äù shafting us on tips because hey at least HE was making money. I had an elderly couple walk out without paying a bill once. He found out and called me a liar, and idiot, threatened my job... all over two hamburgers and a cup of tea. His wife would come in to eat with his daughter and MIL, order 3-4 entrees, sides, salads, drinks, and not tip at least once a week. 

I work for a corporation that runs the concessions of my cities convention center. It‚Äôs the most dehumanizing environment I‚Äôve ever experienced. Everything has to be done in one specific way, even if it makes our lives harder. Cashiers stand on a bare concrete floor for five straight hours. Customers ask us every shift why they don‚Äôt let us sit in chairs, what‚Äôs the point of having us stand around? Upper management fired a woman for being late twice. She has six kids and was a dedicated hard worker. They verbally abuse all the shift leads, sometimes bringing them to tears. There is no communication between upper management branches, but it is our fault if we follow the ‚Äúwrong orders‚Äù that were given to us by upper management. There is always something we are doing wrong, always. I have never felt less like a human that when I am working there.

(Ubereats, postmates, Lieferservice...)

I am there waiting for and fearing the moment when the tablet will start bursting with notifications of new orders. I am there at the other end of the line, ever available for whoever orders anything during a stressful moment or 5 minutes before closing. That's my side of the situation.

268,I'm twenty and life sucks already.,"I know this is a negative outlook but hear me out. I finished highschool and was expected to begin work right away, from 18 to almost 20 years old I was on and off jobs. Before I turned twenty I got a solid enough job with benefits and salary pay.

The first couple months of this job were great it's a small company and I just work alone with one other guy who was the manager of the warehouse area. Two months ago he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and is now on leave for 2 and a half months. 

He's a really nice guy and we kind of became friends even tho he is in his 50's and I am twenty years old. When it was found out he was leaving I was told they were going to find a replacement for him for the two months that he will be gone seeing how there's alot of things in the warehouse I can't do. 

They kept bringing in people for interviews but the head office far away would turn down everyone they brought in so I quickly realized this was just about money. At this point I was being taught how to do everything in the warehouse just incase they were not able to find anyone to replace my manager. But I soon realized they knew they weren't going to be able to find someone because the head office just didn't want to pay.

They even tried to make me pay for my forklift license which I refused so they finally payed for me. Now I am by myself one month in with way too much work load and way too much being asked of me. I am thinking of quitting but my parents would kill me and just make me get another job which would probably be even worse. I also feel really bad about my manager and wouldn't want to let him down.

This new deputy manager is going around everywhere micromanaging the place while talking to people quite bluntly, and tbh pretty insultingly. I know I'm going to snap at the little gobshite one day, he's riled me up quite a bit lately. I can take stuff for so long but already I've lost all respect for the guy.

Anyway, eeryone knows what they're doing, the place works well and has some of the best sales in the region, let alone the company. The last deputy left to work closer to home and commented how the atmosphere of the place was just better than any of the others he'd worked at because people are mostly decent, get along and work together (obviously there are cunts, but it's only minor cuntish behaviour compared to other places).
Yet this upstart comes in belittling us, not telling us how we can improve but instead saying *this needs doing*, *that needs doing*, *X is not working because of you*, etc. He talks directly like it's *your fault* if anything is wrong. Our department smashes sales and outperforms the region and the company, we know what we're doing and don't need some new manager trying to prove themselves and shitting all over it.

I work in horticulture so the main thing is obviously keeping plants alive and looking good whilst trying to sell all the other crap like fence panels that they magically expect to be out available for people to buy. But working all the non-plant stuff means less time with the plants, so smart-arse new deputy comes over, sticks his finger in some compost of a small pot and says it's *""bone dry""* - *well of course it's fucking bone dry if you've got me working in the back putting out timber and fencing all day*, it's not like I'm even the only one there to water them. This is the second time he's done that, of he makes it a third I might end up throwing said plant at him.
Smart-arse new deputy also doesn't quite understand nature, like how putting chilli plants out when it's 0 fucking degrees Celsius will lead to them looking like shit. No, or course we haven't watered them enough, of course that's why they look like shit! Not that you managers kept putting  them outside when we (the workers) insisted on keep them in! Then it's our fault for not covering them with fleece, like something that isn't meant to freeze *at all* will benefit from frost protection on it's leaves.

The place is incredibly filthy and extremely depressing.

I was rushing because the manager said that I had to go fast because I needed to get 100 pieces of clothing on a clothing rack every 30 minutes or else I will get in big trouble.

The manager is mean. She never feels like coming out of her office to resolve to void override issue at my cash register. I've been having customers that have me ring up all of their items and then they change their minds and want to put everything back. There are only a certain number of items you can put back before the computer says ""void override, contact manager"". And the manager gets upset with me when I page her to come to the front.

She even gets upset if I'm not moving fast enough when sorting donations or if I forget something that she tells me.

The sales floor is chaotic. There is never enough people on the floor to monitor the customers who need to use the fitting rooms.

2. Be personal and make some small talk with me as I am ringing them out and making their order.

I used to get mad when people did #1 but as I continue to work there and think about it, both interactions are harmful to me. They both are interactions that wouldn't exist had they not want to purchase something from the company I work for. Likewise, in order to keep my job I must have ""good customer service"", meaning I have to interact back with them appropriately. 

So all these interactions become this thing that is commodified on both sides.

298,Modern Day Slavery," 

From the wiki, my comments are numbered. Feel free to debate with me.

Slavery is any system in which principles of

property law are applied to people, allowing individuals to own, buy and sell other individuals, as a de jure form of property.

Property law is the area of law that governs the various forms of ownership and tenancy

Tenancy is where a property is let (rented) on a periodic basis such as weekly or monthly in land which is the property of some person

Property, in the abstract, is what belongs to or with something.

1) Employees belong with a company, are rented on a periodic basis, usually weekly or biweekly.

A slave is unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement and works without remuneration.

2) We are unable to withdraw from the arrangements of capitalism based on law. Those on the streets, unable to pay rent are left to beg or be jailed. Living for free is illegal and all land is taxed. All remuneration that goes to land is slave money.

Many scholars now use the term chattel slavery to refer to this specific sense of legalized, de jure slavery. In a broader sense, however, the word slavery may also refer to any situation in which an individual is de facto forced to work against their own will. Scholars also use the more generic terms such as unfree labour or forced labour to refer to such situations. However, and especially under slavery in broader senses of the word, slaves may have some rights and protections according to laws or customs.

3) Millions of workers are forced to work in abusive, dangerous, polluted conditions to pay for their land, or more common, the land of their landlord or reality company, against their will.

Slavery existed in many cultures since the time before written history. A person could become enslaved from the time of their birth, capture, or purchase.

4) All current participants into the curent first world were forced into it at birth.

Slavery was legal in most societies at some time in the past, but is now outlawed in all recognized countries.

5) This is simply untrue as slavery is widespread throughout the first world under the guise of a ""free market""

The last country to officially abolish slavery was Mauritania in 2007. Nevertheless, there are an estimated 40.3 million people worldwide subject to some form of modern slavery. The most common form of modern slave trade is commonly referred to as human trafficking. In other areas, slavery (or unfree labour) continues through practices such as debt bondage, the most widespread form of slavery today, serfdom, domestic servants kept in captivity, certain adoptions in which children are forced to work as slaves, child soldiers, and forced marriage.

Human trafficking is the trade of humans for the purpose of forced labour

6) Citizens are forced to work for first world companies, unable to leave the shackles of working for land. Instead of being traded, we are left to beg companies for our land money in a process called interviewing.

7) American children, at the least, are told they need to take out debt to pursue college and become bounded to their debt. To make matters worse, the colleges have jacked up the debt because the government allowed them to set the prices. All educational debt is slave money.

8) All first world citizens are kept in captivity by the first world countries, needing money for land and for a visa to even leave their home country or visit another. This makes all visa money slave money. The conditions for settling in another country are restricted to those with the ability to pay for it. More slave money.

9) Children are forced to work at schools, in the US at least, and told they need a job to survive the desperate landscape of the current world.

10) At least in America, marriage is preferable to being single due to the tax breaks. We are coerced into marriage this way, coercion being a form of force.

Slavery is still widespread. We need a revolution to stop it. Feel free to debate my points if I am mistaken.",False,bdx3ak,ninjapanda112,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bdx3ak/modern_day_slavery/,4,24

310,"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you: my inbox!","**Please don‚Äôt try to guess which company** (this is based on both my current and previous workplaces), all the major tech giants are about the same anyway. 

I recently had a chat with another new recruit, and he said, ‚Äúthe day I logged in the first time to my work PC, I already had 300 emails waiting for me‚Äù. The percentage of real emails among them was close to nil. 
He inspired this post, in a way. 

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs in my inbox in any given day:

1. Mass-distribution email from CEO of Hooli, which includes the words ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù and ‚Äúexcited‚Äù. 

2. Multiple mass-invitations to video-conferencing sales team meetings at 3am my time. Nope nope nope.

3. An invitation for a tech talk about someone‚Äôs project, teaching lizard how to code.

4. An invitation to join the beta program of a new Hooli device, which records every thought that runs through your brain offers you appropriate ads integrated into your dreams! Also uses the words ‚Äúexcited‚Äù and ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù.

5. Someone named Derek is leaving the company and wrote a long goodbye email to everyone, which is also the first evidence I have for his existence. Regrettably, he will continue said existence elsewhere, so it was a useless effort to learn that there‚Äôs a Derek who works here.

6. Another Derek is leaving, but he‚Äôs in the Hooli office in Japan. I‚Äôll refer to him as Derek no. 2. I still get his goodbye email, for some unapparent inexplicable reason.

7. An automated alert email from a system with a mysterious code name, which has a lot of three-letter acronyms. Apparently the Fjarnskaggl TLA level is above the ABC of XTC. This looks important, but I have NFI, and I CBA. 3,000 other people got it too, I hope someone knows what the heck.

8. Email from a customer who has supposedly-irrefutable proof that our hardware is faulty and crashes. I refute it, by showing the log line that says they actually pressed the power button to turn it off. This is the only email in my inbox that‚Äôs actually aimed at me. 

9. Bob is sick today and will be out of the office.

10. Another Bob is sick today.

11. Automated permission system: ‚Äúyou have been added to the permissions group ‚ÄúBlargh-engineers-Hooli‚Äù - good to know.

12. Remember all the Dereks who left before? We hired a new one to replace some! There‚Äôs a welcome email, in which he tells us his hobbies are roller-snorkeling and snorkel-rolling, and that he has 2.4 kids. 

13. Another email about customer feedback, with reports, statistics, tables and graphs about user adoption of some Hooli product. It says ‚Äú[Message clipped]  View entire message‚Äù. I‚Äôm extra-cautious and make sure not to click the ‚Äòview‚Äô button by mistake.

14. [Win-wire]: Hooli marketing people send everyone an email whenever they sign a customer or get them to renew their contract (‚Äúa win‚Äù), so it seems. They never send one if we lose a customer. I‚Äôm considering emailing them back about my own wins - for example, I found a $2 coin on the light rail today. 

15. Someone is asking if anyone is traveling to Malasya, Micronesia or Euthanasia soon, they have a package to deliver to their family there, and can you please carry it for them?

16. Some email about a Hooli tech conference ‚Äò19, with lots of product announcements and keynote speakers and whatnot.

17. Marjorie replies-to-all on Derek no.2‚Äôs goodbye email, wishing him good luck.

18. James replies-to-all on Derek no. 3‚Äôs welcome email, to ensure Derek 3 is welcomed. This process can probably be automated.

19. Marjorie replies-to-all on James‚Äô reply-to-all, and welcomes Derek no.3 for joining Hooli. There are about half a dozen more Marjorie/James emails of this sort from the rest of the team, but it gets old fast so I‚Äôll spare you the details. 

20. About 2,853 filtered emails about bug reports that relate to products I don‚Äôt work on, but still CC everyone who ever walked into a Hooli building.

The irony is if the average person were to somehow get enough money that they'll never have to work again, they wouldn't  know what to do with themselves. They're just used to being a cog in a wheel. That's why alot of people who retire tend to go back to work.

I feel a certain tension in our culture, where I must buy into the capitalist system fully or risk being shunned by it and losing out on its many material comforts and conveniences. It feels like there's no place for moderation, like the system won't tolerate it. Maybe I'm just too soft to tolerate it.

I asked another coworker that was back there and she pulled a tube out  and a little water got around the floor before I could put the tube back in couldn‚Äôt figure it out, so I went and got my supervisor.

‚ÄúWell then why the fuck didn‚Äôt you? We have to drain this every time it‚Äôs used, and you cant even turn it on.‚Äù

321,No privacy in our personal lives. None. At all. Job interviewers don‚Äôt even consider people who don‚Äôt offer their entire life to the job.,"It‚Äôs honestly ridiculous that you can‚Äôt even mark your availability to your own needs. You have to match your availability to what the company wants or else they will not even look at you. 

I remember when applying for a fast food job, I had marked Saturday off of my available days. (They were closed on sundays, im sure you can guess what this place is lol) so I was trying to get.. you know.., a weekend. I already wasn‚Äôt keen to working another fast food job, but I needed to pay my car note at the time. During the interview, the manager said ‚Äúwell I noticed here that you said you aren‚Äôt available on Saturdays, why?‚Äù Like what am I supposed to say? If I tell you that I just want that day off, you‚Äôll look at me like I‚Äôm lazy and entitled for wanting a weekend. I can‚Äôt lie and say I have another job or they would‚Äôve probed me for details about that job. Thinking back, it is a Christian company, so I should‚Äôve come up with a lie that I do some sort of church volunteer work on Saturdays and that probably would‚Äôve gotten them off my ass. Didn‚Äôt think about it at the time because I wasn‚Äôt expecting them to be so invasive about why I wanted Saturdays off. 

Like... and the worst part of it is, that day you wanted off ends up being on your schedule EVERY WEEK. They scheduled me almost every Saturday. 

The complete disregard for our schedule preferences is disrespectful as hell if you ask me. To me, it just says ‚Äúwe know you are full grown adults who would like to have some control over your own schedule, but we don‚Äôt care because we need everyone here to be our personal lackey who we can call in whenever we want!‚Äù Also, if you tell them ‚Äúhey please stop scheduling me at 5 am... I don‚Äôt like it‚Äù, they will probably schedule you more at 5 am. This also happened to me at this same company. I asked to switch to more afternoon shifts because I think it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous to get up at 4 am to be at a fucking fast food job at 5 am (I gave a different excuse) and they kept scheduling me at 5 am. Then got mad when I called in constantly lol. Like sorry dude... I told you already I don‚Äôt like going in at 5. 

Like, find someone who WANTS to go in at 5 am. And if NO ONE wants to go in at 5 am, WHY are we opening so early?

322,Quit my labor job for some R&amp;R,"I've been working at this warehouse doing physical labor work for $9 an hour for almost 3 years now. Unfortunately I've never gotten a raise because I go to school during the week and miss 2-3 days a week. I finally had enough of the back and knee pain that I've endured, on top of that my boss informed me I wasn't making enough hours and he'd have to fire me soon, so I quit. I'm tired of seeing people who work the same hours as me and make twice as much money. Unfortunately my family and my girlfriend are pissed at me, my friends on the other hand are on my side, so that's something.

324,Need advice hoping to get some feedback,"I am writing this as I am mere minutes from going to bed to wake up for work in the morning. Yes, I work on weekends only and though it might be only 2 days of the week, I work at a factory job doing the same monotonous task for 11 hours with only two 30 minute breaks which I have no control of when to take.

I am currently a full-time student (23 male living in Toronto) in computer science and I work full time to help pay for my expenses which is mostly for my car. For those wondering why I have a car as a student, let me explain. I originally went to college for two years to become an electronics technician. I landed a full time job after graduating which I didn‚Äôt mind (just the manager sucked). After working there for a year and a half, I paid my student loans and had enough money to pay for a car. I paid for a car from my dad however I currently pay an outrageous insurance (despite never being in an accident). 

After some time I was hoping to go back to school to advance my knowledge to get a degree in computer science. I asked my current employer if I could work part time with them while I was in school and they originally said yes but than changed their mind and said no. As a result I need to find a job fast to help pay for my car insurance which made up 50% of my monthly expenses alone. So I took a job at a warehouse. 

Again, although I only work two days a week, I dread this job so much. I wish to do some about it but I don‚Äôt know what.

Side note: let me also say that I throughly enjoy university and don‚Äôt regret going back. I love what I‚Äôm doing, my grades are great and everyday I enjoy coding, doing mathematics and photoshop. I hope to get a self-made career doing these things that I love. I also volunteer when I can. I give food to the elderly and use my coding skills for good to help charities design their websites.

Thank you all for reading. Sorry if the grammar or spelling is broken, I am writing this quickly before bed.",False,bcywxc,Kypriako,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bcywxc/need_advice_hoping_to_get_some_feedback/,2,2

They saw that I don't have a degree and said I need to do one or else i'll get fired (degree= 45h per week working incl. 2 days school for 3 years straight). I don't have any other options since a degree in my country is EVERYTHING. If you don't have one, you can only find a ""humane"" job with rare luck or work in badly paid places.

353,The concept of modern work is the dumbest fucking thing I could possibly imagine.,"I know I'm not the first nor the last to feel this way, and this isn't a unique or profound idea for this sub. 

I just can't. fucking. take it anymore. 

I left my corporate 9-5 job to work part time in retail. I physically and mentally could not take it anymore. I'm only in my mid-20s but my soul literally felt black. I wasn't sleeping enough. I was sitting 10-12 hours a day. I was doing pointless work that automation was advanced enough 10 years ago to do. Management was incompetent. I would have panic attacks if I made a simple error because they could fire me for any reason and at any moment. 

Now, for 1/3 of the pay, I still spend ~40% of my life either working or worrying about work (because of course I have to answer emails and texts even when I'm not clocked in). 

I can barely afford what little bills I do have.  My manager near-passively nets 800k a year while myself and my 3 coworkers operate her company for $12 an hour. 

Customers scream at me for issues outside of my control. When I put on my best ""customer service"" face, and try to handle issues with understanding and tact, I am threatened with losing my job, because ""I should have been able"" to prevent a rich housewife from getting angry about a shirt being $30, when the last time she bought a completely different item ""it was only $10,"" or some other bullshit thing. 

I left work uncontrollably shaking today because an item was sold out and a customer wrote a scathing review about our interaction, after storming out and yelling about how I was ""retarded and incompetent"". I handled the situation as best as I could. I was polite, apologetic, and offered an alternate solution. But because I ""caused my manager bad publicity"" I am currently awaiting to hear if I will ""be required to come in to work tomorrow""... Might I note that in the several months I've worked here, this is the only time anything even remotely negative has happened during my shift. 

I know there are many people in similar situations. It breaks my heart that there are millions of people whose entire lives, including mine, will be spent working some meaningless bullshit job until they die. 

I took this job after I left my corporate 9-5 thinking it would be less stressful. Boy was I wrong.

362,My thoughts on work while being laid off,"Simultaneously terrified for my future and more excited than Ive been in months.

My first job (technically second, but with the same company) Is ending very quickly. I was told the position is being shut down 2 days ago, and my last day is this upcoming Saturday. I need a new job ASAP because I dont have the spare funds to keep myself going for long periods of time, especially with my current goal of going to college for the sake of learning, or using the money (if i have to) to go to a trade school to make more money. Im also still living with my parents for the purpose of saving money but I dont want to be a burden on them forever.

Despite all of the things Im stressing over at a time like this.... Theres a part of me that cant wait to be unemployed. In the whole year I've worked here I have not had a single full nights rest, very few days where Ive turned off my alarms (a couple sick days), gone through about 2 bottles of sleeping pills. Missed dozens of times to be with the people who keep me going and my aging pets and parents.

In my head I know I Need to get a new job fast, and I will be sending some applications later today, but Im really at the point where Im willing to give up on my future for a few weeks of rest. It makes anything seem worth it to turn off my several alarms and get a full nights rest for the first time in months. My family moved to a more rural area last summer but I've been so busy, and when not busy exhausted, that I havent had time to do yardwork, or take my dog on daily walks, or clean the house for my mom who works so hard already.

That classic pie chart where 8 hours goes to sleep, 8 to work, and 8 to play/personal, is unfair when so much common work could be automated (some human input is necessary of course, but wasting away at unnecessary jobs because your life has no value without money is BS). not only is it unfair, but its a lie. those 8 hours of work a day arent 8 hours when I live 30 miles from my work, its not 8 hours when the thought of work not only keeps me up at night but keeps me from sleeping as heavily as I need to.

Ended up more ranty than intended, but the relief I am feeling by being laid off, even if a bit misguided, I feel is pretty indicative of the pressure I was being put under by even the simplest of jobs, but day after day.

366,Limited notice,"What's with these jobs that want you to start the same day with little to no notice? Love how it's accepted that they do such things but how dare it ever be the other way around. I have been offered a job by an agency twice now on short notice, the first time they wanted me to start I forgot I had a dentist appointment (for a tooth that needed to be pulled immediately almost had to go to emergency..... and mind you was my first dentist appointment in 15 years so it was kind of important) and yet this agency still asked me to start a job with 12 hour shifts (factory-machine operation as if that's not dreadful even for 4 hours) the same day with a few hours notice. I wasn't sure how long the appointment was going to take or what shape I'd even be in having a tooth pulled so I said no. Fast forward to today and I am emailed and asked to start at 7. I'm now full blown into a random cold and would literally rather do anything else, but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say in response. Like honestly I just want to send back an angry message about the short notice. I need a day or 2 to organize a ride home anyways.

367,"A thought exercise: video games are popular because they present an idealized version of work (seriously, hear me out)","So, a few days ago someone posted one of those **""what would you do if you didn't have to work""** threads. Many people said art, volunteer work, part time work etc. But the most repetitive answer was **video games**.

A few days ago, a colleague of mine has left the company. There were talks that he's under performance review (which is corporate code for ""you're probably getting fired soon""). Let's call him Jack. 

Jack has been working at Hooli, a major IT company, for about 5 years, and had the reputation of someone who isn't exactly a hard worker; he enjoyed performing simpler tasks - ones that teammates described as ""press a single button to fix something"". 

Jack and I often talked about video games. I've been playing the same massively-multiplayer game for ~12 years, on and off, and so did he. The day before he resigned, he told me of a new game he's into, which involved a lot of manual tasks. 

""You have to craft your arrows and fletch them on your own, one by one, for example, in order to fill your quiver and go hunting"". This is interesting, coming from someone who wasn't considered the most studious staff in the company. Us engineers are always encouraged to automate everything, because manual tasks are considered uninteresting, prone to error and inefficient. It made me wonder, why would people enjoy that level of detail in a game? And it got me thinking.

I would posit that... &lt;drumroll&gt;
**video games are actually an idealized version of what we want work to be like. We play video games because they fill the hole that modern labor created.** This is, of course, a make-belief system and I'm not saying video games are 'productive' - but they're designed to make you feel like they are, whereas 9-5 office roles do not.

The following arguments to support my claim are:

1. **Better reward systems**. No person character is underpaid in video games. If the quest doesn't give you enough gold, armor, reputation or the mere sense of satisfaction that you progress in the story etc, you dump it. You might even ditch the game altogether for a more rewarding one. 
There's no harm in changing games, you won't lose the roof over your head. Reading the WoW subreddit after realizing this has been an eye-opener: all the rants there about the current reward system can be read from a Marxist-like POV.

2. **No faceless corporations** - the quest giver is a person you interact with directly, not a huge bureaucratic machine that views you as a cog. It's strange to think about it, but in a good, immersive game - even an NPC has more heart than the IT giant that pays my salary. The quest giver, or their faction, have a story you can relate to. 

3. **No meaningless, pointless tasks** - If you get told to kill 12 wolves for their pelts, then that pelt is later used to craft armor for your character or whatnot. If you get told to pick 8 herbs, it's because they'd be used to craft a potion to heal an orc's sick daughter or something. You actually feel like you help someone! No huge Excel spreadsheets. No Powerpoint presentations that don't interest anyone. Heck, even most raid guilds don't hold ""team meetings"" over video-conferencing. 

4. **Your game-work has actual results** - if you kill an evil demon boss, they die and you saved a village. If you gather 20 pieces of silk and nylon threads, you craft a cloak that your character can wear. The difference is visible. Who knows what the hell the paperwork I generate is for, other than checking a box for the sake of saying we did it. This relates to what Marx described as alienation from your work too, perhaps. In games, if you work hard towards something, you produce a meaningful item of some kind. You can often look back at something you achieved in the game with pride.

5. **You can walk away whenever you want to**. You're a mercenary, in most cases. You can pause and continue later if you're tired, bored or have something else to do. You can play solo or in a group. You are your own master and don't need to ask for approval to log off. I have to create 2x calendar events, fill out a web form to HR and send a mass-distribution email to the entire team whenever I take sick leave.  

6. **You get out and see the world**. This too is ironic, because in reality you sit on a chair for hours. But the ingame system sends you across different scenic fantasy lands. Most workplaces are rows of gray open-space desks, in busy urban areas, with shops and tall buildings. Some games take place in urban environments too, but they launch new maps so you won't get bored. My game launches new maps with new regions every few months, or overhauls the existing ones dramatically, so the world won't get repetitive and boring.

To summarize, I don't think people are inherently lazy. They just want to do tasks that are rewarding, interesting and serve some purpose; which is very often different than what office jobs are like.",False,bdbui7,DrowningUpsideDown3,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bdbui7/a_thought_exercise_video_games_are_popular/,109,451

375,Marx on Wage Slavery!,"Since Lassalle's death, there has asserted
itself in our party‚Äô the ¬© scientific
understanding that wages are not what
they appear to be -- namely, the value, or
price, of labor‚Äîbut only a masked form for
the value, or price, of labor power. Thereby,
the whole bourgeois conception of wages
hitherto, as well as all the criticism hitherto
directed against this conception, was
thrown overboard once and for all. It was
made clear that the wage worker has
permission to work for his own subsistence
‚Äîthat is, to live, only insular as he works
for a certain time grain for the capitalist
(and hence also for the latter's  co-
consumers of surplus value); that the whole
capitalist system of production turns on the
increase of this grain labor by extending
the working day, or by developing the
productivity‚Äîthat is, increasing‚Äô the
intensity or labor power, etc.; that,
consequently, the system of wage labor is a
system of slavery, and indeed of a slavery
which becomes more severe in proportion
as the social productive forces of labor
develop, whether the worker receives
better or worse payment. And after this
understanding has gained more and more
ground in our party, some return to
Lassalle's dogma although they must have
known that Lassalle did not know what
wages were, but, following in the wake of
the bourgeois economists, took the
appearance for the essence of the matter.

380,"I just wanted to say thank you to this community, for existing","Literally all my life I've lived under the impression that there's something essentially wrong in the way the world circulates. I was born in an Eastern European country, during a time when a major financial crisis struck. My father used to work multiple jobs at once, one of them selling fruits and vegetables at the market. My mother - coming from another country - unemployed for years to come. Last summer my father started daydreaming, I guess, and telling me how he used to go to my mother's country, work hard and get loads of gold to bring back, as presents for everyone he knows. *Resentment has never built up so quickly inside of me.* Because since I was born, he has worked his ass off to provide for this family. He hasn't had even one day off since he started working as a taxi driver, after the market crash. He works days, nights, holidays, NY's Eve, Christmas - those are the big profit days. I had only 2 family vacations in my entire childhood and always envied others who went somewhere every winter/summer. I got used to live with fear that somebody will come and take all our stuff, then our home, for unpaid bills &amp; taxes. Me and my mother hid all the expensive stuff when the date was due. To this day, I'm afraid to answer doors. 

&amp;#x200B;

My father has a long list of court summons because of the bills. I have been legit living this life in fear that someone will take everything away from me. We had family friends who experienced that, with two kids... What is this stupid system, folks? Because of this my parents got addicted to casino, cause they actually made some profit there, and of course, lost a lot. Father's health is in decline, he had a surgery, I'm so afraid for him. These last years he's trying to work harder to pay all the outstanding credit cards and bills. My mother makes so little and her nerves can't take much anymore, she has heart problems from all the stress. They couldn't afford to get me into university. I went abroad, saved money and enrolled myself on my dream degree. My plan was to help them with their struggles, so they can just for ONCE leave peacefully. But now I understand how this cruel world works and it's getting worse. With my useless ""fun"" degree it will take me decades to find something good. I think, maybe with every degree. I don't know what to do after I graduate. I want to help my parents but I don't want to sabotage everything meaningful in my life for that. I don't want to... lose my most precious years, you know. I saw a video of some guy who paid their mortgage from an app's profit. Some people weren't born lucky. It depresses me! In my last years of high school I stumbled upon Walden and Thoreau, my truest inspiration. And my friends, then, also understood the absurdity of this capitalist system - we made some stupid plans to go off the grid ""someday"". Folks, I hope we can make something out of this.

This is not california, and they only have two people who ‚Äúpay‚Äù $30 a week in taxes. We only get paid for what we are scheduled even if though we stay 10-60 minutes after our shift ‚Äúends‚Äù. It‚Äôs all done on hand written notes with no signature. They don‚Äôt even know my middle name, date of birth, or social.

The issue I have now is that I am able to quit when I want and still have money saved to pay my bills for about six months. But I do not believe the people I worked for deserve the scapegoats they have employed and did not earn what they got. 
I am a veteran so I am a little salty when I see how they have more than my family had by screwing the government. I also see how the government screwed so many of us soldiers over and understand how a small businesses feel the need to ‚Äúcheat the system‚Äù to get ahead.

Happiness shouldn‚Äôt be a grind or goal to achieve, it should be an automatic and given behaviour that every human should possess. But it‚Äôs not. I can‚Äôt be happy automatically, I have to try so so so so fucking hard to feel remotely positive about myself, my life and what I‚Äôm doing. Even then, this sparks out after 20minutes. 

Could it be worse? Yes, of course it could. But I am a million miles from happy. I haven‚Äôt been happy in years, and with each passing week, the urge for death increases little by little, until one thing might make me snap. Again.

461,I legitimately don't think I'll make it to retirement...,"I legitimately don't think I'll make it to retirement, and I don't mean this in a financial sense. I genuinely believe my will to live will run out before I ever get there. Not that I'm saying anything that hasn't been said here before but I can't understand how it is acceptable for society to function like this. I cannot continue to work 8-10 hours a days, 5 days a week for the next 40 to 50 years. The thought of doing so almost causes a total mental collapse. I'm not exaggerating when I say mental collapse, I'm a grown adult and some days I'm nearly reduced to a puddle of anhedonic flesh. 

&amp;#x200B;

Working literally makes me want to kill myself. Like half the people here say, it's not my job in particular. Hell if anything my job is kind of easy. It's a desk job, pays pretty well, semi-flexible hours.  But at every job I've had everyday is a tortuous struggle. I can usually come in and get work done for 4 or 5 hours but at the point my reasonably healthy human brain just can't continue to do repetitive mental labor. I can't focus and then my mind starts to wonder. All of a sudden I feel like a monkey in a cage. I try to surf the internet for something to take my mind off my boredom but nothing helps, I've been doing this at every job for nearly a decade now so there's no effective distractions left. Then you just sit there and think about all the things you want to do with your life that you'll never get the chance to because they don't generate profit and are therefore completely worthless. I just want to go home, plant a garden, go for a walk, write more music, get involved in my community. I would do anything for a sabbatical. Just like 6 months and some free healthcare to get healthy and clear my mind but that is unacceptable in America. Say what you will but this world is completely fucked.
