0,Thoughts on Laziness,it seems that most people think of laziness as a quality to be ashamed of  but i actually admire laziness quite a bit   here are my thoughts on the topic   laziness is fundamentally a person fully understanding and realizing their own desires  independent of how others attempt to shape or manipulate those desires  consciously or otherwise   the lazy person gives priority to their own satisfaction  rather than the satisfaction of others   especially since the other's satisfaction is often only an illusion of satisfaction that forms around what is really just the realization of mutual suffering   when you realize that your work doesn't actually make other people happy in any positive sense  that it only staves off disappointment or resentment in a negative sense  and that it is rooted in a joyless network of social exchanges in which anything that resembles generosity or freedom is appropriated and transmuted into something ugly and soulless  this is when laziness starts to kick in   a lazy person constantly attempts to grasp the moment  rather than endlessly deferring the moment for a future that never actually arrives   this is what work is  essentially  the positing of the present moment as a means to future ends  this is fine  except that we have let work stop being a means to an end   these future ends ultimately exceed what is strictly necessary for life or well-being  the purpose of work becomes not the means to the end of subjectivity  but an endlessly recurring objectification of one's own life   that first step of thinking of the future product of the labor of the present disconnects us from an immanent experience of life  an immanent connection with our very being  and turns us into a tool that exists  for  a life that never gets lived   this is how civilizations fall into the trap of luxury  even after work fulfills the basic needs of life  we continue to work as if the essential way to experience life is through its objectification  through the endless production of objects that actually objectify  us  rather than satisfy us   laziness often comes with the realization that one's needs are in reality quite simple  and that the rewards of luxury are  at least to some degree  an illusion   at a certain point luxury is no longer a means of present satisfaction  a means of  play  but instead becomes a horizon that can never be reached  an end that requires the constant sacrifice of the moment    in some sense  the people who are the  best  at being lazy are the people who always see things in terms of the  ultimate  end  which is always  death   these people recognize the absurdity of meaning when that meaning is confronted by the truth  the non-meaning  of our mortality   it is possible for us to grasp our own mortality and to  live  moment to moment  in recognition of this truth   this recognition leads us to reject the ultimate principles that people try to substitute for death   all other principles  i e  the principles which others pretend will anchor all of life's meaning  are in fact illusory   they are myths that developed in order to subjugate people to a utility which itself is ultimately  arbitrary   when you die  it isn't going to matter that you worked hard and acquired property  nor is it going to matter that your life was  wasted  on laziness   death is an end to all such meanings  and this fact itself gives us a meaning of life as something of  immediate  value   life is best lived in constant confrontation with death  because death is what reveals life's true immediacy to us   and it is in this immediacy that we find dissatisfaction with work   laziness can also be courageous  because it requires constant confrontation with feelings of guilt and shame that are imposed upon you   it requires a profound  commitment  if one is to be happy with their laziness  and not get bogged down in anguish and regret   everything in our society is structured in such a way that nothing can be freely offered or accepted  and everything must be  exchanged   there is no real way to opt-out of this massive system of social exchange  as even one's refusal to participate wholeheartedly is interpreted as an offering and returned to you as spite  resentment  disappointment  pity  even jealousy   when people notice that you are trying to act freely and independently  they immediately saddle you with all of their psychosocial baggage  even if this is not the case  our very sense of  being  is rooted in this system from the moment we are born  and we can easily begin to chastise  ourselves  for our laziness   it takes an admirable amount of courage  determination  self-confidence and presence of mind to truly be lazy without also feeling like shit  something i have yet to figure out  on my end   but i certainly aspire to it   finally  laziness is not selfish  but actually opens up the possibility for the only genuine form of generosity   when a lazy person  does  truly choose to act  without duress or manipulation  it is an action that can only be  freely given  to another  a sacrifice made with  full consciousness  of what is actually being sacrificed   the preciousness of the moment   and in that chosen act  there is always an invitation to  share  that moment  not exchange it for some other form of social or cultural capital  not defer it for some future product  but to share it  immanently  and without any expectation of  return   and the most admirable lazy person  when they do happen to have other forms of capital at their disposal  they tend to  waste it  generously and gloriously   they do not exchange it for recognition  they do not hoard it for the sake of future utility  but instead they expend it with the sole purpose of forming  moments  of joy and play that can be  immanently shared   bottom-line  don't be ashamed of your laziness   be proud  be free  find what matters to you  be generous and  grasp the moment   ,b6c5f1

7,Coworker was fired based on her appearance,hi again everyone  i made a post a while back about my work at a high-end hair salon    several ridiculous things have happened at my workplace since this post  including my boss asking me several times to  come out of my shell  and  show more personality  and to  be more deferential to the clients  i'm already very meek and polite towards the stylists and clients  which i assume is why he asked me to come out of my shell at work  i've tried to chat with the stylists and clients a few times  but they are usually dismissive or annoyed because i am a lowly peon that is there to clean up after their dogs and fetch them more iced tea    today a receptionist was fired from the salon for  not looking presentable enough  there's only one receptionist working per shift  so i've only seen her a few times  but she is a clean-cut and pretty asian girl and has worn jeans and a nice shirt every time i've seen her  which is the same thing i wear to work every day  she'd been working there six months  when i first heard that someone got fired  i assumed they didn't show up to work or had been stealing from the store or something like that  nope  turns out lack of eyeliner or thrift store clothes can get you sacked just as quickly  i'm pretty sure i was only hired because i'm adderall-skinny and look like a deer in headlights all the time because these people terrify me  ,b6bff4
8,Economic burdens,                                         larger slippers and other low-skilled workers don t deserve a living wage  there should be a minimum wage that guarantees all workers a basic standard of living  workers should form unions and cooperative and eliminate economic hierarchy  genial labor should be gradually eliminated through automatic so in that people can pursue their passions free from  economic burdens    ,b6mxj3

10,Thank you antiwork. I put in my 30 day notice to my employer....,i guess perhaps i am antiwork lite  instead of a big dramatic on the spot 'i quit ' or a standard 2 week notice  i gave a 30 day  i had told my boss that my life goal was not here in louisville ky  i will be relocating  and to please not include me in long term goals  he asked that   because of the time to place and train a replacement  i give a 30 day notice  i have been a salaried manager for a few years  i am frugal and have saved for 2 years to move to live a simpler life  my biggest hang up was the whole concept of  no health insurance  and   not having a job already lined up  before you quit the present one  regardless though  i'm quitting to find reasonable employment  not go back to the  grind  lifestyle   i would be lying if i said that antiwork did not help me make my choice  it was almost like my daily motivateme subreddit  just about my job  thank you for the  confidence and just some of the smack in the face observations   ,b5jgqd

13,Anti-Work Activism,it's time to ask yourself what you're doing to help bring about an end to wage slavery  we must get organized and turn this into a political movement   i've been donating my time and money to the andrew yang presidential campaign  yang2020 com yang wants to implement a universal basic income in part to ameliorate the effects of automation  i've also been working on some anti-work youtube videos and a website in my spare time    and please don't tell me it's a waste of time because there's nothing that can be done to change things  people sacrificed much more than their time and money to resist other oppressive systems like fascism and communism  this is our struggle to reclaim our lives from our employers and the merciless and exploitative capitalist system we live in     ,b7rk9d

16,Who else loves companies that make you stand when you are working?,i've worked at over 10 different companies and the vast majority have duties that can be done sitting down  except they don't give you a chair and if you sit down on something you will get yelled at  this is american work culture for you  appreciate what you guys have in other countries  i've seen videos of people working in factories in japan and they are sitting down  here if you are sitting you are considered lazy and the boss will tell you they aren't paying you to sit down  i hate work culture  can anybody relate                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,b3e0wx
17,Stoicism and Capitalism,now i'm actually a pretty big fan of stoicism  but i recently came across an article that discusses the potential downsides of stoicism  i thought the following passage to be particularly interesting    gt  it s taken for granted these days that stoic values are simply superior  competitions are just pissing contests for the insecure  being anxiously engaged in proving yourself makes you a  try hard  caring about what others think  being thin-skinned  is the mark of an inferior man who lacks real confidence  is it possibly too convenient  though  that the values which are put down  which were once considered the heroic  warrior values in ancient times  happen to be the ones which make men dangerous and unsuited to the modern capitalist economy    in contemporary american culture  the  honorable  person is  honest and true  someone who is above all consistent  he       is conscientious  predictable  stable  solid  four-square  a rock  a brick  we need bricks to stolidly build society  we need men willing to keep their head down  accept their role  be completely unruffled by the ding-dong in the cubicle next to them  we need men who will choose to retreat into their inner citadel  who  rather than becoming completely unhinged by the banality of modern life  will constantly repeat incantations that the meaninglessness of modern work  the irritation of a daily commute  the loneliness of an empty apartment cannot ultimately harm them   any thoughts   original article  https www artofmanliness com articles does-stoicism-extinguish-the-fire-of-life ,b3qhyv

28,Just gave my boss my resignation notice.,it feels like the end of an era for me  and i m considering this post the final chapter in my personal r antiwork trilogy    the first chapter  posted a couple months ago  saw me venting and breaking down the pay cut that my position had received at the beginning of the year   corporate had decided that my position was worth  8500- 9000 less than what they were previously paying me annually   this was truly the inciting incident - frodo cursed with bearing the one ring to rivendell with the wraiths in pursuit   the second chapter  posted a couple days ago  was a meme that i created with the purpose to send to my boss  a snarky reply to the corporate demands that we work mandatory saturdays back-to-back to make up for their  lost revenue   this was merely the latest brutal reminder that i was nothing but a cog in a cold uncaring machine   my branch manager and i might have been on good  personable terms but higher up the corporate tower was the all-seeing eye of sauron pure evil incarnate  cough  capitalism   the meme was my resistance  and it was followed up by a real life conversation between my branch manager and i   i was able to tell him exactly how i felt - something i know not very many workers ever get the luxury of doing with their supervisors bosses without fear of punishment   nothing else was really achieved except that i was  off the hook  for one of the mandated saturdays this month as long as i was a team player this saturday   which brings us to the final chapter  today i got off the phone with my manager after letting him know that april 30th will be my last day   i wish i could have had the conversation in person  but i left early for my route today well before he was even there and wouldn t get back in time before he left   but i finally did it   after months of inner struggle  of shaky promises of a  promotion  and a massive pay cut  i finally did what i said to myself i would do for a long time - within the fiery pits of mount doom  frodo cast the one ring from whence it came     i m quitting and pursuing my teaching credentials   once i become a teacher  i will look into joining the teachers union  one of the last examples of where unionization is still going strong   i plan to dedicate the rest of my working life to lifting up my fellow workers and raising class consciousness   ,b3ih9b

31,Had an argument with another supervisor because of someones name.,i work in a call center as a quality analyst so im basically a supervisor and i just had a mini argument with another supervisor  lets call her penny  regarding an agent  apparently this agent  lets call her kadi  was on a call and the member asked for her name and she told them but the customer wanted her full name  which she refused to provide  the customer got disgruntled and requested to speak with a supervisor  so kadi goes up to penny and tells her about the situation    penny tells kadi that shes not taking that call because its a stupid reason and that kadi should just give up her last name  kadi has a fairly unusual name that could be easily searched and she states that she is not comfortable doing so because she doesn't know who shes speaking to or what they would do    me being the type of person i am goes to the defense of kadi stating that we dont force members to give up their full names so why should she be forced to do the same  penny then starts to argue with me saying that giving up her full name is nothing and that i shouldn't say that outloud because then the agents will start to feel that they can just do whatever and i wont mark them down    why is it that the safety and comfort of employees does not matter to some  the customer is not always right  i know this seems like a small issue but to me there is a lot in a name and if im not willing to give that information to you a business shouldn't force me or anyone to    i dont think i can be a supervisor because of the type of person i am  ,b3hkum
32,"A few times when I said “fuck this shit, I’m out.”",i thought it d be fun to share a few of the times when i no call no showed or straight up walked out mid-shift  i know people in other subs would shit on me for this  but i know all of you completely understand how liberating it is to walk out on a job for the good of your mental health  i d love to hear your stories down below    we ll start with what i ll call taco hell  i went back to this job at a different location a year after i first worked there because i wanted more income and couldn t find a full time position anywhere  so i was working 2 jobs at the time  i m going to be completely honest about the fact that i most definitely was trying to finagle my schedules to get the most convenient schedule i possibly could  who wouldn t  morning retail shifts would guarantee i never had to be at work before 11 am  never had to close the store  and got to leave when it got the busiest  afternoon fast food shifts meant i never had to open the store  or close because the drive thru was 24 hours  so anyways  i told taco hell that i was switching my retail job to mornings  which meant 11 am because that s when they opened  and that i would be available for afternoon dinner shifts at taco hell  they kept scheduling me for 6 am every morning  the manager also treated other employees better than me  he made me keep my phone locked in the office during my shift like a 5 year old while the other employees ran around with their phones out all day  he made me take my lip piercing out  and yes  it promptly closed right the fuck up during my shift  i tried putting it back in but it was too late  and on top of all this the customers were absolute shit heads  someone got mad and walked out the door because i asked him if his order was dine in or carry about  before he was ready  like  anyways so i was spending the night at my friends apartment on a friday night  i was scheduled for 6 am the next day  i brought all my clothes  fully intending to go  but when my alarm went off at 4 am  i changed my mind  why was i getting up and being tired as hell for a fast food job making  8 hr  so i blocked the managers number and went the fuck back to sleep  enjoyed the day with my friend instead    the second place  i ll call gods chicken  i literally only applied at this place because my dad sent me the application  they were the only place that called me back  and i needed to pay my car note  so i took it  it was a brand new location that was opening  it was ok at first  i never liked the yuppie uniforms they made us wear  it felt dehumanizing  the store opened at 6 am  which means morning shifts were scheduled at 5 am  and guess what time they kept scheduling me  you already know  5 am  i made up some bullshit excuse about my crohn s disease and asked them to start scheduling me in the afternoons  instead they chose to cut mine and a few other employees hours  the people they promoted to shift leaders were nut jobs  the managers became condescending  and as usual  difficult customers  i had one person come up to the window and complain about me being rude and  misgendering  them because i couldn t hear what they were saying  evidently he was saying  it s sir  and i was hearing  it s sarah  lol  i was asking their name and said  ok ma am  because i heard him say  it s sarah  and they took huge offense  my last straw was the day a manager instructed a shift leader to  just tell her to do it  when she noticed a bucket was left out and needed to be cleaned  it wasn t mine  like  if she noticed it  and it bothered her that much  clean it your fucking self  then the manager condescendingly instructed me on how to rinse a bucket  then dismissed me by saying  you can go now  and kept talking to the shift leader about how  you have to tell them over and over  after i heard that  i grabbed all my stuff  went to my car  wrote a note  which i ll attach  here https imgur com gallery qmciala  and stuck it to the front door with black lash glue  the shift leader tried coming up to my car when i was about to leave  i waited till she got to my window  and drove off  managers were blowing up my phone while i was driving home  never felt so good  oh  and did i mention i walked out right during lunch rush  and i was the only food runner  lmaooo sorry not sorry bitches    i want to hear your stories about how you freed yourself from shitty jobs  ,b3gz21

41,"Guys, i wonder if r/antiwork is also correlated with disappointment in social and romantical areas of adult life?",how many of you here are overly miserable about working day in  day out  because there's no other motivation  besides survival  which could be planning holidays with so  or having money to be able to afford hanging out with friends weekly  doing your hobbies that require money     how much this upset with work life is connected with your existential thinking  that makes you wonder what's the whole purpose of your existence and such     i personally completely agree with freud statement  that if you have asked yourself 'what is the sense in life ' you are already mentally off  normally you dont even think about having to go to work  since it funds your other areas of life     but i think this overwhelming depressive feeling of being a prisoner to the system comes  when you start livign to work  rather than work to live ,b7rz8k

58,It's been a rough week., last week  my boss called me into her office  the conversation began with  essentially  an accusation  she told me that she suspected that i had become disgruntled and dissatisfied and that i was intentionally underperforming   her reasoning was that over the last six months or so  she's removed some responsibilities for  basically  noncritical background processes off of my plate  and last week and the week before that  i had trouble getting some little  other duties as assigned  stuff complete on time  basically filing paperwork  at no point were any complaints about the quality of the actual work that i do mentioned   a year ago in april  one of my colleagues got fired and i inherited her workload  i had a lot of responsibilities to a lot of people  who relied on me to get their work done  and over the last year  even as a few things have been taken off of my plate  the complexity and volume and expectations about how quickly i will complete my work have continually increased   i got a promotion and a raise  but the amount was disappointing and definitely not commensurate with the new and increasing expectations of me  so i went the office manager  who has really no way of appreciating what i do or how difficult it is  to discuss my compensation  and they told me that there's nothing they can do  i'm supporting more people  being forced to learn new systems and change the way i work  increase my value to the firm  etc  but this is just the baseline expectation   stepping up   how one of the partners describes the ideal level of engagement from us in order to meet the goal of increasing revenue by 60 percent in four years  is the minimum acceptable level of effort   so  all of this  then my boss has the fucking nerve to  when she sees me burning out  put me in a position of defending myself  of basically fucking apologizing for being exhausted and stressed out    oh  but you used to be so fun and talkative  now you just sit there with your headphones on and do your work  yeah  no shit  for starters  i can't be distracted because i have too much to do  second of all  i'm sorry i don't strut around the office cawing about or how busy i am but actually sit down and do something about it  also  i don't want to fucking listen to these consultants  they're a bunch of fat babies  a bunch of fucking 20-somethings right out of college  who spend most of their time talking about their exorbitant condos and vacations and cars  until it's time for their leisurely stroll out to buy lunch and bring it back and eat it in the breakroom   i bring one fucking turkey sandwich every day  i've even decided to cut out chips and a drink to save money  and i eat at my desk  so i can get more work done  so  no  i don't want to be constantly reminded that people who don't work half as hard as me make so much more money than i do  that i am breaking my body and my mind to make their lives easier   and my boss says  oh  yeah  things are rough  i go home practically in tears every day  okay  so you are allowed to have a hard time for the last couple of months  but i'm not allowed to be overworked for a year and feel the effects of it  fuck you  i used to respect this person and trust her  and now i don't  in one ten minute conversation  that was all completely obliterated   the ultimate outcome of the conversation was that it's my problem  i need to find a way to fix this situation  with no support  no concessions  just grin and bear it some more  again  fuck that ,b308sp

62,Stigma and discrimination regarding part-time work,why is there still so much social and cultural stigma around part-time work   so many people 'complain'  but really they're bragging  about how busy they are  how they're over-worked  how stressed they feel   yet  when someone chooses to work part time  and we're free to choose  right  that person is derided as lazy  a slacker  when all that person has done  is chosen to work less hours  and correspondingly get paid less  they're not slacking  since often  part-time workers work harder in the hours they're actually there  they're not getting paid more  they're not taking work away from someone else     logically there is nothing unjust about such an arrangement  yet part-time workers get so much hate and derision from colleagues and society as a whole  so they're paying less tax  but i've never heard anyone mention that  it's just  uhh  lazy   the only people who get a free pass in this regard are mothers of very young children  and only mothers  fathers get jack shit  and people with obvious  visible health issues  or people working multiple part time jobs that add up to full time hours   i'm a big fan of bertrand russel's  in praise of idleness  and  based on the current level of labour saving technology and automation  25 hour working weeks should really be the standard  not the exception   personally  i can afford to be a part-timer  i'm a child-free  minimalist  anti-consumer  and my long-term life plan involves developing skills that would allow me to work 20 hours a week whilst still having plenty of money to stash away for the future   but dealing with the stigma cannot be understated  i already deal with enough of that shit with my mental health    being despised and derided by most of society is exhausting  there reaches a point when you just stop justifying  defending or explaining yourself to people anymore  it's easier to just close off and isolate    modern work is destroying our health and relationships  choosing to go part-time  if you can  is revolutionary in a small way  i believe that everyone should be working less than what is the current standard  and i believe in being the change that you want to see ,b203na

75,Does anyone struggle with the 9-5/lateness?, honestly it's ruined my life  and even typing it i feel like a fucking disgusting lowlife and a child    i got a fucking hernia repair surgery mistakenly thinking it would help just get through the morning routine - wake up  drink caffeine  take a dump  pee a million times  sorry  - it made things worse  it destroyed already bad stamina    that single thing - just  like  being able to pee in my own apartment and not put myself in a situation where i am trapped on a subway needing to pee like a racehorse  or something else  - has ruined my life    i'm three months post op and i sit in horror and disbelief with a fucking block of wood  sutures  in my guts  an internal cavity that feels like the inside of a grapefruit  so much for breathing normally - i wake up groggy  in pain  and semi-suffocating  amazed i have made another horrible   horrible  life decision - like a fucking body-destroying decision  making things i struggled with  so much worse  -  for one reason  and one reason only - the lifelong failure to be a morning person   i'm sorry to be gross  but - welp  it's the truth   i set my alarm clock for 6 35  might only be conscious at 7  drink coffee  shovel food in  floss  while lying down  trying to enjoy the middle ground when i can still do my routine without standing    i know how long it takes to jog to the each subway station   but those one or two activities - basically trying to avoid a situation where i find myself needing to pee like a racehorse on a subway  or worse  and covering acne squeezing my meat husk into work clothes and shoes -   and the longer i am in a job - the more horrible it is  the more fucking impossible it seems to make 9am   not 9 05  god forbid  9 10  9 10 unless someone is dying gets fired    ideally in your desk  computer on  by 8 58    can't do it  amazed i was ever able to make 8 30am in the morning for  school  it's enough to make me understand women that sit on the subway putting on mascara  risking poking their own eyeballs out    because with each day of 9-10 hour days in a shitty office chair or in pain  it's so easy  it's so easy to fuck up and be late and physically be unable to get up and stay up  when you wake up in the morning with lower back pain  shoulder pain  and simply not wanting to get out of bed  head throbbing  feet throbbing  lower back throbbing  limbs falling asleep  i find myself sitting out of breath and wanting to stretch out in bed again  the last stretch before i stuff myself into clothes    sometimes  i'll admit it  i curl up back in a ball under the blankets putting on my bra and find myself browsing the internet again  because that's my hobby - lying down  and surfing the internet  this is when i have five to ten minutes of wiggle room - so i think  i squander them  i think to myself  i am so tired  i am so lonely - i panic  looking for  one last enjoyable thing to do  and then i have to hustle and end up late anyway  i make it a gamble instead of something i can do at my leisure   i fall asleep at 1am  it takes 2 5 to really  wake up  for the caffeine to pass through  in hindsight i dunno  how the fuck can someone have an adult life having to bomb themselves to sleep every night    what drugs might one take to get to sleep at 10-11pm     in my last contract job my boss barely tolerated me coming in at 10 15 and staying till 6 30 but fuck if i don't miss it horribly because she permitted it  i will never fucking have that again  it was in a big company and i could just sit quietly and listen to podcasts  i was left alone  it was still humiliating and awful and i know it makes me a bad  lazy person  that's how it's treated  i know the whole adult world fuck it  has to endure 8am  8 30am start times  from horrible commutes    i just can't imagine it  how is this normal    and then  having to endure that till 5 or 6  even if you don't take lunch fuck me  what time is there for oneself  if you have to go to bed at 10-11    i have another temp job  starting at 9am    i am just horrified and miserable    fuck me  that i don't have the skills to work a 10am-6 schedule  i put myself on a path of being so low value - a serial temp - and the singular virtue expected of me is being on time    i can't imagine saying this anywhere but here - i've struggled with this my entire life  with morning stamina  and all those little unpredictables - the elevator  realizing you have misplaced your phone somehow in the last five minutes  a held up subway  pedestrian  or for you vehicular communters  traffic  the wait for a train - they ruin a life  they get you fired  i know that however long it says it takes in google  you need   at a minimum  another 15 minutes    and still - i have failed to do that  i have rarely ever been early for anything in my entire life and i realize now if i plan to be 10 minutes early  i need a fucking half hour jump  at least     if any of you relate  esp  those of you taking public transit i'm listening    90  of office jobs can be done from home and i think that's what makes this so much worse  there's no one i envy more than the remote employee    those jobs are reserved for people actually pursued by employers     ,b6lf16

146,helping others? altruism in work,just wondering if anyone here has found work less terrible when it involves helping others or the environment  i'm not virtue signaling here  because i'm not actually that moral of a person even and could see how any job could quickly turn awful  just wondering if having a job involving teaching others  helping the environment  helping animals and people  etc has helped anyone in this sub have a bit more motivation for work  is it at least slightly better than the pointless office stuff  ,axi1eq
147,A Good Way To Assess Worth?,some background  i recently had an appraisal that  well  could have gone better  but that's down to a multitude of issues within the department and my life right now   however  i brought up again the idea of using metrics for assessing worker efficacy the way they do in my department  i work in an analytical lab  and the work we do involves running analyses on chemicals using various chemistry based methods   the way the department gauges how well an analyst is doing is down to how many analytical runs they do a month  and how many fail to produce reportable results through a fuck up of their own doing  rather than because of  say  the equipment suffering a fault   for instance  someone may do 50 analytical runs a month  and have 5 fail because they dun goofed  whereas someone else may have done only ten  perhaps they had other duties  were off most the month  or some other reason  but had 5 fail   these are not weighted results  so someone who does fewer  possibly harder assays is not seen any different to someone who does multiple easier assays each day for the month   my question is  do these metrics act as an objective way to assess the abilities of any one worker  because of my experience  i tend to do more experimental and more demanding assays  and i also do more stuff that isn't related to doing this kind of work  thus meaning i may not have as many assays to do a month compared to a new recruit who is busy doing three super easy and repetitive assays each day   tl dr  without further insight into the work done or weighting of metrics  i'm questioning the logic behind a simple pass fail ratio for work assignments in an analytical lab and how this impacts work appraisals ,awzok7
148,Not sure about options. In chronic pain and the thought of working even part time makes me want to die,i'll be 33 on sunday  and back in late 2011 i had a total breakdown  during which i was diagnosed with bipolar i and had to leave my job as a greeter in a walmart-like store  i'd been getting treatment for arthritis and chronic migraines in the few years leading up to that  so while i was forced to move back in with my  abusive  mother  i tried to apply for disability in the hopes that it would get me anywhere  between october of 2011 and may of 2018  i dealt with extreme paranoia  depression  mania  hallucinations  severe insomnia  anxiety  suicidal urges  including one hospitalization for having an actual plan to follow through  and new diagnoses of sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis  polycystic ovary syndrome  thanks to which  i had to have a 20x17x10  cm  cyst on my ovary surgically removed  sleep apnea  and fibromyalgia   every time i tried to apply for disability and sent in an appeal  i was denied  the last time  the judge looked at the evidence provided in a testimony by my community mental health caseworker  who saw me once a week and had written records of me stating that i had been struggling with being suicidal for over a year straight -- a timeframe that included my hospitalization -- and completely dismissed her as an 'unreliable witness' in my appeal   in 2017  i started attending college for the first time  i was barely able to attend even half time  or hold down the low-stress  16 hr week financial aid office job i had through the federal work study program  literally  i would miss work or class at least twice a month because of panic attacks or physical illness   thankfully  i've moved away from my abusive and controlling mother  and in with my boyfriend and girlfriend  girlfriend is autistic adhd and has never had a job  but is also unmedicated and unable to concentrate on anything she's not currently hyperfocused on  boyfriend has a full-time job that he generally enjoys with good coworkers  but he can't make enough for all three of us to make ends meet  long-term   i want to help out in some possible way  but since i moved away last year  i've lost insurance  and medication with it  and my mental and physical health has degraded drastically  and now i've been severely depressed  suicidal  and paranoid nearly non-stop since october of 2018  i cannot concentrate on anything for longer than about 10-15 minutes  and sometimes my fibro fog is so severe i'm literally sitting on the toilet  staring at toilet paper  and completely unable to remember how to clean myself for a solid 5 minutes  not only that  i don't have a vehicle of my own and cannot physically walk under my own power to the nearest bus stop to even begin looking around for a job  let alone be able to sit or stand in one place long enough to hold down even a part-time job   thinking about working makes me want to die  thinking about living like i am  unable to do anything to even help out around the house without being in excruciating pain on a daily basis  makes me want to die  i used to write  even self-published a couple of short erotica stories once  but now i can't concentrate long enough to churn one out  let alone format it for publishing   i'm trying to set up a gofundme to see a psychiatrist and get some medication to help with my bipolar in the hopes that will at least get me out of this constant suicidal funk  i don't know if it'll help  or if it does if it will help in time  i don't know what my options are for helping in a realistic way with bills or food -- the state of texas says i need a doctor's note  which i can't afford to go see  stating i cannot work in order to qualify for food stamps for more than my initial 3-month period that i've already used up  and then they'll insist i apply for disability  again  in order to keep it   after being denied so many times  i feel like it's pointless  especially since ssdi states that i have to have  earned  so many  work credits  within the past decade in order to qualify for ssdi  which i definitely do not  because the f ckers kept denying me for so long  which leaves me with ssi as my only option  and it's the worst option available because i can't get married or save up any kind of money or own too many 'valuable assets'  like a computer  or have even a  5 royalty come in from an old book being sold without the us government saying  um  excuse me  you no longer qualify for ssi because you make too much money now   my boyfriend's mom insists i should do this bullshit 'from home' job where people call my home phone and i provide some kind of support for something  idk she explained it badly and i zoned out to avoid a panic attack at the thought of talking on the phone and having the stress of dealing with a customer-facing job in my own home  in one of the few places i feel safe and secure  and  still  having to work on a schedule on top of that   i don't know what i can do  i don't even know what my options are anymore  even if i do apply for ssi  i have to find a way to get to a social security office to do so in person  because the online form is only good if you're also applying for ssdi at the same time  which i don't qualify for    amp x200b   tl dr  i'm multiply disabled  in chronic pain  badly suicidal  can't afford a doctor or meds  and have been repeatedly denied disability benefits  i just want to help out my boyfriend and girlfriend to make ends meet but i don't know what my options are anymore,axwr91

151,Quit one of my jobs,i worked at a couple apartment complexes as a trash valet  door to door trash pick up  the company is owned by republic services  i was with that company for about a year  the money was good  600 wk  and the hours were short  2hrs night depending on the night  the only bad things were the 7 day per week schedule  the 8pm start time every night  leaky trash  the dog shit  the loneliness  the weather  hot  cold  and rain  and having to deal with it when residents would do retarded shit  last week i started a second job  this one was full time with a 5am start  i thought i could stick it out working both until i go back to school in august  i couldn't  i had a long day and a rough night  it wasn't the first time i wanted to quit  but now it was different because i had another source of money  i realized i didn't  have to do anything i didn't  want to  it felt like the sense  of trepidation before jumping into cold water    after finishing one apartment complex  i left the compactor key at the leasing office and texted my boss i was done  he called me worried something had happened  i said everything was fine  that i couldn't really explain why  but i was done  i apologized several times for the lack of notice  and didn't explain how tired i was or how i really felt  he said this was a shock to him and he didn't see it coming  we weren't in regular contact  despite him being my supervisor  the last time i saw him was in july 2018   i feel so bad about not giving him notice  he will have trouble maintaining service until he hires a replacement  tomorrow will be my first day off since new year's eve    just needed to get this off my chest  i feel guilty ,ayxdbt
152,"Just a thought, don't lynch me for this.",a disclaimer  if i didn't agree with the majority of posts on this subreddit i wouldn't really follow it  but i think it's not as black and white as people tend to see it here   so  i tend to see posts made by people absolutely suffering on their 9-5 office jobs  surely the system is fucked and people nowadays tend to get the bare minimum of their free time  but what about people who have it worse  what about the welders in factories who do manual labor for 12 hours straight  the bus drivers  all those ungrateful medical jobs   i worked a bit at some of these places for a while   i'm just saying that having a 9-5 office job is having it way better than the majority  maybe it's only this way in my country  but i dream about having the aforementioned position  i really hope to start studying for a programmer diploma sometime soon    office workers here tend to get their 9-5 hours quite flexible  the pay is more or less respectable   they work in a clean and comfortable environment ffs   dunno guys  just my 5 cents  sorry if the english is bad  having it as my third language ,ayav1a

154,"Depression, Starting a Business, and Universal Basic Income idea",hey everyone  not sure if this post belongs here but i am a long time lurker and feel like it will resonate with a lot of you    i have been severely depressed so far in my adult life  work is a huge source of pain and mental agany for me  so much so i havent been able to work a 'normal job' in over a year  i've been making ends meet by doing gig apps  such as lyft or uber eats  they allow me to work when i can and not work when i'm mentally unable to  the idea of having to eventually get a 'real job' with benefits so i'll have health insurance kills me  literally  currently i'm working non stop so i can be able to make rent that is past due    i have grown to realize that the only way out of this is either suicide  or to start my own business that will eventually generate enough passive income that i wont even have to work  or at least very little  my business idea cant be mentioned here but my partner and i believe it can become a multi million dollar company in the next 5 to 10 years    anyhow  what this all brings me too is to mention this idea to you  fellow antiworkers  if and when i make it 'rich' i want nothing to do with my extra income besides this idea of mine  i would love to start my own universal basic income  ubi    i am not sure about the specifics of how i will go about it  but essentially i want to find individuals who are like my current self  who can no longer function in this backwards society  who truly need income  personally if i could be receiving ubi right now  i know i would be contributing much more to society and be much more mentally stable  i would give my recipients  2 500 a month  only thing i would like in return would be personal accounts on how ubi has helped them    any thoughts would be greatly appreciated  hope all of you are doing okay out there ,awpwx3
155,Things that should be things but aren’t,-every person who has a job should be entitled to paid time off  yes  fast food and retail workers deserve time off too  not just us office workers who sit on our asses all day    -jobs should not be allowed to ask you to find a replacement if you are sick  especially if you go in at some insane hour like 4-5 am  who the fuck do they expect to pick up my calls and agree to cover my shift at 4 am    -jobs shouldn t be allowed to penalize you or guilt you into coming in when they call you on your days off  you don t owe them your free time    -no employment should be  at-will  having a job is not  at will  if it was  no one would have one  because no one wants to have a job  we only want to get paid because we have to to survive  this is an excuse that lets employers fire and abuse people and then escape the legal consequences    -40 hour work weeks need to go in the garbage  part time hours with full time wages  and benefits  part time employers also should have to give benefits  no more cheaping out and giving employees 34 9 hours a week so you can escape giving them medical coverage  ,b0cd4y
156,"I care about getting fair wages, not more wages",something that always bugged me when i started working was how my boss and colleagues would always focus on bonuses as a way to motivate people  i distinctly remember being shown the highest bonus that was paid to a colleague which was double his salary    amp x200b   it never resonated with me  i knew i wanted to be paid but i don't care about more money  i've been trying to articulate these two feelings inside me and i think it's the following    amp x200b   i care about getting fair wages  not more wages    amp x200b   i don't want to work to death  i don't want to have to wake up at 5 am and come home at 9 pm working every day like my dad  being paid  100k but what life is that  you're wasting you life to earn numbers that could disappear tomorrow    however  i do want to be treated fairly  i want to be paid what i am worth and not pushed to work harder for less so someone at the top can buy premium food instead of regular food ,b0knw7
157,i think my life is over,just wanna share my story   i dropped out of of hs back in 1999  never paid any fucking attention in school  never once did school work  i was a goof ball  just doing pranks and goofing off with classmates  things weren't so bad after i dropped out  i still visited my school during lunchtime to hang with my friends and i got to eat their lunch lol  they weren't really my friends tho  we hung out like 2-4times outside of school  i was the outcast in our social circle  my parents gave me tons of shit but i told em i'm studying to get my ged  never happen  when i turn 16  i got my first job shitttt story is too long  i will keep it short  when everyone else graduated hs  that's when isolation began  when they were off to college  we sorta kept in touch through myspace but it was mostly me  watching everyone else live a good experience  by early 20s  i started to feel very depressed  suicidal  it was knowing that i'm not gonna be anything more than what i am now  knowing that i couldn't develop a normal relationship  i felt how my entire life would turn out  i quit my job  my parents would yell at me every single day  my 20s was a major fucking waste and suffering  a lot of jobs on and off  moved in and out of my parents house  isolation  the only social interaction i got were from few dates i went on  mind u  im not a bad looking guy  it's the only thing that i had going for me and that kept me alive  when i started to enter 30s  shit started to hit the fan  i got tired of missing out life  i wanted what everyone else had but i knew it was far out of my reach  i'm turning 35 this year and i'm just feeling so sorry for myself  i went through most of my life in misery and in isolation  the excitement i had in my early 20s  chasing women  dreaming big that one day i'm going to live the life i want  it's all faded away  there's no hope or life left in me  i feel so fucking empty  i wake up feeling lonely and not knowing what to do  just not having anyone to talk to  no joy  and i felt this way for last 20yrs  20yrs since highschool  things aren't the same anymore  i no longer look young  ppl who look like me have multiple kids  a family of their own  i'm just a deadbeat who hates his life  nobody will ever want to be with someone like me  women situation is getting worse too  girls used to not care as much  nobody sticks around cus i'm a loser in his mid 30s  i guess it's true what they say  women do prefer more stable men as they get older  i just know that i can't ever go back to work again but i don't want to continue my path like this  i think my life is over and it's pretty clear that there's nothing left for me  ppl do not change and by mid 30  it's clear that i am who i am  just a sad man  im not too worried about my parents  i have an older brother who's successful and a younger sister  i haven't talked to my siblings since the fall out  my dad has never really cared  he always yelled  only person who might deal with my death is my mom but she'll get over it  it's not like she likes me   spend time with me or call me  i don't feel scared at all  it seems like death is the most logical solution or path that i should take  nobody will remember or care anyway  the world will move on  im not saying i'm going to kill myself  i just wanted to share my story,azyz5u

160,"My take on hating your job, working for yourself, and finding something you enjoy",every week i try to find a new subreddit and engage in a new conversation  yesterday i came upon this one  linked somewhere in a retirement sub  i spent yesterday reading posts and talking to a few people to get an understanding of this sub    maybe you care maybe you don't - but this sub is not healthy  that being said   it's 100  okay to hate your job  or working in general  however  it isn't normal to hate something  while simultaneously willing to do 0 things to help solve the actual problem  it seemed to me off the bat  this was a sub for people who really see the issue as capitalism  which has its problems without a doubt  but i often find people blaming capitalism when there's nobody else to blame  and when the system is  wrong  - you're internally absolved from any responsibility to attempt to fix something as big as our economic system   i'm actually here to tell you   capitalism is your best friend here  capitalism is the only economic system where someone can work hard for 15 years  bank cash  and retire early and with enough money to enjoy your remaining years  there's enough cash out here for everyone  you've just gotta find something you enjoy doing  i'm  not  talking about fire - fire is the pf of retirement  it's easy to retire early when you made 250k for a decade  that isn't quality advice for middle class people    in december of 2017  i committed the cardinal sin and took a  management  job for the money  a huge salary for working in west virginia  i fucking hated it - it was an immoral company  my employees weren't making shit  and we routinely scammed our patients  yeah it was a medical company on top of everything  i decided i would never do this job the way they wanted me to  so i said fuck it and quit - internally  i worked at that job for  5-6 months while doing absolutely nothing  i refused to overcharge for procedures  put customers on pay plans that had interest  and basically came in  turned the lights on  sat there  turned them off and went home  during those months  i started my own llc and started selling video games at the flea market facebook ebay  i'd buy them in bulk  break them down and sell them individually    around june 2018 i finally was ready to leave my job - and sell games full time  i simply got up one day at work  took my key off my ring and gave it to my colleague and just walked out  i ended up taking the job i have now  on top of selling games  because a mentor and friend wanted me to join his firm  otherwise i'd be selling games at the flea market for a living - but that job made me realize exactly why people hate work  so i completely understand    the point i'm trying to make is  if you hate your 9-5 you can absolutely do something about it  if you don't like your job - make one up if you have to  happiness is important in life  don't give up half your adult life to someone or some company that you hate  but it's gotta start with you - if you don't commit to making the change  nobody will do it for you    my apologies for the wall of text ,b0m18v

Maybe it’ll set you free too?",i m in my 20 s and in college full time  i also have a full time job  my major was nursing but once i realized the absolute shit they receive every day from a big admin  patients patient families  and other burnt out nurses i was completely over it  i also left major due to not being paid enough for hard work  emotionally stressing  it is gross  blah blah etc  etc  i was scared every job was like this  so i did my research online and went to talk to multiple people about their jobs as well as look at my own experiences    i do not care about work performance  i do not need to be appreciated at my job  the only thing i care about is how this 40  hr a week shit affected the rest of my life  some people say they would rather work 3-4 days a week for 12 hrs a day rather than 9-5 m-f    this is what i have found from working 9-5 vs 12s  these jobs were very similar and paid the same as well  only difference was the hours and salary vs hourly    9-5  salary  felt like my entire life at first  i got off sat  amp  sun which was great bc everyone else was off  i got off holidays  i felt like i had more freedom in my job bc i was salary  we get off early fridays  that s fine with me i get paid salary  it didn t feel like a money game as much as 12s to me  it was easier to make habits working 9-5 every day  i felt like i could go to gym in the morning and be off by 5 and have dinner with a date or go to bed early  i didn t get any extra pay for staying late or getting there early so i found myself not doing it  which lead to me being passed up for promotions  like i said i don t care about work performance but i do care about how it affects me outside of work  meaning i care about income    12 hour shifts  hourly  i worked mw fss one week and wt the next  i worked 8 30am-8 30pm   i was able to be productive on my days on but my days off i was so damn exhausted that i slept all day  by the time my weekend to work came around i had come up with every pep talk in the book just to get myself to show up  i always did  but it took everything out of me  they say 12 hours but you have to show up earlier and leave later  but i got paid for it  all the shit was closed by the time i got off  i then had to do all my errands in a few days when i wanted to do nothing but sleep  i couldn t set habits bc as soon as i would get in the groove of working my time would be up and then i get used to being at home and then i had to head back  i hated it  working all weekend sucks  i missed out on so much  which is saying a lot for a introverted person like me  i could control my income a bit more and pick up extra shifts if i needed them but i always found myself very very willing to give them up    conclusion all in all i would take 9-5 and have those weekends off    bigger lesson  i was making 45k in average col and spending all of it  i paid off all debt first  then i lived in a 1br luxury apt  went out to eat steaks or whatever whenever i damn well pleased and donated to charity or family who needed it  now that one i don t regret  i also bought a new car  nothing ridiculous just a nice camry  i wanted it  i got it  bc i could  i just bought these things bc i thought it was what people did and bc i was so miserable at my job i had to have some type of happiness  but my true happiness came from not working like a slave  people asked me how i afforded to do whatever i wanted  and why i offered to pay for their meals if they couldn t afford it or whatever the hell was the case  and i said well i paid off debt  i realized i was so much more financially able bc i had no debt  now i m working on this new thing  retiring early   then i discovered this is an actual thing called fire  financial independence  debt free  retire early  i had hiccups along the road but i m well on my way now  i encourage you all to read about it  i think it ll set me free ,azj1lz

226,"""Charisma"" and ""people skills""",it's funny how in death of a salesman willy loman emphasises the importance of being likeable to his sons but that's actually the worst advice he could give as they grow up with no skills whereas their next door neighbour's son  bernard  has no charisma but applies himself to his studies and becomes a lawyer  it seems the absolute reverse is true in reality  your depth of knowledge is irrelevant  how popular are you  work is like school cliques  nothing changes from when you're a kid  you ask to join the popular group  job application interview promotion  and they either accept you or they don't  the kind of people who race up the work ladder are supposedly  charismatic  but in my experience they're unbearably smug  false douche bags  yet no one seems to notice  there are excellent fictional caricatures  for example lou bloom in nightcrawler  benjamin in wayne' world  even asshole homer in zombie simpsons  all ultra confident and aggressive yet  charismatic  it just goes to show how toxic and alien work culture is and how indoctrinated most people are  ,az6tfw

228,A false skylight.,the place that i work at has swanky interior design  what i wanna highlight is that there's a section of ceiling  about 4ft by 10ft  which is meant to mimic a skylight  it is several square panels that have a continuous printout of gorgeous sky and clouds as if you were looking up on a sunny day  they're even lit up  which adds to the effect   today i was staring at it and i felt the most disgusting pang of sadness and longing  i could be enjoying a sunny day  but instead i'm stuck working  i could be living somewhere that isn't manhattan - someplace where the sky is actually visible and that doesn't feel like living in a hallway - but instead i live here  and i live here because i need to work   it feels almost perverse to decorate an office space with reminders of what your day  could  look like if you weren't stuck here working  eat my ass  interior designers ,awevow
229,Nothing to do at work,we can all mostly agree that working sucks but having nothing to do at work is beyond torture  as if my working times from 7 - 16 aren't already inhumane enough  theres nothing to do in the office i'm stuck in  sometimes a customer comes in  then i'll be busy for 15 min  thats all  i can't even netflix  amp  chill since theres a woman close to me who keeps standing up for stupid reasons and she would see my screen  whenever i ask for work  they're like  theres nothing to do  you can write some notes or read folders   do any of you deal with the same bullshit  how do you stay  or try to  sane  i want to quit so badly but i have to look after me  amp  my mom ,b0m3cl
230,Am I the only one rooting for an extinction level event?,i'm a mid-career technology consultant that is just done  i only have the will to work about 15 hours a week and that is being sapped away very quickly   the corporate speak and process mentality is so mind-numbing that i actively loath it now  i'm doing work in the social sector  which i thought would be excited to put their limited resources to effective use  nope  it's just a bunch of well-meaning folks that are mired in the same mindset   when i saw a page titled  17-step critical path narrative  in a document that i had been instructed to take as an input to the project  i just couldn't even  now  i'm just avoiding looking at it  ugh ,ayik6e

234,Fed up with contradictory expectations,after a few months of burning through my savings looking for a job after taking a semester off from college for mental health reasons  i've managed to find a part-time job as a receptionist at an upscale hair salon    i was hired almost entirely based on my looks  as receptionists are the  face  of the salon  during training i was presented with several expectations that directly contradict one another    - always have makeup and hair perfectly done  but never leave the front desk to reapply makeup or fix your hair   - wear the nicest clothes possible  must be clean at all times  work directly with hair dye every day with no apron  i will have to buy clothes for work out of my next paycheck because almost none of what i have now is considered presentable for work   - be at the front desk 99  of the time to check clients in and out  however  all other work  washing dishes  laundry  etc  that needs to be done is in the back room  i am expected to never be idle at the front desk  but at the same time all work there is to be done is in the back   - closing up should never take more than 30 minutes after locking the front door  doing all the tasks required to close as quickly as possible takes around an hour   - on a busy day it is tacitly expected that i won't take a lunch break of more than a few minutes  even if i work a double shift  8 30am-8pm  on a normal shift breaks of a few minutes are okay  on a busy day it is heavily frowned upon to take any breaks  even to use the bathroom   - never be seen on my phone  leave it in the back at all times on a shift  must answer texts and calls from the owner promptly    i have a fainting condition that prevents me from standing for extended periods  and this is the first job i've been able to find in months that allows me to sit down when i need to  my paycheck at the end of the month won't even cover my rent   ,azv7iq

239,Suddenly I find myself on the other side the unemployment thirst, i too was once highly desperate for any work and now i have a job  i  don't agree with the company's  neoliberal  values of entrepreneurship  and stuff  but at least its an income in this viciously capitalist  society       now i am not even regularized yet and my boss has  delegated to me the hiring of more project based workers  the emails and  applications coming in are eerily familiar  a mirror to when i too was  an overqualified applicant rushing in to any job opening i can find   while unemployed multiple times after graduation  i notice some tricks  and traps that immediately screen out a bulk of applications  little  things like not attaching sample works or wrong email subject       suddenly  from a paradoxical position of power   being not-yet-regularized and  yet accepting job applications myself   and seeing my past unemployed  self in these desperate applicants  i'll overlook little mistakes  because that could be me too  but it still makes me sad  these people  are overqualified  one applicant said such bs that she  dreams  to be  part of this part-time job  i've been there making that bs fam  i cannot  blame you for writing this  and i wish i'd take you all  but i can't   we're all competing for scraps the capitalist system taunts us with      i  see the desperation in-between the lines and that was me once   and  probably still is  since i am not regularized  i have no illusions  this  open call could be the auditions for the position i am sitting right  now  but on some level  i don't care  i don't want to compete with these  people to keep my position  i just want a decent life  and i am sure  that is these applicants was as well  capitalism atomizes us  turning  use each into readily replaceable gears       i don't want to be a gear  i don't want these people to be gears  there is no happy ending to this post   ,b0wxhw
240,Heavy work days and relationships : somethings gotta give,so- i live with my boyfriend and this is how his life is organized     10-12hrs work and work related activity  driving  dressing etc   1-2 hrs  exercise   2 hrs  tv time     those are his 14 waking hours    he is miserable  i can tell  and he s not afraid to vocalize it  but he feels obligated to his job  he has a boss there that has been really kind to him  and he feels like he hast to work long hours  my boyfriend is really meek and has trouble thinking for himself and understanding that this is a job- and his boss is a boss not a friend  recently he says he doesn t get enough alone time so rather than cut back the amount of hours he works he suggests that we spend less time together      i find this sort of laughable  because during the aforementioned tv time  we spend about 20 minutes talking about our days  other than that we sit silently in front of the tv  usually i draw or something i just like to be in the same room as him  so i assume the only thing i can really do for him is simply leave the room and go to a different room so he feels truly alone    he s always grumpy and can hardly talk about anything that requires real thought  i feel like it s awfully sad to let a relationship  something you once found joy in- be the first thing on the chopping block so that you can better accommodate your insane job  ,b11t1x

253,Buying your companies stuff,i posted this a while ago on  r unpopularopinion and had no traction  so i guess it's actually an unpopular opinion   i recently graduated college and started working in the auto industry  june last year  the culture in many parts of this company and all the other auto companies so very toxic  from day 1 so many employees just tear into people who don't drive our companie's cars  they honestly act as if my 10 year old japanese car is actively draining sales from our company    i work here  they pay me  transaction over  i'm not at all obligated to purchase their products  if this was like ticonderoga and it was a couple dollar product then i would ablige  but cars are often 30k   if i wanted to buy a new car and i found a better deal or even just preferred a competitor car that should be fine  i personally wouldn't ever buy a new car because it's a horrible investment    what's worse is that they will often guilt trip the hell out of new college grads who are still heavily in debt  telling people who barely take home any money after their debt payments each month to buy cars is rude and horrible financial advice  ,aw58ng
