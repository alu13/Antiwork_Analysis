11,How I feel about getting fired 4 years ago.,"For this, I will refer to my boss as Mr Anderson.

You fired me, Mr. Anderson. Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do, but I didn't get a new job. I couldn't. I was compelled to stay unemployed. Compelled to disobey. And now here I stand because of you, Mr Anderson. Because of you, I'm no longer an agent of this system. Because of you, I'm changed, unplugged, a new man, so to speak.",False,4a3ege,ChildOfEden,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/4a3ege/how_i_feel_about_getting_fired_4_years_ago/,8,6
12,"""Work"" (xpost from r/SanctionedSuicide)","Forced into life, you’re told it’s your duty to work for the privilege of living.

To sustain an existence you had no part in making.

You’re expected to forfeit your time in a job that you hate to earn just enough to survive.

To slave for pennies and save for a retirement you’ll never receive.

And so goes the cycle of living to work and working to live:

Wake with the alarm and commute to your cage.

Endure 8 hours of tedium and stress. Frustration and fatigue. Ass-kissing and office politics.

Come home exhausted. Anesthetize yourself with TV. Then head off to bed to do it all again.

Work. Eat. Sleep. Repeat.

Like a broken record. Over and over. Again and again. Day in and day out.

This is your life. An absurd daily grind. 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.

Spend the weekends recuperating and doing the crap you couldn’t do while you were working.

Cooking. Cleaning. Laundry. Maintenance of a miserable life.

A morsel of pleasure may be found here and there.

But time keeps score. The clock ticks down.

Because the next thing you know you’re back at your desk. Back in the bondage of work.

With another week’s worth of shit to swallow.",False,49zo5a,pathofraven,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/49zo5a/work_xpost_from_rsanctionedsuicide/,1,36
