7,What job made you hate your life the least while doing it?,"Hi r/antiwork,

I am currently out of work right now which is great but starting to hurt me financially. I find that as I am looking for a new job, I am getting a deep sense of dread and my stomach is turning (coupled with the general sense of guilt that society enforces for not working.)

What job made you hate your life the least while doing it compared to other work you have had? I am hoping to avoid some of the worst aspects of previous jobs I have had, in an entry levelish position. 

In order from the aspects that I hope to avoid the most:


1. Toxic/abusive workplace culture, fostered by supervisors and managers.

2. Having to deal with clients and customer service in general.

3. Inadequate training.

4. Expectations/responsibilities far exceed the pay grade.

5. No down time.

6. Grueling physical work.

7. Never being able to say I ""used"" my liberal arts bachelor because the position requires no college (or even high school) degree.


I know people generally despise ""bullshit"" jobs, but I honestly wouldn't mind trying my hand at some office job I can just come and sit at and do the minimal grind, not deal with many people, then go home. 

Any advise? I feel like an ideal position for me would be some type of low intensity forest surveyor for a parks service, but unfortunately I don't have a BS that would qualify me for that.

23,Work is Meaningless - An Old Poem,"So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. 

I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.

And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.

So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun. 

For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.

What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? 

All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.

A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God, for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment? 

To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

Employers; either the pay is good and you therefore have no reason to hide it, or you're wilfully hiding it because it's terrible and you think it will deter people from applying.

Now to take a sick day
Updated 1 day ago

Explaining to your boss that you'll be out for a sick day is always awkward,
not only because many employees use sick days as an excuse to take a day
off but also because colleagues and managers count on our presence. A
CNN report explains how to tell your boss that you're off sick, including
keeping it brief; acknowledging bad timing; and reassuring those people that

count on you.

34,I'm wondering how many people here are on the spectrum?,"It's my assumption that people with autism are less likely to adhere to the pressure to work that's so prevalent in our society, due to our dissident cognition. The way I see things is that I've been born at a disadvantage in a society that favors the outgoing, charming, and charismatic smooth-talkers. Now, I have no desire to participate in the rat race, but if I'm going to be pressured by my peers into jumping into the fire then I should at least have the capability of succeeding, otherwise what you're telling me essentially is that I'm only useful as a wage slave. If you're going to tell me that my life is only worth $10 an hour, an apartment, a used car, 10K's of debt and an unfulfilling waste of youth job, then I'm gonna tell you to go ahead and fuck yourself. I don't give a shit about having a ton of money or a fancy car or any of that. It's the hypocrisy of those who do care about material items telling me that I can't have the same things, but that I should still play the game. I am fully aware that there are ways to escape the rigged system and become independent. To successfully do that usually requires some kind of artistic talent, psychopathic behavior, high level of skill at something, and a bit of luck. I have none of that, so basically I'm screwed. But I still won't play your game. I still have the right to enjoy my life in whatever way I can.

I find the ""best"" jobs are ones you finish and are done with. No hanging around stuck in some office or box retail. No jobs waiting for people like security guards, cashiers, etc..

Merchandiser - I've worked for several companies where I either work alone or with team and merchandise products at store. It can either be resets, placing displays, or ordering. In some of these you finish and get to go home. Or either you can hang around until clock runs down and bring a book, video game, watch youtube, etc.. I've done jobs where we finish in 5 hours and go home but still got to put 8 hours on timesheet. Or there's been ones where I was paid a set amount to do a project/assignment. Naturally I work really fast and finish.

Freelance basically anything. I have creative talents of making music so this is real. I have yet to make anything really because opportunities are hard to come by. However, there's freelance writing, programming, art, etc...

Gig work. There's a lot of apps out there where you can make money building a display, delivering food, audits, mystery shopping, etc.. It can be unstable work week to week, but it has given me really good side income some months.

52,Turnover is not made of apples,"For various reasons, I've quit on a bunch of horrible employers over the past year (but usually only when I had money saved up and/or something else lined up that I could do afterward).  


Here's what I found after being on their contact lists for so long.  


\-WIS International sent an invitation for me to come back twice. I've quit on them in consecutive years, and they still sent me something wanting me back because they can't find enough staff for their business. This is the company that has practices which are, well...highly illegal. Such as forcing hotel stays where employees only get four hours of sleep, forcing people to work 16 to 24 hours in a row, things like that. They've had three or four managerial shakesup since I've been on their email list, and nothing ever really seems to change.  


\-Pratt-Whitney is a horrible warehouse chain that uses UPS for their warehouse operations in a town called Londonderry. I worked there for six months last year and, surprisingly, it's one of the better jobs I had. This was the job that made me suicidal and feel hopeless about life. They hired a new operations director while I was there, and put in a new staffing coordinator- probably because the ladies who had been doing it up until that point had not been having a good time. This was another job with extremely high turnover to the point where they had a new orientation group in every week, which was highly demoralizing. Recently, I got an email saying that they are hiring again, and could I please apply?  


\-Callogix was a terrible company that I worked for, and they let me go for various reasons- at 8 in the morning, knowing full well that I would have to sit and wait over three hours for the next bus to come by so I could go home. Every now and then, when I pop on indeed to see what's available, I see that they are hiring. This happens about every two months or so. They just can't keep people working for them. Their turnover is incredible, and not good like the ones made from apples. More like bad, as in it's appallingly obvious there's an upper class and a lower class at work. These two classes were separated by a locked door with keycard entry.  


I wonder at what point will managers realize they are costing themselves money by being terrible? I wonder at what point will business owners finally wise up and stop the fast revolving door of entry-level employees and the slowly revolving door of mid-level management? I kind of think it might never actually happen, not as long as employees have to prostrate themselves before a boss just to earn a living- something Adam Smith was opposed to, believe it or else.  


And all of these reflections are coming to me while I'm contemplating how to initiate a class-action lawsuit against my current employer, which self-identifies as an escrow company while they pocket 20% of every transaction while refusing to offer payment protection for people who prove they completed the work they were asked to do.

53,What do you think of Basecamp's work culture?,"https://basecamp.com/about/jobs

Some bits that stand out to me...

&gt; We value a calm company and deliberate, concerted effort. You‚Äôll have a lot fewer meetings, a lot less email, and a lot less interruption. Turns out 8 hours are plenty of time to get work done when you don‚Äôt slice your day into tiny ‚Äúwork moments‚Äù.

&gt; Every three years, employees are eligible to take a one-month-long paid sabbatical.

&gt; 40 hour work week - Work is a marathon, not a sprint. We regularly stick to 40 hours a week, with the occasional emergency or once-every-few-years special push demanding more.

&gt; 32 hour (4-day) Summer work week - May 1 through August 31, we work 4 days a week, for a total of 32-hour weeks.

&gt; Whatever hardware, software, or services you need to do your job are always 100% on us. No red tape, no questions asked.

&gt; Paid Parental Leave - When you welcome a new baby, Basecamp encourages you to take up to 16 weeks leave as primary caregiver and up to 6 weeks leave as secondary caregiver, at 100% paid salary. Primary or secondary caregivers can choose to take an additional 8 weeks unpaid leave.

&gt; Vacations and Paid Holidays - Basecamp offers 3 weeks of paid vacation, a few extra personal days, and a few national holidays every year. This is a guideline, so don't sweat a few extra days.

&gt; No office traps - We don't offer things like Foosball tables, catered meals in the office, and other ‚Äúperks‚Äù designed to keep you at work for all of your waking hours. We want you to put in 8 quality hours then go live your life, rest, and recharge so you can come back fresh to do it again.

54,Practical Antiwork?,"Sorry if this gets a bit rambly. Does anyone with experience have advice on getting by without a full time job? I've been dealing with major depression and anxiety for several years now, and while it seemed to be in remission for a while, lately it's been worse than ever. I can't see myself holding down a job; even if my employer was understanding I'm sure I'd go beyond reasonable accommodation. I'm going to talk to my doctor about going on disability when I get the chance, but I'm not sure what to expect (I'm in Canada, NS specifically). I had a psychiatric assessment a few years ago, which might need to be updated? Would my parents income matter? They don't have much, but I know they'd offer me something. I don't even want them to know honestly, they'd shame me for 'giving up' like this. What about my own savings? I don't have a lot, but I do have enough to live off for a while. I also have some student loan debt. I haven't finished my degree; I am very close and do plan to eventually, I tried this year but it didn't work out. I know this affects the repayment schedule. Also, I'm not sure if I should try and move to a larger city for logistical reasons. I don't have a car and I have to rely on friends and cabs a lot. I can do the math, but cities also have more resources.

59,There's nothing wrong with being unemployed.,"We're conditioned to think there's something wrong with not having a job and even not wanting to work. Ironically, people who dislike their jobs tend to judge unemployed people. I have a job that I don't care for, so i rarely go and I understand what it's like not wanting to work. The whole thing is fucked; work 5 days a week until retirement when you're 60, but of course by then you're too old to truly enjoy your money and you don't even know how to relax because your whole life has been focus on work. That's why so many older people who retire get depressed or go back to working. Fortunately I came to realize that money can't make me happy early in my life so this saved a lot of time people waste chasing money.

The way I see it is you didn't choose to be born, so you should at least be allowed to live your life however you want to. People tend to judge you if you're unemployed because they're unhappy, and judging makes them feel a little better about themselves. But somehow working a job you dislike for the most part of your life is considered normal. We've been conditioned to think and say things like ""work isn't supposed to be fun"" but why not?. They say ""everyone else does it"", but does that make it less crazy?

I say do whatever it is you enjoy (unless you enjoy killing people or something). I myself enjoy meditating, reading, watching tv and [making music](https://soundcloud.com/remedy97/understand), so I spend most of my time doing that. Although my passion is music, I'm not sure i'll get far with it. Although a year ago I made [this album](https://breaze.bandcamp.com/album/the-art-of-being-nobody) and although it was free, I made some money off it which was cool and really surprising. So I definitely recommend also finding a creative hobby if you have a lot of free time.

On top of all this though, I highly recommend taking some time out of your day to just *be*. No phone, no tv, no distractions. Just spending some time observing your own thoughts. We're always doing, so it's good to take some time off and just do nothing (literally).

60,Work should not be more important than your life,"But it is. Or, your boss certainly thinks so.

This has been a rough week for me. Scratch that, this has been a rough month for me. Well, more rough than usual I suppose. On January 14th my grandmother died. We were very close, and she has been an important part of my life for as long as I can remember. This isn‚Äôt really the proper forum for a eulogy, and its not my angle here to fish for sympathy‚Äîthis is, for our purposes here, background information. Her memorial is this Friday, and I requested the day off. Thankfully it was granted, but I‚Äôm having a difficult time grappling with having to work this entire week with my entire family in town, people I see maybe once every few years or so. I should have taken the whole week off, knowing full well I would be a wreck. This is valentine‚Äôs week, however, and I work in the produce department, which covers floral. This is arguably the biggest week of the year for us. Even if I had requested that time, I would not have gotten it. 

I have been thinking a lot about this particular subject since her death, as coming into work has been extremely taxing. As I work for a company that prides itself on customer service, I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to express any other emotion than obsequious happiness. But I am not happy; in fact I‚Äôm downright miserable. This feeling, the subject of this post, really hit me hard this Tuesday. My cousin had just gotten into town for the service, and we went to lunch before I had to go to work. It is the peak of season here in Florida, and I was rushing to finish lunch so I could get to work on time‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt‚Äîand when I clocked in I wasn‚Äôt in a particularly jovial mood, having just powered through a lunch with a family member I enjoy the company of but almost never get to see, just so I could had the pleasure of working for 8 hours. Anyway, I had a thought upon clocking in and walking into our cooler, which essentially came down to this: the company I work at doesn‚Äôt care about any of this. The particulars of my life, the petty travails of its employees, are nothing compared to that of the singular drive for profit. I suddenly realized‚Äînot for the first time but for the first time in a visceral way‚Äîthat work and life are utterly incompatible. The world of work is not the real world, but ironically it is the one we inhabit the most. Everything about work is fake, plastic, a charade of pretend emotions and pretenses, just so people will be slightly more comfortable buying groceries here instead of Walmart. A grand illusion constructed for the ever-expanding acquisition of more monetary wealth. And the paltry lives of the gears that make up the machine mean nothing. The death of a slave‚Äôs grandmother doesn‚Äôt generate any profit, especially if said slave isn‚Äôt at work to be squeezed. So he has to come in, the company requires it. We have a duty to uphold the value of our company for our stockholders, after all, its right there in the mission statement. There are some other bullet-points in there too but they aren‚Äôt as important as that one. And it‚Äôs the only one that matters anywhere, not just at this company. It‚Äôs like we live behind a mirror, and what ought to be meaningful, and real, is reflected back at us as threadbare, unimportant, the dark reflection of a grim specter refracted through the dizzying haze of surplus value production. 

I work on Saturday. The day after my grandmother‚Äôs memorial service. I work at 7 in the fucking morning. No time for silent thought, no meditation, no time for family and friends. No time even for tears. You have work to do. There‚Äôs money to be made, don‚Äôt you know.

65,"First week at work. Help me,","I recently started working for a small company in Spain that buys and sells used smartphones, tablets, and accessories. I'm one of the people in charge of testing some devices to see if they work fine or not. The task is totally boring, repetitive, stressing, and unproductive (worse for me). There's no possibility to lose time and relax, I have to do something every second. 10 hours a day for 900 euros a month, at least on Fridays I only have to work 4 hours, for a total 40 hours per week that I lose to make some people richer. Those same people gave me the opportunity in order that I could leave my home country of Argentina, but at the same time, I've lost all my free time and energy.

My back hurts a lot because I have to move around the table, my chair is not properly set.

I'm alone, I only know some people here, and only have one real friend who lives two hours away from where I'm renting (a room, because with a wage as low as that I can't get any flat). I want to meet people, girls, that are more like me and have interesting things to share. I'm introvert too, so that doesn't help too much.

I can't understand why we still need to produce profits if we have more than enough to house everyone, feed everybody and educate us all. My job is useless, all my effort only serves to reproduce a lacking life.

I'm scared that this will develop into depression and suicidal thoughts.

I'm thinking about giving up, returning to Argentina, finishing my almost useless Sociology degree, being with my friends and family... but then what? The country is going to be a second Venezuela in a few decades and it's just scary even to walk on the streets there. It's only momentary relief.

The reality of the situation is that here on Europe I have more opportunities regarding any future academic career, or even better professional jobs/wages. I can also try and move to the US as I have family there... The whole point is that I just end being an errant proletariat who belongs nowhere and is away from everything and everybody just to survive. I'm alienating myself from a lot of things I've given for granted and made me human. I don't want to lose that, but I don't want to end up in a hellhole.

Sometimes I really wish I just win the lottery or something and never have to work again, or only part-time jobs.

Please, give me advice on how to cope with this. I don't have any legal papers as of yet, so any wild move like quitting is off the table if I want to be able to find a new job, study and stuff. I feel trapped.

&gt;Are you fully prepared to put yourself at the service of the company and the team?
    
&gt;Do you have a highly positive attitude to encourage innovation and work together with colleagues?

    &gt;you are open-minded and are able to communicate well.
    &gt;you act independently, in a structured manner, and in a goal-oriented manner.
    &gt;you have the ability to influence others and confidently move towards a common vision or goal

I agree with a lot of sentiments in this sub. I think hard work for the sake of hard work is ridiculous. The idea of taking a new job with more stress because it pays more than your current job is insanity to me. It's not being lazy if you don't want to ""work hard"" and become a millionaire. Lots of jobs are toxic, unnecessary stressful, and do nothing but cause anxiety and depression for its workers. 

**However,** I think where I depart from sub is I actually want to continue working but I want a stress free job or a less stressful job than what I currently have. I actually like having a salary, getting paid, and having money. I wouldn't mind a full-time job in the least, assuming it's not stressful, your coworkers and boss are decent human beings, and it doesn't interfere with life outside of work.

I know boring, mindless jobs are frowned upon here (and in general) but I would love a boring 9-5 job. Imagine having a job soooooo easy to you, you can do it without effort? Wake up, stumble into the office @ 9am. Do some stress free admin stuff at your own pace. Clock out at 5pm and then forget about work.

And just for some context, I actually did once have a job like this almost 10 years ago but I sadly resigned after less than a year of working there (for unrelated reasons). I'd love to go back to that job.

I'm very happy to find a sub covering this topic. I'm even thinking of using the last 20MB in my phone's storage to install the reddit app :D

I've started working full-time 9 months ago and since then I've been developing a pretty hardcore work-refusal mindset.

125,Fed-up,"Quick rant. I work in an office, like many of you a lot of my time is spent trying to look busy and just making it through the day. I used to come in around 8:00 am and leave at 5:00 pm on the dot. You know, because I value my free time and would like to go home and see my wife. A few months ago, my boss pulled me aside and said it was ""unprofessional to run out the door at 5:00 every day and she'd really like me to stay until 5:30 every day in-case someone needed something last minute."" I reluctantly obliged, even though we all know nothing productive is going to happen in those extra 30 minutes that I could be using to get home and start dinner. So since then I've been watching the clock and then leaving at 5:30 on the dot. Last night when I said goodnight to everyone my boss, in a very condescending tone said ""Oh, it must be 5:30 because EL-DIABLOW ***NEVER*** stays past 5:30..."" I was taken aback, so I just glanced at her, didn't say anything and walked out. Seething with anger on my drive home.

We were born to be gray. We went to school,

Sat in rows, ate white bread,

Looked at the floor a lot. In the back

Of our small heads


A long scream. We did what we could,

And all we could do was

Turn on each other. How the fat kids suffered!

Not even being jolly could save them.

And then there were the anal retentives,

The terrified brown-nosers, the desperately

Athletic or popular. This, of course,

Was training. At home

Our parents shook their heads and waited.

We learned of the industrial revolution,

The sectioning of the clock into pie slices.

We drank Cokes and twiddled our thumbs. In the

Back of our minds

A long scream. We snapped butts in the showers,

Froze out shy girls on the dance floor,

Pin-pointed flaws like radar.

Slowly we understood: this was to be the world.

We were born insurance salesmen and secretaries,

Housewives and short order cooks,

Stock room boys and repairmen,

And it wouldn't be a bad life, they promised,

In a tone of voice that would force some of us

To reach in self-defense for wigs,

Lipstick,

138,"Fellow Idlers, I could use some Job Advice! (Please help)","So, I've been basically getting paid to *sleep* for *months* now at my job. I work an overnight shift job with dogs but I make sure they have water and get to go out before I go to sleep. I then wake up 3-4 hours later and take them out again, re-fill their water, etc. If there are any problems I'll separate dogs, but typically I catch things when I'm awake.

Last night however, a dog ""destroyed"" one of the doors (really just a bad paint job as far as I could tell from the pic) and my manager discovered that this happened ""because"" I was asleep through the cameras. Of course, that's nonsense. I would not have been able to stop the dog from doing that to the door even if I *had* been awake.

The dog was (probably) upset because I separated him from the other dogs because he kept knocking over their water bowls and I believe at one point got aggressive, though I'm not sure. In any case, I didn't give him water in the new room because he *always* does this (which is also what bit me in the ass, I should have done it, but I barely thought to, honestly).

Here's my question: **What should I do?**

1) Keep doing what I'm doing

2) Take micro-naps and do the walk-throughs

3) Stay up all night

This job *is* actually important to me, somewhat. It's the best job I've had in a while and I'd prefer not to lose it, so please no suggestions of quitting.

1. People on here seem to be talking about not working, but what would you do instead (no I don‚Äôt mean how would you fill your time, I mean literally what would you do without money?) is the plan to live off the grid or something? 

2. I understand the desire to leave a job you aren‚Äôt fulfilled in (I am an avid reader of FIRE subs and blogs) but what about speaking out another more fulfilling career?  I understand it would be great to never have to work but isn‚Äôt minimizing the pain best? Especially when working is a requirement if you want to have the money to buy stuff. 

3. Are the majority of people on here American? (I am a Canadian and grew up there, but as an adult I have lived in Europe and Australia which are both more socialist than capitalist) This whole idea seems like the capability system failing the ‚Äúlittle guy‚Äù and I‚Äôm wondering if there are people on here from non capitalist countries. 

4. Are there any people on here who actually enjoy their job but are seeking things like early retirement? (I ask because I 100% love my job, but I have a lot of freedom and challenge, and a great ‚Äúreturn on my time investment‚Äù)

What this has done is put our bodies under constant stress and forced us to sacrifice our health with things like sleep.

This is not the way our bodies were built to perform. All across the board in the US people get minimal exercise and sleep which is literally killing them. I would even add that it is even more dangerous than smoking cigarettes because of the multiplier effect of ignoring other things like family that result from treating work like a mandatory obligation.

We are just monkeys, in suits,pretending like we know what we are doing, but we aren't.

I've never had a girlfriend, a car, a apartment, friends, gotten to pick my own food, gotten to ""go out."" I have lost all contact with my family, not because I don't like them or they don't like me, but because I'm in a constant state of misery. I don't want to bring other people down.

I just don't understand how I'm supposed to give any effort to society after a lifetime of being treated like complete scum. 

I understand I haven't ever flipped a burger or stocked a shelf at Wal-Mart, but should that really mean that I have to wake up everyday in complete agony at the idea of another day in a life that I have no control over. 

I didn't pick the way my brain works. I've tried working before and it makes me completely miserable. If that makes me worthless then why not offer homeless people a pain free method of euthanasia? I don't see the difference between letting me die painlessly and letting me die to overexposure? 

I'm not trying to be thick. I just don't understand it at all, and I don't understand how I'm supposed to be ""normal"" after 25 years of not having my own life. There's no snapping out of it, and after being treated so badly for my whole life I don't think there is anyway I could happily work for this society everyday. 

The world has made it clear that it doesn't think people like me deserve food, water or shelter, so how could I possibly ever give it even a second of my time? 

Honestly, if Universal Basic Income was a thing I could see myself actually having a job. If I was started out with the basics like a tiny apartment, food and water, it would give me the abiltty to do things like have people over, have girls over, go out and meet people. I would be much less of a mess of a person, but because I've been treated like a child my entire life because of my refusal to work I literally don't understand how I'm supposed to do anything.

I can't have people over when I'm forced to still live at home. I can't go out with no money. I can't learn to socialize. I can't do anything except wake up everyday and wish I was dead.

Until UBI is a thing I will continue to refuse to work. It's funny that people thing people who don't work have it easy. They only have it easy if they are born into a rich family. If you are born into a poor family it's literal daily hell. The fact that I haven't killed myself yet is a fucking wonder of nature.

For any task that can‚Äôt get automated, I put it into a detailed training manual, that way I don‚Äôt have to remember how to do things and I won‚Äôt have to train new employees. 

Every person should actively push toward automating, streamlining, and simplifying their job workflow to make it easier for themselves, and for their inevitable replacement. If any aspect of the job can be automated without hindering quality output, it should be. 

This includes working toward intentionally automating one‚Äôs own workflow and cutting down on unnecessary bureaucracy to the point of making one‚Äôs position obsolete. 

This ideology is often hindered by legacy systems and idol workers with a ‚Äúthat‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always been done‚Äù mindset. 

Current technology exists that can automate large swaths of office work, but don‚Äôt occur due to willful ignorance by the managers &amp; employees. 

We must rebel against the status quo to identify and create more effective systems and methods to complete the tasks at hand. Make it right the first time, save time in the long run.

From the description: 

 ""STORY-LINE:  Their home most certainly has a view. Ramiz Palos and his wife Zemina fled the hardships of urban life in Bosnia as soon as the country had emerged from a 4-year-war two decades ago.   They choose to live on Mount Vlasic in central Bosnia at 1,300 meters above sea level, separated by kilometres of dirt road from the nearest inhabited place.   Palos says he is not a recluse and was not looking for an escape from traumatic memories. Instead, he says, he wanted to take control of his life.  After 21 years of primal existence in the wilderness Palos feels in control and happy, insisting he would never return to ""civilisation"".  ""I had several reasons to move here. I came here to secure means for existence, but also to live an exciting life, to not have a boring life,"" he says.   Life in the wilderness has many challenges, but Palos insists embracing it was easier and more productive than if he had waited for the government to create a job for him.  ""People here (in Bosnia) are too willing to surrender responsibility for their own life to somebody else, they are not thinking. People need to think to come up with ways to find work for themselves. I don't have to worry about the work of the government or anyone else,"" he says.  While he sometimes has to fight off bears and wolves and to endure pouring rains, winter storms and strong winds, Palos has an abundance of food, fresh air and a warm home.  ""You need to know how to behave (in nature) because we get heavy rains, winter storms and strong winds. You need to know how to behave in such circumstances,"" he says.  ""Sometimes it gets so cold that I cannot leave home for two months, but I have enough food and everything else I need so it does not matter. Winter comes and goes.""  With an unemployment rate of close to 30 percent, finding a job in Bosnia can be hard and close to a fifth of the country's population lives in poverty.  The country is failing to fully capitalise on the good climatic conditions and an abundance of fertile land that make it one of the most favourable spots for farming in southern Europe.  But Aleksandra Nikolic from the Sarajevo Faculty of Agriculture and Food Science believes that a growing number of Bosnians are recognising the advantages of rural life.  ""Agriculture is a way of life; it is no longer identified with the image of an exhausted man farming a rough patch of land in the middle of nowhere with the help of emaciated farming animals,"" she says. ""Agriculture is a sector of economy that helps people in local communities to weather the periods of financial, economic, political or any other crisis by securing a source of income that helps them get through hard times."" Palos might be the best example of that. When he first moved into the mountains in 1996 he lived in an old van and then in a makeshift tent. But after just a few months, he had built a simple house for himself and was joined by his wife.  They still live in the house with no running water and off the electricity grid. But they grow their own vegetables and corn, raise goats and farm fish in the wild mountain river. Palos used local wood and stone to build his barn, hatching tanks and the watermill where he grinds his corn.  From time to time, Palos ventures into the nearest town to sell extra produce to urban dwellers and purchase essential supplies that he and his wife cannot produce for themselves.""

168,Best description i saw on why anti-work isn't anti-effort,"&gt;[‚Äì]sufjanfan 3 points 26 days ago 
We can't have a society where everyone could or would want to do nothing all day.

&gt;But even ""work"" is a modern idea. Humans have been working for longer than we existed but we only recently carved our life into spheres of work and leisure, in a very crude way that's left lots of paradoxes - one great example from feminist theory is the wild amount of work done in the home that's ultimately beneficial to society but still mostly unpaid. This dichotomy means that when people suggest doing away with work as we know it people assume we're going to replace it with the only other thing they're familiar with - digital streaming services and maybe a couple hobbies (hyperbole but you get the point).

&gt;In actuality, growing food, teaching people, building buildings, raising children and animals, cleaning important spaces, and organizing with the people around you - the kinds of labour that are most necessary - are pretty rewarding or fulfilling despite being really hard ""work"", especially when do you decide to do them when you want. A world without work would still have an abundance of productive exploits like these, and on top of that it's not like we'd ever be wanting for creative media to consume, since people find even more joy in producing that.",False,au4g06,JorSum,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/au4g06/best_description_i_saw_on_why_antiwork_isnt/,39,47

Slaves endorsing slavery

It's always weird to see how the victims of capitalism defend the rich.

For example, if you propose to tax millionaires hard and millionaires harder,
you'll be bombarded with the spit of clerks and fast-food workers screaming:
how unfair would it be to do so.

One might find this deduction of slaves passionately supporting their, masters ‚Äî ¬•
to look wicked strange, but these people don't see themselves as slaves. To.

They see themselves as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.

Slaves of the past would never endorse slavery, because the system was clear-
ly rigged against them ‚Äî you were born a slave, you will die a slave. But these
modern-day slaves are made to believe that one day their sufferings will end
and they will finally have an opportunity to become a master.

In reality, 99.9% of them won't have a chance to live a decent life. The system is
still rigged. They'll waste most of their productive time working for the enrich- 4
men of the privileged. Unfortunately, staying alive is so expensive these days... a

Last year I got an office job (""I've been living as an artist for a while, let me see how well I can handle an office work""). It lasted for three months. Got no time to do the things I enjoy and got so tired and stressed out! Left that and came back to the streets. 

An ex coworker told me ""you are weak for not being able to sustain a job for too long, you are not professional"".
All I could think about was... Who is the weak one? I work 4h daily and get almost the same amount as a closed and stressing job. I have enough time to study and get good at the things I actually like to do, so in the future I'll make a living with those things.

204,I'd like to share some thoughts about meaningful work,"I am now in a job that I do not hate because it would exist relatively unchanged in some kind of utopia, and I'd like to tell you all about it because I want to talk about best-case scenarios as well. I won't go into much detail for privacy reasons, sorry.

I am a personal assistant to a disabled person. Now, I don't know if this is common outside the Nordic countries, so I'll explain. If someone with a longterm disability requires regular assistance from another person for daily tasks - not medical care, and not ""looking after"" - it's possible to hire someone to come help you out with whatever you need. My employer has a physical disability affecting mobility, and their own life that they live, so I am just there when needed for logistical support, so to speak. It allows my employer to focus on their own life, rather than meshing the role of assistant with friends or family. I don't have any opinion on something like whether anyone prefers an employee to a relative taking this role, my point is more that this option is available to people here. And I'm not trying to toot my own horn here, anyone with mobility in their hands could do this work, so I'm not special but I think that this particular position is pretty cool.

So, I'm very motivated when I go to work. It helps that my employer and I get along well, but the fact of the matter is that this is work that NEEDS to happen. In an ideal world, in my opinion, disabled people would be not bred out nor segregated nor considered a burden, so this is work that absolutely needs to be done and an option that absolutely needs to exist in order for everyone to have self-determination. Compare to some childcare jobs I have had, where the parents and kids expressed the desire to actually stay home, but for serious financial reasons couldn't. That was so frustrating to me, and left me with a lot of dissatisfaction in my work.

The other thing I like about my job now is that this comes at no cost to my employer. They are the one who put out the job listing, interviewed me, hired me, and who sends my hour log to the city, but it is the city who pays my salary. To speak of the salary, it is enough for just me to live without much stress, but it's likely that other people with more responsibilities would need help. But for me, this particular situation is very stress-free.

If things were different when I woke up tomorrow, and I didn't need to go to work anymore, for the first time in my life I would still go to work anyway as long as my employer required my assistance. I sure couldn't say that working in restaurants or cleaning houses, or at some of my childcare jobs. I prefer my free time, but I don't dread work at all, and I don't feel dead from it. 

I hope that whatever kind of things you're interested in and good at, that some kind of employment like this comes up, where it would exist in relatively the same form even in an ideal world.

But I truly feel that if we acknowledged that they are as shitty as they are and paid a more fair wage while scaling back hours everything would be so much better. Studies show that scaling back hours leads almost always produces the same amount of completed work. Example: Janitor. No one says ""I want to be a janitor when I grow up"" But unfortunately, that kind of job has to be done. If they were paid a higher rate AND had less hours they would be much happier right? So lets say a hospital wing has one janitor making $10 an hour working 9 hours a day 5 days a week. If they were paid $20 an hour and only worked 5 hours a day 5 days a week they would be much happier, even more so if a second janitor was hired to make up for when janitor # 1 isn't there.

213,Really feels like there is no escape... (Told that happiness over money is immature),"So this happened a couple hours ago, but keeps grating at my nerves. Sorry if this gets long, need to rant. 

I was talking about how to find a job since I have left uni and have 8k in loans. Understandable, I have to get those parasites off of me as soon as possible, but the issue seems to be when actually deciding what to do to get rid of the debt. My mom was poking around for ideas since I write and hope to have passive income self-publishing eventually, asking what I could find online for maybe a site or something local. Something that I could not get too stressed over and had some experience doing. 

The issue came when my dad started getting angry because I wasn't receptive to the idea of Wal-Mart or a factory like him. He knows it would be stressful, early hours and I am not a morning person, and half the places listed don't even do the basics of allowing unions. Which all I mentioned to him. He proceeded to tell me that I had to have something (I had to agree) and anything is better than nothing (so the chance of some money at the risk of burning out and suicidal thoughts like the reason I left college because I work for whatever company can exploit me the easiest is fine, as long as I make at least $10/hour; literally his bar of making a decision on jobs). 

I reminded him about why I left, severe depression and anxiety, in combination with incompetent faculty and he says that's life, suck it up, not every day is going to be fun (yeah, but I don't want everyday to be a shit show like where you work and constantly pissed at co-workers that you complain about to everyone). I say I don't want the Boomer/Gen-x mentality and would rather be disability and poor if that is the life he wanted me to have. All he cared about was how it would be a stain for future employers and wouldn't get me anything good later, not I don't know, wondered if there could be a reason I felt so broken (not saying people on it are anything negative or worthless, but I don't know what I am good for and it is all my minimal self-worth I use it for myself. I feel like shit and life right now is breaking me.)

He then goes on to talk about how I am going to end up working until I die and have no retirement, to which I mention because I am a millennial and the way things are going with the jobs he thinks I should take, I will anyways. Which leads to the main reason I was mad enough to make this post. He says it's because my generation has smartphones and video games, and waste money on that to be happy instead of putting it away for retirement. I asked if he was joking, that spending a little money on something that brings joy is why we cannot escape from this pit at 65. This leads to him going on a rant about two single moms working two jobs and happy because they don't have those, and I realized it was pointless to keep arguing, he really has no idea and wouldn't change his mind. I was tired and I didn't want to hear how I was being lazy and a hippie with my ideals. Rather sleep on the couch and be too depressed to actually cry.

223,[Whiney vent] I'm not made for this society,"I sound so whiney and I can't tell this to anyone, I hope this sub will understand me. 
Everyday I get closer to having to slave away at a job. School isn't going well because i've been struggling with depression and possible ADD for forever and never got help, not only that, it's simply because i've always hated studying random shit. Those two illnesses wouldn't even be a problem if it werent for the school system in the first place. It caused my depression, and ADD really doesn't fuck my life in any other aspect. I was miserable in highschool, in my country we have this culture of getting overloaded with information from 8:45-2:15 and then we all pay for private tutors, normally for an hour and a half but so many times we stayed 4-6 hours or more because of exams. Now it's still bad with uni, every exam is equivalent to studying a 400 page textbook. I'm done with this. But I look to the future and only see slave jobs, it's no better. I'm officially trapped. What's the point in life if you're not rich and famous? That's the only option you have to get out of this mess. Otherwise you're just a modern proletariat looking up to the people on top. It's too early for AI to reform everything and just get universal income. And inactivity is horrible as well, I can't do anything worth something for society because I haven't proven i'm qualified. I'll never have fulfillment. I just can't take it anymore, yesterday I bawled my eyes out because I found out a famous girl from my country who's a year older is where she is today because she tweeted ""I want to give you a hug"" to a famous youtuber and he decided to date her.

226,Not working long term: How would people handle that?,"Tl;dr What would people do with themselves if they didn't have to work? Would they find ways to remain integrated and social within society? Would we withdraw into tv and media? Would we find most people lack a passion and drive to make the most of their time, when all they have is time?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on the last day of my weekend here, and why there's no way in hell i'm looking forward to work, i'm also wondering how i would fill my time if i didn't have to work? I mean, i'm relatively lazy, and doing the same solitary things day in day out would no necessarily satisfy me. I also know that my relatively lazy self would not thrown myself into all those things i say i want to do and accomplish just because i had the time. It would take work for me and building a good lifestyle i think, for not working to, work. I imagine i'd having to have standing coffee/dinner/lunch dates, maybe join a sports or community group (rubbish cleanup, charity for the needy?). Having social appointments would help me appreciate my time by myself. It'd be nice to even have just time to go hiking, or to lunch at the park.

&amp;#x200B;

So how do we think most of the populace would handle not having to work? We say we'd do these thousands of things, cook, sew, draw, garden, but these require a lot of self direction i guess? And putting work in to get good at these things takes actual effort. Would most people be willing to put in this effort? Would someone who has the time and patience to learn how to cook well for their family and community decide to be a chef and/or open a restaurant? Well that's great then if having the space and time has let this person find their passion. But about billions of other people seeking a place and role and purpose in their lives or greater communities? Would having all the time make most people better and force them to really seek out their ideal selves, or would most people crumble?

249,Should I take this step?,"So I need your opinion. I'm from germany and I'm close to 30, and so far either been a Student or just been travelling the world. But I never had a 9-5 job. Only little side jobs here and there, with like 50 hours a MONTH. So that's really chill. Studying in germany is basically cheap/free, so you can study as long as you can afford it (after a while you have to pay long-term fees, so it is getting more and more expensive). Anyway, in a year or so I will end university and then... well, that's the thing. I mean, despite the ""common views"" on work, like we share in this sub, I also have MS. I am fucking tired most of the time and completely unable to focus on anything for more than 20 minutes (partly the reason why studies took me so long). It also causes massive memory loss and paralyzes legs/arms/etc even when ""just"" temporary. I don't think I'd ever be able to even hold a job, because I can't function for THAT many hours, let alone 5 days in a row. So I've been told I could get a severely disabled ID card, which has quite some advances here, like paying WAY less taxes, getting money from something called ""basic security"" and, of course I can still work, but I don't need to work so many hours. But right now, I really don't know if I want that. It has it's pro and cons. What if I'll find a job I genuinely like, but they reject me because of it (yes they can do that)? I also feel like with this ID I will be stigmatised as ""malfunctioning"" forever. There is still this stubborn naive voice in me that is like ""well, maybe if it is your dream career, you can do it! With a lot of caffee and drugs, but maybe you can!"" - Am I just an idiot holding a golden ticket for a stressfree life, or am I about to ruin my young future to build a career? Should I try to survive in the working world first and get that ID later (in case my health fails)? This could also be a ticket to complete isolation, maybe I could never move to a different country. Can I have your thoughts on this?

252,Overtime ended. Until August. Exhausted.,"I love the people whom I work with, my manager is reasonable and accommodating, but this mandatory overtime 12 weeks a year (2 six week periods a year) is crushing me, I secretly sometimes wish I could go back to working part time and be on welfare again. But government shutdowns, and the looming threat of  an unstable economy, scare me, and I feel as though I have to work full time. Like my choices are working or being on the streets. Turning to spirituality helps a little, like I just finished reading the Baghavad Gita, and its portion on Dharma helped me find some solace. However...

I have a serious metal illness, but it's functional enough that I'm able to work, however it makes working hard. Even though my job is relatively easy for me--printer breaks down, fix printer, pc is on the fritz, fix pc--and pays well too, I'm starting to struggle with being required to work overtime, even if it's only 3 months of the year, that's still 25% of my year that I have to work 55 hrs a week. At first I loved it because it meant extra pay, but now I'm feeling defeaten. I've been at the job nearly 1.5 years. I at one point loved this job, and in many ways, I love aspects of it and I'm grateful to have it, so I hope this post doesn't sound whiny.

My dream job would be something where I could be self directed in my time, doing something I found meaning in. I love to help people (through advocacy and activism), research, writing, public speaking, and so I'm considering going to graduate school to become a minister*... 

But I just feel so defeaten at work right now. Like, I'm near tears, I just finished my 6th week of OT, and now I'm facing a 40 hr week, with 1 day off (today). 

Any advice?

267,Is anyone else's manager this inept?,"Mostly a rant here but I'm curious to see if there is anyone else here with a manager who is this useless and feckless.

I work a firm that is owned by my local council, the department I work in has one manager as we're a small part of the company. I should add we do the tree work in the councils parks. 

He will routinely hand us work we've handed in/completed months prior and equipment like saws and hedge trimmers won't be fixed (it's up to him to get it done). We'll hand broken equipment in to him and it just gets abandoned in the shipping container where we secure the tools.

He managed to fry the lightning relay on a truck by trying to jump start it with car jump leads (we warned him that would happen, he did it anyway). This resulted in the truck pissing sparks everywhere and melted the cables to the chassy, completely fucking the truck and costing tons to repair.

He does underhand things too. A colleague of mine is retraining to be an electrician and enquired to the street lighting department for a new job - our lovely manager had a word with their departments manager, telling him my colleague is lazy and not good at the job, just to keep him on trees as he's deparate for drivers (we need special licences to drive the larger vehicles). Funnily enough the street light department turned my colleague down for a job.

Training is promised and never delivered, he lies about problems he makes and just runs our department very badly. The only reason he has the job is because he was friends with a higher up (who was sacked for racism and sexism). He had no managerial experience prior to this job and it really shows - the man is a clown and a cretin.

286,Suicidal from working or am I just a trash human?,"Well, actually it's Not l as simple as work made me suicidal, but it is a big portion of it. I had suicidal thoughts eversince I was 13 or 14 because I just didn't see a point in wasting my time in school. Did not have any friends for a long time, also. I eventually burned out at 17 leaving me in a heavily disassociative state of mind, took a year off, and finished school as the best student of my school later. It's especially the latter half of the NEET-year (where the symptoms slowly subsided), the last school year and the gap between school and work I look back fondly because it's literally the only time I felt alive, accepted and had hardly any signs of any depressive disorder.

But it all backfired so fast when work came around. I used to have a lot of hobbies and friends during these last years and they are all gone now. First the friends went away as I did not have time to spend time together anymore within the first months. My hobbies went away step by step as my energy level got lower and lower from literally doing nothing in an office. I used to draw from time to time, write/Journal, Play videogames (Not even this one is fun anymore), smoke less, drink less, Go to the gym (this is probably tje only thing I still do a few times a week), skate and most of all I felt alive. It was in the ladder months where I realized my personality might not be able to ever adapt. My parents realized I changed much for the worse again but #01 priority is that I go to work for them. I never was in a relationship and I think this also fuels my mental state. I am not too ugly, just my personality makes it hard to meet people and even sympathize witj them. I don't even know if I have the emotional capacities to keep a relationship anymore. I told my parents as long as I still make and listen to music there is nothing to worry about. I called in sick for work threw on a documentary and vent on here. I don't have the motivation to listen to music right now and it's the first time in a very long time, and I don't know if I can make it through even just 5 more years on this planet.

Unfuckingbelievable. Go to kindergarden, go to school, go to college... then work for 40 years and die.

296,Book recommendations,"I thought it might be interesting to hear about more books on antiwork than are in the sidebar. What're everyone's favourites and why? The two I think most about are:

-The Refusal Of Work by David Frayne. 

This one goes through the ideology of the work ethic, the ways work takes over our lives so even free time isn't really free, and has a lot of interesting and well researched sources, but the thing I really like is it interviews a group of people who've tried to push work out of their lives as much as possible and talks about how they reached a breaking point (one really cathartic part was when they talked about these small slices of utopia they experienced that made them realise something better was possible and they were wasting their life), though it also goes through the social/financial pressures that come up when you try to push work out of your life. It opens with a quote from a film called the Working Class Goes to Heaven, where antiwork students with megaphones harangue the workers going into a factory in the morning saying ""it's 8 o clock in the morning, when you come out it will be dark, the sun will not shine for you today"".

-Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber

This one's already in the sidebar and is pretty well known, but it talks about one of the most infuriating and frustrating parts of work, a significant portion (if not most) of the work we do is totally pointless! Increasing productivity hasn't led to us working less (or freeing us from work entirely) it's led to the proliferation of what're essentially make-work jobs. It goes into how alienating and despairing it can be working those jobs (and why). It proposes a UBI as the solution (though David Graeber is an anarchist)

I‚Äôm 34 days away from moving, and unfortunately quitting this job is not in the cards right now, but god damn is it hell on earth. I work in a small Pizza/Coffee joint. We handle food all the time. Lately, a lot of the staff have been getting sick with the cold, the flu, etc. Genuinely sick. Like coughing, vomiting, the whole nine yards. About half of our staff have tried to call in sick days lately, and my boss/manager is enforcing the stupidest rule I have ever heard of. No sick days unless YOU find someone to take your shift, and if you can‚Äôt convince someone, then you have to come in, regardless of how sick you may be. There‚Äôs got to be someone I can report this too- if it helps, I‚Äôm in Canada.

303,My boss is micromanaging my time by passive aggresiveness.,"I work as a vendor for a company where I go around to stores all over my region merchandising and placing orders. My job description states 30 hours per week as maximum. I get paid hourly so of course I've been getting those 30 hours a week no matter what. I have over 90 stores to finish in a month. The schedule is totally flexible as long as I get those stores complete and not go over 30 hours a week. 

So I have gotten used to the work and sort of chill at each location after I'm done. I get the job done in a quality manner and stay below those maximum hours. Well now 4 months into the job my boss has started to email me about my time. He has been asking why I'm spending more amounts of time in stores when I could be getting it done faster. I think he knows the work doesn't actually take that long which yeah it really doesn't. However, I don't want to purposely cut my hours because it's giving me a stable income to get by with living for the time.

He said this recently, ""While your store efficiecies are good, we are concerned about your ability to accomplish the role in a timely manner"". ",False,apfvcv,whyworkwhenicanplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/apfvcv/my_boss_is_micromanaging_my_time_by_passive/,6,1
