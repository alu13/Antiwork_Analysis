1,Feeling helpless and exhausted,i know this isn't a therapy subreddit or whatever  but i figure yall will understand me and won't just call me lazy and shit    i fucking hate work  work is hell  i dissociate all week and then spend the weekend recovering from the misery of the week that's ended and mentally  spiritually  and emotionally buckling up for the week that's about to begin   it's hard for me to imagine any job that doesn't make me want to kill myself  it's not the content of the work- my job right now is bullshit  i work 25 hours a week but only really have maybe 4-6 hours of actual work  the rest of the time i fuck around on reddit mostly- and i can think of a few things that i would actually love to do that i could also make a living doing- rather it's the nature of work itself  the inherent alienation of work  the fact that i  have  to do it to survive  even if i was doing something that in itself i genuinely loved  felt passionate about  dedicated to  it would become lifeless and oppressive in the very fact of it  being work    i'm so tired of working  i'm just a young kid and i've got my whole life ahead of me and i'm already fucking sick of it  how am i going to live my whole life spending most of my waking hours working  how do yall deal with it ,76q6pa
2,Capitalism doesn't offer motivation to work,today  whether you work or not  it does not matter  your country is going to be parasited by the usual parasites  whilst  in a socialist system  you know that every day you go to work  counts  you know that after years of work  you will see your country change and your life change  capitalism does not offer such a motivation  why try anyways  maximum i will try is to bring this system to its knees,78xmbr
