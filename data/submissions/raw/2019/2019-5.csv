im about to quit my job since I have the safety net of a slightly better job in a field that doesn't make me want to blow my brains out. so heres some things that made my job the piece of shit that it is.

&amp;#x200B;

* the phrase ""work theft"". I've been talked to twice since i started this job in this location less than a year ago, both times were about me taking too long breaks. The worst part of this was them not taking the blame. my two bosses told me my coworkers didn't trust me and were coming to them CONSTANTLY, to complain about me taking a 20 minute break, instead of a 15 minute break.
* To reduce shoplifting in the store we have to walk the floor and greet customers and fix up messy areas. this walk should take 5-10 minutes, (now you know why I took long breaks) our ""shrink"" walks NEVER reduced theft. except for greeting known shoplifters. I was told that I wasn't dedicated enough to the job, and they could tell I didn't take pride in my shrink walks.
   * they were fucking right.
* PIZZA PARTIES ARENT A REPLACEMENT FOR MORE MONEY AND RESPECT
* my store manager is a creepy fuck and has literally been caught punching walls in the back room and makes all of our (majority female) employees uncomfortable. I've personally complained to HIS boss but uh, he's allowed to be a dick because he makes the company $$$$$$
* store credit cards are a scam.
* specifically the cards from my store are dumb, DONT GET THEM.
* also: this is probably true for the majority of big box stores, but employees, who do ALL of the work selling the cards, get little to NO rewards. at my store we get ""reach"" cards that get drawn randomly every month and one person get either a $25 gift card to the store or a shit piece of store merch. my managers get bonuses and raises.
* now.... if you catch and can help LP prove than an employee is STEALING (product or $$) guess what? you can get up to $350 as a reward! cash, not gift card. 
* because of this ive been snitched on for ""shopping"" our merchandise ( i was fucking looking at the color of the lipstick. i wouldve bought it too if my discount was more than 10%) at my old location we shopped during work all the time.
* not only do i have to be polite to EVERYONE at work including employees and bosses, I need to be overtly friendly. I have coworkers that do this and its fucking unsettling, and customers that I speak to as a human being, appreciate the store much more than when i treat them as a thing to sell too. fake friendliness is NOT something people like @ CEOs.

He basically talks about 'millenials' wanting everything made easy and won't shut up and do the work properly till they die.

Some insight of the mentality that my boss also subscribes to... I mean I hear what he says and all, but even doing what he talks in the video perfectly would leave me unfullfilled in life. Like he probably is too but won't admit it... Life doesn't always need to suck, its what you make of it...

The story hes talking about reminds me about the relationship with my boss, except I didn't quit after 2 days and i've been here a couple of months. But my boss is sometimes an idiot too, not that bright in some areas. But I also make stupid mistakes, my excuses is the work enviorment, I just run around too much and then I miss this or that or forgot to check something which may lead to disaster.

22,A more honest exchange,"I have been really depressed about work lately, but I'm starting to come around; it's been a struggle to give myself the credit I deserve.  I tend to lose motivation and let more routine organization and communication tasks slip by me, but I am still pretty good at getting our main tasks done.  When there is urgency that calls for it, I work as hard as anyone else.  It's actually when things slow down that I can be lazy.  I have motivation issues that I need to work on, likely related to a deeper depression which has nothing to do with work, or maybe it's ADD, maybe laziness is just laziness, I don't know.

But sometimes I just wish that people knew and accepted my work performance for what it is, because it's this unceasing imagination of people's judgments which really makes me anxious and depressed.  Can't this somehow be a part of the negotiation of labor?  Despite how often I slip up, I know I am not going to get fired because I have skills and experience which are hard to find, I would be difficult to replace – at the end of the day, I know that my presence is a net positive for them, losing me would make things more difficult.  Why does it seem impossible to be open about my flaws, to lay them on the table and say ""take it or leave it""?  Why should the burden be entirely on me to change for the better, or else feel ashamed by my repeated failures to improve?  I do want to get better, but I also want this guilt and shame out of my life.  I feel anxious for 8 hours a day at work, and then guilty or ashamed for another 8 when I leave.  That's no way to live, it's an unfair exchange for my livelihood – for just the bare right to pay for an apartment, some food and other necessities.  I just want to fucking *be*, why does that have to come at the cost of so much mental or emotional strain?

To me, the ideal situation would just involve some simple (but perhaps radical) honesty about the exchange of my labor.  I would promise to put in my time and do my best to improve my performance, but in addition to my wage I would want some basic understanding and acceptance of my flaws.  I would want to drop the façade I put up from day zero, when I first sit down to interview and only list my strengths, never my weaknesses.  I don't want to feel like an impostor anymore.  I don't want to feel like I have been trapped by the very perceptions of myself that I try to encourage.  I don't want to feel like I need to escape before anyone finds out who I really am.  I want my employers and my co-workers to say ""we're at last glad that you're here to help, because having you is better than not having you, and that's good enough for us"".  Is that such a big ask?  Am I being naive?  ",False,bv0ylw,DrinkyDrank,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bv0ylw/a_more_honest_exchange/,1,5

24,Hired on the Spot and then Fired Immediately,"So as the post title said, I went to an interview at a local branch of a company who's expanding their operation, and was hired on the spot. My work experience just prior to this was at a very successful company with a good reputation, and I had glowing recommendations coming from my previous bosses. I went into the interview knowing full well I was overqualified for the job, as my last job was doing basically the exact same thing, but I didn't expect to get hired on the spot.   


Side Note: In my experience, hiring on the spot is actually not a good sign, it means the company might be more desperate than they're willing to admit.   


But anyway, I tell her more prior work info and start filling out the legal hiring forms, but then the interviewer starts asking me weird or even possibly illegal-to-ask questions. ""So other than yourself, who requires you to be employed?"" Even at the time I knew this was a red flag, so I know this interview (which again, was technically over, as I was filling out hiring information) is gonna get awkward real quick. For the sake of my own clarification/sanity, I somehow worked up the nerve to ask her a few questions as well, ""so what's the next step from here?"" Interviewer lady says she'll \*submit my paperwork to my new boss,\* and he will contact me on Wednesday about drug testing and a start date. This was also a red flag to me, why would my new boss need to see my resume and cover letter and prior experience? Is he somehow involved in the hiring process? Something about that just seemed real out of place to me, but I thought maybe it was just some weird, unorthodox hiring procedure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the interview ends, my paperwork is filled out and the interviewer tells me I'll hear back from them on Wednesday. Well Wednesday comes around, and guess fucking what? They retracted their employment offer. Not gonna lie, it was like a movie where I read the email like 3 times to actually comprehend it. My brain starts going a million miles an hour trying to figure out what went wrong:  


\-Failed Background Check? Nope, never been arrested or in trouble, not even a traffic ticket.  
\-Bosses said something unbecoming of me? No, I worked with them a long time and they were also my friends, definitely wasn't that.  
\-Something wrong on my resume or cover letter? Nope, double checked and it all looks good.  
\-Did I say something wrong? No, don't think so, I wouldn't say I aced the interview but it definitely didn't go badly.  


So then I start remembering the real minor details: 

&amp;#x200B;

Interviewer was late to the interview, despite it being a time she told me and that we knew ahead of time for 2 weeks. Security guard accidentally slipped that she was in a meeting. \*She was in a meeting at the same time she was supposed to interview me, on a time \*\*she\*\* set.\*  


Employees seem to be coming in late as I was waiting for the interviewer to show up. And not like 1 or 2, but like 20 kept filing in and going through security. No idea why.   


When I first walked in, I had to correct her on some things she misunderstood about my previous employment (it seems like she did some research on my last job, but some of the things she \*\*ass\*\* \*\*u\*\* \*\*me\*\* d were objectively wrong, my last workplace manufactured things in a proprietary way and she just researched the industry standard way of doing things. I literally specifically mentioned that on my resume as well, so I don't know if where she went wrong there. Again, looks like she was winging it.   


Call me cocky, but I think I was fired out of their own incompetence. The being late to the interview and then not understanding the things I mentioned when contacting her earlier, I don't know what else to call it. I should have been an obvious hire for this company (and I guess I was at first, before whatever happened behind the scenes went down.) Anyway, I'm just kinda taken back but their lack of professionalism. I'd love to hear what you guys think about this or if something similar has ever happened to you.

Just thinking about how this is one of those benefits of work that I have a hard time finding elsewhere: I know that when I'm not working, I start feeling depressed and I think some part of that is the need to feel relied upon by others.

When I think about being anti-work I can't seem to get over all these small intangible benefits beyond pay, the sort of baby-in-the-bathwater type benefits that I don't want to lose but can't seem to find elsewhere.

I could be wrong, but it does seem that there is some psychological benefit to being relied upon, to being held accountable to complete tasks even if you don't wanna do them.

So my interactions with that person might be important to them, but I really don't feel like I'm making a difference. Even if someone tells me I helped them, I feel nothing, even though I do empathize and care. 

For me, I think years of suicidal ideation are also taking their toll, making me feel obligated to constantly be justifying my purpose to myself. But I think it also has to do with expectation vs. reality, and pretty much omnipresent burnout.

35,'i was henry sy's slave' by Danilova Molintas [long],"# i was henry sy's slave

*First published in i****, The Investigative Reporting Magazine****, Jan-Mar 1995.*

*A UP**^(\[1\])* *undergrad tries to see if she has what it takes to be an SM salesgirl.*

I DROPPED out of college in the second semester of 1989 to joint Manila’s hordes of jobseekers. I had a government grant in a good university, but I was tired of trying to make ends meet with the measly P500^(\[2\]) a month I received from the State.

I was 19 and felt deeply alienated from the rest of my middle-class classmates at the School of Economics. And the grumbling of my belly forced me to leave school to join the nameless, faceless swarm of Filipinos looking for a job.

Like many job-seekers with neither skills nor business contacts, I scouted the Classified Ads of the ‘Manila Bulletin.’ Then I beat the pavements on my way to an interview or a typing exam.

I passed several exams and was able to bluff my way through countless interviews only to find out that my biggest disadvantage was my height. I am fourth of an inch short of five feet. This meant I was disqualified from relatively higher-paying jobs as a hotel receptionist or even as a secretary in a Makati firm.

I was desperate. By December that year, I finally came across the ShoeMart ad looking for “200 young girls from 18 to 24 years old, good looking, at least 5’2”, with pleasing personality. Guaranteed minimum wage.”

“What the heck,” I told myself. So I gave it a shot.

&amp;#x200B;

APPLYING at ShoeMart began with an encounter with an arrogant security guard. He first asked us—around 15 young women between 18 and 20 years old, in pretty dresses, heels and make-up, all looking and smelling like flowers wilting in the noonday heat—to line up in front of SM City’s rear entrance.

We were told to arrange ourselves according to height, while the guard went around checking if each applicant had a complete set of requirements: a bio-data and four colored 1 x1 photos. Those of us who did were then marched into the store.

I was amazed to find the premises dingy, in stark contrast to the rest of ShoeMart—or at least the part revealed to customers. While waiting to be interviewed, I chatted with the other applicants. One of them asked us whether we were Catholic. I failed to understand the relevance of her question, until I noticed that the others eyed her with envy when she said she was a member of the Inglesia ni Kristo (INK^(\[3\])).

Later, I was told that SM preferred INK members because the sect explicitly bans its members from joining unions. Many of the few temporary employees who were eventually “regularized” belonged to that favored religion, and not a few desperate men and women were said to have converted to that faith to ease their entry into the job market.

As in every exam or screening, there were leaks. One applicant whispered to me that there were only two questions to contend with: “Why do you want to work?” and “Why do you want to work with ShoeMart?”

I thought that was easy. But when it was my turn, Madam Supervisor jolted me with a new question, “*O, taga-UP ka pala, bakit hindi mo na lang tapusin yung pag-aaral mo* (You’re from UP, so why don’t you just finish your studies)?”

I told her my father had died when I was in high school, forcing me to support myself through college. I said I was so impressed by ShoeMart’s success that when I finished my studies I wanted to continue working with the company in a better position. Fat chance! But I told her that in one nervous breath and was rewarded with a sympathetic smile.

Madam Supervisor warned me she wasn’t sure I would make it since the store was only hiring 200 or so temporary employees for the expected stampede of Christmas shoppers, and that there were at least 120 applicants in a single day. But she asked me to return the next day at nine sharp for another screening.

&amp;#x200B;

THE following morning, I was herded with 50 other applicants into a classroom-of-sorts. We were asked to write two essays on “Why do you want to work?” and “Why do you want to work with ShoeMart?” Argghh! Again? I thought, but obediently scribbled away.

Then the sales supervisor began a lecture. He started with the tale of how the young Henry Sy had risen with the simple conviction that if he sold a pair of shoes at one peso to at least a million Filipinos, then he was on his way to becoming a millionaire. That, and determination, were supposed to be the secrets of the Sy empire.

After the lecture, composed of company trivia and the location of the various departments within the store, we were given another exam.

When we were through, the supervisor arranged the test papers from the highest to the lowest score. Each applicant was asked to come to the front of the room and retriever his or her test paper. Those who had failed were asked to stand on the right side of the room, dejection in their faces as they clutched their papers.

I saw no need for such a humiliating procedure. But it was not the last act of petty cruelty I witnessed as an SM girl.

&amp;#x200B;

“*WALANG pangit sa ShoeMart* (There are no ugly people at ShoeMart),” were the first words of the personnel manager, a cheerful, chubby woman who was assigned to orient new employees.

“And when you use that SM uniform everyday on your way to work, you can be proud of the fact, *na, walang pangit sa ShoeMart*.” She then revealed to us the secrets of being a beautiful SM girl, starting with what she called “personal hygiene.”

We were told to keep our uniforms clean and well pressed; the boys were told to keep clean-shaven and to have their hair always cut above their ears; the girls were supposed to keep their hair always neat. We were also expected to wear make-up.

“And don’t forget to change your underwear everyday, girls and boys,” she said good-naturedly.

ShoeMart did not provide us with uniforms since most temporary employees were sacked after six months, so we had to have our own uniforms sewn. Only a handful—the most good-looking and obedient—were eventually retained as regular employees. I learned that because of this policy, many SM girls became LandMark girls, then Robinson’s girls, hopping from one department store to another every six months.

While ShoeMart paid us minimum wages, it cut costs by keeping only a few permanent employees who received maternity, sick and vacation leave benefits.

&amp;#x200B;

THE SM girl is not only pretty, she is also quite sexy. Employee uniforms are cut a little above the knee. Permanent employees wear body-hugging navy blue dresses that button up at the front. For temporary SM girls, the attire is a navy blue pencil-cut skirt and white cotton blouse. All female employees are required to wear two-inch high, open-toed open-heeled sandals. The effect of the entire get-up can be quite fetching.

But more than to charm, the SM uniform was developed for a less benign purpose: to deter employees from stealing. Our uniforms were not supposed to have pockets. The open-toed shoes were meant to make it inconvenient for us to conceal money or goods in them. We were not allowed to wear jewelry or carry handkerchiefs. No slips or chemises were to be worn at work.

If an SM girl stole some merchandise or cash, she has no place to hide it, except maybe in her underwear. But even that was difficult because every time we entered or left the “selling area,” we were thoroughly frisked.

The management took other precautions. An entire department—the Customer Relations Service—was tasked not only to catch shoplifters but to spy on other SM employees.

Even when we needed to go to the toiled, we had to guard against theft. First, we had to make sure another employee took our place—a very trying affair since there were just enough employees to fill each station. Then, we had to ask for a “pass” from the supervisors, whose main job, I soon began to think, was to remain unavailable. The process was so exasperating, most of us chose not to relieve ourselves.

As counter-checker, my job was really nothing more than that of a bagger. While standing beside the cashier, I was to find the right-sized bag for the goods sold to a customer. But I was supposed to check that the number of items the cashier punched into the cash register corresponded to those that I would pack into the bag. I was also supposed to ensure that the cashier would not steal money, although how I was to do so, I had no inkling.

All these procedures were guaranteed to create an atmosphere of distrust among employees, and I worried about how I could make friends in such an atmosphere.

The last step on the way to becoming a full-fledged ShoeMart girl was the medical and dental exam.

The dental exam was to ensure that toothaches would never be given as a reason for sudden absences from work, said the dentist who examined me.

The medical exam was rushed in a cubicle with only a curtain to shield me from a long line of girls awaiting their turn. I was examined by an aging male doctor who felt for lumps not only around my breasts, bu on my nipple too! He was assisted by a woman, but she was either too jaded or too ignorant to stop him from what I felt was a sexual assault. I knew there was nothing I could do at that point, except resolve never to get sick and put myself at that doctor’s mercy.

&amp;#x200B;

MY first day as an SM girl began with a struggle to put on all the regulation “war paint.” Even when I had won the skirmish with make-up brushes, rouge and mascara, I still worried that all that paint would melt on my way—by bus—to work.

I was an “opener” on the first week on the job, and that meant I had to be at my station by 9 a.m., 30 minutes before the first shoppers invaded the store.

At about 9:15, a husky, female voice announced the singing of the national anthem, and all SM employees stood at attention. This was followed by the recitation of some credo, the exact words I have since forgotten, but with was a vow to serve each customer with a cheerful smile. This entire morning rite, we were told, was part of a Japanese method of management.

After that, it was check, check, stamp, dump, staple, smile… check, check, stamp, dump, staple, smile… check, check, check, check, dump, staple, smile…

Any other time of the year, the job would have allowed me time to daydream, but it was Christmas, the season of nightmares for SM girls. By noon, the store was mobbed by shoppers. I speeded up to work, spurred on by the sighs, leg-shaking and and other impatient gestures of customers waiting in line.

After a few hours, I had abandoned any attempt to smile, or even look at any customer. I was stressed, and my feet—unused to standing for so long on two-inch heels—began to hurt.

There are at least 100 SM employees in a shift, and they all break for lunch at the same time, causing long lines to be formed behind the bundy clock, the lunch counter, the water fountain.

And the toilets! Every lunch break, a hundred girls would be competing for six cubicles and the same number of faucets. This stampede would happen every time a shift took a break, so while the janitress never seemed to stop mopping the toilet floor, it remained constantly muddy. I thought the sign “Comfort Room\[4\]” should be taken off the door.

Each time I went for lunch, I had to have myself frisked before leaving the selling area, locate my time card, punch out at the bundy clock, line up at the employees’ canteen, eat, brush my teeth and retouch my make-up. By the time I was done, it was time to return to my station.

When I had gotten used to the lunch routine—or when I brought a sandwich to eat—I managed to get a few minutes to rest at the cramped locker room (where only regular employees had lockers). Some lucky girls were able to lie down on the few benches there for a catnap. Others just slumped on a bench from fatigue and dozed off, uncaring about whether their skirts were in place.

&amp;#x200B;

THERE are ways that the powerless get back at those who exploit them. Stealing was the first way. When a customer chose not to buy a chocolate bar and left it at the counter, some cashiers and counter-checkers would conspire, not only to eat it, but to eat it on the job.

Small items like hair clips and bracelets could be artfully concealed in our underwear. These little things were stolen, I felt, to break the monotony of a mindless job more than anything else.

What really went on in the minds of the other workers, I never found out. We were forbidden to “gossip” with each other during work hours. After work, our thoughts were of soaking our tired feet in warm water, so most of us chose to go straight home.

I left ShoeMart after a month and a half, with little regret. While I earned the minimum wage, much more than I would have received as a semi-skilled worker at a smaller establishment, I felt bled for every single centavo I was paid.

At the start of 1990, a strike broke out at the SM North Edsa department store, with workers demanding higher wages and better benefits. There was even a rumor that one of the managers would be confronted for the “lie down or lay-off” policy he imposed on many temporary SM girls.

That I had not been part of that strike is the only regret I have today about having deserted my post as an SM girl.

He worked for the same company since his mid-20s. Since I was a kid, I only remember him coming home from work, sleeping on the couch after work, and destressing by watching TV or whatnot before hitting the bed. And the cycle repeated for years.

He eventually climbed the corporate ladder, but that translated to seeing him less often. He'd often work overtime, and since he cannot drive in the evening (eye problems), he would sleep over at a family member's house near his workplace.

So many humans literally have no value whatsoever when it comes to their own time, and that's just so sad. If humans don't value their OWN time then how could they possibly value someone else's? 

This is why so many people get upset when people just want to live a comfortable lives without working everyday. So many people value their own time so little that they actually can't fathom spending it how they choose, so to them, anyone who is must be ""lazy, a leech, a failure, a loser ect.""

56,Wage slavery leads me to suicide,"Hello everyone.

I am glad I've found a community of people who share my ways of looking at life.

&amp;#x200B;

I just really need to speak out.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm living in poor country, average salary in my country is **200-400$**, cost of apartment is approximately **30 000$**.

And there is just one big town with good / normal works. 

There isn't any allowance for unemployed or disabled people. You don't have money - then you are homeless. 

Actually maybe there is, but I know that allowance is so low, you can't live an that money, especially if you don't have your own home.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything I did in my life I did just to earn more money, so I can buy several apartments and rent them out, so I can live free and buy time, buy freedom. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate my work and I never wanted to do now what I do for living.  And it's not just the work, it's the system we all live in. System where you have to work and you can't stop if you don't have money.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always hated work for hire, from the very first day and even before I started working, so I don't see reasons to change work, actually I am earning 2 or 3 times more of an average salary.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought high salary somehow will compensate the time I am spending for work.

Well, it doesn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even read a fiction book or play on some video game because I have so little time for this and I can't stop thinking about next day. 

The day I will have to go to the work I hate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Spending time at entertainment for me it's like I am eating gourmet dish but instead of restaurant I am sitting in a public toilet. That's how I feel, and it's even worse than not to entertain myself at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I have enough money to live free for 2 years. 

I want to read all the books, watch all the movies, play all the games I have planned, go to Amsterdam, use psychedelics and then kill myself.  


I am used to certain way of life and comfort and becoming a homeless for me is worse than death. 

 

I think it's sad that I want to spend my last years of life for escapism.

When did my life became so fucking boring and shitty? I can't even remember when was the last time I felt just ""normal"".

&amp;#x200B;

And I think this is the first time in my life I am thinking about suicide so seriously.

I feel constant anxiety for years and I can't stop it.

I am so tired, fucking system broke me and I can't find any reason to endure my life, except one thing

&amp;#x200B;

I want to play The Wither 3 one more time. That's how good this game is.

It could have as one of its tenants something like,""Capitalism is in a moving condradiction in that it presses to reduce labor employed to a minimum and yet posits waged labor as the only way for 99% of people to make a living.""

But I started figuring shit out, finally getting the right diagnoses, getting the right medication (apart from still struggling to find the right antidepressants) and as I do the expectations rise. I went back to school to finally get my high school diploma, and opted for a 2 year track instead of 1 year so I have more free time to easy myself in and not get totally stuck again if something goes wrong. Convinced the government to keep giving me free money because with part time school I'm not eligible for any kind of education money.

So, I just finished my first year. Another year left. 1 year. In which I don't have to work for my money and have a super light course load and tons of free time to enjoy myself. But after I graduate the money stops, and I can either continue to higher education and get a loan or work. I'll probably go into teaching, which is initially a 4 year study and possibly more for a master degree, and the course load won't be 10 hours a week. And then? Then I'm really done. Then I'll have to work to earn money and I will have to do that for the rest of my life. I'll probably never get free semi-disability money again with a good degree like that.

122,[Thursday Rant] Maybe seeing a light at the end of the tunnel,"Well the last few weeks were brutal. I'm for a long time in the same job. I don't know how I could put up with so much bullshit, but maybe it's because I bullshited myself that my side passion which I put in all my money and effort in would blow up in the meantime. Guess what? It didn't and it's gone now as every other person who was involved finally resigned.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's because I had the illusion that I actually can gain financial independence with saving a lot, investing and crypto and stuff. Guess what? Yes since I focused on it I came a long way. But realistically speaking with the annual wage I earn, it still would take at least 20-25 years and then I would be anyway near retirement age. So it's more like fuck you money for a short amount of time when I'm out of a job.

Most people on financialindependence and personalfinance are already privileged people with Master/PhD degrees and cushy jobs in big companies where they belong to the top earners. Or doctors (like MrMoneyMustache), lawyers from wealthy families. Also a near illusion that it is possible for everyone to quit their job at age 35-40.

&amp;#x200B;

So after that realization and instant feeling of being trapped set in. I've never experienced so much existential crisis like this year. It's agonizing.  On top of that my boss made it pretty clear that I simply can't stand working for him anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

So what did I do? I looked for another prison (employer) who maybe has some better slave (work) conditions although it's the same shitty job in a part-time way. I actually had an interview and it look promising. Soon I will know if they accept.

What did I do? I just asked for so much that I would earn the same amount for only 4 days instead of having to work for 5 days. Can't believe that they would even consider that.

That would mean 52 days more, almost 2 months more life time in a year.

137,I'd like to live like my cat(s),"The guys sleep in a shack my family built for storing firefood, now they even got plankets in there, they spend alot inside but let's pretend they don't. Even then it's pretty good living conditions for a cat. Sleeping on soft, warm fabric materials made by humans, really thick stuff too. They get milk and water from us but sometimes then enjoy drinking the rain water instead too. The cats were wild before we took them in and they survived anyway, plenty of stuff to eat and scavange around our small city as a cat. 

Im jealous of my cats, I go to work in the morning and they might just be outside doing whatever they want, or sleeping, hunting, who knows. I come from work stressed and keep looking at my clock on how much time I have left, what chores I have to do, plan ahead etc. While these cats are totally fullfilled and make no plans, there are content with being where they are and are truly at peace and live completely in the present. They are pretty safe too, if they get too sick some human can carry them to the hospital, or they can either accept death and die happily. Not many other dangers around, even if I left them they would probably survive, sure they might not be laying about as much but they would become more active looking for food. Overall a better life than a human.

My issue is I just can start living like a cat, If I camped in the forest I might succedd but it's hard to survive there and I would have to be undetected because people would come and throw me in jail, I couldn't really grow stuff in the forest. 

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't just walk on some empty friggin land that noone uses and build my small shack there. Thats illegal and I would be punished. So all I can do is slave away and gather money. Then maybe with that money I can buy property... And when I buy my property I'll find out I can't just build anything on my own property that I BOUGHT no matter how small and simple it is, I would need permits, and all kinds of stuff that involves other people who are there to take your money so they can approve it. A costly thing all of this, you might save for awhile and buy that land which is pretty expensive these days, but thats just the beginning. 

I would love to live like they did in the older days but I almost can't. A cat can, I can't its that simple. Deeply jealous of my cats, but I still love them no less.  They also wish I was home more and wonder where the hell their human dissappears for 9 hours each day. 

Also my boss should pay me double hourly if its sunny out. Fuck them. There is this 70 something woman living in the Russian Taiga, hard enviorment, but she survived all these years, alot of years on her own to, and this is a woman with a tumor living in one of the harshest places on earth. It would be so simply for me to survive without a job, I wouldn't mind working 10 hours a day if it was for my own benefit. I mean if she can survive so could I, much easier in my climate then hers...

140,The amount of generic advice in this post in a thread posted by person who is unemployable due to narcissistic parents makes me want to vomit.,"AGED? 2 joints - 3 daysazo + excited days.ago

% Takes a while. It really does. Especially in the current economy. Deep at it. Each interview you do is more
experience and more practice in selling a very important product: YOURSELF.

a job search is selling yourself. Your time, your skill..YOU are valuable. It takes time to figure out the right
approach to marketing the YOU product. Each interview is just another step towards the sale.

Take sure you have resumes posted on places like Monster and state employment agency sites (of) ~ even if you
don't have a ""job"" history, you can still do a resume. (You have skill! You have life experience! You have hobbies!
Seriously ~ I once got hired because a call center manager loved how I turned playing World of Aircraft into
“leadership experience.”) Bites like Monster will bring also you to the attention of recruited agencies: another source
of job leads and interviews, and the good recruits will work with you, because they only get paid (by the company)
if you get hired.

Check your public library: they might have resources to help job hunters (especially if you live in a city of any size),
especially into on doing a resume and how to job hunt. Ask the librarian to point you in the right direction. One
good guide is ""That Color Is Your Parachute?”, especially in determining your skill.

Also: try hemp agencies. There are a LOT of places that now hire their staff only thou hemp places; many call centers
go through them, and call centers are a good place to start getting experience. Hemp agencies often have you
talking to the hiring agent within a day of you walking in the door. Last food places, too ~- you're older, you know
the value of listening, of consistency, of reliability, which any good workplace needs to balance out the flight tens
who haven't gotten that knocked into their heads yet. I have a masters degree, but I still worked at acts for a
while, to keep the bills paid, and the managers loved having someone they knew they could count on.

Good lock, stay strong, and keep at it. You will get a YES.

  

Edit: i saw in the other comments that you're already shooting for “tact bell'like jobs. They need to be approached
the right way. See what I said above? Attitude is very important with the fast food places; going in there with a
college degree can make it seem like you're just a job-beggar. On't be a beggar. You have to get the ""begging”
attitude out of your head. He beat. Smile, Focus on what you have to offer them: reliability, able to learn, willing
to work hard, punctually, enthusiasm, etc. You see their place as having a lot of valuable lessons that you are eager
to learn, etc. again, good luck and keep at it!

149,"We could still have ""tiers"" without starving the people at the bottom","I agree that if we give everyone everything they want that less people would work, but I feel we could structure society in a way that entices people to help and rewards them fairly, without leaving anyone behind. No one here is suggesting that everyone should be given mansions, teslas and gucci shoes. Most people here are suggesting that humans should have the right to some food, some water and a shelter. Not a mansion, not 5 star meals. Just cheap food and a cheap apartment or trailer. 

You can still have ""tiers"" in society without letting the people at the bottom have nothing. You can allow everyone a piece of bread and still get people to work by offering them more than one piece. You can offer people lots of things. Better cars, better clothes, better shelters, the right to cut in lines, faster internet, tickets to things, better food, better restaurants ect. 

If the people at the bottom must have nothing in order for this system to survive then this system needs to be fixed. If there are 10 people, and 10 pieces of bread, it's fucked up not to give everyone a piece. We live in a society that has *as many as we want* and we still let people starve. There's no way around this and people aren't going to stop pointing it out until something changes.

Quite the contrary. Life for him begins where this activity ceases, at the table, at the tavern, in bed. The 12 hours' work, on the other hand, has no meaning for him as weaving, spinning, boring, and so on, but only as earnings, which enable him to sit down at a table, to take his seat in the tavern, and to lie down in a bed. If the silk-worm's object in spinning were to prolong its existence as caterpillar, it would be a perfect example of a wage-worker.""

162,"Hate having to work? Well, here's a solution: kill yourself","**This may be a controversial post. Hear me out before you downvote it. I just want to initiate a discussion, not close the door on it.**

Imagine the above headline on FOX News or your local tabloid as they blare how America is ""threatened"" by people demanding an end to wage work. Only that statement isn't being blared across FOX News; it's being promoted right here on this subreddit by many folks who sincerely advocate less work. 

I just want ask why people think it is appropriate on this subreddit for people to suggest they want to kill themselves as a solution to wage work? Why is such talk tolerated on this subbreddit, when mods would not tolerate other abusive language? Do people really think killing yourself is rational solution to wage work?

I understand that suicide is a social problem. But is this the subreddit to address this? Either people are really suicidal and lack resources to cope, in which case they need to seek professional help, or they embrace terminating their life and should seek assistance where it is available. Either way, it has nothing to do with this subreddit as it will not get rid of wage work.

I don't know how it should be addressed. I don't advocate any form of censorship at all under any circumstances -- not even forms that are practiced on this subreddit. But suggesting that killing yourself is the way to address wage work seems rather problematic to me. I am also concerned about the effect it has on the morale of the subreddit.

Perhaps I am completely off-base on this. If that turns out to be the case, I can accept that.",False,bs6jz6,commiejehu,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bs6jz6/hate_having_to_work_well_heres_a_solution_kill/,45,38

168,How do you start a successful movement like /r/the_donald's initial formation?,"This post will be all over the place, just warning you. This might turn out to be absolutely meaningless 

I'll be honest, I was duped by Donald Trump in 2016. His rhetoric on the campaign trail made it look like he was going to be the candidate the 99% of us Americans have been dreaming of for a long time, but now I realize he's just another stooge for the elite in DC. While some feel differently, I personally don't feel like not having a  filter and criticizing the media from a partisan viewpoint is giving the middle finger to the establishment. But the almost 1 million people on T_D seem to disagree. 

Pursuing this subreddit, I've noticed some common viewpoints that I believe would resonate with most Americans. For example, no one I know likes getting up at 7AM and wasting their life away at a bullshit job. They just never seem to talk about it because it's accepted as ""the way things are."" We need to end the stigma that not wanting to work makes you a societal leech. We need to convince people that working is your only purpose in life. Again, I feel like most Americans would resonate with this rhetoric if the framing is correct (nonpartisan). I'm thinking that this is partially what made Donald Trump such an attractive candidate at the start and led to his subreddit's popularity, but this sub only has about 30K subscribers which is a drop in the bucket comparatively speaking.

The stakes grow once you move up the ladder. More stress = more cortisol = worse mental health. The pay I was offered to move up was laughable so I stayed put in my current position because I win commission. I'm willing to take more pay if it meant hoping over to a new company but no promotions for me.

I've had friends and coworkers constantly wonder why I don't bother making an effort at work.

190,Complacency,"I've made several attempts to ""fixing"" my life (even created this account to try to once more). I don't know how people can go on trying and being motivated. Hobbies, enjoying little things, relationships... they all seem like a whole bunch of ""feel fine"" opioids to keep on wasting the real opportunities and time 40 hours a week, and being complacent to the system. You see, while yes, most people think the system is sh\*t, you can have that movie night or go out with your friends once in a while. This goes for addictions too, they're really two sides of the same coin, only one is ""better"". You are making progress, you are happy; or you are happy by escaping and indulging in momentary pleasures, afterward, you are less likely to protest.

I'm starting to think that we're all playing into the capitalist game, like it or not. We think we are mentally healthy, that we are living a good life, but in fact, it all amounts to nothing because for 40 years I'm wasting my talent, my happiness, my time, in order to survive (in the 21st century nonetheless). We are failing to see that we are falling right into individualistic solutions, even when giving advice to people, we always think about something on the lines of ""there's nothing that you can really do, but here are 5 tips for surviving your life!"" I can't deal with that anymore, I'm too conscious to believe that life can *really* get better if I clean my room or meditate for 10 minutes a day.

I've been following subs like NoFap, StopGaming, GetMotivated, etc. for 2 years (other accounts) and no matter how much effort I put in, how much I enjoy a walk in the park, ""go out and meet people"", or study new languages... I can't get the *why*. I even moved to a new country for crying out loud! This society has made me into a nihilist that's too scared to really act like he doesn't care. A person that finds no motivation in anything because everything seems so dull in relation to the big problems of life and others, and finds no value in money or career paths. I'm not made for this system. Sometimes I envy ignorant people that can go on with the BS and still be happy in their own small worlds.

I like Buddhism but my rational self tells me that it is used to tame people into overworking, discipline and patience. Zizek says something like this as well and it stuck with me, we are in a trap, a big cave where one side can be brighter, but you never get out of it.

""As a capitalist, he is only capital personified. His soul is the soul of capital.

Capital is dead labour which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks. The time during which the worker works is the time during which the capitalist consumes the labour-power he has bought from him. If the worker consumes his disposable time for himself, he robs the capitalist.” (p342)
“The prolongation of the working day beyond the limits of the natural day, into the night, only acts as a palliative. It only slightly quenches the vampire thirst for the living blood of labour. Capitalist production therefore drives, by its inherent nature, towards the appropriation of labour throughout the whole of the 24 hours in the day.” ",False,bnv4tk,communizer69,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bnv4tk/they_want_you_to_work_24_hours_a_day/,0,1

I've spent much of my working life in the public sector - now I work in a university research facility maintaining the facilities here (think plumbing/electrical)

So I should be motivated. I was, when I started last year, but my fucking ""superiors"" have worn me down so much that I've just stopped caring. 
* When we got on top of our work, we were made to mop floors that were clean and dust cupboards designed to get dusty, just so ""we look busy"". Well, shit - I can look busy without doing those things unnecessarily!
* I've asked for one day off to go training, as suggested in my appraisal. I got told that I was needed here, despite the fact everybody is in and nothing is behind.
* I am not allowed to take ownership of many problems, as any external communication needs to go through my manager for no fathomable reason
* My lunch break (yes, I know I'm lucky to get one) has to be taken at a specific time for no good reason. I once missed it because I was busy doing an urgent job, then got a talking to, when I sat down an hour later to take it.
* I'm spoken to like I'm an idiot when I dare to ask how a specific machine works that I've never used before. Maybe if there were manuals/procedures I could figure it out by myself, but I'm not allowed to organise that because every time I try, I'm asked why I'm not ""out working.""

Christ, I could go on all day. My point is that I just don't care any more. I wish I cared, maybe then work wouldn't feel so much like a prison sentence commuting in an hour every day. I go home so mentally exhausted from the frustration of it all every day.

And because I've job hopped in the past, and have bills to pay, and know I'll find problems wherever else I go, I'm too scared to tell them to stick it. I just needed to rant.

209,Immigrants have an abstract value unrelated to their economic productivity or willingness to do shitty work.,"I was at a pretty big state library and archive yesterday and saw that they had put together a big series of exhibits on immigration in Virginia over time. When I took the time to look at those exhibits, literally every single sub section emphasized - to the exclusion of all else - the role played by immigrants in the economy. It was entirely an exercise in justifying immigration in terms of the easily exploited labor power of people trying to build new lives for themselves. 

Anyway, I see this shit everywhere and it’s extremely common for modern democrats to frame immigration in these terms. The things a person contributes to society are manifold and important to their friends, family, neighborhood, and society irrespective of their productivity in the narrow frame of private interests. IMO demolishing the narrative that human movement is only legitimate when used to create wealth for others is one of the first things that needs to be deconstructed when attacking the edifice of modern labor.

&amp;#x200B;

Which leads me it to why people have problems after retirement, or for those that identify so much with work they could never not work because they'd get so boooored they say. They've just long forgotten what it's like to just find things to fill their days. Now, granted even children have parents to set some minor scheduling for them, when to eat, tidy this up. That's good, they're will always be some maintenance required in living. People forget what bored used to  feel like. That they'd get themselves some paper to draw with, or go to random places with the neighbourhood kids, riding bikes and what not. We forgot how to be bored, leaving room for our authentic selves to grow. We get molded quite early away from our authentic selves, into little workers, school children with to much homework asked what do you want to be when you grow up. But i don't really think anyone ever grows up, we grow out of our authentic selves because our survival in this society demands it. We start becoming roles. we perform the necessary little lies of 'hi, how are you'. 'Fine, thanks you'. Not, better when i wasn't here at work.

234,Interesting dialogue from the movie Silence that has stuck with me,"This dialogue is from the movie Silence (2016) directed from Scorcese.

   Two catholic priests go to japan in search of another priest that they fear is dead. Catholicism is banned in Japan and all worshippers of Christ risk death.

  In the following scene Father Rodrigues has been captured by Japanese soldiers along other catholic Japanese people. They're discussing of people who have been murdered for their beliefs and how they are probably next:

     They look at him blankly. A sudden desperation escapes him. His temper flares.
         
                  RODRIGUES
        Why are you looking like that? Why are
        you so calm? Don’t you understand?
        We’re all going to die like that.
        Soon.

    They look at him with growing astonishment and he immediately begins to feel remorse for his outburst. He forces down the last bite of cucumber.

                    RODRIGUES
           Thank you...for the food.

          father...Padre Juan...said if we die 
          we will go to paraiso.

          Paradise, yes...

                     MONICA
         **Isn’t it good to die? Paraiso is so
          much better than here. No one hungry,
          never sick. No taxes, no hard work.**

                    RODRIGUES
                   (conciliatory)
          Padre Juan was right. There’s no work
          in paraiso. No taxes, no hunger.
          Nothing can be stolen from you. And

I just feel I have grown so weak from society, I could almost not survive without it, our old survival skills are being forgotten. Everything you own comes with its own bill, nothings free. Our modern commodities have made us comfortable, lazy and weak, imprisoned people. I want to once more become strong, independent and free. It's hard to even do this in certain places, you are surrounded by all sides from your parents, friends, government and society in general. Cornered and forced to submit and suffer.

240,One of my major life goals is just to work less.,"This is the first time in months I've had two consecutive weekends off, and have only worked 40ish hours per week.

I can feel myself slowly adjusting to it: I'm slowing down, taking my time to smell the roses a bit, engaging in my hobbies more, thinking about big picture stuff.

This isn't possible when you're working 50+ hours a week. It's just not. Now maybe there is diminishing returns there: maybe after 6 months of working only forty hours a week, maybe I would cease to enjoy these weekends and start to be more concerned with my bank account.

And certainly I wanna do some work: even if it is a job I dislike, there is some value for me in being forced to leave the house to meet obligations, to accomplishing tasks etc. 

But any more I think, I wanna minimize my expenses and maximize my pay so that I can get by working 30-40 hours a week. One of the major ways I'm going to do that is having a vascetomy. It's a decision I've been thinking about for years, and I finally had the consultation and scheduled the operation.

And I feel great about it for a lot of reasons, but one of the big ones is that raising a kid costs 200k and I don't wanna have to dedicate 10k hours of work to that.

Think about that: at 20$/hr, that's 10k hours that I no longer have to work. I'm investing $800 to save potentially $200k. I can't believe anyone would go to their job and think, 'boy I'd really to spend more time here, how can I make that happen,'

258,We're all going to die one day.,"I think a lot of people either forget or try to ignore the fact that they are going to die one day. This becomes more evident when it comes to having a job, or when someone brings up the idea of how fucked up it is that generally you have to do something you dislike for most of your life, so you can keep living (which is mostly doing something you dislike). Most people have been so conditioned to the idea that you have to ""work hard"" to earn the right to live, which is ridiculous. We're all going to die one day so why do we (as a society) make the time we spend alive unnecessarily unenjoyable? We have the resources to take care of all of our basic needs without too much strain and yet, people frown at the idea of universal basic income. It's so sad that most people have been conditioned to love their slavery so much so that when they come across someone who doesn't want to be a slave they call them lazy and a leech, but why? We're all going to die, what's the point of spending our time alive chasing money, which is really only paper we choose to give value collectively? I honestly would rather die than live my life this way, because what would be the point?

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday I remind myself that I'm going to die one day, and when I face this fact, it becomes hard for me to waste my time doing something I hate for money (which has no ability to make me truly happy). In a better society, from a young age children will be given the space to explore their talents and what they're passionate about so that when they grow up, that will be their vocation.

Been subscribed to r/antiwork for quite a while. It used to help me feel not alone despite the majority of everyone here being somewhere on the opposite end of the political spectrum.

I've always held to the belief that the giant sociological clash between the two prevalent political parties is a massive waste of time, and frankly pathetic. We as a species are not as intelligent, and heroic as we make ourselves out to be. Tired of living in a world admired by the artists that crafted this falsehood of freedom. I hate that I couldn't save my baby boy, and that it's my fault.

I'm going out to the wilderness. This is the only place I've ever lived where despite the bleakness it's actually possible. I can't be around this worldwide dominant civilization that has flexed itself into the absurd borderline worship of the false value that is currency.

It's a controlling mechanism that is unfortunately required, because honestly the mentality widely required for utopia is blatantly vacant in our social strictures. We're not responsible enough, and this irresponsibility, as well as misplaced value in authority/protocol has harmed me for the last time.

267,Letter to my coworkers,"To my coworkers and management:

Work is making my life miserable, you don't have to make it even worse.

I don't give a damn about productivity, I don't care how many phones I test and/or repair in an hour. I dread the working day and I just want to go home or throw myself out of the window. I'm about to snap at any second.

I hate being at the office early even if there's nothing to do for an entire hour. And then you put the blame on me if I ""slack off"" and I don't get on ""doing something useful"". Fuck off, will you? This is not my house, I don't care about this place, I don't care about profits, I don't care that the ""machine"" works. I work tirelessly to do everything in half. I ""work like a cat"" in that I will undoubtedly take longer breaks, poop on company time and ""play"" as much as I can with clocking in and out (for example, only doing it after I begin to microwave food, prepare my lunch, and NEVER going to the bathroom when I'm clocked out). I only work at a good pace if I have my zionist boss watching me as a prison guard watches over his/her inmates, and even then I mostly simulate doing anything or lie about my productivity rates.

There are weeks where there's no work at all, and others where we can't keep on. Flexibility, you call it, adaptation. We have to learn to ""do other things"" so when there's nothing to do we can just sweep the floor, organize our desks a thousand times, and take on others' jobs; or we just have to become automata, seeking only to produce more and more to the point of exhaustion.

But why? Have you ever wondered about the why of it all? Ignorance truly is bliss, that's the lesson I'm getting. You are working hard, putting the blame on others, and complying to every order, and even so, guess what? All of that is meaningless and only serves the purpose of making a disgusting man richer than he is, the planet more polluted, people becoming more stressed out. That's your daily life, fellow workers. I don't get how you can live with that. Orwellian doublethink. Like when one of you tries to teach me ways to be more productive, I just want him to fuck off and ask him ""are you seriously trying to make me work even harder for nothing but a shitty pay, in this anxiety-filled environment, for a man that supports an Apartheid state""? But you wouldn't compute that. You just go on with your lives, like nothing's going on. Gym this, party that, holidays, Netflix and BS. I envy you, I really do. I also consume media and have hobbies, but damned be me if I ever alienate myself like that, They say people are anxious, but what I constantly see is people that can miraculously detach themselves from any kind of structural-level of questioning, focus on the individual level and be filled with energy and motivation. Hell, some of you are even friendly to the boss! Zen Buddhists to the core.

What strikes me the most about doublethink is that you, management, while being a worker like the rest of us, still comply to every order and have no problem kicking your coworkers' asses around and treating them badly to be in good terms with the boss. Bootlicker pragmatism. You should encourage us to live, slack off, but instead, you are totally fine being the front face of exploitation and anxiety. I get it, the boss is a piece of shit that can fire you at any moment. You were just following orders and getting paid... right? How can you be happy with that?

Oh, and this is the best part! Bosses and management are like BFF, referring to themselves as ""we"" and to the rest of us as ""them"". There's also a subtle condescending attitude, where they ""jokingly"" call us ableist terms, or things like ""dogs"", ""human trash"", ""bags of shit"". Homophobic and racist comments passing by like ""jokes"", hatred toward Muslim and black people... I can't stand it, even more knowing that the boss is a Zionist. You, my coworkers, go on with that. Congratulations. However, this is better than thinking you are friends with your boss, at least I notice the distance.

Indifference, ignorance, lack of critical thinking, ableism, racism, shitty attitudes. Heck, I constantly get to receive ""advice"" and rebukes from a coworker (in a condescending manner, of course, because people love those 5 minutes of power to vent off) doing the same task as I am because ""I'm not doing it right"" Hell no I'm not! I'm trying to sabotage as much as I can while not putting my survival at risk. Can't you notice? I skip testing stuff or I do it without paying attention, I steal supplies, accessories, I slack off, I browse Reddit, the news. I try to recover the time and energy this asshole is stealing from me, and I try to cheat society as much as I know how, the same society that would let you rot in the streets, you idiots. I don't owe anyone of you anything, but I still am not a piece of shit and I understand the stresses of work, I never complain about your work and I treat you with patience and respect. Why can't you do the same? Your lack of solidarity amazes me, you are quick to throw others under a bus whenever the opportunity arises. Most of you are quicker even trying to shift the blame to others if it's not clear who fucked up in something, egoists to the brink. Still, I respect you, I'm the stupid here. I should just become an apathetic narcissist and focus on my own life... That seems to be the key to happiness in this wrecked world.

273,Interesting fact about the minimum wage since 1970,"A few weeks back I created a bit of controversy by suggesting the minimum wage should be set at $45 not $7.25 as it is now, or even $15 as some union activists are demanding. A few folks thought this idea was outrageous. So I have been doing some more research and guess what I discovered? Basically, that is what took place in the stock market. 

My suggestion was that the minimum wage needed to go up by 35 times from $1.45 to make up for the depreciation of the dollar since 1970. Guess whose price actually did go up -- an astonishing by 34 times since 1970: 

**The Dow Jones Industrial Average**

&amp;#x200B;

[Change in the price of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1970 \(Source: Macrotrends\)](https://i.redd.it/vgsqrtmyzsy21.png)

That's right. Although people think it is absurd to suggest the minimum wage should rise to reflect the loss of purchasing power of the dollar, almost no one seems to notice that the DJIA has risen almost exactly as much as it would have taken to offset the depreciation of the purchasing power of the dollar since 1970.

281,Corporate work is little different from farming commodity goods,"I've come to regard the farming of goods that sell on commodities markets as absurd.  It takes away your control over prices and forces you into the ""get big or get out"" mentality of agri-bussiness con-men.  It leaves you relying on insurance and subsidies to weather bad price years, not to mention the insecurity costs of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers that come with monocropping, when you could instead be growing and selling a diverse range of produce and fruit to your regional buyers.

So how is pursuing training and work experience in a specialty for improved corporate (or even government for that matter) employability any different?  I've considering this as I look forward  to developing yet another tech or adding another degree to my CV in order to get work.  The wages of employment are almost always just another form of commodity pricing.  You're time and life are the commodity of course.  The opportunity cost is what you could be doing instead to both enrich yourself and your community.

Unfortunately, too few communities offer the structure and maturity to support this kind of life approach.  Access to workshops, to land, to raw materials, or to experts and apprenticeships is a rare privilege when you look at the vast number of people in the world who inhabit disrupted and disfunctional communities.  That's just the world we've inherited.

Let's give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that everyone does have an equal opportunity and they just need to work harder. Let's also assume that everyone decides to follow their advice and work diligently towards making it to the top, and for the sake of this hypothetical let's also assume that everyone has the same capacity for advancement and hard work.

What happens then? In this scenario there's simply no way for everyone to ""make it"". There isn't enough room at the top, and someone still has to do the shit jobs at the bottom. Most people still aren't going to get there, and in this hypothetical it will pretty much come down to pure luck, which basically just undermines the whole thing.

Maybe it's time to take a step out of the box society has made you put yourself in, and see the very real opportunity in your difficulty.

Unwise financial decisions, taking on unnecessary debt and generally becoming complacent with overconsumption has probably played a big role in getting you where you are today.

True wealth is just as much about needing less as it is about having more.

I know you have probably heard before that life is not fair and we can probably all agree that society and wage slavery is cancerous to the individual.

But how do you break free? Well, it starts with your own attitude and thinking.

Maybe you learned in school that working hard will make you successful, well whether you work hard or not is irrelevant if what you are working on is irrelevant to your success. Work smart, not hard.

Cut back on your spending, sell shit you don't need, stop eating junk and drinking beer, stop trying to escape the reality of your situation with unnecessary consumption and learn to face it.

Pay your debts or file for bankruptcy, don't pay unnecessary interest.

Learn how the system works and how to take advantage. Learn to become an investor and not a worker. Discipline yourself. 

Find out how you want to approach your escape from the rat race, maybe you can become an entrepreneur who makes money his/her own way, maybe you can just go on unemployment or disability and make way with less, or maybe you want to go completely off grid and hunt your own food, whatever you choose, I respect you.

296,I thought I was insane. Then I found this sub.,"  I’m 31. The first major career type job I had was as a janitor for a state run facility. I did 6 years of that. The job included cleaning up bodily fluids, cigarette butts and receptacles, cleaning patient rooms. Stuff like that. The “profession” I found was demeaning to me. After some negative workplace relationships and leadership being subpar I left that job of 6 years. I took 2 years off to focus on myself and hopefully learn some more skills. When I was ready to go back into the workforce I told my mother my feelings about that kind of work but what I said basically went in one ear and out of the other. Several months down the line she asked me what my plans are. I said I have no idea. Then she suggested janitorial work. I started filling with rage at that. 
   I cannot be more clear in my feelings for that type of job. I hate it. I hate it so much. I hate cleaning up piss and shit for 12 dollars an hour. I hate cleaning infectious rooms and areas with no hazard pay. I hate getting up at 5am to commute in one of the worst counties to commute. Basically, this type of job drains me mentally and physically and I am so serious when I say I would rather die than pick up another cigarette butt. The whole thing about my “profession” is that it caters to people but guess what. If people would clean up after themselves my job would be nonexistent.
   But I still do it. I’m miserable, but at least everyone’s toilets are clean. 
   I thought I was the only one that felt like this. Everyone has the mentality that work is normal and expected of you to contribute to society. I fail to see how my profession accomplishes this.  
  Saying all of this brings me to this point. Thank you r/antiwork. I thought I was the only one being overwhelmed by “duty” and expectations. I’ve been lurking for a few days and I can honestly say you guys have helped me so much. The fact that there are like-minded people who feel like work is draining and sometimes useless and all-the-time unfair helps me to see other sides of the same story. I’ve been in therapy because I thought something was wrong with me. Why can’t I find a job I like? Why can’t I get paid more for doing a somewhat important job? Why do people who sit behind desks all day make A LOT more money than I do? I’m the one breathing in chemicals all day. I’m the one swinging a mop until my shoulders are busted. I thought these questions were wrong and I was trying to figure out why I was the only one who was seeing this bullshit.

297,Thinking outside the box on wage labor and wages,"I have been noticing that a very vocal minority of persons on r/antiwork insists workers wages should never rise more than inflation. One person even suggests it makes it more difficult to convince Republican-leaning voters to support ""common sense reforms"" when I propose a minimum wage equal to the exchange value it had in 1970:

&gt;You  ever argue with a republican and you're making arguments for common  sense reforms like Medicare for all and a minimum wage that tracks with  inflation and they counter with ""well where does it end!?""  
&gt;  
&gt;This stupid ass argument is why they say that shit. People like you exist.

If this is the sort of objections made to a modest increase in the minimum wage to $100,000 per year, how then do we answer the objection that we can't reduce hours of labor by half  to address climate change and inequality because such a reduction would cut workers' wages and leave them in poverty? 

We seem fucked either way. Don't cut hours by half and climate change will cause a massive global catastrophe. Do cut hours and no one can live on $7.25, $9.75 or even $15 an hour.

That is inhumane and I do not support inhumane systems.

This is not my choice, but as I said I will not support any system that forces people to prove they deserve food and water.

I live by myself and my mental health probably isn’t bad enough to get sickness benefit anymore but damn I wish I could. How can I cope with this feeling? And how can I make life easier on myself? I do need to work for financial reasons as I live by myself. My family probably wouldn’t want to help me out for too long. I just wish there was a way.

305,"When you think about it, having a career is ridiculous","A bunch of effort dumped into work just to make money. A lot of people think, ""Oh if I just work hard enough and I make myself likeable, I'll move up the corporate ladder and get rich!""

Everyone, society, parents, and teachers, trick you into thinking getting a college degree and having a steady job/career means you made it. No it fucking doesn't. Why do I need a job or a career? Just because it makes successful? Can't believe I fucking fell for this shit. I wish I just skipped college altogether and focused doing my own shit that way I wouldn't have been saddled with debt. Now I'm stuck with debt that I have to pay off. Don't even get me started with getting a car loan or mortgage. 

Office politics is a thing. Middle aged women love to gossip since they're past the college age drunkedness and are so bored at home. Power hungry men try to backstab you at any moment in order to look good and get brownie points for a future promotion. You have to broker alliances to even consider moving up. Sticking to yourself only makes you look like a loner, where people will just generate gossip or take advantage of you

Once you move up the ladder, you receive marginal pay increases but double the amount of responsibilities and duties. Your bosses are always on your ass and you gotta deal with potentially rebellious subordinates that you gotta keep in line or else your boss will demote you, fire you, or cut your pay. It only gets worse as you move up since the stakes are raised. This added stress is one of the reasons why managers always intrude into your personal life, they're only looking out for themselves and are looking to see who is the most vulnerable-looking or easily manipulated to work outside of their prescribed schedule. Show some balls and be ready to assert a firm ""No"" in real life before they even text you.

The praising came in the typical form of ""you're doing a lot of work lately"" (praising me for supposedly working excessively, because that's what the company likes). The reality is that I make it look like I do a lot, but I don't.

I learned how to [work like a cat](https://www.non-compete.com/heres-why-you-should-slack-off-at-work/). For those unfamiliar, among other things, it involves doing the bare minimum while making it look like you're doing a lot. It's particularly doable in office positions.

I'm a software engineer who works from home, and I strategically make my work look like it was done throughout the day. Changes in the code we work on are logged, with the author, date and time of the change. I work on solving a problem for one or two hours, but I apply the code changes over six to eight hours. That makes it look like I worked for a whole day. Sometimes I leave one change or another to be applied by midnight, just to make it look like I'm working late (capitalists love it when you fuck up your personal life for them).

These acts had a very positive effect, as I was praised for ""working hard"", and I'm getting a raise.

347,The reason why most people don't seem to mind working.,"Is because they have no real hobbies or interests. All they do in their free time is lazy, recreational things like watching TV and drinking. Most of us are guilty of this as well because in what little free time we have it's the end of the day after a full shift and we don't have the time or energy to do anything above relaxing media consumption. The amount of memes I see about watching endless Netflix sessions should prove this. 

I have people tell me that they were bored when they were unemployed or if they won the lottery they would go back to work (!!). I think it's because they have no challenging hobbies or interests that require skill or effort. They just bum around in their free time and even the laziest people would be bored with no sense of purpose. Even if you are unemployed, you have no money to really do anything so you can't develop much in the way of skills and you certainly can't travel anywhere too far from your town or city.

If we only had more free time people could discover a whole world of things to do. There are far more skills, arts, hobbies, crafts and things to do than any one person could even scratch the surface of in a single lifetime, even with unlimited free time. Many people take decades to master a single skill such as a language, an instrument, writing novels, martial arts, building things etc.

I think it's a horrifying injustice that so much human potential is wasted with people believing its better to do mindlessly dull, soul drainingly boring and unfulfilling repetitive grunt work for almost no pay off besides small amounts of disposable income that is no where near the hours wasted and time lost; just for the sake of not ""being bored"" or ""having nothing to do"".

I'm almost 30 and I've been working non-stop since I was 15. Never more than a few days or a weekend between jobs. I worked through high school to pay for my own transportation and then third shift for six years to pay my own way through college (in the US by the way). Of course I've had a few weeks of vacation sprinkled here and there over the last 15 years but nothing serious. My new job offers me one whole week of PTO in the first year. ONE WEEK. Since the US has no guaranteed minimum amount of paid leave like most other industrialized countries this is what 15 years of work and a college degree will get me. ONE FUCKING PITTANCE OF A WEEK.

I *desperately* need time away from everything. I need two, six, hell maybe twelve months to heal the emotional scar tissue that has accumulated over the course of 15 years of mindless labor. When I first started working - and for maybe five or ten years afterwards - my days of rejuvenated me. The odd shift off here or there and weekends would allow me to rest, recenter, and go back at it again. But over the last five years and three incredibly shitty jobs therein I can no longer center myself. Days off and weekends don't help, a week of vacation every two years doesn't help, therapy hasn't helped. I do everything I used to do with my free time, I sleep and engage in the things that interest me.

359,The System is Fucked,"TL;DR: *After being thrust into a post-employment world, the protagonist discovers that the System wasn’t set up to help him, but rather entrap him. As he begins to rebel against it, he discovers the only way to deal with a System that’s designed to fuck him—is to fuck it right back.*

Earlier this year I was laid off from a $66k+ per year job. I immediately filed for unemployment insurance (for the first time in my life), only to discover my state’s UI benefit maxes out at $500 per week for a maximum of six months. 

To add insult to injury, I found out that my UI check would be reduced by 80% of any wages I earned in any given week. 

Don’t even get me started on how long it took to even begin receiving the benefit, or the mandatory “waiting week” that added an additional seven days to an already drawn-out process. 

Anyway, let’s do some math. 

Right now I’m earning the equivalent of $12.50 an hour at 40 hours per week for doing nothing (keeping in mind this is less than 40% of what I had been making when I was employed). If I earned any more than $15.65 an hour (still less than half of what I had been making) my UI benefit would be reduced to $0. 

So, effectively, at $15.65 an hour I would *really* be earning $3.15 per hour (after you deduct the $12.50 an hour I get for doing nothing). 

This makes accepting a job for any less than $25-$30 an hour absolutely pointless. Hell, I would have to make at least $19.75 an hour just to be making more than minimum wage (again, when you subtract the $12.50).

So what has been my response? First off, I minimized my monthly expenses as much as I could. This included no longer paying the $600+ in credit card bills I was dealing with each month. 

I could make an entirely separate post about how I was throwing $7,200 per year at about $30,000 in credit card debt, but because of high interest rates it was still going to take me about nine years to pay it all off, at a total cost of over $65,000–literally almost an entire year’s salary. Not to mention, despite 100% on-time payments on my credit report, my credit score had been stuck at around 600 for several years, so I couldn’t even get a lower-interest consolidation loan—believe me, I tried. I’m honestly considering bankruptcy at this point. I’d rather spend seven years with shit credit (it was already shit anyway) and *not* have to pay $600 per month than to continue working my ass off to throw over 10% of my pre-tax income at my debt for the next nine years.

But I digress...

Eventually I was able to reduce my monthly expenses by about 40%, but that still didn’t bridge the gap between the income I had been making and the income I’m making now. 

So what did I do?

I found alternative (i.e. non-W-2) sources of support for myself. I won’t go into further detail, as I would hate to possibly admit to any possibly unethical or, even worse, possibly illegal behavior. Suffice it to say, I figured out how to bridge the gap. 

What’s crazy is that the System all but forced my hand in all of this. I lost my good job through no fault of my own, and expected there to be a support system (unemployment insurance, a system my employer had paid into on my behalf for years) capable of getting me through what I expected to be a brief period of unemployment. 

But instead, I found I could only draw about 40% of my previous salary in benefits, and were I to take a job earning any more than about 49% of my previous salary I could draw a big fat zero. 

So I had to cut back on my expenses, a process made easier by the machinations of yet another component of the System, the Debt-Industrial Complex, whose excessive interest rates and brutal (if opaque) “credit score” formulations made it a no-brainer to simply default on my debts. 

Then I had to figure out how to sneak money past the watchful eye of my state’s UI department, all so I could maintain something vaguely close to the standard of living I had grown accustomed to (or in Capitalist propaganda terms, “earned) prior to being laid off. 

And the funniest part of all, the real irony in this whole situation, is that the very mechanisms that were supposed to keep me in line (UI, FICO scores) have put me in a position to learn how to subvert the System. 

Now I have three months of UI remaining, and I’m doing everything in my power to ensure I never have to return to wage slavery (or debt slavery) again. 

Oh, and did I mention the free health insurance? Never again am I going to spend $25 on a doctor’s visit copay, or $10 on a prescription, or 20% on an overpriced specialist or hospital visit. Not when I can get all of that and more for free!

And before anyone chides me for  “taking advantage” of the System, I’ve been paying over 20% of my income in taxes for years and years. Damn right I’m going to take advantage of it. 

I fucking paid for it.

373,I stopped going to work so I can do what I enjoy.,"I've always been of the opinion that it's better to live a short life full of what I enjoy doing, than live a long life full of things I don't like doing (work). So I stopped going to work so I can focus on studying counselling and also mainly make music. The past few months I've been writing a lot of songs and I've really enjoyed it, I managed to put a few songs together with a main theme through out and now I have a complete album I created. It's called ['Going Nowhere'](https://soundcloud.com/remedy97/lost?in=remedy97/sets/going-nowhere) and it's basically about a character who starts of very depressed about his life and the fact that he has to work a shitty job and through out the album his perspective changes and he becomes free. So at the beginning he feels that he has no purpose or direction, he is going nowhere. But at the end he realises that there is no destination in life. There is just \*this moment\*, now-here.

391,There's Hope,"This is a rant I've had on my mind for a few weeks now as I've been lurking in this sub, and I apologize if its semantics aren't fully on point. I haven't spent a lot of time hashing this out, I'm just kind of hoping you all can see what I mean. This is not an attack on anything or anyone nor is there any anger or frustration behind it, only the desire for us all to lead happier lives.

I first want to say that I empathize with all of you. I am anti-work in the sense that I don't believe in forced wage slavery and I think people's avocations should be their vocations if they so choose. I think the current quasi-capitalist system is a biased sham. However, there's a lot of really, really negative stuff in this feed. It's as if most of you are just waiting to retire or die, being miserable for every second of your workday and spending every free moment dreading the next workday. To reiterate I totally empathize, and I'm not here to tell you that it's all sunshine and rainbows. In fact I'm here to tell you that a lot of aspects of your job, or most jobs, are kind of shit. But you don't have to completely give in to that.

I work a minimum-wage job where I put in between ten and twenty-five hours a week as a pizza chef and occasionally an arcade game attendant, and a second job where I drive for a notoriously shitty food delivery service. Both jobs have abysmal aspects to them that I dread. However, I've learned to find joy and purpose for both jobs. Getting people their food, helping them out with games, seeing people's reactions when I fix something for them, even just helping my co-workers with their tasks is rewarding. Is it rewarding because the company cares about me at all? No. I'm just a cog in their machine, easily replaceable. I don't believe in the current capitalist system, and I don't believe in a minimum wage that isn't a living wage, etc. etc.  Howevrr, my job is rewarding because I found a company that has a bottom line I can support, delivering and/or producing quality products for customers. To me, it's a matter of personal vindication - I succeed at my job because I've decided I am providing for myself and providing a necessary srtvice, and sometimes that's enough to excuse the pain. It can be for you, too, if you choose. The power of positive thinking and all that jazz. You may not want to work at all and that's fine, we're all here wanting to make that happen, but having a grudge against your job isn't gonna make your bad job disappear. What CAN disappear is your negativity. You have that power. If you don't, see a shaman or a therapist or a pastor or a friend or whatever. 

You only live once, my friends. Stick to your ideals, but do not let them cloud your skies too darkly. We can't choose to opt out of the system, but we can choose not to let the system affect (or infect) our bodies with negativity. 

That's all. I hope you have a pleasant evening.",False,bkfe4m,zenshatta,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bkfe4m/theres_hope/,13,3

They make pretty decent money.. they don’t ever have work before 11 am... they get off at 10 or 11 sometimes but who cares when you don’t have work till noon the next day? They only work 5 hour shifts. They have so much free time and I feel like I’m in jail or something with my stupid ass full time job. 

Idk... should I quit so I can just serve tables and live a life free of 10 hour shifts, unnecessary stress, and drug tests? This full time job.,., has taken away my identity and I don’t feel like myself. I feel like the mundane aspect of it all is suppressing me. I can’t be real with one single coworker because they’re all very conservative.. all against weed.., all pro capitalist... I’m just not like them and I don’t fit in. I can’t fit in with my boyfriend or his friends because I’m all “I have work at 7 am I can’t stay” or “I’m tired from being at work all day” always something holding me back. 

I miss the days of leaving work at the door. With my current job I have to worry about things when I’m at home... projects from last week carry over into the next week. The only nice thing about this job is when that direct deposit hits. Still not even the best pay. I thought $17 an hour would be a life changer. Which.. it has helped. But it’s only a couple hundred more that I made in fast food lol. I’d honestly rather get my life back than keep the stability of full time work. I can make plenty to cover bills. I’m planning on getting a townhouse to rent with my boyfriend and our mutual friend who is also a server.. I’m thinking that I’ll use this job to fund the move essentially and then transfer to a serving job as soon as I get to the new area I’ll be living in. 

Thinking of the 3 of us having that nice ass place with all part time serving jobs seems like the shit. I would kill to wake up with my dog and boyfriend and have time to enjoy the morning.. then go to work at 11am or 5 pm. Making the leap just scares me.

So in order for a mechanism to lock the toilet paper to be worth the investment, you have to have a pretty serious problem of TP-theft in your office. IMHO, people would bother to pilfer something as cheap as TP regularly if they're that poor and underpaid. It's absurd, the lengths they which companies would go to maintain these small-yet-efficient oppression mechanisms.

Last week, my workplace had some protests arranged by staff (the company is huge and it reached the news too). Everyone got an email to come over to a dedicated room on their lunch break, to support coworkers who suffered retaliation for raising various complaints against the company. 

Not a lot of people showed up. I think they were scared of retaliation too. Besides, people really need their lunch break -it's the 1 hour a day in which they can step away from the Mid-Century modern pastel furniture and fake smiles. 

I've had this idea of arranging an alternative protest through social media, in which everyone secretly steals 1 toilet paper roll from their office bathroom and uploads a picture on twitter/reddit etc; perhaps with some added anti-work text on it. They can't retaliate if they can't catch you.

405,Platimotivational about embracing the gig economy given to a homeless person living in a car. Makes me sick,"interesting want... but like An says, the world will not bend to your will. fact of the matter is, simply, you took a dead-end
path in this made we call life. now you can stay at the dead end, screaming out your anger to the world and refuse to
budge - or eat some humble pie, backtrack to a place you've already gotten thou once already, and fight your way thou
the masses to find a new nice in the world.

i fix computers for a living - that career is coming to an end, with the advent of smartphones and tablets (throwaway
devices) i'm also in a dead-end path. i got downsized a decade ago, been scraping by surviving ever since - but i know its
just a matter of time until i'm in the same boat you are.

doesn't matter that it isn’t fair... such is life. i went from making a decent wage in my little hometown to a federal
poverty-level existence. real eye-opened, gutta admit ! thankful, i had a girlfriend that could survive on under k a year
(half the federal poverty level), and she taught me how to stretch a dollar ;) and about eating humble pie (and raven
nodules).

so my choice are move to a big city and be miserable in a metropolis, or restrain to a different career. and in the same
age you are. which is why i'm studying the /homeless boards in case things don't work out, and taking free online
courses to educate myself on a different career path.

the world will not change back into my favor, but with the advent of the digital world, new opportunities abound. i have
friends that survive by grinding thou endless online surveys and doing grudge work for Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
another one hunts garage sales every weekend and spends his weekdays posting his finds on various auction sites. a
gal-pal with fashion sense does the same thing with outfits avenged from garage sales and thrifty shops. one couple
works with me to recycle old electronics and clean banks in the evenings to pay their mortgage.

 

so it boils down to this : are you willing to give up your pity party and start over from scratch ? or would you rather admit
defeat at the hands of life and your assist family and just cash out your existence ? your journey only HAS to end if you
refuse to move forward - even if you don't like the direction its heading at the moment... pick your path, and roll the dice

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, she probably see's this as a pipe dream from her lazy 29 year old, and granted i am 'lazy'. She thinks it ridiculous that a 29 year old would live in a van. I get this sentiment, i'd want a nice van i could cart myself and my cat in around (don't want to abandon him, he's my responsibility and i love him&lt;3  ), and it would at least have to be paid off. I'd probably need odd jobs until i win the lottery. How desolate is the alternative though? Get a house, date, have kids (granted they're adorable), dress like other people, act like other people, smile and be happy that you're employed, being super friendly with the boss so you're in their good books (oh yeah, i like them, let's let them keep their job). Even in doing this, or attempting it, it's not cheap in Australia. You'd want like $30k for a van (easily $80k+ new, and still not 4x4), $10k to get it 'off grid' and fitted out, then you still have to pay to run it, which would probably chew out the max $300 a week we'd get in welfare (which is often your weekly rent around here).

&amp;#x200B;

Realistically it's probably a pipe dream. I'd need the money, then i'd need upkeep+petrol. I like how Bob Wells (of CheapRvLiving) put's it though, you get a big house, all the utilities, you're trading freedom for comfort. (granted i might like these some day)  Only way i could see doing it is having the money first somehow, then just doing it and saying see-ya. But by then somebody will be saying don't be stupid get a deposit on a house, then get the house and keep a job and pay $300+ a week so you'll have it outright in 30 years. Then you can sell it for a caravan and travel if you're still alive at likely 70 years so you can then get your full measly pension from the government. Though i can see the point in a house, it's really just a way to park your money and have 'security' as well as a place to fill up with stuff, though i want a farm.

I broke my arm not long ago but jesus im perfectly fine now and its still the same thing. The work load is horrible,people come in non-stop and working as a cashier is pure hell,
1)people are rude like extremely rude,leaving the place disgusting and full of icky leftovers.
2)For 9.00$  an hour its so not worth it,you have to deal with giant lines,make sure you have enough forks,spoons and knives and thats every 10 minutes because you will run out extremely fast. 
3)cleaning the dinning room is hell,since its always full you will never have space to broom and clean the tables properly. 

You will have to do other peoples job even if you repeatedly say no,Ive had to take out a bunch of heavy trash bags alone because someone did not want to do their job.

The employe treatment is horrible too,you cannot be absent ever unless you are extremely vomiting or have explosive shit,the managers will threatened to fire you everytime you are actually sick to work. Ex,I had a really bad fever,I called in and my hiring manager told me “what is your problem?okay then that is a write up” and most of my breaks are directly at the start of my shift,I have no in between that I would actually like to have since standing 9hr straight hurts extremely bad.

To see how low the Left sets it sights, we need only realize that in 1970 an once of gold went for $35. Today that same ounce of gold fetches $1250. Over the intervening 50 years gold hasn't become more valuable, the dollar's purchasing power has declined. 

This means your real wage has collapsed without you even realizing. In truth, to have the same standard of living your parents had working a minimum wage job in 1970, you would have to be earning $45 an hour today.

My database administrator is an old man who talks about how much he loved George Wallace (yes, the segregationist) being governor. The guy frequently insinuates that racism is natural, and just last week he actually made the argument that global warming isn't caused by greenhouse emissions, but by people's body heat... Just yesterday he said Bernie wants to take all the profits Disney made from the Avengers and distribute them among the ""middle class."" I pressed him on this, I always press him on his nonsense, and got him to direct me to his ""source,"" and, of course, it was a Fox article about how Bernie was calling for Disney to pay their workers a living wage - nothing to do with state redistribution to the ""middle class.""  


My immediate boss is one of those enlightened centrists who only ever complains about ""sjws"" and ""leftists sissifying children."" The day after the Christchurch mosque shootings she complained about how six year old boys were being suspended from school on the grounds of sexual assault for forcibly kissing little girls. Despite there obviously needing to be some substantial steps taken to prevent such behavior, I (upon doing a little research) could only find two reports of such suspensions, and the most recent one was from seven years ago. Just yesterday she went on a rant about colleges removing courses that present ""alternative viewpoints"" that ""trigger leftists."" When I pressed her to name such a college, she gave me ""Evergreen State."" I did the research (of course), and while they had a bit of a fiasco two years ago, it had nothing to do with course content, and no courses were canceled. When I asked her if ""alternative viewpoints"" meant ""Richard Spencer,"" she said ""we can't censor such people because there might be some truth in what they're saying."" A few weeks ago she went on a tirade about how we shouldn't have women superheroes because ""men can't identify with women"" and we ""can't change biology.""  


Needless to say, I push back against all this crap, I can't stop myself, and now I have to put up with a super passive aggressive work environment.

441,Open Office Plans/Startup Culture/ Work and Play (a rant)," I work for a multi-billion dollar corporation who has embraced the open office plan fully. Is it nice not being trapped in a cube ? Sure. But cubicles offered at least a semblance of your own ""office"" and your own space where you could grovel and grumble on post shit like this on Reddit without the boss looking over your shoulder. There's a million ""huddle rooms"" for unnecessary meetings. The dress code is supremely casual.  There's a sort of forced effort to try and connect everybody. Particularly in the office break-room/kitchen where there is a couch, and on some floors things like Foosball tables or ping pong or whatever games. Not to mention the incessant wall of monitors constantly  playing Top 40 hits. (I work at a large multimedia corporation and am not a big fan of most of today's pop.)   I would love to  grab the remote and lower the volume if possible. You know where else I could wear jeans and a t shirt, and control the music, and play things like pool and board games with people who I actually know and like, MY HOUSE. If I wanted to do any of these things, I would do them at home. That's the whole point of having your own space and leisure time to do them. The line between work and play is becoming totally blurred and its bizarre to me.  Pick one or the other.  The article I linked below discusses WeWork   
 who embodies this new startup/ weird work/play hybrid fully and wholeheartedly. (I still don't fully understand what exactly they do?) Part of me would rather have to wear a tie and sit in a cubicle instead of seeing leisure activities and the sense of ""home"" being forced into the workplace. Work is for work and home is for everything else. Leave them separate.

Florida government lawyers are among the worst paid in the nation, and public defenders work very long hours of overtime unpaid because of insufficient staffing and a legislature that doesn't care about due process rights for the poor.

Private lawyers used to bill an average of 1800 hours a year in the 1960s-1970s and this number is now over 2000 hours even though workers are more productive than ever thanks to computers. Considering you can only ethically bill on average 2 out of every 3 hours, you need to work at least 60 hours a week to make your minimum billables.

459,"My employment history, I'm 21","In 2014, I started working at McDonalds, and later left in 2016 to work at a hospital. After 6 months at the hospital I knew the job inside and out, but the office environment was toxic af. 

April 2017 I left to be a support worker for those with mental health issues, but I had far too much freedom in that job to the point I was sitting watching Netflix all night (I miss it) and I left due to wanting more discipline and challenges. 

In August 2017 I then started a job in cold calling sales, which is where I realised this is literally it. The rest of my life searching for something that was bearable. In September 2017, one day the job was so bad that on our 15 minute cigarette break I just hopped in the car and drove home and never spoke to anyone there again. 

The next day I had an interview at a care company who care for the elderly a I stayed in that job until December 2017 before I was scouted for a admin job at a financial claims company. 

I started that job in January 2018. It was ok, I was good at it, but the office environment again was toxic, wasnt allowed to talk, laugh, sing, nothing. In September 2018 I was suspended from the job due to allegations of 'sexual harrassment' towards another girl (I am straight and female myself)  which was totally bullshit and they knew it, I just think they wanted me out. 

I got fired in the September just after I had been offered a clinical trials job at the hospital which was big money, but I had to decline due to not being able to provide a reference from the job I was fired from. 

I moped for a week, and then returned to McDonalds in October 2018 and that's where I am now. 

It is soul destroying. I feel like a failure, no real worth, and I'll be stuck in this system for the rest of my life.

My most recent job is so utterly repulsive to me that I actually made an attempt a couple of weeks ago (think sales, with lots of lying to people to manipulate their emotions). I couldn’t go through with it, but told my fiancé, and I’ve been on drugs since and went to the ER, the whole deal. Not feeling much better. 

Fiancé makes about $130k, I make $32k. He has been telling me to quit my job and just let him support me. When we first bought our house, I actually did this while I worked on my freelance writing and self publishing career. This was the most fulfilling work I’ve ever done in my life. I genuinely enjoyed waking up every morning and getting to it. In addition, I also had time to keep my house spotless by taking care of all the indoor chores myself, and make my fiancé delicious meals three times a day from scratch. 

The problem was I’m not a natural business woman, and my savings ran out. I wasn’t making enough to do it without becoming financially dependent on my FH. This idea sickened me so much that I decided to get my current job. I have pretty hefty student loans, so the idea that my fiancé should have to pay those for me made me sick. My mother was very nagging about what I financial burden I was to her from the time I was born, so this is something that’s very deeply ingrained in my psyche. 

I’ve been applying to jobs every time one pops up that I think might be better than my current job, but can’t even get an interview. What’s worse is that my depression has gotten so bad that my creativity and drive to do anything outside work has completely vanished. That was in fact what triggered my suicide attempt: I sat in front of a screen for two hours straight trying to write. This has never been a problem for me before. I felt like the essence of what made me feel joy was lost, and that was unbearable. 

I fantasize about being his house wife and working on my novels, starting my podcast back up, maybe even creating video essays (like Lindsay Ellis, Contrapoints, Philosophy Tube, etc.), learning skills like graphic design and coding, getting back into art, etc. 

However, here’s the list of reasons why I am so hesitant:

1. I would hate to be a burden on him. 

2. He might not always be able to make so much money. If he loses his job, we’re absolutely fucked. He works for a very successful non-profit doing IT work, which means he gets paid significantly higher than the average wage for people in his field. 

3. My resume would suffer from being unemployed. 

4. My friends and family would judge me like they did when I was freelancing. I was always asked to babysit, walk dogs, run errands for them, etc. and when I refused due to my busy workload, they shamed me and didn’t believe that I was actually working. 

5. My drive and motivation are shot. I’ll never shirk on my chores, but the creative and self improvement things aren’t going to happen right away. My fear is that it would take a long time, or might never come back at all. Then I would literally just be depending on him.

6. My fiancé likes expensive things. He drives a Tesla. Even though we can afford to live on his income alone, he would lose out on the opportunity to have more of those expensive things that he loves. I know this seems petty, but he just has a love of cool new technology, so he’s always investing in things like 3D printers, drones, etc. I feel really bad denying him that. 

I’m so torn. On the one hand, I am miserable. On the other, my fiancé is the best thing in my life, and I dread making HIM miserable by becoming dependent on him and putting the stress of all our financial burden on him. What can I do? 

I completely align with the anti-work philosophy, but I hope that you will understand my conflict.",False,bm70u0,FastAsleepattheWheel,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bm70u0/in_a_weird_position_and_could_use_some_input/,5,3

He can't just expect everyone to be okay giving up
their entire lives to work. It's unnatural and
completely the opposite of the way some people
want to live. Of our only 2 option are an entire
lifetime of work or potential death via overexposure

Like for example, I call in sick every other week with different excuses just to chill at home. My recent excuse was saying that i’m a bad cook and got food poisoning due to eating raw chicken. Worked well!

Or take long paid breaks that go over an hour and my responses go from „Had to help or print something out for Mrs xxx (random popular name)“, or „I had to search for my meds in the car“

I have yet to find out how to clock in more hours since my boss is obsessed with micromanagement and I have some negative hours (I was on time &amp; left on time everyday but there’s literally 2h missing just because I sometimes did 10 min longer unpaid lunch break...) I really don’t want to sacrifice my already small freedom and work more :/

I’ve recently got a job as a postman in UK which is kind of a respectable position. Quite low skilled but people seem to like us. I’m only 2 weeks in. I’m always late back though and I’ve been told I’ve been making errors every day. I am going to have to get retrained tomorrow for I don’t know how long. I would feel at least more content if I felt like I was good at the job. It’s so crap to go into work (which I don’t really want to do anyway) then made to feel stupid for any mistakes and not being quick enough. I need to learn not to give a fuck. But it’s hard when you feel incompetent at every job you’ve had. To be fair I usually leave jobs after a few months so I never really get to know my potential. But they make it seem like even for a newbie I’m slow. Which they’re probably right. I won’t go through all the jobs I’ve had but it’s happened in practically all of them. I don’t want to “work hard” for a living I feel so overwhelmed right now. This job is actually a good one as far as jobs go so I should consider myself lucky. I’m going to try and act resilient as I have a gf and if I don’t work I will have to say bye bye to her. But we have a lot of goals together now. I am on sickness benefit while I transition back to work so soon I won’t be entitled to it anymore.

I’m not a dumb guy. Ok I have no degree and only have GCSEs/high school diploma but that’s better than what some of these guys got. When it comes to speed and accuracy I just can’t do it. Nevermind when they’re both necessary.

489,A story about an American and a Mexican. Thought r/antiwork would enjoy it!,"An American investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked.  Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna.  The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.

&amp;#x200B;

The Mexican replied, “only a little while. The American then asked why didn’t he stay out longer and catch more fish? The Mexican said he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs. The American then asked, “but what do you do with the rest of your time?”

&amp;#x200B;

The Mexican fisherman said, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siestas with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine, and play guitar with my amigos.  I have a full and busy life.” The American scoffed, “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually New York City, where you will run your expanding enterprise.”

&amp;#x200B;

The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, how long will this all take?”

498,Work=Serve=slavery. Some thoughts.,"I've been thinking on and off about the nature of work these days. Specifically how you could probably change the notion of working, into serving. Now serving to me seems that it wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. We should serve our community. No one is an island. I don't think anyone needs to work full time with our population levels, but if you try to be a blacksmith and a doctor, you'll get a shitty blacksmith and a shitty doctor. So specializing makes sense to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people will just never be good at serving. Some people that aren't the best, the most intelligent, or able physically/mentally at serving might ironically have to take the little skill required jobs that let's them serve and assist like retail, administration, food service.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem in our society as a culture today is that we've, i think, got this toxic culture of 'dog eat dog', 'everyone has to work' that leads to everyone being pissed off, stressed and lashing out to self-aggrandize themselves and act entitled the moment they feel they can and their reputation won't suffer (or it will and they don't care). When it doesn't have to be this way. The way we have the current system is the rich have much and poor have little, and instead of 'serving' we 'work'. We work under other people, government systems, faceless corporations to whom we sell out time and energy (tl;dr esoterically, i think we're being fucked up) so that the rich remain powerful and we are all beholden to our god the dollar.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe if we had a system in which people if not lovingly, then agreeably, served their communities we'd all be happier. Now here's the caveat, and were we've gone wrong. We don't, say farm enough potatoes so that logically everyone wanting potatoes has them, though on the odd week you might miss out because we're running a little low for some reason. though normally there's enough that some small amount do go to rot but that's the cycle of life. Now we have a system were by we have lot's of potatoes, but we also have so many vendors, we have more then we need as a community, we literally toss them in the bin rather then say give them away, so those potatoes don't lose their monetary value (because everyone's selling potato's, sell them to me cheaper!), we literally poison those potatoes to that people can't salvage them, because people who get them for free won't pay for them. This is just one scenario of how we've gone wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Then let's go along and say we've farmed enough potatoes to feed the community. We don't really want a horde of it going to waste so we don't farm to many. We might branch out some if so inclined to other fruits and vegetable as per the communities need. But if the community doesn't need them, why do any more work? We only serve really 5 hours a day but six days a week or so. This would be a decent system.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel i could write an essay, but this is just one thought. I'm sure all you guys on here probably have similar thinking. Oddly enough this is probably were some religions have things right. Religions are very very good schemes in teaching and enforcing societal values, like valuing the things you have.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: We're prompted to be a wasteful consumerist society that worships the almighty 'dollar'. We're forced to 'work' churning out crap while being deceived into valuing and buying crap, when we really need so very little and just better notions of what 'happy' and 'meaningful' lives are. Religions can be good for indoctrinating these sorts of value systems. OR really really not. Nobody really needs to work. People should agreeably 'serve' the community and get paid adequately for it. If you have little or no way to serve, you should see get paid a comfortable wage that let's you live in society.",False,bkwse9,CarefreeInMyRV,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bkwse9/workserveslavery_some_thoughts/,3,10
499,"Queried unpaid time, I'm sure I'm on someone's blacklist now.","Queries some times I stayed back to handle customers/things. Got told unless i'm explicitly told to stay back I won't get paid (fair, I know this is a general thing).

But we also get told not to leave customers half way, and give good customer service. I was told if I needed to leave wait and call staff/managers. Someone has to cover me before I can leave  See if I did that, I know I'll wind up in the shit, plus nobody answers at the end of the day and typically you might have one or two managers in.

The argument was brought up that everyone else stays back 10, 15 minutes (I was querying lots of 30mins), if they paid me they'd have to pay everyone else. They should, and that sounds like an admission of guilt to me. Do they think everyone else wouldn't like to get paid for staying back to go the extra mile and give that customer service? But apparently everyone stays back and doesn't get paid (but everyone bitches about it) and that just customer service. It's not, it's free labour.",False,bm033r,CarefreeInMyRV,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bm033r/queried_unpaid_time_im_sure_im_on_someones/,2,3
500,Don't cum inside a girl if you don't want your children to go through the same shit,"Kids are only born because adults are baited to having sex, if you ever feel the sex desire, use protection. No one should be born just to go through this. I asked my parents why I am born, and they won't answer and change topic immediately, that's when I understood that I am only born and have to go through this because my parents humped for 5 minutes. I am currently 17 years old now and I know my life ahead won't be an heroic adventure of slaying dragons.

501,I’m exhausted to death,"This is a throwaway account since my sister knows my main.

I’ve been working in an office for 5 months and a month ago, they upped my hours to 8h daily. I thought I’ll survive it but i’m realising that I cant. I come late almost every morning and then there’s nothing much to do at work so I’ll just sit around and wait for it to end. I can’t do private stuff on the computer since we don’t have cubicles anymore. 

And when I come home at 18, I can’t do nothing either. I used to cook healthy, go to the gym or play an hour of video games but hell, I am way too tired to do that. It takes me tons of effort to even brush my teeth or take a shower. My room looks like a mess, clothes around on the floor and I’m so ashamed of it. Even on the weekdays i can’t get myself up to do something. I go to bed at 7pm, browse the Internet/cry and then sleep at 10pm to wake up depressed at 7am the next day.

I feel a bit more free after typing this but can anyone relate or help me? I can’t ask for less hours or they’ll fire me, can’t find a new job either because I’m half (mentally) dead and need the money.",False,bm1is6,oozyb52,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bm1is6/im_exhausted_to_death/,12,35

504,Work is a Prison Sentence,"If you think about it, work is essentially jail.

Most of us spend our day in a cube (which honestly is going to be smaller than a jail cell) and you are forced to do the same damn tasks over and over again. This causing mind numbing boredom and exhaustion. This forms the great majority of your week, where driving to and from the cell takes up more of your time, but of course that time is unpaid...

I feel like I am in jail at work. I don't have any freedoms. I am forced to obey, to do and answer to whatever tasks are placed on my  desk. It is awful. Sure you can try to escape to a different prison (a different company) but at the end of the day, 8 hours of prison is 8 hours of prison no matter where you go.

Yes, you get to go home at the end of the day, but with drained energy and a horrible fatigue from dealing with another day of bullshit. The weekends are a chance to fuel up the battery so you can work yet another week. They have to give you that time off to take care of the other tasks required of a job (clean your clothes, get some food, fill the gas tank, pay those bills).

The system is designed without your interests in mind. It's designed to enslave you and drain you of all your energy. The job will over the years drive you crazy. It will rob you of your vital life energy and convert you to become a mindless, numb, miserable robot. Work is prison, but they have it so twisted that those who want out of work are looked at as lazy, losers. Our society congratulates people for finding a new job, for getting promoted, and shames those who are fired or quit the hamster wheel of corporate america. 

It's a paid prison sentence; don't let them convince you otherwise.
