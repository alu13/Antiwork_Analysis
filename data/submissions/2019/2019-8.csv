1,Alienation due to commuting for work.,"I've been thinking about alienation in a capitalist society. It occurs in many different ways, but I'm thinking about how it alienates us to the very places in which we reside in.

I deal with about an hour of traffic each way, every weekday for work. I've been living in the same place for about six years now, and still don't feel like I'm a member of this community. I'm wondering if this would be any different if I lived and worked in the same neighborhood.

10,"I've decided I don't want to NOT work, I just want to do something fulfilling.","I don't hate working, I hate working at jobs - I hate it because I have people in a heirarchy, who are not necessarily any better at the job than I am, telling me what to do, how I should behave, and how much I have to care, and what kind of person I am based on that, in a company that doesn't give a fuck about me except how much production comes from my labour.  And these tasks, no matter how hard and long I work at them, result in the same return on my end.  If I want just a little bump up, I have to bust my ass with a good attitude every day for years.  At other jobs, I've gotten the raises, I've gotten the promotions - none of it made my life any better, I just had to care more and be more responsible while continuing to build someone else's dream. And I could be fired for literally any reason, so long as my employer follows all legal requirements, or the company could downsize, or go under entirely.  They don't care that I have a mortgage, and car payments and bills, or that I've dedicated a rather large portion of my life, my youth, to the company.

I don't want that anymore.  I sure as shit won't make it to the end of my natural life if I have to do this for another 35 years to retire, when I'm too old and broken to enjoy my life anyway.

The only solution is to go into business for myself.  It'll require a lot of work, and it's a risk, but so is having a job.  This is risk worth taking.  I want the living it can afford, I want the freedom from bosses and other employees telling me what to do, I want to learn and grow and feel a sense of accomplishment when I'm successful.  And I want my work to contribute to society in a meaningful, respectable way.  I want what I do to matter, to others and myself.

18,All the things I'd enjoy doing don't make enough money to live on,"I don't hate working. I hate working for nothing, for a pittance or even for a ""just above paycheck to paycheck"" wage. I hate that I don't get anything physical from work, nothing that i made and it is mine, i don't own anything. 

For example: I wrote a book with the pretence that I'd be able to make a living writing books. I'm pretty good at writing, and assumed I should worry about publishing and all that once it is done. Guess i should have checked beforehand, as the overwhelming majority of authors don't make enough to live on. Hell most don't make enough to cover the time spent making the book. Which sucks for me because i spent a good amount of time writing this thing that i have no reason to try to publish.

Same goes for youtubing, music making, fucking anything i have an interest in. Essentially any artistic or creative pursuit is useless to live on unless you are extremely lucky.

44,My families stupid construction company (management and employees),"I figured you guys would find this interesting. My grandfather owns a construction company, my incompetent uncle is taking over and the idiots  involved make the job significantly worse than it needs to be. 

- Despite the nature of the job they make us start at 6am because “we start early we finish early” and “we need to work when the competitions sleeping” and even though the nature of the job (pouring the same concrete moulds everyday) in no way requires a set start time. Everyone including my self is always extremely tired as most live an hour away. 

- In contrast, the office team comes in at 9am though because, “that’s how offices work” this includes my uncle who the crew does not respect what so ever. 

- We could get the job done in 5 hours but the supervisor and the work crew fucks the dog all day so they can get a 40 hour pay check. Some guys actually show up at 5.30am and do nothing to take extra time for them selves. 

- My family forces all employees (including me) to buy their own equipment (clothes, boots, gloves, scrappers etc) that end up collectively costing hundreds of dollars and depreciate every 4-5 months. 

-Some of crew are drug addicts who bully other employees (including my self) and treat them terribly. My family won’t do anything cause they “need” them and tell me we have to stick up for our selves. 

- They hired two girls who are my age who went to hair dressing school to be in their office/sales team, despite having three construction employees (including my self) who have bachelors degrees “we need a women to answer the phone”. 

-They refuse to give me any form of advancement, mentorship or training. “You need to start from the bottom and learn the ropes”. I’ve been working there for the 8 last years (since 16) and have not gained any skills. Yet for some reason they expect to take over the business one day? Every time I or any one else has an idea or ask a question we get shit on.  

I’ve started my own business (I’m a piece of shit I know) in the cannabis space, and will be quitting soon. 

It’s funny that in school I did well and in my industry I’m quite respected yet my own family won’t even show me any respect, let alone their employees.  

I know my families business is going to go to shit once grandfather leaves and my uncle takes over and I want nothing to do with it. I almost look forward to that day.

51,"I quit work. It took a lot of work, but I'm still standing.","I just discovered this subreddit and I'm very happy to find it. I've been looking over Democratic socialist pages and listening to leftist podcasts and while encouraging many still hold the silly idea that everyone needs a job. Jobs are a dumb thing to agree to, but rather than dwell on political theory I want to share my store from the last 3 years of how I quit having a normal day job. I will start by saying LUCK has been a huge factor. I was very lucky to make good money for long enough to set myself up this way and it's been far from easy. Here goes:

I was a professional computer programmer for about a decade from 2006 to the end of 2016. My salary began around 35k and by the end was up to 70k. I live in Memphis TN where cost of living is very low so that was good money.
Before quitting my day job I had bought a house, 4br 2ba foreclosure that I rehabbed with a total mortgage of 110k. I Airbnb 2 rooms in the house and make enough to pay the mortgage + utils and a little extra meaning FREE PLACE TO LIVE! Covering that base is the number 1 priority to going jobless. Yes I have to still do work but the Airbnb is about 2 hours of labor a day that I can shift around to fit my schedule.

So I have a place to stay but I still need to eat food. I turned my passion into a business and opened a parkour gym. Long story short I worked my but off and just broke even the whole time. I have closed it down BUT I teach classes outdoors and do after school remote programs that being in several thousand a year.

In addition to these two leads I have lots of gig based employment. I'm typing this while waiting for medical students to start practicing ultrasound on me ($15 an hour sporadic shifts). I cleaned houses, helped a friend do a big remodel, taught summer camps, and now I do hourly work with a local bike co-op.

So I totally work jobs. I'm not just living the dream. I'm stressed over money a lot and every month is a balancing act. But I'm still here. I'm getting by without any one employer holding sway over my life. 
It's not perfect but since I can't just magically live in a non job based world I feel like I'm living a good example of resistance to the norm.

I don't care about having more money than I do now if it meant getting my life to myself, I'm sure that's not controversial here.

But there's a dilemma. The money I make here isn't going to be good enough in a few years. I need to make more money over time to beat inflation to effectively save for my retirement, which means I'm forced to develop skills to appease the masters and play their game of pretending that I want to be here, and putting up with only 2 weeks of vacation and a handful of sick days a year in order to recoup myself beyond the weekend... it's just so bleak.

I've been living this life for 5 years now and I want out, so I do the ""responsible"" thing and am actually forward thinking with my money (since I am so very fortunate in having the luxury to be able to think about putting my money away), but it's still at least another 30 years down the road before I can escape this hell and this morning I just woke up and it all hit me and I'm just having a bit of difficulty in coping with it... it's just all so overwhelming having to play the game in order to get out of it.

Ive worked for a large insurance agency in a very large city in the PNW. I personally manage a book of about 3000 clients and have been doing so since day one at my agency. In the 3 years I've been here all of the other people in my department have quit and replacements have been found. I have watched this happen about 4 times in 3 years. Personally I dont mind my job. I like my boss, and I work with some of my best friends. I would love to make more money and I know I could find a company that pay better but I have been comfortable up until last week. My boss called my department into a meeting and informed the three of us, that we would soon be a team of 4. Her reasoning was ""We have been doing really really well as an agency the last 2 years and we can afford to do this."" Yall...IM LIVID. Last year when I asked for a small raise I was told the agency couldn't afford it. After back and forth talking I finally got a 3% raise...Yeah let that sink in. 1 percent more than a typical raise for inflation. They dont need to hire a new employee. They need to pay the ones they have, more money. The reason the agency has done so well in 2 years is largely due to my effort. Would I be out of line to email my boss and say ""Hey, Since the agency has been doing so well, should I expect a raise in pay as well in addition to the new employee?"".

86,My Boss is Holding My Raise Hostage,"So, in my 20s it might seem like a real problem not to have a driver's license, but I have a perfectly good reason. That reason being: Severe general anxiety disorder. I got my permit at 15 and tried to start, but I quickly learned it destroyed my nerves because I was so afraid on the road. I thought this might go away as I was assured, but it did not after several months and eventually I gave up. To this day I am relying on rides to get to work (It's not an imposition, my house and work are right along their commute path). 

&amp;#x200B;

I give you this context because today I learned from my boss that I had elapsed by probationary period two weeks ago, but I would not be receiving the concurrent pay raise that would usually come with the end of that period because he didn't trust that my ride to and from work would be reliable, despite the fact that they have proven otherwise. Not once have I even come close to being late for my shift. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to protest and point out why I didn't have my license yet, but he has still refused until I can present a valid driver's license to him. So, in essence, I am either going to be forced to drive which will induce severe daily stress and anxiety on me, or I will simply continue to make the shit pay I currently make for all of eternity.

That 40 hour week is often 45, 50 hours, because you have to eat shit with a fixed income and work overtime as a slave.

If it's not specifically 40 hours a week on salary, it's at least ten more or ten less. Ten less and you struggle to survive. Ten more and you don't get to live any kind of life. If you're in a rostered industry, kiss your ass goodbye to any money over your allocated hours - it's not your employers fault that you're taking 11 hours to do a 10 hour job, right?

This ""40 hour week"" bullshit is just a self-perpetuating lie now. It's a minority of cases. Honestly I wish it existed as the majority sometimes.

What's the solution? I think it's a 4 day work week that pays the full five. 32 hours a week with a wage inflated to represent a 40 hour one. Work less, have more fun, and also come back to work more productive knowing your employer gives a fuck about 1) your life and 2) your need for money in order to thrive as a person. *The company would be making a sacrifice for the worker because they want to, not because they have to.* I think that's the first and only step forward to success.",False,cwycit,-PvtFish-,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cwycit/why_are_people_constantly_saying_40_hour_work_week/,3,10

They're saying my customer service is bad because I don't know where the things in the shop are when someone asks me.

The manager was saying that my colleagues were complaining about me and it makes me feel shit and now I feel that I can't trust anyone who I work with. I try my best at the job but I'm still criticised. I also feel I have too many responsibilities because I was left to close the shop on my own. And I'd been left with all the deliveries to put on the shelves so I didn't have time to brush the floor. I got my mum to come in and help with cleaning and a coworker had to come in to give me keys to close up and they spied on me and told me off for getting my mum to help.

103,Why does everyone have to be perfect to get anywhere in this life?,"Reddit, being full of white middle-class males, tend to promote the self-improvement movement. One of the largest issues I have with this movement is that it presents the world as if you don't do what they do, you will 100% fail. That has caused intense anxiety for me. I actually had my first panic attack in years after reading some posts on /r/ITCareerQuestions. A [recent post](https://old.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cw4td2/this_daily_plan_for_job_seekers/) on here shows some of this ideology.

What's wrong with wanting to leave work at work? Any ""professional"" field such as IT seems to require you to LIVE that life. IT isn't a job, it's a lifestyle. If you're not setting up a homelab, reading specialized tomes, getting new certs, reviewing fundamentals, and building soft skills, you are fucked. Any job forum will just give you tough ""love"" (because they think being ""tough"" and ""realistic"" means they're adults) and confirm that you will become homeless if you don't do those things. It's very black-and-white. They will come up with, ""Well, if you don't like IT, you can do manual labor 24/7"". I guess the only two jobs in the world are IT or working in a Roman slave mine.

I really don't know how to handle this life. Maybe I am not tough enough, but I don't want to do any of that. Having a job is fucking stupid enough, but I now need to dedicate every waking moment to the field. This always seems to apply to everything too. If you want to date, your Tinder profile needs to be perfect, and your social skills top notch. 

Part of me feels like this is false. I see imperfect people dating, getting okay jobs, etc., and that the majority of IT workers never even heard of /r/ITCareerQuestions or /r/sysadmin let alone post there. But I can't, I feel like this is definitely reality. It horrifies me because I view suicide as a rational choice. If this worldview is true, then the suffering will be too much, and I will pick the option that means no suffering whatsoever. I don't want to be a Type-A, bootlicking, libertarian-minded person who only has one singular, specialized passion. I don't want to, but if this is all life offers, then I want to quit.",False,cw6woa,Western_Weakness,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cw6woa/why_does_everyone_have_to_be_perfect_to_get/,20,74

113,Above/Below the Line,"Recently, I had to sit through a two-day long presentation about “efficiency of communication” in the workplace. Part of this presentation involved a concept called “above/below the line”. Basically it’s the idea that you need to be happy and positive at work, and if you see someone who isn’t 100% excited to be there, you need to do whatever it takes to bring them “above the line”. I knew it was bullshit from the moment I heard it. But it never affected me personally until about 10 minutes ago. 

It’s a Tuesday, probably one of the worst work days in the week.  I’ll admit, I’m not in the greatest attitude. I haven’t smiled yet today. But why would I? Our operations manager comes up to me after our morning meeting and asks if I’m ok. I said “it’s just one of those days”. He then proceeds to ask me “Are you below the line?” I gave him the biggest blank stare possible and just replied “yeah. I guess so”. He then proceeds to ask what he needs to do to get me above the line again. I proceeded to just walk away. 

Why is there this idea that you should be happy at work. I show up at 7:30. Get my work done. Take my hour “lunch” break. And then leave right at 5. I am not here to put on some fake smile and act like this is the best part of my day. A lot of days, I’m pretty agreeable and I have a genuine smile because I’m alive and I have some fun stuff to look forward to after work. But some days, I just don’t have anything great going on and I’m sorry if my “grim” demeanor bothers you. It’s one thing for my wife or friends to ask how they can help me be happier, but I don’t need a damn coworker trying to put a smile on my face.

Now the reason why this bothers me so much is because Physics and Chemistry, along with Mathematics are the 3 most foundational sciences there are whose laws apply to the whole universe. Imagine you land on a foreign planet and you meet aliens there. The only way to communicate with them would be to draw an atom core or an mathematical formula (without human signage) to prove them that you have basic understandings of science.

135,You know what is hypocritical? How western society views the sanctity of life,"This is going to be a bit long. So bear with me.

In western society, we have it drilled into our heads from little kids that life has inherent value. That all human lives matter.

As we grow older this is evidently not true. If the state and the populace truly did think that, then why must we suffer?

In this world we are told we all matter. But for people with mental illness, chronic pain, diseases that leave them bedridden or unable to work. Suddenly we have no value of life bc we produce no capital

We are told life matters then how come there are only two choices in the west? Wage slave and be ground into nothing and rebuilt as a robot, or become homeless and go stave to death. 

Some of us cannot work, or if we can we can only do limited. Instead of being accepting of what has happened to us. We are shunned, shamed, and looked down upon. Even though we are still human.

We cannot sleep, we cannot take pain meds (ether the state won’t allow or the docs won’t), work brings us nothing but misery. We can get the proper healthcare to actually try and heal

What kind of life is that? Suffer or starve to death? None of us asked for this.

We plead with those in power “I am in pain, please help. You said all life has value and I need help!”

They don’t care. They only play the “life has inherent value” to obtain or maintain their power by getting the votes. Then as soon as they have it all empathy leaves their body. If it was even there at all.

“Oh but there is a law saying it is illegal to discriminate against disabled people and mentally ill people”

If you truly believe that an employer will obey the laws of discrimination then you’re being deceived.

We only have value in their eyes if we suffer and produce capital. As soon as we don’t we are less than human. Not everyone can and should work and yet we are forced too.

Life has meaning but only if you make them money.

-----

Had a thought the other day about a potential company structure us antiworkers might be able to create. Something that can exist within the current system to tide us over until we can finally overthrow it. Here's the TLDR:

&gt; Company's main goal would be to find some way to generate a passive revenue stream with minimal upkeep required, so that everyone involved in creating it could sit back and collect a paycheck/benefits with minimal time spent doing occasional updates/maintenance to keep it viable.

I work in software so this is kind of software-centric, and I don't know how well it could or couldn't translate into other industries. I'm just trying to think of a way to exist in this capitalist hellscape without having to spend 40 hours of my only life every week at some bullshit job enriching someone else in return for scraps of the value I create.

Anyway, there are a lot of software companies that will develop an app, API, etc. that pretty much just generates money with minimal upkeep involved. What if all the programmers involved in creating such a product could just share the spoils evenly, instead of the riches going to some greedy fuck's pocket at the top of some company? Maybe there are parallels to these kinds of products in other industries, I dunno.

Here's how I think it could work. Open to suggestions.

-----

### Detailed and boring ideation below:

#### Stage 1: formation

A limited number of people mutually agree to work on some product idea, probably for free, probably in addition to their existing full-time jobs. More people can be hired to the company by majority or unanimous decision, with the understanding that each person brought on would get an equal share of the profits generated once the company enters its final ""maintenance phase."" More on that later.

#### Stage 2: development

At the outset, all co-owners of the project will determine an end goal: a profit threshold after which the company enters ""maintenance phase."" Again, more on that later. But essentially, before any work starts, everyone involved decides ""after we're each making $x in monthly passive income, we're going to stop active work on the project and transition into maintenance."" Alternatively, instead of picking some number, every member could agree to transition into the maintenance phase at any point by unanimous vote.

Product is worked on for as long as it takes to reach the profitability goal. All profits could be evenly distributed from the start or kept in company hands as a financial buffer, depending on what all co-owners want to do. If there are costs associated with keeping the company running (web hosting, materials, etc), it may be wise to keep a multi-month or multi-year buffer in company coffers at all times.

Critical business decisions (including hiring and firing) should be made democratically, either by majority or unanimous vote. If you're going to decide things with majority rather than unanimity, everyone should probably agree on that being the rule to prevent conflicts.

#### Stage 3 - ∞: maintenance

After the profitability threshold determined above is crossed (maybe it's crossed one time, or crossed on average over x months, depending on what people want), or everyone votes to do so, the company enters its final ""maintenance"" phase. This is exactly what it sounds like: nobody is obligated to do any more work, and everybody sits back and collects a paycheck.

Okay, so there's always going to be a little bit of work involved after this point. Someone has to process the payroll and shit, so either someone can volunteer to do this forever, or you can do it round-robin style, etc. Also, some work will have to be done occasionally to keep the product working, update software to prevent security holes, etc. Any member can volunteer to do this, you can split it up, whatever you want to do.

There's one critical piece here: after the project enters this phase, even if one of the contributors decides to say ""fuck it"" and not do any maintenance work anymore (or they die, etc), they can't be fired. If someone decides to check out, the remaining members will have to pick up the (ideally minimal) slack to keep the money rolling in and keep the company from collapsing.

I don't think most people who help carry a company to this stage will be so greedy as to abandon the project completely, especially if the work left to be done is minimal and occasional. But the possibility remains, and I think that's okay because it guarantees the passive income to every member after the maintenance phase is reached, in return for their contributions toward the company's profitability. If everyone decides to abandon the project and the company falls apart, so be it. I think that's pretty unlikely, though.

Extra work by any member to improve the product at this point should be welcome, but it won't result in any greater share of the profits. Everyone gets an equal share regardless of the extra work they put in, period.

-----

### Anticipated Questions

&gt; A competitor has shown up, or market forces have shifted in such a way that our company isn't going to be viable anymore! What do we do now?

I'm wondering if there should be an optional 4th stage, called (re)development or something. Essentially, all members or a majority would have to vote to enter development again for some time in order to stay competitive. This would be a limited-time thing, after which the company would return to maintenance mode.

Alternatively, a new company could be spun off from the original one, and it could fork source code from the first (in the case of software) to create an even better/more competitive product. I think it's important that all members of the original company be provided a chance to join this new company at its inception, with the understanding that their income from the previous project might decline to $0 once the new competitor is launched.

&gt; Why can't we fire anyone after the project enters maintenance?

Because ideally, no more heavy work should have to be done. Also, if someone hasn't been fired up to this point, it's because their contributions have been valuable enough to keep them. Therefore, the product in its profitable state couldn't have existed without their contributions, and they should get their fair share of the reward.

This is also meant to protect against personality conflicts/political drama. It's like being a tenured professor: once you're in, you're in, and barring any extreme legal circumstances you'll keep getting your paycheck. Everyone benefits from doing things this way because they're guaranteed a paycheck/healthcare/other benefits no matter what happens in the future.

&gt; How are these rules enforced?

When forming your company, you'll need to get this all codified into legal language with the help of a lawyer. This is just a framework, and you can tweak it as you please, but hopefully you'll stick to the main idea of creating a passive income stream for everyone involved in your project.

-----

What do you think? Again, totally open to suggestions on this. Are you interested in starting this kind of company? I'm a web/mobile developer, let's talk. I'm willing to front the initial costs like getting a lawyer to codify this stuff into a formal contract, pay the web hosting bills, etc.

For those outside software/IT, Scrum is a project management process that is really similar to a white collar death march. Its not exclusive to software/IT but it is used most often in these fields.

I am underpaid so i wanted to give a big FU to the man by slacking off but every day there's this ""daily-stand up"" where every member of the team has to state the following the rest of the team:

1. What tasks did you do yesterday?
2. What tasks are you planning to do today?

Every. single. fucking. day. Not to mention every task you do has to be estimated and the actual time it took you to finish that task is recorded. Sure you can give a really high estimate so you can slack off, but the other team members have to agree and your boss is watching you give estimates so you better give the impression that you can do things fast.

179,"Thinking about Social Security makes my blood boil, hbu?","So now that I finally make enough money to save, I’m starting to plan for retirement. And I’ve always known there’s issues with social security for the newer generations (I’m in my mid 20’s for reference). At my new job, we have pension and 401k options. So I was sitting with a financial advisor about all my options, and I just flat out said, “so we are basically fucked out of social security?” And he said there’s basically a few options the government can do:

1. Raise taxes
2. Cut the benefits by 50%
3. Just not pay anyone when it runs out 

And I’m sitting here... like so they don’t have a plan, why the fuck am I still paying into social security then? Thousands of dollars down the drain that I will never get back. I’ve heard estimates of getting $200 a month when I retire from social security... wow. And that’s if we even get money. And it pisses me off because it’s not just because people lived longer than expected. There’s so much more to it, but we don’t have to go down that rabbit hole. It just pisses me off that more and more people accept, “yeah we aren’t going to get anything” while we still hand it thousands of dollars instead of investing that into our own retirement. So since we have to keep paying it, then they should guarantee a fix. The government goes in debt for much dumber things.

I love seeing these articles shitting on millennials for not saving enough money, not being ready for retirement, etc etc etc. like fuck dude I am trying. But the government and the laws and everything else feels stacked against me. And that’s with making 70-80k at my new job in my mid 20’s. At my old job, I was making pennies. I couldn’t even imagine if I hadn’t gotten this damn job. Most of my friends make about 30-40k and can’t save. I consider myself lucky, and even I am still looking at the numbers thinking, “fuck dude.” I know this isn’t entirely about antiwork, but I love this sub and the people on it, and this is kinda tied in to work and the bullshit.

194,Maybe nothing gets better because there are so many enjoying the perks of the society by being apart of the silent majority,"I was playing some video games yesterday. My buddy and I are kinda good and rising up the ranks, but that's how the game is designed. We don't complain about much because we understand the game and play within the rules and still get rewarded. But turn to the subreddit of that game and you have (what seems like) tons of people that want change. Compared to the concurrent players online at any given moment, it's a small percentage.


My buddy enjoys the perks of society pretty well. His job doesn't expect him in the office ever. He is stuck in one of those beautiful situations where he fell thru the cracks during a company move and now he just collects a check and does stuff on the side. It's insane, but he profits silently and doesn't want anything to change. On the other hand, I haven't collected enough PTO at my current job to go to the doctor's for months because I opt'd to take a 4 day vacation this Summer. I get watched while I'm doing work and my work is scrutinized so hard that small mistakes could lead to me being let go. I want change to my current situation.


Today I opened up an article about people gathering for an Area 51 music festival. I'm thinking to myself, ""what do these people do for a living to afford time/money/effort to go to something like that?"" Surely they're all benefitting from society and want nothing to change. Obviously I am simplifying things and everyone has a slightly different situation from everyone else, but it's something I am trying to consider.

Prior to this, I've only done fast food work or administrative jobs, but have left them all because the environment was unhealthy/unsafe or my mental health degraded to the point where suicide was the only option I saw for myself. 

I went through a hiring agency. They told me my position didn't require heavy physical labor, and that it was in a cool, well ventilated area, which worked well with my back and migraine problems. I thought that maybe it would be something tolerable that I could do for 8 hours a day and make decent money to survive, since I've burnt out all my other options. That was bullshit. Part of me always knew it was, even though I wanted it not to be. 

I spend 8 hours a day in a hot ass warehouse (120 degrees F) with limited ventilation and no air circulation, doing hard physical labor. Everything hurts, and company policy dictated that I couldn't take my pain medicine and be employed at the same time (blah blah blah safety hazard). I'd been off my pain medicine for a few weeks, and doing well without it. Today I could barely stand when I woke up. Tonight I can barely sit upright. 

I can't quit, though. I need the employment to pay bills. Line work was my last option. My toxic parents told me for the first time in my memory that they were proud of me. My other family members have told everyone they know how excited they are for me. 

I guess I just needed to vent. I feel bad for even complaining, but all I can think about is how this is my life now. Everyone I know who's worked for this company says the pain gets manageable as you get used to the work. This company takes care of their employees and there are plenty of opportunities for upward movement. All I can think about is how I have to do this for the rest of my life. I feel myself spiraling already, and the constant pain is driving me crazy. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do to cope with it, but at least tomorrow is Friday and i don't think we have mandatory overtime on Saturday.

The situation:

I just got angry at my co workers and boss for allowing a volunteer internship. A student recently graduated from my college and now they want to use them as free labor in the guise of experience. They glorified working for free and emphasizing how the work will end up being a good thing.

I flipped out. This person has a degree from our own college. He shouldn't be working for free. Now it's a whole debacle about entitlement to an opinion and that in a perfect world free internships wouldn't exist. 

I'm definitely projecting. I interned, volunteered, and took low paying jobs just to get ""experience"". I was 26 when i had my first full time job. I fucked up my health but at least i have health insurance. But its one of those jobs that I'm extremely over qualified for because that is what was available. What my organization is doing is bull shit because they are literally devaluing their own degree.

205,Feeling like jobs just want to stright up control your life.,"Hello. My name is Karrieal. Its going to be a long venting post so please bare with me. I recently quit my job today and abit stressed out.

Ever since I graduated high school last year I had a shit load of jobs. Ranging from Amazon to Restaraunts and fast food joints and now to a office job. I fucking hated ALL of them and quitted on the spot especially restaraunts because standing for hours hurted my feet to the point they permentantly fucked up now and management being assholes. So I landed this office job now. 

When I got this office job, basically doing data entry on criminal employment, everyone was nice and looked like a peaceful environment. As weeks go by everyone started to look..different. All I saw was depressed faces. And thats when my supervisor came to me saying that 

""Hey so you have to turn your computer off everytime you take a break, get up to get some water, and go to the bathroom."" Basically everytime I get up. I was like ""what the fuck."" But I needed to stay at this job because I'm paying bills now. 

So today... a couple minutes  when I came back from the bathroom she was like ""You cant use the bathroom for more than 10 minutes, do it on your break"" So you saying that i cant take a shit now? Come the fuck on. Not like I'm fucking missing anything and its light work today.

THEN, I wanted clean my water bottle to get some water so I washed my bottle out etc. Supervisor came in and told me I cant use the sink to wash my stuff out. Im here like ""Why??"" 

""So nobody would think you're stealing companies belongings"" but uh this is MY shit.

 
Then one of my coworkers told me the other day ""We having a potluck soon. Its manatory to bring something homemade. Lemme know what your bringing"" UM MANDATORY? I BARELY COOK FOR MYSELF. WHAT. YOU EXPECT ME TO WHIP UP SOME BUFFET FOR 50 PEOPLE??

Anyways. I quitted today. And Yes I told my manager everything. Her excuse? 

Her: ""Oh dont worry about the supervisor, she's pregnant and she saids things she dont mean too."" Yeah fuck no. Just because shes fucking pregnant doesnt give her the excuse to stalk my every move like I'm some bad ass little kid and make my life a living hell.

I couldnt take the stress of people watching my every move and stalking me. I dont get paid much to deal with this shit. Every week I get a lunch money paycheck. I feel sick mentally especially as a person suffering from depression and anxiety for years now. I dont see the point of giving a 2 week notice. I did one time at a fast food job I had and for the next two weeks everyone there treated me different and being passive agressive on me. Thats only some dumb tradition just to search for another person to replace me. Fuck it, I'm done. 

Next job I get. I'm going to save money to make my own business. Im tired of getting up so early. I'm tired of dealing with people and doing useless work. I feel so mentally drain and feeling so negative I just cry at night most times hoping things will get better in time.

223,Does anyone else feel like they're always on thin ice? (small vent),"I just wanted to comment on the way the modern work environment uses a deliberate background anxiety of uncertainty in order to control workers by fear. At my workplace, people kind of have an unofficial mantra that goes ""As long as you deliver, you'll be fine"". I think that people see this as reassuring in a way, but if you look at the root of the idea, it's really not. It's basically saying that you *must* perform and try to muster up the energy to donate your life at every possible moment, or else you will lose your means to survive or keep your current standard of living. It is basically saying that you are never *actually* secure. 

I see this obvious everyday anxiety as deliberate cruelty.

232,"Friends, please don't work hard.","I have a coworker who gets upset at how little some employees seem to be doing. He works hard, so he understandably takes offense when a manager spends all day in the office on the computer. Or when he sees someone at the register with their hands in their pockets(this is retail). He told me he has brought it up with the general manager a few times and hasn't gotten the result he was looking for. 10 years ago, I probably would have felt the same way he does about the situation. What I finally learned though is that the coworker who doesn't hustle isn't lazy, they're smart. 

The idea that working hard is going to get you promotions and raises is 5% reality, 95% propaganda. If you're really good at your position, and you outshine the other employees, management sees promoting you as a loss. If you work the shifts no one wants and are compliant with unreasonable requests, they have no good reason to promote you away from that. It was hard for me to learn this, and it took a long time, because I'm from the midwest where a ""strong work ethic"" is practically religious doctrine.

My job isn't stressful and requires only about 20 hours per week of my time. I work from home every Friday and generally all my afternoons are free. This should be the life, right? Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to not be stuck in some of the horrible jobs Ive had in the past, but here's the problem. Society is so structured around everyone working 40 hours a week that even if you don't, your stuck in that same lonely trap. Because everyone was so busy and stressed by full time work, my friendships deteriorated years ago. Over the years the good friends I had became more sad, angry and irritable. When we got together they seemed to be to anxious to leave. We weren't having fun anymore. Once a week get togethers became once a month, then maybe 3 or 4 times per year. My husband's job seems to be taking a toll on him as well. He comes home very stressed, is in a bad mood (unless he has a few drinks) and I feel we are drifting apart more too. I've thought of looking for other things to be involved in, see if there are social activities im the neighborhood or something like that but there's nothing. I leave work and walk out on to totally empty streets. Everyone is stuck in their offices for a few more hours still. I live in a suburban townhouse development and the homes are really just places for people to sleep between work shifts. Ive lived here 14 years and I know no one. I never see anyone. There is no sense of community.
Even if you can get yourself out of the 40 hour per week trap, you're affected by the damage it does. The disconnection takes its toll. When you're disengaged from people its harder to have empathy for others. Society just gets colder and lonlier and worse. It's every man for themselves. 
The real work that needs to be done to improve our cities and towns isn't being done, because everyone is busy working to make a few people richer instead of improving ourselves. We waste our lives, toiling away to support businesses that at are at best unneeded and at worst doing active harm to people. 
I read a few books on this (Bowling Alone, Lost Connections and Bullshit Jobs) and the conclusion seems to be the same. Work, in the current state its in, is ruining us. We no longer have time for friendships, or to raise our own children, or do the things that we personally value or would find rewarding. Things need to change. We need to cooperate to make this change, but work keeps doing it's best to pull us apart. It leaves us too tired, too lonely, too depressed to do anything other than lay down on the couch and flip on the TV.

290,"It’s been a good ride, but I guess it’s over","I’m on mobile so I don’t know how to link my previous posts. I was hired at a company to recruit Personal Care Assistants who are basically home health aides. 

I took this job because I really care about this field and believe in the cause. However, this company is for profit and is sucking out every last Medicaid/Medicare dime from the people who actually do the services. They get no PTO and no sick time.

Since I’ve been here I’ve never even been offered to look at a Health Insurance plan. And I was told a couple weeks ago there’s no 401K. I don’t get any PTO or sick time either. No one in the office does. And definitely no paid maternity leave, even if you’re at the top of the company. 

I took this job because it was a desk job and my last job overworked me on day and night shifts to the point that it almost killed me because I needed to cover shifts for someone they fired. 

Well, this job has fired someone too. And now, me, a person who just wanted to recruit people, am being forced to go out to the middle of nowhere to do PCA work. It involves driving 4 hours from my home one way, staying for a few days at a total stranger’s house, and bathing and helping him in the bathroom. 

I have PTSD. I cannot do this. Any time you disclose disability, they don’t keep it confidential and they use it as ammo against you. Imagine me having to explain to them that I have PTSD from being raped and don’t feel comfortable bathing a stranger. So I haven’t disclosed disability. 

I’m trying to get to my doctor and I don’t even think they’ll let me leave to do it. They’re criticizing me for spending all my time trying to staff this one case when they know full well it’s taking up all my time. 

So this afternoon I’m walking out for my doctor’s appointment to hope my doctor can help. Wonder if they’ll fire me for it. It’s been a fun ride at this hell hole just seeing how utterly mad the people in management are.

I did Information Technology and by the middle of my course, I felt that IT may not be the field for me and yet, due to societal influences I went ahead with it and got an IT internship and a job now. I feel like I have treaded on the wrong path again and I am just hoping that a car hits me and I quit this place because of this. I don't have the guts to open up to my parents that I am not comfortable here. Everyone in this office are happy and ""proud"" to be in a good organization. But I couldn't feel the same and because of my inability, I feel totally worthless. Leaving the office doesn't make me any better as I find myself even more down when I am alone in my hostel.

Like I mentioned, regardless of my intelligence level, why do customers assume retail workers are too stupid to do our jobs? I have lost count how many times customers argue with me about the functioning of my own register and how it works. Or have argued with me about whether or not a product was priced a certain way or not. Just different things like that.

https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/cjgu5z/so_many_things_that_jobs_find_red_flags_are_so/

I saw that there are people here. Who like the jobs where you have multiple months off. And you scoffed at people saying you'd get bored.

I feel I've found my people. I have had bouts of unemployment. They would have been fine if it weren't for the financial aspect. After I left my last toxic workplace. I just took a week to relax and sleep and emotionally heal from the damage they place did to me. It literally almost gave me an hour. I almost killed myself over a fucking $15 an hour job.

That week off of doing nothing. Not worrying about any schedules. No plans. Was one of the most healing weeks of my life.

I am working right now in my life more than I ever did. I don't know if I'll ever get the full freedom from work. But, my future goals involve saving up to have extended time off.

My boyfriend and I are moving to a cheaper rent. So that he can go to school to get a better job. 

We were really gonna try to stick it out where we currently live. We thought going into a different field would be a different experience for him. Unfortunately. The state of America in modern day, and how capitalism has managed to make it legal to fire you if you form a union (among a myriad of other issues). The vast majority of entry level jobs are full of bullshit. Doesn't matter the field.

I've had many people tell me he needs to not be lazy and get a part time job.

I've chosen to support him. I make enough money to support him. I also wasn't complaining about supporting him. I didn't say I couldn't. I was just sharing. ""Hey, I'm about to do this thing.""

**We** don't want him to get a physical psrt time job. Because part time jobs love to do this thing of ""Oh, you're only available 25 hours a week? Alright. Well we'll feel fully entitled to **all** of your time. Schedule you on days you wanted off. And threaten your job if you ask for some basic respect of your time.""

And they'll inevitably do the thing. Where they schedule you close one night, and open the next day. And they will never give you a consistent schedule. Even though it's what every. Single. Employee. Wants. And they'll never post it in a timely manner. And change the schedule on you without telling you and then discipline you for being late. Because apparently being a manager in a retail store means you can actively ignore details. Like Fred picks up his kid every Friday, so he can't work close. But you schedule him anyway. While micro managing and yelling at your subordinates about things that are out of their control.

Apparently I'm an idiot for not wanting him to deal with this nonsense and focus on school. 

There area couple basic online jobs that would bring in an OK income. And pay a lot more than the awful minimum wage job in the area. So we're going to try to get him those. But if not. He'll still be taking care of the house (which will be such a blessing with how much I'm working). And learning extremely brain intensive things like coding. I don't want his head space occupied about how he didn't meet the quota for inventory. 

He's getting a software development degree, I'm going to get a marketing degree. We've talked about how I could help him get into freelancing by working on the marketing stuff. 

The big plan is to go to South Korea. We hope he'll have a remote job (or maybe freelancing) by then. We'll have free housing. I'll be a TEFL teacher in the public schools. I am currently a TEFL teacher online. I do really enjoy the work. Though it's not what I'd be doing if I didn't need to pay bills.

It's common to get to South Korea, work in public schools for the first year. And then move to a Hagwon (private school). Because they pay more. But you get far less vacations. You're often working extra on the public holidays because public school is closed and parents still send their kids out. And a lot more stress.

I am hoping to stay in SK for 3 years. And will gladly take the 2 weeks paid vacation. With the many paid public holidays off. You also have to come into the office during winter break and sit around all day. The smart ones do something meaningful to them during this time. Msny study their distance masters. Or write their novels. I'll be working on my passion project. I will happily trade a little more money for a lot more time.

I'll stay in SK for 3 years. I'll then use the savings from those 3 years to spend 18-24 months living in cheap beautiful tropical countries and working on my passion project.

I saw multiple people here talking about how you buy free time. And that's your priority financially. I 1000% agree.

And then onto the next multiple year saving plan to save up for the next passion project.

I've never seen myself retiring from a company after 45 years in the same office. One week of vacation is pithy nonsense and you're lucky to get that much. Also, many of those days get eaten up by life. With things such as; family emergencies, sick days, your car broke down. You rarely get to live your life for yourself.

And our society has made us out to be the lazy ones. The immature ones. 

As long as I'm not negatively impacting anyone else around me. What does it matter? I'm lazy for being dilligent with my money and prioritizing my life over leasing the brand new car?

There's somebody on YouTube I love. Their channel name is Creativity RV. Their sister died and it compelled them to completely change their life. When their sister was sick, she said to them (I'm paraphrasing from memory).

""Are you happy with your life? Because I always imagined you in a field. Making a painting or working on your novel.""

They weren't happy. They were in a corporate job that was making them miserable. They bought a house and their boss said something along the lines of. ""I love debt equity.""

""What do you mean?""

""Now I own you for 30 years.""

They hsted that, and rebelled against it. Shortly thereafter, against all ""sense"". They sold their house. Bought an RV and set off. They now make a tiny income on YouTube adsense. They have written a couple books. And little other odd things to survive. And they couldn't be happier. 

In a recent video. They talked about the importance of not working. They'll drag their couch outside the RV. Lie there and watch the clouds and sleep. Not caring about time. Until they feel fully recharged.

They do still have to work to make a living. But not in the traditional way. And in a way where they can travel full time and fully enjoy life.

I've seen a lot of people like this. I feel grateful I grew up in a home that never placed a high importance on a career or being financially successful.

I'd much rather be the hippy with the off brand hiking boots. The falling apart backpack. Knowing I have no debt. Then to be the one who gets turning heads from my vintage Cadillac that is just hemmoraging money. 

I am getting a marketing degree purely for my South Korea goals, and the other reason is because I can get it for minimal to no debt (same is true for boyfriend's degree). I've gotten criticism for this, but I really don't think it matters. I am not interested in a teaching degree. I'm not interested in a teaching career (I've had it suggested it to me because of my plans). I just like it, and can see it propelling me to my next goals. I have no idea what life looks like after 10 years from now. And I'm OK with that. I may get some skills that will help my boyfriend with his path. 

I personally think there is merit in getting a degree for the sake of having a degree. So many jobs, literally did not care what my degree was in. They just wanted me to have one. Because we have to keep creating ""Others"" in society. And even if someone ditched most of their classes. Smoked weed all day. Didn't work, and scraped by with a bunch of C- grades. 

They're more valuable than the person who went into retail work straight after high school so they could feed their family and have worked 10x as hard as the college grad.

So I'm not interested in doing the ""puritan"" college route. Where I pick a degree in my ultimate passion and sacrifice everything I have to get into that field, and then face extreme shame if I ever change my mind.

Something like only 30% of American college grads are in a job relevant to their degree. I'm just skipping the steps to get to the other 70%.

I remember a fast food job I worked. The manager told me I could get a management job if I got a business degree. All that time and money. To get *this* at the end of it? I don't know why anyone would submit themselves to that.

Thanks for reading if you got this far. My boyfriend and I are really excited for our next step. I'm excited to give him the opportunity to focus on school. I'm excited for so many of my future plans. I'm also really glad that I (hopefully) found my people. You seem to be understanding that many of us need to work. You also seem to not be the type to act like you know my life better than me (something I've been dealing with a lot lately).

Using them and then quitting right away could piss them off to the point where they give a bad reference. I was thinking I could use it all, work just a few weeks after, then quit. Is that considered acceptable in the world of corporate slavery? Anyone have any experience with this? Can you please tell me how it turned out?

I am definitely using it all soon, because it's mine, I fucking earned it. And my bosses have kept me from using it with their deadlines. 

Also, I am 100% certain I will quit soon, or else I'll end up in a mental hospital. But at the same time, I need their references.

309,New in this subreddit. I don't want to spend most of my time working. 24 hours is it possible?,"Hi I'm new in this subreddit, I worked as soldier and now I am working in a fish canned factory.

I don't think I can't endure this much more.

I don't want to waste most of my youth-adult working, I want to have a lot of free time. I was thinking in emigrate and getting a job in other country as IT, is it possible to live only working 24 hours per week? I'm a person who never hang out and is very frugal, so I wanted to know if is possible to live with that.

What do you suggest/advice me that I should do? A lot of thanks for your time.

Before finding this subreddit, I am desesperate for a changing and I made a post about it in other subreddit. And some people critizing me saying, that I should mature or that I'm an ignorant or that I'm NEET, when I was asking for alternatives because I want to live my life.

361,I'm looking for good careers for an anti-worker. Any thoughts?,"I was thinking about being a part-time registered nurse in California which means working two twelves. The union is pretty strong there too. The thing is I have to pay my dues and my health will suffer just to get to that point. It will be hard working night shift, and sometimes I won't be able to eat between breakfast and dinner. Both of those will contribute to a shortened life since that diet will leave you susceptible to diabetes and that schedule will lead me to cancer. Also, some lucrative nurse jobs might have to force me to cross the picket line which is something I will absolutely not do despite travel nursing being interesting to me.

Also, nurses actually do real work with some value. The people there probably got there because of capitalism: a sedentary lifestyle, a system that promotes opioids, bad diets, etc., but I'm sure my work will have some value despite the patients really having no hope. It's better than a bullshit office job where you're only there to checkmark a box to make someone above you look important.

My other goal is to read subversive literature in the corner of some office where I listen to a podcast and get lost in the shuffle with generous benefits, PTO, retirement, m etc. I'd like to work at an NGO or non-profit but reading what goes on through r/nonprofitcritical makes me kind of want to not to and the issues I'd deal with would be too close to home.

366,Kept Just Below Full Time,"So where I am, 30 hours a week is considered full time. Since I started there, my job has kept me at 28 hours a week. Because I am not officially ""full time"" I do not receive any of the benefits of full time (insurance, vacation time, etc.). They also had me on 28 hours a week while I was going to college full time. During that semester (I started in April of this year), I was at my classes from 8am until 3pm and then going to work from 4pm to 10pm nearly every day. I was so overworked and stressed that it completely messed with my emotions and I would cry at the smallest inconvenience just because I was so overwhelmed with classes, homework, projects, and work.

Recently, I put in for a change to my schedule for when I go back to school in about two weeks. I need two days off specifically (I have classes from 8am until 6pm both days so there's NO WAY I could even come in), and I can't come in until an hour after I usually am able because I have a class that would overlap if I kept the same schedule and obviously, my classes come first. My manager decided to yell at me for it and tell me he might schedule me at those times/days anyway. I was so angry and frustrated that I told him if he did that, I just wouldn't come in for the entire shift.

I put in my two weeks notice the next day. I don't care about the money anymore.

380,Got a written warning for reading a paperback book during downtime.,"Today I got a written warning for reading on my downtime, not taking a lunch break when my boss wanted (everyone pretty much takes it before leaving and goes home early), and for taking 1 OT hour.  


I have this job. I started this job a year ago. It's a help desk position for a giant company (the largest for their type of company in the world, actually). I have so many complaints with this place, all the way back to the start... I'm a contractor because big companies contract work out to save money. My contractor company bait and switched me, telling me in the first interview a higher rate of pay than what they eventually offered at the time of signing papers. Not enough to make me run for the hills... But definitely below what I should be paid. I took the job because I am desperate, live in a rural area, and for the low cost of just traveling an hour to and back a day, I can make enough money to barely afford a life.  


I busted my ass (60+ hour weeks) on rotating shifts (You switch every week from 6 AM - 4 PM to 8 PM - 6 AM to 10 AM to 8 PM and back to first shift). It was brutal but I did what needed to be done to get to a stable place in my life. The shifts were hard, but they allowed you to get a natural 50 hours, 10 hours OT, every week, just by showing up for work.  

I went beyond the shifts often because people were late, or I volunteered for extra work on the weekend. My manager knew I was using OT but he saw I did a good job and let me be. I learned like a sponge and soaked up everything they threw at me. Soon I knew everything about 200+ applications, networking, enterprise-level computer imaging, active directory, company procedures, data workflows... I am helping take hundreds of calls a week for a two man team,  making hundreds of tickets a day... I get so much experience at an enterprise level. It's got to count in the long run, right?

After three months of being a great worker, I was promoted to the supervisor position of help desk. Still a contractor. NO raise was given to me by my contractor. They conveniently ignored when I got the promotion. I was too tired and busy to fight for a raise because I was excited my efforts were going to get me even more promotions very soon. My contractor craftily told me that the only  way to get raises in this company was to get promotions. So I bided my time.

My schedule becomes set, no more rotation. I start coming in at 4 AM (waking up at 3 AM) and leaving at 2-3 PM (so 9-10 hours a day). I do this to get my reporting for management done during my first two hours there, when it's quiet and not hectic, and so I can be available for third shift to tell me what happened while they were manning things alone. People think it's crazy, but my boss knows this provides IT coverage when no one else is in the IT area to provide it. He lets me do it and I'm honestly okay with it, because I am no longer on rotation. I am getting enough sleep and no longer having micro-naps while I'm driving.  


As supervisor, I know everything and I basically carry the help desk with my knowledge of processes. I suggested changes to the way the help desk worked and everyone on my team enjoys me and our work now. I try to do the best job I can so I get noticed by the departments down the hall that pay TWICE what I make now... If I can make that kind of money, and learn what they do, and get that experience, I'll be set for life. I just know. I fucking know it. It fuels everything I do. That dream of making it. My contractor tells me after I interview for a position like that that I definitely am first in line to get it. Months pass... The promotions never came. I figured out the big company was more interested in hiring overqualified outsiders to be safe, or getting H1B visas in for sweet government kickbacks.  


However, financially, I was finally getting things in order, settling some debts, feeling secure... Then the big company changed my management.   


New management comes in and is cleaning house as of this month. They are writing people up for things, reducing costs, etc. They notice people taking OT and tell everyone to stop it in a general email. So I look at working 8 hour shifts, instead of the 12 I usually did. I immediately know this is going to kill me. I calculate my new paychecks. My landlord raised rent and now a single check will not cover my rent. I feel like the skeleton of economic endgames is tap dancing on my career grave because I. am. financially. fucked.

I take the 8 hours and swallow it. I start to weight options. I cut off expenditures. I go to my contractor and ask them, please, god, a raise? They tell me that because I received a (mandatory) cost of living raise (not COL, it's only half a percent) already this year (everyone received it) that I am no longer eligible for raises this year. That skeleton takes his top hat off and starts rattling his cane in my face.  


Because I am a supervisor, I am taken into many meetings at various tables about all the stuff that's going to change for help desk. More responsibilities, more things we are going to take over on to make the new management look good, good, GOOD! 

Oh, by the way, they tell me again: no more OT, especially not mine. They also say that it would be best if I came in at 6 AM and left at 3 PM, and I MUST take a lunch during the day, because you know, at the manager's old job, back in the 1980's or some such, someone sued the company for not being given lunches... So we must take ours! 

Ouch. I am trying with  8 hours, but I have my reasons for leaving for work as early as I do... Because I live in a rural place, there's only one road out of the mountains. Around 5 AM, tons of people get on this road to get to the city. They drive like madmen to get there, brights on, riding your ass the whole way on a twisty road with blind curves and semis crossing the lines... It's stressful and scary and I prefer to leave at 3:30 when it's empty. Sometimes I can even get to work in under an hour this way... ""I prefer 6 AM"" is all my new manager says, and that's that.

By the way, I ask, while we're here... Can you talk to someone on your end about the raise? I heard the BIG company can influence the contractor on getting people raises. ""Why, no I can't do anything about that. Don't you know I have it hard, too? I'm only making 90k, but I should be making 100k because I'm a manager and not a specialist anymore!""  


Oh yeah... I totally understand that. What a hard time you're having!!   


The skeleton's head falls off onto the table we're sitting at, but my manager doesn't seem to notice.

So I wake up the next week and come in at 5:30, I leave at 1:00 to stay under 8 hours... The next day my manager assigns a meeting at 2:30 PM. I ask if we can take it earlier. He ignores me. So I have to stay over to meet with him. I read a Stephen King book about a child murderer during the downtime at help desk to take my mind off everything that's going on. 

I have the meeting: I am going to train the new hire that's coming in, and by the way, ""we need you to write up a whole training regiment for her by Friday..."" The skeleton is in the parking lot on my way to my car, holding up a time card that says 9.03 hours of time for that day, like a demented Olympic judge... And I feel like I just took a dive from way up above the concrete.  


Today I get a call on my cell phone this morning... My manager has called me from the meeting room right behind me, telling me to come in. Why here's my manager, seated with a woman... Ah, it's my contractor company rep. I've talked to her many times, told her about what's going on at the help desk, been a good friend... Now I've finally met her face to face.

My manager says ""\_\_\_\_\_, you disobeyed me. I told you no more OT and you have 1 hour of OT on Tuesday. You came in at not 6 exactly and left at not even 3! I am going to have to have you sign this written warning.""   


My rep agrees. ""Yes, we told you when you signed up you must ask a manager for OT."" They didn't. But I'm tired. I'm really tired and I see no hope in this situation. I don't even argue. I just write on the paper for comments: You do realize I am paid LESS than the people I supervise now, right? I don't get the natural OT they do. How do you think you'll ever get another (FOOL) to do this job if it means a huge rise in responsibility, no raise, and less pay overall?  


I read this message out loud as I write it. They stare at me, goggle-eyed. They have no response because this was a pageant, not a meeting of rational minds. They said their canned HR warning and did their grim dance, right there in the meeting room as my co-workers watched me in greedy, lurid fascination, already gossiping about \_\_\_\_\_ getting chewed out, YUK YUK! 

My manager does finally say something. ""Well, would you like to go back on rotation?""

I set my head down on the desk and look at the floor. The skeleton is underneath the desk, staring at me. It gives me a thumbs up.

My manager then says ""Also, don't ever read a book at the help desk again. You are setting a bad example for the other help desk workers if you aren't seen working when you are the lead. This is an official warning.""

While I work to learn and grow and do a good job in the workforce, that skeleton of disappointment, of absurdity, of banal pointless labor for no real reason... It's there in the corner while I work, staring at me, doing those really obscene push ups where you clap with both hands on each push, maybe even winking, just waiting to throw me the stupidest fucking dance routine it can come up with.  


I'm tired. I think they're crafting a case to dismiss me. It's really weird. Two months ago, the old management loved me, and they let me do what I needed to do to tread water. It changed really, really fast.

I'm going far, getting nowhere. One of my friends who heard my story of today said don't be sad, keep going, I have so much to offer. I said I feel that while it might be true, I also feel like I'm running out of places to find and put my effort. They all seem rotten... Am I crazy if I keep doing what hasn't worked before?  


I'm really, really afraid the next place I go to, that skeleton will be there.",False,cu6e4e,nowherelefttolook,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cu6e4e/got_a_written_warning_for_reading_a_paperback/,42,153
381,The job market right now for those without connections or wealth,"As an adult, most of the jobs I’ve worked have met one of the following criteria:

*1) Servant class to the wealthy (eg customer service or retail for luxury industries)*

These jobs paid higher and the workplaces themselves were good, but it was basically like being a servant by kissing a ton of ass to rich people who can be very rude, and dealing extremely expensive luxury goods. I’ve styled children for family holiday photoshoots, dealt with “gold rewards cardholders” who spent over $10k per year at my workplace, and overnighted one of a kind occasion gowns to customers, spoke on the phone with actresses in LA about their makeup appointments, and resolved delivery issues for businessmen buying designer bag for their wife. I did these things while living a working class lifestyle and the difference got to me. 

*2) Various grab-bag working-class-pay jobs (lower end retail, generic customer service, tutoring, domestic labor like childcare/basic cooking/housekeeping)*

These jobs paid very low, often without benefits, but had friendly and team oriented environments with flexible scheduling and part time options. Honestly, these are my favorite jobs because my health stays okay and where I’m at again now (retail). 

*3) Temp/contract jobs in entry level office work with zero benefits, status or job security* 

The office placements through my agency were generally okay, because they were higher end places looking to save money while having some low status person be a warm body to finish a task or fill a seat. Not terrible, but you can be sacked at any moment and your hours can be cut, plus you never really feel like you belong where you work which is extremely lonely and depressing. 

*4) Office jobs that are open for a bad or suspicious reason*

I’ve landed what appeared to be a fantastic office work opportunity with upward mobility, benefits, PTO, and on the job training a few times now and quickly realized that the job was open for a reason and not a good one. Extreme overworking, abusive boss, piss poor morale, disrespect and company culture problems to the point of causing illness to me, etc. I stayed in these several times until my health collapsed. I keep seeing some of my old jobs reposted again and again online every few months, because I’m sure the horrible pit of misery that that part of the company is hasn’t improved.",False,cubiy5,LiterallyLesbian,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cubiy5/the_job_market_right_now_for_those_without/,17,50

386,Working life doesn't become easier.,"Hello everyone! Just today I discovered this subreddit, so happy now that decided to make a post and share my experience, I think this is my first one in reddit :) 

So, I'm in my thirties now.. I always hated so called normal work, especially because usually one must get up early and I'm very much owl, this was a torture for most of my life. Before I had worked only low paid jobs, like the warehouses ect. and mostly abroad (I'm from Latvia, by the way), so sad, hated all this crap,..  and I don't like to be with other people anyway, I'm a loner type. Long story short - I wanted to change this situation and get better job, hoping that maybe this will help to get life in order and so on. By better job  I mean better salary, more respectable (than picking up crates, ha ha) and most important, that one what is perfect alignment with my interests. The kind of job that is like a hobby, but you get paid for it. So, finally at age 30 I finished high-school (yes, really), went to university and got degree in my desired field. And now I have my dream job... sort of. I mean, I get exactly what I wanted,... except maybe salary (and if you wonder, a bit over 600 EUR pm, it's like almost ok in my country, but not really)  

The point is the nothing changed for better, I'm in this job for almost a half year, but spiritually I feel the same emptiness when I cant be with myself. The feeling is if I'm not living at all, or like loosing myself, don't even know how to put it, but I hope you get what I meant. Waking up every morning doesn't becomes easier, just the opposite, and all my my colleges, cant stand them anymore.. All I want is just to get away from this nonsense, and if not for money I would left already. 

Hence, I'm interested does anyone have similar experience, when improvement in carrier doesn't change attitude and feelings towards working life, and also does your chronotype is factor to displeasure for work.

A lot of people appear to put a lot of stock in degrees/dipomas but for a lot of things it's actually totally irrelevant. I remember a physics friend once saying you didn't even need to go to uni to learn physics, of course he was off the charts intelligent and I think he was just tired, but he had a point. If you're really into something you don't need a group of people to tell you you're good at it.

394,For those who need a pick me up - I'm about to quit my job.,"I'm a frequent poster here and in other related subs. Just wanted to share a positive thing happening to me today.  

I've been in my current job for about 6 months. It's my first high paying salary job but it's just the latest in a line of brutally soul-crushing desk jobs. Long story short, this is the final straw. Its the most stressful job I've ever had and it has basically ruined my life. I'm more physically unhealthy than I've ever been and have recently had two panic attacks where I basically blacked out. This has never happened to me before this job. I'm more depressed than I've ever been and can't really play any music, which is my favorite thing to do.

Anyways, I'm putting in my two week notice today before I leave. My friend has has offered me a part-time job doing construction/remodeling with him. It'll be my first non-desk job since college and I'm SO excited to change up the pace of my life and hopefully get my mental and physical health back on track. I plan to do this job through the fall while also taking time to work out, eat healthy, and write more music. Then my plan is to start with a computer programming boot camp to transition into the next phase of my life, which will hopefully involve 100% remote developer contracts that I do out of my band's van as a touring musician at least a few months per year.

405,I'm so anxious about work this week.,"So long story short, last week I found out that the entire office except me knew that someone I work with had a problem with how I was doing things. Apparently certain people had complained about me and everyone knew but me. I found this out when the person with a problem started going to someone else who does my job even though I'm assigned to that person. So rather than address the issue with me, they complained about me to everyone and expected it to get back to me or me to get fired or something? 

I'm anxious because this is not the first time that's happened in the office. It's just the first time it's happened to me. Last time something similar happened the girl got fired a few months later because they determined that her performance hadn't improved even though she hadn't been told it needed to! 

I literally had a stellar performance review 2 weeks ago when all this passive aggressive bullshit was going on and no managers talked to me about it even though they knew. I talked it out when I found out this person had a problem as well as let my supervisor know that I would be making the changes they wanted.

But I'm still extremely anxious. I hate my job to begin with (honestly, I'll admit I've gotten a little bit careless) and now I'm having to deal with this passive aggressive BS. I want to quit but I know if I get just another office job I'll be miserable. I was trying to pay off my car then get a part time job but it turns out our rent will be doubling in February so I can't afford to (unless we boomerang back to my parents' house or something).

If you do not have the skills or the desire to put in the work necessary to end up in an “important” position within society, you are resigned to a life of simply getting by (or not having the means to survive at all). 

Every day, I wake up at 6 am to drive an hour to my job, where I sit at a desk until 5 pm. I perform work that is so mind numbing that I can’t wait until noon just so I can sit in my car for an hour and contemplate what I’m doing with my life. With all of this, I am still only just able to pay my bills. I guess it’s a good thing that I have no energy to do anything after work, because I have no extra money to do anything. If I was to quit (which I would absolutely love to do) I would be out of money immediately. I would lose my house, my car, and any ability to enjoy life. This is wrong. I’m encouraged to work hard with bonuses that are dependent on factors that I have no control over. 

We need a paradigm shift in this county. No longer, should a human being be forced to sell their time and energy to simply get by while the beings who are so gracious to give us a job make billions of dollars. A human should be allowed to pursue anything that truly interests them, or do nothing at all if they wish. A human should be able to live a life worth living without any conditions. I believe that we would be a much more prosperous and happy country if we allowed our populous to perform work that they have a strong passion for.

453,I don't think Ive ever wanted to kill myself more than when working full time,"I was lucky enough for my parents to support me while in highschool and not force me to get a job. I did clubs and orgz and shit to look better when applying to college.

I got my first job at 18 it was being a residential assistant at the college which was basically no set times and help people with emotions and help them have fun. It was great but after the first year and a half everything changed and got more paperworky to prove we were doing anything .
Shortly after that I quit.

Ever since then I've been jumping around from job to job in the past two year I've had around 6 jobs which I quit after varying times. Most were 3 or 4 months long. 

I just started a new job. It's the first time I'm doing over 30 hours a week and I can't take it. It's all been smaller companies in customer service but now it's for a large corporation so there are much stricter dress codes, time punches, and after five days of 8 hour shifts I feel drained and depressed.

I've already been diagnosed and am taking meds for generalized anxiety and depression for the past three years. I'm going to have to ask for more anxiety meds as I have multiple panic attacks at work over long lines, rude customers, and my entire job revolving around me smiling. I basically double or triple my daily dose when I have work that day. Every time a customer mentions how big my smile is or how infectious it is I have to hold back tears because I know it'll become a full breakdown. It's a fake smile I've learned after years of customer service and sometimes it's real but most of the time I feel like a fraud and hate pretending I'm happy on the clock.

472,I can't comply with the world we live in,"I can relate 100% with some threads on this sub. So I think this place is good for what goes on my mind.
I can not stress enough you how much I hate living in this society. I am seen as a failure amongs my friends and relatives. Thankfully I don't care what other people say or think about me.
I am 24 male from a shitty third world country. When I was in high school I had huge fights with my family about not going to school. Later at 18 I dropped out of university on first semester. Next year I chose different major(computer eng) and dropped out again on first semester. This time I transferred myself to a vocational school. I barely could stand school for 2 years and got my associte degree. After that bullshit I went to Canada with the help of my family. Infested with the bedbugs after I landed, and decide I can't stand it and returned. Wasted thousands of dollars. After that point, I become numb for my expenses. For example I was sad that because I dropped university my family's hard earned money is lost. Now I don't care. After return, I started looking jobs and started at a company for IT project support. I didn't expect so much topic about law and IT stuff and nobody in the company knew how to do the project. Also my manager was 1 hour seemed happy with my work and next hour unhappy. So I said fuck it I am quitting before 2 months trial.
After I quitted it, my mother pressured me to get a bachelor degree so I got into university again. Barely stand 3 months. Going to school everyday was misery for me. I thought I am not going to live a life that my somebody else wants to. I called my mother and father and said I am dropping again.
Now for about a month I got into a job about IT Security. Waking up to this capitalist bullshit is making me depressed and angry. When I talk my parents about this they say thinks like, it is what it is, you need to be patient, I carried you for 9 months bla bla bla. I wish I never born. Anyways, I get up at 5:35AM for a good breakfast because I want to skip shitty meals at luch in the factory. At 6:30AM I get in bus and arrive work at 7:20. Work starts at 8:00. Until then waiting with sleepy eyes for time to pass. For 9 hours I stare at the fucking screen. I sometimes get computer vision sydrome because of it. Lunch time is 1 hour long and unpaid. Get off work at 6:00PM and traffic is the absolute worst. After 1.5 or 2 hours commute I arrive home at 8:00PM. Eat, shave, shower the clock is 9:00PM. After 30 minutes my eyes gets heavy. I go to bed at 10.
I make a little above minumum wage. My family is not rich by any means but not poor either so I consider myself lucky. I am thinking to force for couple of months and then quit. I will be cruel and say that I won't look for a job for a while and if you don't like it you could rewind to the night of sex and cancel it.",False,cokqkn,throwaway9890604,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cokqkn/i_cant_comply_with_the_world_we_live_in/,8,30

482,Possible Corruption I've Encountered,"So this is going to be a bit different from a lot of the more general posts on this sub, but I couldn't really think of a better subreddit to put it in. This is more of a vent post about what is possibly the biggest corruption I have encountered in the workplace.

So I've been working at a manufacturing firm for a year now, and was staffed by staffing company 1, (SC 1). A few months back they were removed and replaced for reasons that were never revealed to us contract workers. So SC 2 comes in and on the first day made a promise that they would honour all of SC 1's policies, benefits, etc.

Well, immediately after the first week, this staffing company gets everyone's pay incorrect. They seemingly never realized that some contractors that had been there longer had a .50 cent raise, and that one of our breaks was considered on the clock. Most people were losing about $10 on every paycheck (weekly). For the next couple months, we had to go to their office individually to correct each paycheck. Even after they should have had us in the system to be getting correct pay, we were still getting shafted for a bit and had to keep micromanaging our every paycheck. A lot of people I had talked to never made a fuss about it and it seemed like many people perpetually took the ghost pay cut and probably thought it was taxes or something. But anyways, as for those of us who made a fuss, we were back to our post-gross amounts that we were used to getting.

The next issue that came up was regarding holiday pay. SC 2 is now claiming that they have literally zero records whatsoever of what SC 1 was doing, and is relying on word of mouth or something I guess. Some of us are getting our holiday pay and some aren't. It's supposed to be active for us after we have been staffed for 10 months, but they claim they have no way to know who has been here that long. Some people show them check stubs individually, and we get stuff sorted out. Like always, other people are clueless and just take the pay cut. 

The final thing they give us trouble with is a bonus of $200 that we would receive after 10 months as well. They really tried to fight me on this one, and I was basically the only employee that was doing anything to fight back. I gave them a copy of my SC 1 documents to show them evidence, which they then hilariously claimed was the first time they have been capable of getting hold of such papers (they never asked a single employee for this in their introduction meeting).

Time goes by and after a very long time, me and a couple others get our bonus cash after a lot of work done mostly by myself. They made sure to let me know that SC 1 had actually completely changed their policy a few months before they left the mfg. firm, and that the bonus is no longer offered, so I shouldn't tell the other employees that I got the money. They then start saying ridiculous things like you only get holiday pay once, as in for one holiday, and then have to work another 10 months to get it again. Which, honestly sounds like lunacy to me. What company only pays for a single 8 hour holiday once every year? I double checked the original document and it says, verbatim: ""Holiday Pay will be paid when a staffing employee has worked 1500 hours (10 months) in the past 365 days from the holiday)."" I feel like they are totally rules sharking that statement and intentionally trying to twist what is slightly ambiguous wording. When this was discussed with SC 1's onboarding, they verbally made it very clear that holiday pay ""kicked in"" after the 10 months and stayed for all subsequent holidays. There is some ambiguity with how that thing is worded but it just seems ridiculous to think they meant it starts over.

But going beyond all of that, there really isn't any evidence that SC 1 actually did do away with the bonus. They keep sticking to that point, but how can we possibly know that they aren't just making it up to avoid paying us? Because it really seems like they are jacking wages/benefits left right and center from hundreds of employees. What really pissed me off was in a meeting *following* the time I gave them the papers and made them well-aware of the bonus, someone asked them about it in the after-meeting questions portion and they put on the fakest ""What bonus, we weren't aware of any bonus, Timothy, do you know what she is talking about?"" kind of thing. You know damn well what she is talking about, and after someone from my group whispered to her about what to actually call the bonus by name, they referred back to how SC 1 cancelled that before they left.

That's definitely something that only exists in our society because of work; we need to know who to blame when an accident happens, and it's goddamned tiresome. I've been between a rock and a hard place on a bunch of shit for the better part of a week. I ordered parts as soon as I was aware that we needed them. I did my job. Why am I catching shit for this stuff not being in yet? Why not the guy who used the part last and didn't mention we needed to reorder? Why not the shipping company?

But not working can get a bit boring too. We humans are not made to lie on the couch and watch Netflix all day, so I got an idea and went out and bought one of those litter pickers. I started picking garbage in the nearby park and after 45 minutes or so I had filled one whole big black trash bags with plastic packaging, beer cans, soda bottles, broken bike locks, some used needles and even an old suit. 

And do you know what? It felt great! Being out in the fresh air, getting a bit of excercise, cleaning up the park, making this tiny spot on earth a tiny bit better. 

I figured if I did this a couple of hours every day, I could clean up the whole park system in this part of town, in maybe two, three months - for the benefit of myself, dogs, children and old boomers alike!

Off course in three months I would be financially ruined as well. The system would rather that I go back to selling pointless stuff that people dont really need, than me actually doing something that benefits my local community directly.

I typically send out applications to new places but today I decided to post this. After that, and the work I am supposed to be doing, I take a poop on the clock. Once that is over it's pretty up in the air and the worst part of my job. 


I have a boss I don't really talk to unless he has a new task for me, the owner of the company walks from office to office sarcastically giving his input to nearly every part of the business he deems important, and the collection of other people who are ""above"" me are just straight shitting on me until lunch. Lately Ive been in the habit of taking a little more time than usual for lunch. It kills a good part of the day and I do it because about a month ago I was talked to about the need to be here from 8-5pm every day.


At the end of the day I typically smoke a little pot. Pot leads to video games and eating unhealthy (something I'm still working on controlling).

532,The pressure on IT Guys.,"I like technology. I always have since my childhood. I have spent a lot of money on computer accessories some of which can be considered a complete waste of money to others. However , the professional IT world is a different beast. You are expected to dedicate your life to tech . You have to have a home lab at home , learn about how every printer works , constantly be on the know-how of recent developments in tech , Learn the trending programming /  framework or development strategies .(Although I am aware of the importance of upgrading skills.)

The this is I just don't care most of the time . Samsung released a folding phone ? Good for them . Apple screwed over their customers again ? Maybe this time they will learn and not buy from them again. Huawei is banned in a country I don't live in ? Let the parties involved sort it out.

Some aspects of technology are interesting and fun  to me but they are just a small part of my life . Majority of my friends have zero interest in technology and most of the times I do actually want to listen to them talk about their trip to Spain and hold conversations about potatoes , their family tree or whatever .  

Whats worse is that the pay is peanuts compared to what those who expect a lot from you (about technology that their careers are based on) are paid .  I have been thinking a lot about a career change . My uncle did it a few years back . He saw that most promising tech careers are towards advertising-tech , financial-tech  and wasn't really interested. He picked up small scale farming and hasn't used a computer productively since.  I know that there are careers with more insane demands , but two things can be wrong at the same time.",False,coqii6,FlatElk,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/coqii6/the_pressure_on_it_guys/,3,19
533,"I just started studying business. I'm disgusted and I want to contextualize my study, and way of operating a company, differently.","Human Resources. A name I've hated, and a topic I've loathed. A human is more than a resource - a human is a human. Why do people hate HR? Why do I hate HR?

It probably has something to do with the fact that on day one, new, malleable minds going into business are told that your employees are human capital - or human assets - or intellectual capital. Right off the bat people are dehumanized.

I hate this. Why would I want to dehumanize anyone? Yet businesses do this every day!

When studying, rather than learning and beating the formed path, I want to venture elsewhere. I want to learn about what makes businesses run the way they do today, and I want to flip it on its head. I want to use everything I learn as ammunition against the system which controls and constricts so many peoples lives, so if I ever find myself in the position to create a business or organization, I can do it differently and, most importantly, ethically. I think a big part of this is providing legal autonomy to my employees and in turn accepting risks and potential instability.

537,My boss just yelled at me and I can't stand being so weak,"A little context: I am a journalist working at an online site wheres I basically upload news (I work from home) and today has been one very rough day. This weekend is my shift and that shift is 13 hours the day (26 hours lost from the weekend). There is supposed to be at least a half hour break on the noon so I can grab something to eat and not die on my computer and I did just that. The problem is today there has been a massive traffic on news (and all of them are on me to deal with) and I really needed that break. 

I guess the boss didn't like that at all. He called me and literally made me feel like dirt... I have been struggling a lot at this job (I also have depression and anxiety so a real hard struggle) and that today broke me. He basically demanded that I had to stay put until all of the news where covered... but they were never ending like wtf. I didn't say anything back at him only ok sir, it won't happen again. Call me weak and sensitive  if you want but after he hang up I started crying. 

I can't stop thinking how I am just a 22 year old girl that already wasted herself on psychopaths like my boss. I know I am young and all but was that treatment necessary? I wanted so bad to yell at him and make him feel half as bad as he made me feel but I didn't. 

Bosses think they are the only ones that deserve  respect and people like me (slaves) are just there for their needs and are nothing more than horse shit.

The work system is so bad  today for young people... literally they think bc you are young they have some hold on you and can do whatever the hell they want.

I'm literally crying as I write this but I think this is the most appropriate sub for me to let this all out. 
Please bear with me. 

tl;dr
Being fired from so many jobs has given me what I fear to be irreparable trauma which has affected my life in every way possible. Unable to work and indulge in hobbies and things I love and sometimes leave the house. Help? 

~~~~~~~~

I've been written off from work due to mental health. I have significant work related trauma after being fired from basically every job I've had since graduating in 2016. 

I've recently discovered I have ADHD which explains a lot why I don't do well in corporate profit driven office environments.
The lateness, poor time management, silly mistakes and every other adhd symptom which has gone undiagnosed and as a result 
 untreated for 25 years of my life. 

I've been let go due to 'poor performance' lateness and other issues. The last time I worked for a company I was let go after 3 days. 
It was my dream job at a top agency with clients like Netflix and the BBC. I missed a key client meeting, as a result of my anxiety and poor decision making (if I explain to you how I missed this meeting you would be so baffled) and they let me go because of that and how they didnt feel I was happy there. 

I was just super anxious and on edge and it showed but they read it as something else, as me not being as sociable or whatever. It was a job I got after months of being unemployed so I was super anxious for it to work out. It didn't and I was let go. 

Cue me having a massive breakdown which caused me to selfharm for the first time in my life it got so bad once my boyfriend had  to physically restrain me. It was after this I realised I had ADHD

The impact this has all had had on my life, I cant begin to put into words but I'll try. 

Since that episode Ive worked on my own ventures and business but they're being affected because I avoid and completely fear working. I run a successful employability service (the irony isn't lost on me trust me) where I help job seekers with their cvs, letters, interviews etc and I'm contracted by schools, charities and universities to give employability related talks.  I'm very good at what I do, I make good money from it but because I'm so disillusioned, fearful of work I don't take my business seriously. I don't reply to enquiries, follow up on things, etc. When I get an email or an order it's a pang of anxiety not glee. My business inbox has so many unread messages.

It's only when I get a rush of motivation that I attend to my business, allocate work to my freelancers etc. I could have so much money but I'm in my overdraft because I'm not taking it seriously. I could legit have a mortgage, travel 5 times a year if I put my mind to it. Lol. Intentional poverty I call it. I do just what I can to ensure I'm not homeless and can eat. It's gotten worse because now I'm not even doing that and my bf is supporting me financially at the moment. 

My confidence and self esteem is shot. Me being a Careers adviser is worse because I feel like a fraud. I mean I can get the jobs (I've worked for multinational IT companies, FT500 companies, top marketing agencies etc) but keeping them? Lol

My work related trauma has made me a shell of myself. I used to be so hardworking so ambitious a go getter. My peers are way ahead of me. I spend my days milling around, swiping on social media avoiding responsibilities. Sometimes it's hard to leave the house. The depression and anxiety has taken such a toll on me. I'm on zoloft for the depression and its helped with the episodes but not anything else

I don't recognise myself. I've just finished talking therapy and I'm waiting to get CBT and also treatment for the adhd. It's just I'm waiting on the NHS and it's a long and slow process as Im not private. 

I'm meant to start my masters in September to get qualified as a Careers adviser at the highest level, they gave me an offer almost immediately after applying but I haven't responded to it. Fear. Anxiety. Self doubt. Laziness. I don't even know anymore 

Because I've spent a year like this I'm worried these lazy habits of mine are entrenched now and just me. I have very little motivation to do anything. I run a diversity initiative with 4 other women, it's amazing but I'm not pulling my weight and they think I don't care. Talks of me stepping down have been suggested. Welp.

I would rather they think that than them know what the real issue is though.

I graduated recently and have been working at my first job for 6 months. I cannot even begin to explain the numbness and apathy towards life that I've developed since I started.

My depression and anxiety are in charge now, not the person I once was.

And the worst part? I feel *so* guilty for complaining about my job! I know so many people who graduated and are yet to find full time work, and my *envy* that they haven't just seems so nonsensical to everybody that they just assume I'm kidding. Am I supposed to be grateful for this existence? 

I don't know how much longer I can take this. I want to do something, follow my passion in writing, go on an adventure... but once I'm home from work, all I can think about is the fact that I'll be waking up in T-minus 8 hours to do it all over again. And again. And again.

565,Passing on a promotion and I really don't care,"27 Male at large corporate facility.

&amp;nbsp;

I found it interesting management was discussing moving me from Coordinator II (CII) up to project manager (PM), leap frogging CIII (highly structured here). Unsurprisingly, during the discussion with my director, I asked about the title of PM along with compensation. Basically, no additional benefits and he said ""we'd give you PM work now, then promote you a year from now""... Shocker /s

&amp;nbsp;

So basically, I'm moving up to a CIII regardless, but they wanna rig it to where I take PM work without PM pay...a very substantial pay difference

&amp;nbsp;

Said I was interested but uncomfortable taking on the responsibilities prior to gaining CIII experience. 

&amp;nbsp;

In truth, I don't want to be PM at this place. Recently, it's gotten bad. The directors have been greedy fat fucking pigs lately. They stretch the truth of our possibilities to get more projects -- more $$$ for higher ups, but everyone below them instantly gets fucked as a result. We've got so many projects landing, everyone is overworked, and I hear even some other non-PM positions in my dept stay late/work weekends (salary, what an insidious trap)

&amp;nbsp;


But the PMs...my god, they get utterly shafted. Mental breakdowns are not uncommon here amongst the PMs.


&amp;nbsp;


Each PM works between 50-60+ hours. They all have this rushed/worried/franticness about them. One PM has recently been completing email tasks both Saturdays and Sundays now (previously, it was only Sun). This one also ""jokes"" about not needing vacation days because he can't even use them..... hilarious. Another PM openly ""jokes"" about not having a life. Yet another PM says ""yeah it really fucking sucks"" but she wants to move up higher so she deals. 

&amp;nbsp;

I think these people are literally insane. Like actually batshit crazy, I think they've lost themselves, lost a healthy perspective towards life. 

&amp;nbsp;

Director and a few PMs have followed up with me about moving up -- I'm close to giving a hard no if I can't dodge any longer.


&amp;nbsp;


I'm well aware a ""No"" could affect me negatively here. But I seriously don't give a fuck. I'm lucky enough to have no kids and low cost of living and CII/III pay is decent as is. I'll stay as comfy as possible as a III then reassess a year from now.

&amp;nbsp;

To be honest, I feel incredible sadness towards people in my position who don't have options to weigh the pro/cons of the corporate ladder (if the ladder is even available at all). Whether they have kids, high cost of living, even more student debt than I do, etc, etc. It seems so much of contemporary life forces people to actively leap towards suffering.. Either knowingly or unknowingly


&amp;nbsp;

Related - another CII they're legitimately forcing to become PM, likely without the full title (PM above him quit). He asked about more compensation. In response, the director said he was ""focusing on the wrong thing. Instead, think about the great opportunity"".. He's now actively looking for another job",False,cq8vnn,Hypnotic_Delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cq8vnn/passing_on_a_promotion_and_i_really_dont_care/,6,23

570,Are there any teachers who are lazy and actually are in it for the money and the pretence of stability?,"This seems to be a taboo subject in teaching but just wondering, are there any non-martyr teachers who just want a solid paycheck and summer, Christmas, Halloween and Easter holidays? I'm considering upskilling as I already teach but not in the school system and basically it's all I can get a job at, it's seems like a case of Fry the Pizza Delivery boy. 

In any case, although obviously you have to prepare for a lesson (otherwise it's sink and die), I really hate this cop out response people have on reddit: ""please don't be a teacher"", if someone complains about legitimate bs aspects of the job and society's quite frankly repugnant attitude towards education. I think it's ok for teachers so say, ""yes I don't like working and try to find ways to expedite a whole load of processes"". The teacher strikes in the US were well justified. If governments and parents/society continue with their insane attitudes, it's about time teachers just said ""fine teach your kids yourself and see how far you get!"" and walk off the job. We need more of this attitude and less ""I'll give up my life for my students"" crap. 

That teacher who made it to the news for teaching students outside the wreckage of his town after some flood really annoyed me. Lots of people were praising him for his ""dedication"" but what I saw was an attempt to play into this ""martyr teacher"" persona and get kudos which only makes it harder for the rest of us not so dedicated teachers. 

Calling teaching a vocation and something you have to give up your life for (which a lot of teachers on the teaching subreddit seem to tacitly support) is complete horse shit. It's a job and there should be boundaries, i.e. no calls from parents outside work hours, optional after school work if you want to do it, not mandatory etc. If some people want to make it their lives, good for them, but don't demand that teaching should be a vocation and not a profession deserving of the respect that profession gets with respect to boundaries/work-life balance.",False,cpk8sx,TheCassiniProjekt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cpk8sx/are_there_any_teachers_who_are_lazy_and_actually/,14,10
571,Labor for income,"I want to try and be as concise as possible, but please forgive me if this post is scatter brained.

First of all, the idea that humans must work at corporations in order to not starve to death, is problematic in my opinion. I wont go into that here, because the response os usually something along the lines if, well you gotta do something to survive, if you lived in the wilderness, youd have to hunt/forage etc. Granted, but my complaint is that what we call work in this system is largely divorced from any kind of meaningful scrutiny, to the extent that the work we do is either unnecessary or arbitrary. 

What i mean is this: there are things that are intrinsically valuable, like keeping the electricity flowing, fixing leaky pipes, cleaning up someone’s yard, etc.

However, a majority of the activities people must engage in (or starve and be homeless), are either meaningless or arbitrarily defined. Take the 8 hour work day, often, it is unecessary, counterproductive, and completely debased from any sort of logical definition. Take telemarketing or a lot of office work. 

My point it this, modern society exchanges techology and material comfort, and trades it for the type of environment that humans evolved in (pleistocene), and the individual cost of these so called benefits of modernity, are engaging in meaningless, ill-defined, arbitrary actions, that are only existing because it generates profit for some owner. 

Again, i applogize that this is a very scatter-brained post. I have been looking a lot lately at how modern lifestyles actually generate things like depression, and trying to express this in the language of anti-work, or a type of criticism of modern economic organization, especially as it relates to individual humans doing “gainful activity” in the context of our current system.

588,I found the solution I needed.,"A family friend has an 8 year old kid who's close with my cousin. The kid starts school again in a couple of weeks and the mom works a lot. She was looking for somebody to pick up the kid from school and do activities with him/play games/help with homework, sometimes do housework and make dinner, etc, from 3:30 to 7:30 5 days a week.

And she is going to pay $18 an hour to do this which is a lot of money where I'm located. I don't even like kids that much!! But she says she is happy to have me for the ""job"" and it's so low stress compared to actual jobs I've worked that were mostly annoying bullshit and kinda sucked. 

This is perfect because I need to save money. My gf and I want to get an apartment together where we'd split rent/bills bc the rent at this certain place is $1,000 per month. 

Including other costs of living this is enough for me and to still have some left over for fun stuff plus I sell art occasionally and sell other things online.

To make matters worse I’m also averaging about 500 calories a day and half of that is the Pepsi I drink in the morning before work. My body aches even worse now because I don’t eat but I’m in so much pain when I come home that I don’t feel like making dinner at 11:30 pm when I get home, and then I wake up at noon an hour before I have to be at work so no time for breakfast either. 

I’m absolutely crumbling under the stress of working like this. I requested a part-time position thinking it would be closer to the 20 hour range, and is what I said I’d preferred.

596,I’m starting to hate my job even though I went into this field because it was my passion,"I’ve always been into design. Back in middle school I used to design and code websites and have fun on photoshop. I didn’t even consider a career out of it until I got disgusted by law school (talk about justice). As time went on, I got into UX Design and at my last job (where I was benchwarming, doing useless visuals no on gave a shit about in a toxic environment) I was waiting impatiently for my next job at an app company. I used to design apps and motion videos a big chum of my free time, thinking up startup concepts. Got the job last September for a health app. I was so motivated I was given so much freedom in my creativity, any of my ideas is considered and I’m directly working with the techs and content writers (we have an awesome team).

However our boss just keep losing our time on useless marketing nonsense, coming back in forth on everything we’ve done. We lost 3 months working on the wording of the onboarding, to the point it got so far from our original idea it made no sense and had to be reworked... I came into this field because I wanted to do user-centric design, to answer to people’s need, to make their life easier, and for the last 2 months I’ve been working on the conversion funnel because the marketing lead and our boss keep changing the pricing and marketing strategy everyday (they both have no idea what they’re doing to the point the company is borderline on going down). Everything changes, all the time, brand image, content, marketing strategy... to the point in most days no one is sure what they are supposed to do. Literally my only enjoyment in my work these days is thinking up scams for the conversion funnel and scheming with my coworkers about how we can screw the boss.

I have a project going on with 3 other people about an app and I haven’t touch it this year yet. When I go home, I don’t want to design at all. I don’t want to design at work either. I’m not even sure what I would be motivated working on actually. This is so sad because I got so much joy and energy from creative thinking.

To add up, our place is slowly becoming more and more toxic, I should go but I’m too sick (got a bunch of chronic illnesses) to pretend I’m fine while job hunting and I think I’m just waiting for the big burning down because everyone is going to go at once in a few months. The boss and the CEO are stirring up shit and they actually believe we won’t just, like, go and manage to immediately find another job somewhere we will be decently compensated in regards of our skills, experience and diplomas. We’re only staying at the moment because everyone (minus the boss and the CEO) is friends and it’s easier to party after work if we’re already together (beer is already in the fridge).

Basically, I just passed my two year mark for being a full-time employee (I understand that's not much compared to others' situations but I'm still very unhappy). I've been trying to look for any way to make life easier, but it seems like I've exhausted all avenues. I've looked for part-time work but I won't be able to make rent if I do that, I've tried talking to my boss about working part-time in my current position but of course, we need ""coverage"". For reference, I work in a back-end office position where I get *maybe* 5 calls a week. And there are others in the department as well. 

I'm at my rope's end here, I've even been toying with thoughts of exploiting the welfare system to start working part-time, but I'm really not sure if I'd even want to do that. Maybe all of this is super trivial and I'm just so far down the rabbit hole that I can't think straight. I'm just so tired of not being able to enjoy my life. I get home, I try to go back to my hobbies but nothing sounds good. I feel like I'm optimizing my time to max out my enjoyment of free time before I have to wrap it up and send myself off to work the next day.

611,They're onto me.,"The society where I live and situation in my personal life has created this environment where I can work only two days a week, sometimes working a bit more, but for the last year I've generally worked 2-3 days a week. Now I think that things are changing for the worse. I work in restaurants as a waiter. I work for a company that rents out hospitality workers to restaurants, it's a zero-hour contract and I'm allowed to accept or deny shifts that are offered to me and this system has allowed myself great liberty to organize my life the way I have more free time. I can do this, because I'm a good worker, I know I am, so there is always restaurants that offer shifts for me or ask for me specially when they contact the company I work for. 

  
Resturant worker mindset is radically different from my own personal views on work and employment. In the industry everybody is pushing hard, and people do long days and long weeks and the culture is all about working hard. Cooks and waiters see themselves strong and needed when they work those crazy hours, and everyone in the industry are a tight group, pushing forward together, every day. While I can honestly respect hard workers and their contribution and determination and passion, I don't want it myself. When I was younger, I too worked this way, I did it because I had found the thing I'm good at and I felt that 'this is it, my thing', but quickly I just found myself drinking and doing drugs with other workers, on a tuesday night after a 12-hour shift. Going off on un-healthy sexual trips with other workers and literally not remembering anything else than work from a few years of my life. I understood that gift of life is greater than to spend it at work. 

  
Now this summer I've been working for a good restaurant in my city, they “rent” me from my company but sort of have agreed that I'll be their “number 1 guy” when they need some extra workers. So I do the weekends there, and rest of the week I'm chilling. But obviously they have this mindset, that I too, am hungry for more work, and they keep telling me “more hours will be coming to you” “You're good worker, how you like it here? Would you like to do more work during Autumn” so on and so forth.   In this industry, it is impossible to bring out my “life philosophy” if you will, it's unheard of that someone is refusing work just because. At work, everyone is literally speaking about how busy it was or is going to be and that's good, the harder we work the better. So I need to play along to that tune, because I still need to pay rent and make some money, and I like working in this good restaurant. But I don't want more work, but when they offer it I'm forced to accept it because otherwise they'll find out that I'm just a freak, a fake, someone who doesn't share their ideas of working, someone not be trusted.   

It's difficult and stressful to pretend to be part of the ratracing slaves that just want more hours. The other night I got really hammered first time in a long time, because I came to the conclusion that they're onto me, that if I don't accept more work from them they will make sure I wont be able to work for them anymore, and their word spreads around this, not very big city, quickly, because they're one of the best. 

Maybe this, working very little has only been a short lived illusion and the gaping abyss of employment is about to swallow me whole.",False,cn3lyf,vizzivizzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cn3lyf/theyre_onto_me/,1,12

659,UBI and Antiwork: Some thoughts on a controversial subject,"Summary at the bottom for those who want the gist of my essay.

Is UBI compatible with antiwork? This is an interminable debate within the antiwork community and for obvious reasons: if you go into a grocery store or a mall everything has a price tag. That price tag tells us how much we have to pay if we want to possess the item in order to consume it. 

The only means we have to purchase an item -- money -- is earned by selling our labor power to capital. Thus our work plays an essential role in securing the money we need to purchase the goods we need to live.

Antiwork proposes to upset this neat relationship between work and living by removing wage work. In so doing antiwork appears to remove the sole source of income we have to secure the goods we need to live. 

For many in the antiwork community the only way around this problem is for the state or some other authority to provide a universal income that is not tied to wage work, a UBI to cover basic needs that used to be covered by wages. The UBI idea is simple and easy to understand without a lot of convincing or sophisticated jargon because it fits neatly with our experience. 

Our experience is that our income is tied to the amount of labor time we provide to our employer. As we reduce the hours we provide to our employer, our wages should fall. If we work 40 hours, we get paid $200; but if we only work 20 hours, we should be paid only $100. This is how it works when we ask for time off and it seems like it should work that way for a general reduction of hours of labor as well. 

But does labor hours reduction really work this way? 

LESS WORK PAYS FOR ITSELF 

Labor power is a commodity and like any commodity it has a market price. If you sell less of it in the market, you will receive less income. But this is not the only effect. If you sell less of it, the supply drops. And what happens when the supply drops? The price of labor power rises, of course. 

The logic here is not particularly challenging. In 1973, many oil producers imposed an embargo on oil sales to protest the low price of oil. The price was artificially set by the imperialist countries agreeing to pay some very low price. The OPEC countries refused to sell at this price. The price of oil skyrocketed as a result of their embargo. By the time the embargo ended, the long standing regime of artificially low oil prices had collapsed.

Although it is unclear to many in the antiwork community, the antiwork movement acts on the labor market exactly like the OPEC embargo acted on the oil market. By reducing the availability of labor power for sale in the market, it raises the price the capitalists must pay for labor power. Within certain definite limits, reducing hours of labor pays for itself in higher hourly wages.

IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT WAGES RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE 

Although I think the above argument is ironclad, no one has ever been convinced by an economic argument. People are driven by emotions and there is no more potent emotion than fear in a public debate.

Advocates for an antiwork position can expect to be inundated with millions of tweets, reddit posts and Facebook messages about why any reduction of hours of labor must lead to millions starving in the streets. 

UBI may seem like an easy answer to the problem, but there is actually an easier one: raise the minimum wage to offset the wage impact of less work. 

A higher minimum wage is better because it is what everyone already expects to happen, although they may not realize it at first. People expect that if the minimum wage is aggressively increased, employment rates will fall. In this case, we have simply reversed the order: we reduced hours of labor first, then raised the minimum wage to compensate for the reduction. 

Second, raising the minimum wage, rather than UBI, attacks income inequality by aggressively raising the wages of the lowest paid workers upward toward the highest levels. 

Third, the minimum wage can be explicitly set at a level that ensures every wage worker, even the lowest paid, is paid multiple times the meager income that the census bureau defines as the poverty level.

Fourth, there's no question where the higher income of the workers comes from. By raising the minimum wage, profits fall. Income that once accrued to capital now accrues to the working class. We no longer need to follow the tax revenue from its putative sources to the pockets of the recipients of state handouts. Everything is transparent. 

UBI AND THE STATE 

Having said this, if UBI did not complicate the antiwork movement, no objection would be raised to it by me. But this is not the case. 

UBI heavily relies on the state, and its currency. It is, therefore, a national program, particular to a specific national territory and a more or less specific citizenry. Many in the antiwork community reject these attachments but have failed to explain how UBI can work in their antistatist framework. 

Many in the antiwork community also assume the state is more or less the ideal representative of capital against the wage workers. But UBI proposes the state directly assumes control over the basic subsistence of the working class population of a country. How can these two ideas be reconciled? Who would advocate to let their survival hang on the whims of their class enemies?

TL;dr 

1. People work because they need the money. UBI says it can fix this problem but it's not really a problem because less work causes wages to increase. 

2. If it were a problem, raising the minimum wage would be a better fix for a host of reasons I detail. 

3. UBI relies on the state to work and this is a big problem for people (anarchists/communists) who oppose the state.",False,clz4ic,commiejehu,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/clz4ic/ubi_and_antiwork_some_thoughts_on_a_controversial/,8,1

661,Work sucks.,"Just as the title says, work sucks!

For teens or young people in the audience who may be unfamiliar with the concept, ""work"" (aka ""a job"") is trading your time, skills, effort and ability in exchange for money, which can then be used for goods and services.

When you first get involved in work, it can be seductive. You become part of a ""team"", engaged in a common task, and the fact that you have to show up at a certain time and obey certain rules helps give you structure in your life. The money you earn can be certainly appealing.

However, work can also be a drag after awhile. It becomes increasingly intrusive when you discover that there are nearly infinitely better ways to use your extremely valuable time here on earth. I can't say what these things are, only you can answer that question. If your work contributes nothing positive to the earth, doing it may depress you. The money you make doesn't compensate for the icky feeling inside when you realize you're not doing right for other people and going nowhere in your own life. The money, too, is never enough. A $1,200/month rental in an apartment turn into a first house, which turns into a fixer upper which turns into a $370k house. The beat up piece of shit Honda turns into your second used car, which turns into signing a contract for some fucking vehicle for 60 months at 0.9% APR, Once you start spending it, you realize how inadequate it truly is. If you play this work game for long, it will feel like prison.

Indeed, for the vast majority of the worlds population, work is nothing more than slavery. They don't call it ""slavery"" of course because technically people are free to leave their jobs if they are unhappy. Once you have been in the workforce for awhile, you will probably start to desire something for a better job as your lifestyle changes. You end up in a cycle though of working more hours for other peoples interests. There's always a limit to the satisfaction you can achieve from it. That time could be better served pursuing your own interests, being creative, spending time with loved ones or whatever the fuck you want. I meet so many people in my life that go ""I wish I did this, I wish I could that, but blah blah blah blah...""

Even ""good"" careers like doctor or social worker can get you down after awhile. Turns out, almost every worker is a slave, if not to an economic system then to a government one where they are serving a bureaucracy more than the people they really want to help.

Ultimately, You may find that you have better uses for your time than any employer does and that your own intelligence is better served trying to make yourself money rather than trying to make a corporation richer. That's when you realize how much work really sucks! It's completely a drain and it should be avoided as much as possible.

If you need to do it, then do it. But just remember its only a fucking job, and you shouldn't give a flying fuck if that company lives or dies. You certainly shouldn't be doing more than the absolute minimum amount of effort, effort you spend elsewhere that could give you greater joy in your own life.

You can avoid work through a combination of extreme frugality and finding innovative ways to make money for yourself that involve very few compromises. Frugality may be painful, but certainly not as much as working long hours at a job you hate, just to pay for shit you don't need. Unfortunately I can't tell you the money making ideas, they are unique to your time, skills, abilities and you will have to find them on your own.

The ultimate goal is to spend more time doing meaningful things and less time working for some assholes that clearly don't give a shit about you. That, over time, is where your life has to lead.",False,clo1pw,Perpetual_Traveler,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/clo1pw/work_sucks/,1,25

664,There's undoubtedly a limit to a person's happiness and potential under capitalism,"I think this is the worst part of ""growing up"" and realizing the systemic pressures over us.

There's just no escape, I will always be subject to wage slavery, anxiety, social pressure, stress. No matter how much I relax, how many hobbies I try, how much I meditate, leave my hedonist and teen addictions behind, I will still be here, suffering, not being able to find any motivation in a system that kills my energy, my appetite, my will to go on, social relationships, etc. This is why individualistic solutions are problematic: they don't cut it, they aren't made for the majority, but for a little minority that can live off the labour of others, with loads of free time and money to spend (many hobbies are just off limits for the many).

Also, the mindset needed to ""change our lives"" is too difficult to find in a constant cycle of forced work and capitalist relaxation. It just dies off, succumbs to the unbearable patterns of modernity. And, worse of all, the ""gates to happiness"" like free time, creativity or relationships are scarce and filled with worries and commodity fetishism, commodification of human beings makes social existence harsh. It's not about being anymore, it's appearance, it's selling yourself as a commodity that others have to appreciate, in our delusion of narcissist depression.

How can people like ex-alcoholics move on amazes me. Stoicism does too, cynicism, drone-like waking up at 6:00AM everyday on 6 hours of sleep. How can people handle this and progress, and just not go crazy over the state of things? Is alienation so powerful? I find myself being alienated as hell too... video-games, Internet surfing, movies, sometimes porn... that's my ""free time"" well spent, and I'm still going on, but it's as hard as ever.

Then, let's look at the limits to education, even if you are in a country with affordable or free education, you still have to have gone to a good high school or be ""intelligent"" to pass the entry exams or courses, and then time is looming over you, because as soon as you begin working it all becomes hard as hell, grades dropping, attention span decreasing... Like with everything, education as a way to get a better life is also classist.

Not only alienation, but, how can anyone see this and think it is ok or a matter of personal choice? Are people shit? Most of the people I know would say that you failing exams or getting a bad job is your fault, like with your psychological problems, ""you are just too worried!"", ""stop complaining and enjoy!"", ""just talk to somebody"", etc. like it were so easy to change my state of mind and my life already. People think their environment and personal history have nothing to do with them, that they're just as free as everyone else and can change on a whim.

668,Fuck my manager who wants me to attend meetings during non office hours,"Rant alert  but I need to get this off my chest.

I work for an Indian IT outsourcing company and apparently the guys at the other end (USA) had tried to contact me during their Friday daytime (my Friday night time) to get some queries resolved.

They tried to call me to my office desk number and sent emails. I had no way of knowing any of this since I dont check my mails during non office hours.

Apparently they have also tried calling my team lead to his mobile number and he too was unreachable due to some reason.

My lead also received an angry mail from the guys who work for the company at USA from which we get the outsourced work with heck lot of guys in CC from both companies. Saying how negligent we are and not responding back to them in a timely manner.

He called me sometime back to tell me about it.

Apparently not checking mail and not picking the calls at midnight on a weekend is a big deal breaker. We're both on hook and have to attend a series of meetings on Monday to deal with this.

To all the asshole managers outsourcing their work :
