6,The boss that pushed me over the edge,"Hit your bowl and grab a snack, this is lengthy. 

I've always been vaguely aware of my exploitation, and, until now, have been able to grin and bear it. Not anymore. 

My degree is in the arts. After college, I took a few office admin jobs to pay the bills. And I was good! I was a busy little worker bee that seldom complained, worked diligently, met deadlines, and always took initiative. I was quite proud of my work ethic, but not a fan of the work. It was dull-- and I felt like I was paid too little to do so much nothing, if that makes sense. 

When I got sick, I had to find an alternative to the office day job. I spent too many breaks puking in the office bathroom.

I was able to find remote work through a staffing company that was offering much more than I currently made. It was contract work, but I was sure that the pros of working from home would outweigh the cons of paying self-employment taxes. (This is not a story about the horrors of gig work-- s can talk about that later.)

Eventually, after a couple months of working with this staffing company, they offered me a contract with their top client. It was an Executive Assistant role, and the client had enough money to pay top dollar, they told me. However, I had to complete a few weeks of work at a training rate with this client before we could renegotiate a rate. 

Well. During my first month of working with this client, while I am supposed to be training, he disappeared for a road trip on the other side of the planet. He spent the month traveling by motorbike, staying in expensive hotels and resorts, and eating exotic food. (This was all billed as a business expense somehow.)

I was put through the ringer during this month. He would Slack/WhatsApp me outside of my working hours. On one occasion, he called me, noticeably drunk, on a day I had requested off because I had family visiting, to give me a time sensitive task. When I told him that I would be taking the following day off to make up for the lost time, he proceeded to Slack/call me on THAT day as well. 

He gave me a slew of impossible tasks, and never seemed to be aware of the lengths I had to go to to make them possible. 

For example, he asked me to order his Mother's Day flowers for him-- at 9pm the evening before Mother's Day. To top it all off, he scolded me for not ""shopping local"" when he found out I had ordered from 1-800-FLOWERS-- the only florist that would take my order with the expectation of same day delivery. 

Ok, fucking ridiculous. I complain to the staffing company. They tell me that sometimes ""busy executive types"" don't understand the work that has to go into making these things a reality. Nice non-answer. Despite my better judgement, I forge ahead. 

He begins to ask crazy tasks of me-- to order flowers for a stranger in Switzerland. To call a ferryman in Azerbaijan. To check on a rural road closure in Turkmenistan. I speak none of these languages, have no contact info provided by him,  and have to purchase Skype minutes for all of these overseas phone calls, something that was NOT in my contract. To top it off, I was given about ~6-10 hour turnaround times for the bulk of these tasks. And, miraculously, I made them happen. 

I contact the staffing company again. This is getting out of hand, and I tell them that I'm going to ask for a high hourly rate. Don't worry, they say, it will be better when he's not traveling. (Um? I manage his calendar. I can see that he's nearly ALWAYS traveling.)

So he gets back from his trip, and he and the staffing company negotiate my rate, and come back to me with a number that is significantly-- SIGNIFICANTLY-- lower than I asked for, reasoning that I have proven to be a good PERSONAL assistant, but I haven't done anything to establish myself as an EXECUTIVE assistant. 

Again, against my better judgment, and with loved ones begging me to quit, I forged ahead. I put an emphasis on getting involved in my client's business, but the bulk of my portfolio was still personal assistance. And the unwieldy demands with zero appreciation continued. 

It was during this time that I started to notice my enthusiasm for work slipping dramatically. I quarter-assed everything I did, and I didn't give a single shit. The busy little worker bee was no more. He crushed her. 

On a particularly bad week, I was loaded up with projects. I wasn't making any headway with these dead-end projects. My client was NOT completing tasks on time (even after I implemented a new system), and I was getting an earful from project managers and the staffing company. 

So, fuck it. This job isn't going anywhere. And it's clear to me that the staffing company cares more about keeping this guy as a client than actually offering me any support. My contract doesn't require me to give two weeks notice, but I do anyway. (To which the staffing company referred as ""dropping a bombshell"". Excuse me? I've been complaining about this client for months.) 

I explain to the client that I'll finish up the projects I'm working on, but I won't be taking on any new projects. Guess what he does right away? Yes, gives me another project. I put it on the to-do list, say yessir, and I don't touch it. Fuck you.

The story ends with me giving him a half-assed ""I need medical leave"" in my exit interview. It's true, but I don't tell him that the leave is to recuperate from severe depression after months of his abuse. Not worth it. Fuck you, goodbye forever. 

Months. It takes me literal months to find passion for life again. And I felt completely robbed of any sense of a work ethic, which uses to be a huge part of my personality. I found myself bungling and half-assing jobs I actually did care about. It wasn't until I had the chance to step into a role in the arts-- the job I went to school for-- that I found the person he killed again. Aha! My life had purpose once again. 

I feel forever changed. I'll never be able to look at work or bosses the same way again. And it astounds me that so many Americans are living their lives that way, feeling unappreciated and alienated from their labor, and continuing on like that for years... How?

When I was debating whether or not to quit, I came up with this metric: 

A job can offer you three things: compensation, satisfaction, and ease. A job should AT LEAST offer you enough of one to compensate for a lack of the other two. If it lacks in all three, it is time to quit.

P.S. I have it on good authority that his new assistant makes the same complaints I made. Some people never learn. 

TL;DR My shitty boss's outrageous demands zapped me of any work ethic I had. The staffing company that placed me only cares about keeping him as a client. Work culture fucking SUCKS.

8,"Venting, venting, venting...","I am beyond mad. I just drove for over half a day and spent a week working full-time for a fairly well-known animal rights organization (to hell with it, it’s PETA) and was basically given the boot. It was a “working interview,” as they like to call it. They provided me with food (during my stay) and a house to sleep in, but that’s it. I had to pay for transportation and anywhere I stayed between travels. 

I did the assignments they gave me and interviewed with the higher-ups, but I had a bad feeling as soon as I left. I emailed my “boss” in a joking manner, basically explaining how I felt and trying to determine whether or not they were willing to train me for the job in spite of my “shortcomings,” and they said it sounded like I was withdrawing my application and that I should continue to support them and to keep looking. And they even had the audacity to say that the application process was an investment for them as much as it was for me. I’m not the one who invited me to do the interview and wasted my time and money. I was just stupid enough to think that anything would come of it. I replied back to the “boss” saying that I wasn’t withdrawing, but essentially that if they can’t see my worth then to hell with them. I wish that they cared about the people that they’re supposedly investing in as much as they claim to care for animals. I am a human being and I have worth too. Instead, I was treated as if I was trash. 

I don’t care about money, otherwise I wouldn’t have applied for the job, but I do care about my time. Time is not guaranteed and I applied for this job for that very reason. I want to spend my time on Earth doing something to benefit the world. Maybe PETA isn’t the place for that, especially considering their reputation. But I want to do something fulfilling in some way that pays the bills that I’m forced to pay. I’m fortunate enough that I could go for the whole week without sacrificing another job or income, but think of all of the other people that they’ve snubbed. Who thought that they had a chance and missed a week of work that they really couldn’t afford to miss. And it’s not as if I went into this with only a resume. I gave them references and they did a background check and I had a phone interview beforehand. I’m pissed at them for leading me on and at myself for being so stupid and naive.

I never really worked. Ever since highschol i stayed at home doing nothing but playing games whole day.

It seems in this place is when there are no orders thats your break lol. There are 3 people in kitchen. I dont see why we cant rotate and let 1 go have 30 min break while others 2 work and so on. Just bullshit.

When there are no orders, im hoping that nobody orders anything for at least 15-20 min so i can chill.

32,"If anyone tells me I’m not suited for a typical work environment, I don’t think that’s a bad thing. Just because I would prefer a happier environment doesn’t mean I lack talent. Mister Rogers agrees.","In lots of toxic and unhealthy work environments that is thrown around a lot. They put a certain pressure on fitting in. Living up to the potential. Being perfectly suited for it, and implying that you are a loser if you’re not.

Unfortunately I haven’t heard of many nice work environments. Out of all the people I know, I can’t even tell you one. The problem isn’t the job itself. Different careers could be really cool and incredibly rewarding. The problem is the work environment that turns a really cool career into a mentally unhealthy work environment where the hours and demand for lack of input could drive anyone insane.

So, we studied in college, wrote papers clearly stating our own ideas to join a job where we have to conform and rarely have our own ideas acknowledged? For most of our school life we were constantly asked what our ideas were. Shit on school all you want, but they trained us to be bosses not employees. Or, in the very least, not employees that only followed orders without truly contributing to our job in a way that mentally satisfies us.

Of course, there are some exceptions depending on what field you’re in. But, you get what I mean.

To be honest, I thought I was crazy until I heard that Mister Rogers felt the same way. I heard Mister Rogers had a job where people treated him horribly, and he never forgot that. 

I’m sure most of the people who belong to the subreddit have the same feeling – being incredibly happy to be an adult, only to be disappointed with how awful every day work environments are. Mister Rogers made his dream career happen. Sometimes when your preferred environment doesn’t exist, you have to create it for yourself.

34,Capitalism is created by the rich for the rich,"A local restaurant in my neighbor hood that I used to patronize just raised prices for its entire menu by 2 times to cater towards rich customers. It is just sad that it ended up this way. The restaurant had its humble beginnings and initially, started its business by serving tasty meals at an affordable price for the common working class. Over the years it has build a solid reputation by earning the trust and loyalty from its customers. It is common to see long queues during breakfast, lunch and dinner. Everyone was willing to spend time queuing for the meal and no one is complaining about the waiting time. 

Eventually all the buzz surrounding the restaurant started to attract the attention of people with too much cash to throw around. They started to get their meals from the restaurant and it is obvious that they enjoyed what they ate.But apparently these people didn't want to spend their time waiting for a spot in the restaurant. Since well, you know they are rich.

To solve their issue, they decide to strike a deal with the owner - they are willing to pay twice the amount to avoid the long queue. So now the restaurants serves these rich folks and everyone else is left with nothing. This deal is a betrayal of all the loyal customers that have help built up the restaurant's brand and reputation. 

This is how capitalism works. Businesses catering only to the people with money. Can you imagine what will happen essential services such as healthcare gets privatized? They would turn down all everyone who cannot afford to pay. Yet somehow capitalist love criticizing how the government shouldn't get involved in businesses. Leave the free market and society alone alone, they say. Yeah, I wonder what would happen it a 100% free market world?

35,I love my job but I’m antiwork,"I have a job that I really enjoy. I’m a rigging grip for the entertainment industry. I enjoy union protection and absolutely adore my union. I love climbing on shit and driving big machines and playing with power tools. No one tells me what to do or how to act. I don’t see any other job where I could make what I do and have as much fun as I do. 
That being said. It’s fucking bullshit that I have to exchange labor for money at all. And I think of all the non-union folks who work harder than me for less and it drives me up the wall. I suffer from multiple injuries and just this past Thursday my buddy fell through a set roof about 13 feet onto the concrete. He is going to be okay but his number one concern laying on the ground was the fact that he was going to miss out on work and he needs money. It’s so goddamn unfair to him and to everyone else in that position. 
I am so glad that I like doing my job because doing something I hate for cash would be soul-crushing. But I can’t do this forever.

37,Mom kinda realizes she’s anti work,"
I noticed lately that my mom has been less and less enthusiastic about work, she recently was able to get an office job paying double what she made before and even works in some overtime, after working for over 25 years of low paying menial jobs, I was really excited for her as it meant that she wouldn’t have to work as hard as before (kitchen and adult daycare before that). Though told me not too long ago that she’s tired, of working and doing everything over and over, she definitely did not like her job before and I don’t think she hates this one either but she’s come to realize that work truly isn’t end all be all. She would’ve eventually reached this spot (financially) after maybe another half a decade of slaving away but a sprinkle of nepotism and good charisma really was all that was needed instead. She grew up in a country with worse wages and standard of living so maybe those changes were what held her together for so long, or maybe keeping me and my sibling fed. I just think that it’s insane and I really respect her for putting up with it for so long. I was truly blinded by her conviction to wake up at 4:30 everyday and go work 8 hours and then pick up us from school and cook and clean and mom, I stupidly never saw her as someone who could get tired down by anything.

My dad on the other hand has always been his own boss and even though he stresses about money, more so than my mom, he genuinely likes work, he’s a mechanic and a truck driver and the times when he’s not interacting with customers or talking to his friends on the phone while driving, he spends doing problem solving and/or calling me to ask me about my current views on the subject of the week. 

Two sides of the same coin, both have worked forever with no end in sight. Though maybe one better off than the other?

I want to talk to her about it more but when I told her jokingly that I didn’t want to work ever and that I probably wouldn’t have kids she got after me a bit. I’m on my third year of college studying for engineering bc I genuinely thought that I could be like like Lewis from meet the Robinson’s, make inventions and live of the profit, but it’s more like, be a drone and work and invest into a 401k and then you die like everyone else but maybe your casket is a lil nicer. I love the learning bit of school but when everyone starts going on about career fairs and internships my brain shuts off. That might be the impostor syndrome but I’d prefer to work alongside my dad as long as he can stand my fuckups and stay in school forever than anything else. Don’t know, sorry this was supposed to be about my mom but It just all poured out while I was browsing the Reddits instead of working on my solids hw for tomorrow. 

I like coming on here bc of the human aspect of the posts you guys write, I can relate to a lot of what y’all say and I wanted to put a bit of my thoughts into words. Helpfully I can convince my mom become anti work and we can help usurp our overlords together lol

41,"Quit, walked all the way home ..","I'm somewhat new to Reddit, a little bit older, and love that I found this sub. I plan to post more, but just thought I would relay kind of a funny story. 

Several years ago when I was still trying to do the marketing and communication job thing, I interviewed for a corporate communications consultant position downtown that paid 60 K. I thought the interview was so horrible, I was sweating and uncomfortable and not exactly qualified… I ended up getting the job, ""they loved me"" and I was simply so excited to have gotten a job paying this money, I accepted it. At the time I was working as a health care admin asst. It's a lot easier to say sure I will take this job then to actually do it! 

So many things about it felt uncomfortable to me:

- My boss trying to be so buddy buddy and mentor to me, almost trying to force my passion for the role (I'm kinda just here to work, lady..)
- I didn't understand/care about the actual product (energy/electricity) 
- I had no motivation to contribute to anything actually part of the job description and realized I didn't even have the skills! 
- I have nothing in common with my desk neighbors and felt socially weird 
- uncomfortable one on one meetings and team lunches to meet everyone 
- taking the bus downtown 
- wearing biz clothes 
- working downtown milling around with other corporate people
- realizing I am not mentally able to handle this job and I am far under qualified (even tho my resume and interview got me in) 
- I felt like such a fake, fraud.. coming in hating it all 

I lasted a week. 

One day I was riding the bus in and I started to feel nauseous, anxious - I got off a block from the office and I just turned around and walked all the way home. I stopped for a bagel. I felt such a weight off. 

I emailed my boss and said sorry this won't work out and I never responded back. 

I didn't mean to screw anyone over but it's not like they invested much time in me. This is one of many many situations I've gone through to try to figure out what I want and what I can handle in the world of work (which I hate, which is why I'm here...). I no longer apply for marketing and comm jobs which was my ""career"" I guess.

42,on exit strategies,"
you're going to a place you hate. a place you wouldn't go unless you had a gun to your head. almosy every day you find yourself there. ready to perform mindless tasks set out by someone higher up on the ladder.

you are at work.

capitalism has dug itself in extremely well and if you want to escape the system, it is going to be difficult. it wouldn't bode well for any system if people could opt out of it easily. if everyone could get out it would set a bad example. more and more would leave and soon the system would become unstable and eventually collapse. the ones at the top can't let that happen. they like eating cake too much.

i've seen comments around leaving or quitting the race. an exit strategy. we think of exiting as something that we can do easily. quit our jobs and just say fuck it. i have similar ambitions but as i sit here looking at my notes on quitting and exit strategies this isn't something that happens overnight. it is something that you have to plan for and even then it isn't an easy task.

is it possible to leave the system? 

i did a quick search and most of the exit strategy articles i saw are based upon (not surprisingly) the idea of finding another job. the idea seems to be to go to a lesser evil instead of no evil. perhaps in 2 years time you will once again head to a search engine for another exit strategy.

to stop playing the capitalist game is near impossible. not only because we have become accustomed to the comforts it provides us but because the system makes it difficult to function without money. almost everything is tied into you working and by proxy money. we pay rent. we buy food. we pay for health insurance. we pay for gas to drive to work. we buy a ticket for the bus or train. we buy clothes. pay for utilities. living costs money.

add to this the idea that your worth in society is tied to what you do and how much material stuff you have. clothes, car, house, cellphone. how many trips you take to exotic places. all of these things have become a more competent indicator of who you are as a person. what you have gives you more gravitas in society.

thus we that see it becomes increasingly difficult to leave the system.

having a skill to barter with is something to consider when thinking about an exit strategy. it could be used to earn a place to live, food to eat. skills will be a valuable currency as soon as money holds no more power over us. once more people move away from capitalism, skill sharing could be a different form of currency.

an alternative that i have given some thought is a farming type community where you would work and earn your keep by means of labour. this is similar to what we have at this point but i feel it carries less risk of exploitation with it. like minded groups of people working towards a similar goal is better than working for a faceless corporation that only cares about bottom lines and quarterly results. in communities like this you get to deal with people instead of CEO's and HR.

before the appearance of money this was the type system that people used to survive. returning to it might not be such a bad idea. co-operating instead of serving. people instead of profits.",False,f9rcqz,lovebrunettes,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f9rcqz/on_exit_strategies/,20,1

50,My job totally fucked me,"Few weeks back I received another job offer for significantly more money ($12,000 more a year). I told my current job about it because they asked why when I put in my 2 weeks, and they offered me $10,000 more to stay. It was a little less than the other job offered me but the other job would be a bit stressful, and the current job promised me no change in responsibility.

It’s worth mentioning that I was going to be relocating for the other job, as my lease was ending and I had an apartment lined up closer to the new job. When I received the counter offer I found a different, slightly more expensive apartment still in my current area.

Current job involved a lot of driving that was reimbursed by the company. So at my bosses advice, after receiving the raise I purchased a new vehicle that gets better MPG than my other vehicle, so I could pocket some of the reimbursement to further increase the job’s profitability.

It’s been 2 weeks since I got the raise and I found out they have been quietly training my replacement. When I asked my boss about it this morning, he let me go. Fuck them.

55,The system is self reinforcing.,"People want to reinforce their beliefs, which is one of the good psychological tricks of society. We want other people to validate our behavior, so we subconsciously search for things which mirror our attitudes, beliefs, and values. This is why a hard worker who has worked their whole life for money cannot agree that no work is a viable idea. It would go against the values that they have spent their entire life slaving away to get. 

For them to agree that no work is okay would be an instant blow to everything they know, and would immediately compromise their value structure. When a persons fundamental beliefs are compromised, it causes an incredible amount of dissonance. Most times, it is FAR MORE PREFERABLE to abandon the new idea in favor of going with what we already know because adopting a new fundamental value means that we have to restructure our entire internal hierarchy of values. . Whole lives are built around working for the sole purpose of financial gain. 

So, for every person who slaves day in day out at work, they become crabs in a bucket. The phrase misery loves company is real in this sense, because while they may hate their jobs, they do not want anti workers to come along and make them aware that they may be doing something they hate for what we claim is no good reason. The system's majority reinforces our cultural traditions.

56,The last company I worked at,"Just want to share a story about the last day I ever spent at a company.

After I finished university I tried to get a job in the country and city my now wife lives in. God. It was the only time I ever tried to actually get a job. So well. The first month they didn't care about me at all. Gave me no tasks. Nothing. The second month they let me write guides with no end despite me having applied to be a server admin. Then they complained that I am not trying to integrate into the group. Yeah. Because that's so easy when they leave me alone with a solo task like writing guides. Not like the others made attempts to talk with me either. Furthermore they complained about me not giving them enough input about how to do tasks better. In my first month ... sure. Just let me go there and instantly complain about how everybody else is doing their job wrong while ... writing guides and having no idea what they want to begin with I guess? The only few times I mentioned something I was shot down anyways.

This job was my sole opportunity to stay with my then girlfriend. I needed a visa. So I wanted it. When they told me they wont take me these assholes had the audacity to get me into a conversation where they wanted to ""help me"" so I dont make the ""same mistakes"" in the next company ... jesus fucking christ. I just wanted to get out of there. I dont need the advice of fucking assholes. The manager there who gave me tasks didnt even have the balls to join.that conversation because he had such an.important phone call ... yeah sure. And thats also the reason.why he didnt join half way through after he finished I guess?

Because they were so ""nice"" to help me I wasnt able to take it anymore. I burst into tears there, seeing my life ending, incapable of staying in the same country and city as my girlfriend. They even had the balls to tell me that all the companies in this city talk with each other and I probably wont get another chance if I act so ""unprofessional"" there. Jesus. Can you be any more of a giant dick?

When I handed them back their stupid keycard I told them what they did to me in their hunt for profit and sheer ignorance. The boss daughter who weirdly enough has a managing position in that company just said - in an attempt to justify their actions - ""But that's not our fault!"" I left with a ""You tell yourself that.""

That was the last time I ever dealt with a company. It was the last straw which pushed me over the edge, having had the antiwork mindset ever since middle school. Fortunately I was in a position to change things. I expanded a freelance contract I still had from my.university time. Now I make three times as much as they paid me while working 8 hours less each week and without having to spend 10 hours of my freetime to commute every week. To stay in the country I married my girlfriend.

59,Mass Unionization and the Group Hug Protocol,"**I'm CEO of a nonprofit (cause** ***fuck*** **profit) govtech startup called Ouro that is building a decentralized labor union and labor unionization platform.** We're launching in Appalachia (I'm a trans commie from BFE Ohio, funnily enough.) at the end of April with the goal of making it possible to unionize any business while protecting the workers from retaliation. Any business with two or more employees can unionize, even in Right to Work states. Our platform works by providing anonymity; users will submit contact info (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, cell #, email) for their coworkers, who will then receive information on unionization in general and a link to a digital union authorization card. If 30% of the employees at a business sign these cards, the National Labor Relations Board puts the matter of unionization to a vote of all employees. During the period between signing the cards and the elections, the company to be unionized and Ouro are both allowed to wage propaganda campaigns. If a majority of employees vote ""yes"", the business is unionized and our platform will enable collective bargaining in as democratic a way as is possible. We aim to have dues paid by the business itself and will finance the startup's operation through a benefit fund built out of these dues. The startup operates to build neoliberal market solutions to systematic oppression while legislation catches up to reason.  


**I'm a student at Lambda School.** Can you see where this is going?   


Earlier this week, in response to [this article](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21131848/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-isa-tuition-cost-free), a bunch of students started talking about their experiences in the school and contributing to a collective exploration of the general phenomenology of being an individual that's gone through the program. Things seem pretty fucking bleak for us, tbqh. The lot of us have problems with mental illness and all the classic symptoms of poverty in general besides that. As a result of our perceptions as to how Lambda School really works, the prevailing opinion is that our education is the functional equivalent of a crypto pump and dump. Not only that, Lambda School extracts a lot of revenue from student teachers that they're underpaying. It's this weird thing where they tell you that you're worth $50k+ out of the company and then they don't pay the students in their near-graduate program doing most of the actual teaching @ Lambda School anything near that. It's surreal that they think that nobody is gonna notice. I noticed it the first week and it **IMMEDIATELY** *pissed me off.*   


I went ahead and decided to be brave and contributed the linked (I think they're links at least) posts on the Slack. It took me six hours to write the post (I'm a slow writer) and 32 minutes for them to take them down. In that time we got ***11 total responses - 10 team leaders, 1 salaried teacher, 4 POC aka 3% of their staff .*** My team and I are fucking proud of those numbers and think that that it's time we **#UnionizeLambdaSchool**. The school censoring me and refusing to engage with my points at all has only radicalized me. Go figure.   


I'm going to be making a series of posts on this sub over the next few weeks so as to introduce our plans and to interact with this community in general. The movement to abolish work as an intrinsic part of life is an essential part of any humanist's (and we're ALL transhumanists on top of that)  endeavor. We are very glad to have found a community that we know is going to appreciate the product that we're making. In fact, we're probably gonna do a beta test through this subreddit, now that I think about it. We aim to be as aggressive as is possible to get as many unions formed as possible and it all starts with building a community.   


Please ***discuss*** everything in detail. Ask any questions. Make any suggestions. I literally cannot do enough writing on this, as the practical implementation of the Group Hug strategy is rather complex. I hope you all have a great evening. Talk to you tomorrow ;)

68,The only reason you feel like a loser when you're unemployed is because the system tells you that you are one,"People want to find a meaning or purpose in their life. That doesn't mean they live to work. 

However the system keeps pounding it into your head that your purpose is to work and if you don't you're a loser and that there's something wrong with you.

Don't be fooled. There are a lot of rich people out there who don't really have a proper job. They hold onto a bunch of assets/investments that generates income via interest/dividends/capital gains etc. Maybe they bought it at the right time. Maybe they inherited it. who know?  However the point is they will get more money passively in one month without having to do anything than you will get wageslaving in a year. 

Do they feel sad they they don't have a 9-5 job? Not really. They have a constant flow of income coming in so why would they need to. If they want to do something in life, they easily can because they got the money to do so. 

A poor unemployed person wasting all his time going to clubs, bars and other places for entertainment is probably called an deadbeat alcohol waste of skin. A rich unemployed person going to social events etc is called a socialite which doesn't have the same negative connotation.

So just remember that its the system that pounds in your head that you need to be employed 9-5 to not be a loser. Its your duty to wageslave so the guys on top can take all the beenfits.

It makes me even more depressed and I sometimes cry myself to sleep because of it. My dad thinks I’m a failure because I don’t have a job. He tells me to go work at a fast food place but that’s one of the worst places for someone to work with social anxiety. I would just be a wreck the entire time. Other family members and people I know think I’m just lazy and dumb. We are all on different paths in life. Not everyone goes to college/unit and/or works. I feel like i’m trapped in somebody else’s master plan - go to school, get a job, get a mortgage. All we’re really do is dying. My sister constantly tells me to just get a job but fuck she works from 7 to 5 Monday to Friday and honestly, who has the better life? She doesn’t even live a life. Being cramped up in an office for most of the day only to go home to be too tired to do anything. The thought of going to work for the rest of my days and only enjoying a small amount of my life makes me miserable and want to kill myself. I think suicide is the only option at this point. I’d rather be dead than live a boring life that’s grey, bland and fake. Flavourless. There is no point in life other than school, work then retiring. We only have one life, we should enjoy it to the fullest. Not worry about when our next pay check is or whether we’ll have enough money to feed ourselves and our children. We are slaves built to distress ourselves over when our next pay check will be to pay off our debts. We are nothing more than products. We live to pay our bills until we die,
it’s a mundane existence.

I'm done working for corporations that expect me to travel during weather emergencies because my work is worth more than I am.

Maybe I'm being a baby or overreacting or just being plain ignorant, but this last termination was my wake-up call. I will never be worth anything to anyone other than myself and my family. If a corporation can fire me for having the audacity to be sick, they can fire me for anything. I am not paying another fucking cent into the pockets of rich CEOs who couldn't care less about those they enslave. Work is slavery. Work is punishment for those who aren't born into wealth. Work is a way to keep every one of us too tired, too strung out, too miserable to fight back. Well, I'm done. I'm going to find my own way. Fuck a career. Fuck a job.

I work as a job coach for people with disabilities. I live in an ""employment first"" state, which pretty much says that there is a job for everyone that wants one, even for those with severe disabilities. The thinking behind it is that these are the people that society has left behind, and they are already living off of social security, but it may not be enough to survive off of, so they get jobs. Now, these jobs are mostly menial and extremely repetitive. Most of the people I support really like their jobs and are excited to be out of their houses, but it's so fucking sad to me to see how meaningless their jobs are and seeing them slave away at these places. One client works at the big ""A"" corp, and I absolutely loathe going there to help him. I like working in social services because I'm not really making a profit for anyone and get paid through the state for my work, but it still feels so soul crushing to see what my clients have to do and that I'm supporting them doing it.

110,Thank you Henry Ford,"As I just read up a bit about the history of our usual working hours I found one culprit: Henry Ford is the reason for the 8 hour workday. But actually not even in a bad way. 

He was the first one who managed it to reduce the work day hours of modern times, as up until he started his company people were working 14 - 16 hours. His workers also only worked 5 days a week instead of 6 and earned twice as much as the minimum wage back in the days.

Here is a source: [https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ford-factory-workers-get-40-hour-week](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ford-factory-workers-get-40-hour-week)

&gt; “It is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either ‘lost time’ or a class privilege.” 

So for the time back then it was progress in the right direction.

Unfortunately nowadays companies kind of stopped what Ford started and are moving backwards again with overwork and so on. I guess with nowadays technology somebody like Ford would reduce hours even more and would be on the forefront of companies trying to push for a 5 hour workday.

Stuff like that is very important for us I think. We don't need extreme positions like abolishment of all capitalism, but people in powerful positions who see the benefit of what we are striving for: More free time which makes us happier and allows us to have an actual life and a minimum wage which lets us stop worrying about surviving (with the ideal of course being guaranteed income so we only really need to work when we want to finanze our hobbies).

Fortunately some companies are already trying: [https://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/the-5-hour-workday-how-to-increase-productivity-by-working-fewer-hours.html](https://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/the-5-hour-workday-how-to-increase-productivity-by-working-fewer-hours.html)

I was wrong. Apparently the background check company is calling all the places I ever worked at and grilling them about my salary, reason for leaving, nitpicky job duties, and whether I'm eligible for rehire.

And they're checking my credit and driving history too, and forcing me to take a drug screen.

How is almost any of this their buisness, especially my salary, driving history, credit, or drug use? Luckily I don't do drugs but apparently I'd be disqualified if I did weed recreationally even though that doesn't affect my job. 

I might get disqualified from this internship because I left a past job a month in without notice because I hated it, and I fluffed a job duty for one company.

140,Ways to escape,"I'm done with the working life and looking for alternatives. So far I've come up with the list below. I'm curious to see what others have come up with. 

-	**Live on the road** I live in Europe and I could easily jump on my bicycle and just leave. I have supplies to live in the wild and some money to keep me fed etcetera. To keep costs to a minimum so I can spend as much time away as possible, I could do some wwoofing and the like. This would get me away from what's bothering me and it'd offer me useful experience in the process. With funds being limited though, chances are my getaway would be shortlived. 
-	**Join a commune** I could try and join an intentional commune or the like. This offers a more long term solution that's also fairly risk free compared to other options. Downside is (the suspected) lack of individual freedom since there's always the commune counting on me doing my part. Also it's probably rather hit or miss when it comes to being able to bond with the people I'd be joining. 
-	**Homesteading** Though I have no knowledge of things like farming and preserving food, I'm charmed by the idea of self sufficiency and the philosohy of permaculture. I'd need money and other people to get this off the ground and basically start a commune myself. I'd also have a lot to learn. This seems rather hard to accomplish. 
-	**Illegalism** Before I let myself get sucked into this wage slavery hell, I made a living operating outside of the law. I enjoyed the sense of freedom, while the tension and uncertainties could be stressful. A risk with this type of crime is that one could easily get preoccupied with money and materialism. Also, while it disconnects one from one of the most ugly parts of life as we're expected to lead it (work), it is still embedded in the same society with all its flaws. 
-	**Join Rojava** Or something similar. I haven't investegated this that well, mostly because I'm afraid I'd be more of a nuisance than a help. I consoder it an option nevertheless. 
-	**Career switch** I could look for work that erases the most dreadful aspects of working life, preferably something in nature, or something in line with my views like an organization, or helping others. This would require schooling though, which is a costly matter in money as well as time.",False,faulmw,PoorHighClass,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/faulmw/ways_to_escape/,7,1

159,I work for a non-profit; it’s fucking awesome.,"Thought y’all might appreciate a positive story! 

I’m a victim’s advocate for domestic violence, human trafficking, stalking, sexual assault. I do things like safety planning, meeting victims at the hospital, finding shelter for them, crisis intervention, going to court with them, accompany them to police interviews and keep the cops in check, among many other things. My jobs in the past were pre-K teacher, car sales, car repair, behavioral health tech, and managing various restaurants/cafes. 

Here are a few things I’ve never experienced with any other job:

-They give us a paid ‘mental health day’ monthly, and even offer training on self care.

-I have never once been pressured into working, or guilt-tripped while sick; when I’ve offered to work from home, my supervisor says ‘just take care of yourself, please don’t work!’ 

-I’m a new employee (4-5 months) and began earning leave after 30 days, not 90-180 as in the past (or none at all/food service). I’ve never had to take an unpaid sick day.

-We have monthly meetings that are just advocates, no supervisors, and we can vent to each other about cases. The meetings are just for our benefit, and I look forward to them.

-My supervisor is only in my office once a week; and she’s cool. They trust me and just let me do my thing with almost 0 monitoring. They’re always available to help me when I need it, and aren’t up my ass at all when I don’t.

-They pay $0.58 per mile for any driving. This is at least double what I’ve been paid in the past, if at all. 

-We’re assigned a book about social justice/change, and during our staff meetings we discuss this literature.

We’re a tiny non profit and, surprise, treated immensely better than any corporation I’ve had the displeasure of working for.

This is not an easy job with really high burnout/turnover; but I feel truly appreciated and respected. 

Can you imagine what our society would be like if this was commonplace treatment of employees?!

169,Seriously needed advice ASAP: quitting vs staying,"Hi all, I have found myself tangled in a horrid predicament. I hope I can find some advice here from people who could possibly understand how I feel rather than assume I’m being lazy 

I am a shift runner at a large food delivery franchise. I’ve worked there for 1 1/2 years, and I used to love it. Used to. 

Started out as a delivery driver, got trained up inside, got promoted August 2019, so I’ve been a bottom line manager for 6 months now. 

I hate it so much. 

It’s horrible. I work 45-55 hours a week. I’m tired and the hours are insanely unsociable. I’m sad and have no free time. The work sucks. It’s stressful and the food prep we use genuinely triggers painful allergic reactions on my hands. My store manager and above keep demanding more and more and more and I can’t provide. I’m not good enough and it’s so STRESSFUL I can’t even enjoy my free time anymore. I have this overwhelming sense of dread whenever work time looms or is happening. 

Thing is, I’m sort of... set there. If I leave, i will owe them £600ish for a training course I took last August (you need to stay at minimum a year for the course to not need repaying, &amp; yes, I stupidly signed agreeing to this). I have all my holiday for 2020 booked, which gives me 1 weekend in March off, 1 week off in April, 1 week of in May, and 11 days off in June, which is an awful lot of holiday I may not be able to score somewhere else. I also earn more money there than I would elsewhere probably, given that being a manager means I earn just under £3 above my age’s national minimum wage. 

Additionally, I am planning to actually 100% leave in August... when I became a manager I told the higher ups it was on the condition I could leave for university without owing them a thing... which is what also makes me hesitant. August 2020 is a little over 5 months away, which isn’t that far off. my family and most of my friends all thing I should grit my teeth and stick it out until then. 

Thing is, I hate it. So so so so so much. I am stressing so bad, I can’t sleep properly, I don’t have proper eating habits, I’m beginning to have dental problems from teeth clenching/grinding, I scratch myself stupid (a bad habit of mine that increases with stress and anxiety) and bite my nails and cut myself occasionally too. I feel sad and depressed and I cry a lot and feel so terrible. But logically I really shouldn’t leave. Emotionally I should get the fuck outta dodge. 

My only other option would be to drop down to part time and this job, then work elsewhere I enjoy at the same time. Thing is, it’s difficult to be a part time manager, and I doubt I’d be permitted to do so. I think they’d try to persuade me to either take a demotion (not interested), move to a different store location (not interested), or stay full time (fuck). 

Is it worth the risk of being broke for a while? I’m not in any debt, and have a small (£1-2k or so) in savings, so even if I don’t have a job for a month or two, or get a lower paying one, I could stay afloat. The idea of working as I am was to have some money saved up for uni, as I won’t be getting much family help when I go away... 

Help. I need to talk to my area manager tomorrow. My plan is to say, essentially, let me cut myself down to part time or I leave in March/April... but is that really my best move? 

I also feel slightly guilty for leaving my store in the lurch... but also, store manager is a bit of a dick, so those feelings of guilt aren’t as strong as they were a few months ago

177,"Not sure if this is right sub to share my frustrations, but my full time job is wearing on me and I hate it.","At the beginning of the year I accepted a full time position at a community college on the administration side. At almost 30, it's actually my first ""full time job,"" as previously I had worked part time at that college and another one as a writing and math tutor, and was also a musician making some money playing gigs and giving lessons. I was working roughly 30-35 hours a week altogether during semesters, which felt like a lot but I enjoyed it. I'd practically have all summer off from tutoring which was nice, but I didn't get paid - that's the only reason I took the full time job is because I needed to make more money.

Well, the money is nice, and the job itself isn't bad, but the sheer 40 hour grind week after week is becoming unbearable. I'm trying to maintain my social life, but it's at the expense of my getting gigs and working in music. Since I also have a 45ish minute commute, I feel like I only have enough time to get home, have dinner, unwind, *maybe* practice for 30 minutes or so, and then go to bed. Rinse and repeat. I'm literally sitting in my office now with numerous ""busy work"" I'm supposed to do but I' burned out on doing it cause I was here all day yesterday and the day before that. This sucks!

I often think about other careers I could do...get into engineering, information tech, teaching high-school or college...but they all lead to the same path of working full time for another 30+ years. I wouldn't say I'm ""anti-work""...I enjoy working, but I need a balance in my life, and I believe a 40+ hour work week is simply not a balance. Little changes in my specific job *could* make things a lot better, like having Fridays off, getting off work at 2:00 or 3:00 everyday instead of 5:00, having the Summers completely off...but that doesn't seem to be possible with this job or the vast majority of others.

misery in terms of 40 hour work week by paper in depression
[-l-red-ataxia 145 points 1 year ago""

You and me, I think we're the exact fucking same.

T have an hour long commune. I have to wake up at 5 am, leave at 6 am, and be in by 7. I leave at 3 pm, and make it
home at 4. I have to go to bed at 9 pm in order to wake up the next day not feeling like tired shit because the human
body is a disgusting efficient thing.

The instant I get home at 4:30 pm, my mind goes into time mode. I start counting the hours, the minutes,
sometimes even the seconds. I have exactly four and a half hours to do things I want to do before I have to go back to
the slow the next day. I need to cream that time with as much of the things I want to do as possible.

By weekend are the same. I wake up, and I start counting. Saturdays are less of a problem usually because I can
wake up when I want and go to sleep whenever I want, but it's still there casting a shadow over everything. I get one
day. One day out of seven where I don't feel stressed about waking up when I have to and sleeping when I have to.
And when Saturday starts, I have twelve or fourteen or sixteen hours before Sunday. When Sunday starts, I have until
9 pm until my weekend is over.

When the forty-hour work week starts to get to you like it does to me, you start feeling stifled for time, and the
paycheck you receive starts feeling worthless, because it's not like you can use that money to buy the time back.

His is your life, ending one hour, one minute, one second at a time, for forty hours a week. Maybe even more.

Of anyone asks you out, whether it's your of or your friends, your parents, anyone, even if your relationships with
them are happy and healthy, your brain can't help but make an automatic calculation. Now much of my time will this
take? Now much will I have left until I have to go back to work? And when even the slightest thing goes wrong--if you
forgot to get something at the store, if there's traffic, if someone makes a mistake and costs you more time, you start
to resent it. You resent that delay, and the people who caused that delay, for wasting the precious free time you have,
and every hour, every minute, every second that slips away is time that you don't get to spend doing the things you
want to do.

Things you used to enjoy no longer provide the same fulfillment, because you can't stop that clock. You can’t stop
counting the hours, the minutes, the seconds. Even if you're enjoying yourself, even if you're having a blast and
accomplishing a lot, even if at the end of the day you feel like a champion who is closer to your dream, that shadow is
there, telling you that you only have this many hours, this many minutes, this many seconds left until you go back.
Like a guillotined slowly itching its way towards your neck. And when you're having fun, that realization causes you to
get jerked back into the real world.

Key, pucker. Have a good time? I hope you did, because it's another forty hours until you can even start to get it back.
Now start lifting, jackets. Your life doesn't become yours until we say it does.

By job doesn't suck. The work is nothing special, if a little firing, but it's not murdering me. I work at a good
company, my co workers are good people, my boss is a pretty understanding guy who always tries to be fair and helps
out whenever he can. By pay isn't anything cellar but it's liable, and some people would envy having it ($20 an
hour).

But I get the sense that I'd feel like this with the vast majority of work. Forty hour work weeks, no matter what, get
tedious, become meaningless, burn me out. The only way I can avoid it is to not work a day in my life--to do a job
that I love. But how many people get jobs they love? Now many people get paid liable wages, enough to have a
room and food, doing what they love? Now many people even know what it is that they love to even pursue it in the
first place?

The fact that the starving artist is a running joke in America--someone going hungry trying to do what they love--is
the cruel reality. And the fact that we're okay with it and point and laugh with everyone else, even face laughter, is the
crudest reality imaginable.

You want to do what you love? Luck you. That's not how the real fucking world works, shitheel. Now hop to it, you've
got forty hours of work to do, and if you want to fucking eat, you better fucking do it.

I'm reminded of that movie In Time, starring Austin Timberlake. It's a movie about a dystopian future where money
has no more meaning, and people trade time. A coffee might cost thirty seconds, a cab fare might cost two minutes, a
high quality mountain bicycle might be four months, a new sedan might be nine years.

There's a watch everyone has embedded in their arm that tells them how much time they have, and when the number
reaches zero, they die. Some people have hundreds of years of time. Some people live minute to minute.

That's what I feel like. That some people have the rest of their lives to look forward to, with their 90 years of time, and
here I am, scraping by with only a few hours on my clock every day before the clock hits zero and I die.

And in America, you can't talk to anyone about it. Nobody at all. Not really. Because even if some individual people
might sympathize and wish they had less working hours alongside you, society will think of you as a lazy piece of shit
who just wants to much off of others. All because you're not willing to surrender forty hours a week, one hundred and
sixty hours a month, one thousand nine hundred and twenty hours a year for a paycheck. And you have to convince
yourself that you need this paycheck, that you need this money in order to not get tucked in the ass by taxes and

bills. You try, you try so hard to justify it. You need this money. You need to give up these forty hours to live. His is
necessary. You try.

But it doesn't work. Not really. Not until it's too late.

I've been trying to search for a job where I can work from a home office. But for someone like me, there's no option.
Everything requires more choosing, more experience, and getting choosing or experience requires time and money I
don't have and can't get. And even then, I've only been at this job for a few months. I can't quit yet because I need to
stay long enough for it to look good on my resume.

T know drugs will make it worse. Alcohol will make it worse. The most I can do is try to anaesthetise myself with the
activities that I used to like, activities that used to give my life meaning and purpose. I used to enjoy these things,
but now the most these things can give me--these things I used to love and enjoy--is a distraction. A temporary
illusion that I'm not miserable, which wears off at 9 pm every day.

There's a light at the end of the tunnel, and I can only hope that it's a train.

190,I'm sick of sales and i'm sick of screwing people over.,"I goddamn hate my job and it makes me sick to my stomach. 

I recently got promoted within a paint company and was relocated to a different store from the one I started in. At first, I was excited at the prospect of making more money and having more responsibility, but after working just one week in my new position, I realize what a greedy, scumbag of a company this really is.

I understand that this is commonplace and perfectly legal, but it doesn't make it right. It honestly makes me feel guilt ridden what they force me to do for a paycheck. I'll tell you what they want me to do. Again, it's all legal and many companies practice this.

Say a customer walks in and they want a product. They are nice, polite, and they just want a good deal. I smile, showcase our product, and promise them that they are getting the best deal I can offer them. They are happy and they leave the store content. Minutes later, a contractor/pro comes in and says to me ""such and such store across the way sells a product, that they promise is just as good as the one you sell, cheaper than what you sell it. I want that price."" 

What would a good, honorable person say to that contractor? If it were my choice, it would be ""I'm sorry, but we sell that price to everyone. It's the same no matter who you are."" But, no. I am forced to say ""We will match pricing from our competitors no matter what.""

What kinda bullshit is this? Just because this person wants to bitch about his pricing because of the promise he will buy more in the future, I'm supposed to cut him a better deal than other people? Again, I know it's common, I know many other companies do this, I know that it's legal, but I fucking hate doing this. Customers that come in who don't complain about the competitor price pay more. My company literally plays off of people's ignorance. 

Another thing. I know what these products cost our store. I have the power to look at all the numbers. The ""list pricing"" on every single thing we sell is pathetically high. If someone comes in with a coupon with the hope that they are getting a great deal, they aren't. Our company just list prices things so stupidly high and then once the coupon is applied, we are still getting crazy high margins on the sale. We could have honestly just sold the product at the coupon cost in the first place, but we LIE to people by tricking them into thinking they are getting an awesome deal because of the coupon. Sometimes, people aren't even aware that there are coupons out there! But they have to print the coupon off from our website, bring it in, we scan it, and then they ""surrender"" it. It's not even a unique barcode. It's the fucking same and you can just keep printing it off over and over, but yeah, gotta ""surrender"" it at purchase. What a fucking joke. 

Despite what some people think, we do NOT sell based on bulk pricing. That is a complete and utter lie. We sell as high as we can until the pros start to bitch and then we lower their price. I've seen pros who buy 20 gallons a month get better pricing than others who buy 100 plus gallons a month all because they threatened to shop somewhere else. Because of my company's greed, they literally want every possible fucking sale even if it's at the expense of my honor and personal integrity. Am I the only one that feels this way or has this become such common place that everyone is just like ""meh, that's how the economy works""? I'm sorry. I just felt like I needed to vent and get this off my chest. I can't wait till I find something else to do.

199,"Unemployed, and getting really stressed out and depressed by my peers, parents and random other people pushing me into employment for the sake of it and without regards to quality and happiness","It's so terrible. It's a constant loop.


No job - get shit - depressed


Have job - job is shit - depressed


Only the brief moments after you lose a job because the company is failing and doesn't pay their workers are the ones where I can be myself and enjoy life without the ever-looming stress of having or not having a job, and others behaving like I am not human because I don't have a job.


I'm not against working. I love helping people. I love to have a worthwhile goal. Sadly, in my area, all the jobs are either too fancy for me and they tell me I'm shit, or the jobs are too shit for me. I made a bad decision once or twice and got shoved into employment where I worked in some factory where it felt like I was in hell. Every minute was like an eternity, and after 2 hours, I was already looking at the clock for when it's time to go. It chipped at my soul this job did. It was really like hell in every context of the word. One day, after the second shift, I had a sudden urge to start smoking, getting drunk in a pub, and beat my wife if she gave me shit. Obviously I have neither a wife, don't drink, and definitely don't smoke. In that moment I didn't give a shit. I even went away before the alarm for shiftchange sounded, while the other fearful desperate people waited in front of the building , even though the shift already changed people. I got really desperate there, and my parents allowed me to quit. 


My friends tell me I'm shit. It's like I am not deserving of basic human dignity if I don't have a job. A way of wasting a third of my life away in  exchange for some morcels of money, and a lot of stress. My friends are also desperate in their jobs, and they hate them, but it's like they want everyone to be miserable if they also are. I mean , I understand that the modern capitalist way of life is set up in such a way that you have no other choice than to be a slave for someone and make them money. Unless you have money for starting your own business which will inevitably fail. Like I would dare to invest in anything when I have nothing.


It sucks from all sides, and only gets worse as my unemployment time increases. I've seen it countless times between jobs. At first everyone feels sorry for you ,and then as time passes, they grow resentful and more aggressive ,and make you feel bad, until you get so stressed that you take literally any job . 


I had one okay-ish job ever, and it also sucked. But it was one I wasn't forced into, and it was leagues better than the rest. The future is grim and I hate that it has to be like this. Why don't my parent have a business, so I can get forced into it, and actualyl have a reason to give more than the bare minimum. Why am I not a country lad?



Some business dude that I know, whom I was choffeuring a few times, talked to me about the mobility of workers and how it is normal in some places to drive 2 hours to and from work. I didn't dare to tell him that I value my free time very highly, and that I would rather take a pay cut just so I don't have to waste 8 hours of my life somewhere I don't want to be, that I think a 5 day work week is plent,y and 4-shift and working 6 or 7 days is slavery. Didn't dare to lay some math on him and tell him that if you waste 12 hours of your life on work, that you are wasting your life and you are stupid. That commute obviously counts as unproductive work-time where you can't enjoy your life and your hobbies (unless you really enjoy listening to audiobooks in traffic).


All in all, it's all shit. I should just kill myself, or go live in a forest. The modern way of life is slavery. We have machines which can extract resources. Why can't those be public, and generate income for the universal basic income.

206,How to build a sustainable anti-work life?,"Is it possible to build a fufilling life that avoids the current system of work-till-you're-dead capitalism? And if so, what are the steps to getting there?

I'm pretty young, I'm 21, but already I'm disenchanted. It began with school, which I was originally very interested in, until about middle school. I disliked the idea of being fed information and then being tested on it, only for the information to then never be referenced again, and I felt my worth was diminished to mere numbers. I became very depressed and was told college was better. It wasn't, it was the exact same thing, except this time I was expected to pay. I dropped out of my second year of community college after two years of what seemed like the same thing, with about 2k in student loans. Instead I went into a competitive training program, and I am now staying afloat by working freelance in the Film Production industry as a Production Assistant: I stand outside for about 12 hours a day, during 12-14 hour shifts, lock down perimeters and get coffee for asshole directors and lighting techs. I make a little above minimum wage, with room to grow. Its grueling, and restrictive (With the industry only being viable in NY, California, and Georgia) 

However, I get the feeling continuing on this path with never lead to anything fruitful. So here's the question: how to build a sustainable life focused around living rather than working? Instead of focusing on career and building a life from that, how do we focus on life and build a career around it? 

I believe the first point is freedom of work. Freedom to set your hours, freedom to move, and freedom to grow. I believe the best path to this is working remotely. What are the best jobs that one could get working remotely without a college degree? Could training in coding and computer software or web design be a viable option to work from home? If not, what are some careers that would allow travel or leave?

The second point that comes to mind is detachment from the system. That would be understanding and sacrificing your connection to parts of the system: letting go of the idea of owning things that could chain you down, like taking out loans, buying a house, etc. What are some things to be aware of, what sacrifices would this kind of life entail, and how does one detach from these things. Is it sustainable to have a partner, or child, with an anti-work life? 

And finally, what would an anti-work life look like for you, if it were possible? Working and saving and retiring early? Working in short periods and traveling? Working from your computer and moving around? What do you imagine an anti-work like to be? For me, it would be working as I travel, keeping costs down and having very little possessions or buying land (although taking a loan to buy land is a problem in itself) and living sustainably, working from the computer freelance when money gets tight. 

I'm interested in hearing other people's ideas, and the steps and sacrifices that would come with this lifestyle as well as the pros to this life. Any answers are welcome.",False,f9j4fo,vomit-gold,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f9j4fo/how_to_build_a_sustainable_antiwork_life/,5,1
207,It's 15:35 and I'm staring at the clock on my computer screen.,"I'm losing tracks of what I'm doing. I'm so tired. I haven't slept very well lately. I look at the time. 15:36. Time goes so slowly. I start thinking of what I'm gonna do when I get home. I can't wait to cook some food and play some games. I snap out of my daydream when my manager asks me a question. ""Can you do me a favour?"" Sure. It's not like I can say no is it?

I got my degree. I studied for 3 years. I have great skills. And this is my life. This is what it resulted in. Me sitting here, from 9 - 17:30, 5 days a week, earning 80p above the minimum wage an hour. 

And everyone is so proud of me. Proud of me for being a slave. Proud of me for getting a job in my field. Finally, my Dad says. Finally you're worth something.That's right, my dad is even proud of me. The first time I've ever heard him say those words, is when I became a full time employee. 

I used to be so passionate about this. I used to love what I work with. It was my whole life. It's all I ever wanted to do. My passion is gone. My inspiration is gone. All I do is making the CEO wealthier whilst I'm struggling to even save anything every month.

I personally have a friend whose paid 60k out of their 68k in loans and they STILL have a balance of 58k. This is absurd!

220,[seeking advise] how do I set boundaries without having mgmt hate me?,"My work is done on a ""case by case"" basis. Cases take anywhere between 1 day on my end, or 1-2 weeks. There are instances of ""escalation cases"" that require them be done in a tight timeframe. Workers in my position qualify for OT but must be approved. People usually leave at 5 unless they're working on something with pre-approved OT (like an escalation) but that's rare. 

Last Tuesday I was given an ""escalation"" by a group lead who communicates between us and our group manager (who sits remotely in another state). The group lead told me the manager said it can be done tomorrow. I come in the next day spending all day trying to finish it within that timeframe. And because I thought it had to be done that day, I did not approach it the same way as I normally approach other cases. 

Around 5 a floor manager in our office came around and I tell him about the ""escalation"" and says I had to finish it today. The group lead overheard and immediately tell the floor manager that it did not have to be done that day, but that the group manager only said it *can* be finished that day. Due to other complications related to the case I stay until 6pm. 

The next day I ask around and find out that escalated cases go through this specific approval process, and the one I had was likely not a real escalation. Later I casually ask my group lead if that case was really an escalation, he tells me that's what he was told by the group manager.

I'm calling this time a loss and not going to pursue OT for the hour I worked. But I'm pretty angry that they made it sound like it was super urgent when it really isn't. What should I do next time if I'm given another """"escalation""""? How should I confirm that it's a real escalation? I don't want to be overtly combative because I'm afraid that'll mark a target on my back, and mgmt might give me trouble in the future in weird ways. Also, I have a feeling this issue does not happen in other teams. I know for a fact that my remote group manager is much much harder to work with than other managers.",False,f8i5dv,Am_I_Scammed,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f8i5dv/seeking_advise_how_do_i_set_boundaries_without/,3,1

236,My boss denied my work schedule change.,"When I first got hired the hours were 8-5pm. I work in a field that is a bit tedious and boring so by the end of the day I’m drained. I’m an early bird and I’m usually at work super early. For the past few months I’ve been just clocking in at 7:30am and leaving at 4:30pm, 30mins early. 

This hasn’t been an issue but yesterday after I left my boss went looking for me and didn’t find me. So this morning as soon as I get in, he asked to speak with me. He said that because were getting an intern our VP, wants to know what we are doing so he wants a weekly recap of what I’m doing. He also said that the business hours are 8-5pm and I need to stick to that and I asked if I can adjust the hours. He responded by saying we agreed on business hours 8-5pm and I said I know but I’m asking if I can change it. He said no because it’s business hours and I’m the only one manning the desk. He said why do I want to change it? I said the traffic makes a big difference in those 30 minutes and it helps me. I said those 30 minutes don’t really make a difference work wise I don’t get emails that late and I check my emails in case I do. He still said no. I think this whole VP Wanting to know is obviously a lie.

I’m upset at this because it seems like I’m asking for a minor change that obviously hasn’t effected my work or our managers that I work with and I’m only asking for this small thing and he won’t compromise. 


Lot of people at my company have their own schedules I don’t understand why i can’t change it either?

239,"People or r/antiwork, why don't you create passive income source or build own business?","Hey, I don't mean to offend anyone on this sub reddit so I'm sorry in advance if this post triggers anyone.

Im an entrepreneur/former employee who came across this sub reddit for the first time and spent the last few hours going through the posts. I enjoyed the memes and my entrepreneur mindset just wanted to spam all these posts with the same answer so I decided to make a thread

Instead of working 9-5 for someone else, why don't you earn online/freelance or go for passive income source like affiliate marketing to help you live the life you want, in your own terms?

I also noticed this sub reddit is filled with americans and was wondering have you ever thought about saving and shifting to a country with less expenses?

In my opinion, freelancing + shifting to a 3rd world country could solve all your problem. Where as just freelancing initially is slow and requires stable career till you get your few freelance clients. Its better to suffer and live life like a king, rather than suffer whole life.

There's a solution to every problem I believe and was wondering what have YOU done to get out of the situation?",False,f7gsgq,Neoguy396,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f7gsgq/people_or_rantiwork_why_dont_you_create_passive/,11,1

243,Obsession With Leadership,"I work in one of worlds biggest engineering companies right, it's a massive corporate cesspool of bullshitters and people just hanging week by week to get that pay check.

What is becoming more and more apparent is this obsession with leadership, and forcing everyone in to these bullshit training on how to become a leader. Everyone is a leader...leadership...how to lead...how to become a role model... It's just pure madness on an epic scale, we are supposed to fuckin build bridges and tunnels not lead an army or whatever. Then you have these managers who buy in to this or just follow the crap to climb up the corporate ladder. They all read those books with tips how to become leader, their speeches are fucking same bland template shit with mandatory joke right on cue that feels painful to hear.

If we are all leaders...who will do the actual work then? You cannot train a leader just like you can't train someone to become Mick Jagger...you either have the carisma or not. 

So now I have to attend this leadership seminar again next month and I am already feeling sick about it, I just wanted to be an engineer. Not a fuckin corporate psycho talking business leadership lingo.

God I hate how work environment killed all my enthusiasm and passion for engineering...I just don't give a shit anymore.

There's nothing I enjoy anymore. I have no incentive to work or to chase money.

254,"Boss needs a ""note"" for a family emergency (rant)","I'm a busser at a dine-in movie theater on the weekends (college student during the week). This morning I got a call saying my mom was in the hospital which is a 2 hour drive from the city I'm currently in. I called my manger to let him know I won't be able to make my shift tonight because I'm not sure how long I'd be at the hospital and the drive back would be a couple hours. First thing he says ""well you're gonna need a note proving this when you come back"" ...... I just agree and hang up. 

First of all, really? I get people make excuses to miss days, but since when do I owe my manager a damn note for an emergency? I'm a busser. 

Second, the hospital I'm in right now doesn't give us visitor passes and who do I ask for a note? The doctor? And say ""hey my boss is being a dick, and I need a note saying I'm here."" 

Third, this just pisses me off. It already annoyed me that he didn't even say ""ok I hope your mom feels better"" he immediately assumed I was lying. This is why I hate the food/service industry. This is a part-time, low paying job that I do in my spare time, not a career. If I call out, I call out. Find someone else to cover my shift. You don't need a note and I don't owe you shit. My family is more important. 

Last, they just started asking for notes from employees since one guy lied about a car accident. Now we're ALL expected to provide proof for any reason we call out. I really don't like jobs being in my personal business at all, let alone my family's.

257,Wage slave nearly killed me (literally),"Hi, so I'm about as anti-work as they come. Im really school smart and active at my college, so when I applied for Americorps, I got in even though only 1 in 3 applicants are hired.

I lived on the bare minimum, with everything I need just on my back and in my pockets.

It was wonderful, and felt like complete freedom.

Now here I am, job searching to attempt to start my engineering career, and after my first interview I am left completely flabbergasted that I have to do this. I haven’t been this stressed out since college just because of one interview. It was terrifying by the way, being interviewed by engineering professionals while I’m just a hatched egg. I’m not ready to dedicate my life to something that mentally destroys me so much. I thought it would get better after college, but I really don’t know how I’m going to do this.

264,Work and money is the main reason I don’t want kids,"Work and money is the main reason Why I don’t want kids. It’s not that I don’t want to be domestic it’s that I can’t afford to and expecting parents, especially the mother to be superwoman at work and home isn’t fair or healthy.

A lot of millennial women are choosing not to have kids and many of us say “Oh I prefer to choose my career” but that really is a professionally and socially acceptable way of saying “I will never have enough wealth and security to afford the support needed to take care of home and children properly. I will never be able to enjoy a maternity leave without knowing my pregnancy might get me laid off (creatively of course, they’ll state another reason) or skipped over for promotions and pay increases.”

And further more, as a wage slave, I believe whole heartedly it is a sin to create another. I can’t see myself working full time to 75 which is when many of us will be working until if not longer. Most of the people I know who had kids my age or younger are not properly ensured and won’t be able to maintain life insurance after a job lose. If anything happens to one of the parents then the family is really up shit’s creek. So many millennials men and women have suicide in the back of their minds. Maybe they want to wait until after their own parents pass. Maybe they are waiting to see how something career or relationship wise plays out. I think this is also another reason many of us don’t want kids. It ruins the exit strategy.

283,Sick of being called lazy and entitled,"I'm so sick of being told I need to stop being lazy or that I have an unearned sense of entitlement. Just because I hate working to make other people rich. 

I am 34 and have held atleast one job since I was 15.  Why is it so hard to understand that I just hate doing work that a robot could do? I want to feel like my work means something and I'm sure I'm not alone here when I say that if I quit my job right now the only people who would care are my family and the poor guy that has to pick up the hours I used to work. Then on the rare occasions that I make sense to someone it's ALWAYS  the same thing. 

""So why not just get a new job?"" 

Maybe because it's all the same shit. Anything that would make me feel meaningful to society won't pay enough or won't hire me because I don't have an education or background in that area of work. 

""So go back school"" is what anyone who's made it this far in a conversation with me says. 

Ok when? I work 12 hours 5 days a week. Day 6 I sleep most of it. Day 7 I spend with my family so my kids can actually know their father. 

Nobody can give me an answer, because there isn't one. And the entitlement conversation pisses me off the most. 

""You and your generation have this false sense of entitlement.""

 What do you mean??? Am I not entitled to have any joy in my life? Am I not entitled to want to spend time with my family? Am I not entitled to actually want to do work that I like doing instead of mind numbingly repetitive horseshit? I don't have a problem with working I have a problem with working for someone who

 A. Is already far more wealthy than me. 

B. Doesn't give a shit about me, my coworkers, or anything other than their own profits so that that they can actually live the life the rest of us dream of. 

No its not me and my generation that are entitled, it's the people who are at the top and have always been there trying to keep the rest of us down. 

""Oh come on now CEOs and big business owners have had to work hard to get there.""

 Have they? Is delegating other people to do the actual work for you hard work?

287,Government Jobs,"A few times I have seen people bring up switching to government work to get away from making money for someone else, so I thought I'd share my experience being in the public sector.  Based on what I've read on this sub, there are a few things that government jobs certainly do better.  We have a union that regularly increases our wages and protects our benefits/insurance.  You cannot be asked to stay late or work on days that you are not scheduled.  It's a different environment when the goal isn't to make a profit.

However, there are still plenty of problems.  If you work at a desk, you are given the most uncomfortable workspace you could imagine.  They're generic setup can't be adjusted enough to suit anybody, and as a result people are always getting injuries.  You can ask to get replacements that fit you better, but not until the pain has already set in.  Even when you do ask for a replacement, it could be months before you get your new equipment.  The schedules are also extremely rigid.  You can never leave early, even if you have absolutely nothing to do, because it is ""not giving taxpayers what they paid for.""  Some days, you can sit there for 8 hours with nothing to do but watch the clock.  In addition to that, you have to constantly keep up your image because it would look bad to the taxpayers.  So have fun fake working for a few hours because there isn't anything for you to work on.

Ranting aside, a government job is still a job.  You will be wasting your life away sitting in traffic, sitting in an office, sitting in traffic, sleeping, and repeating.",False,f8nc7m,Senderender,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f8nc7m/government_jobs/,14,1

I have to pay rent of course, but in the past when this happened it was some of the best and productive (creative) times I had. 

I've been at my current job now for two years, and it could be worse, It's not like I exactly hate my job right now. The hours are good and the work is not hard, and its only 5 minutes away. There are annoying things of course but even then its not that bad but I'm just already having that feeling of wanting to quit again so I don't have to constantly deal with coworkers constantly messaging me asking to take their shifts or something and I like being able to choose my day/week as I want when I was NEET. I am more introverted as well so I prefer doing my own thing.

I could never have a career my whole life, unless its working for myself. Even jobs I've liked everything seems to get so repetitive like the environment or the tasks.

I like to write and draw in my spare time and even make money from it when I make merchandise from it.

Of course the cost of living mostly rent is really high but just seeing anyone else who can relate. And there may be those that say well can take a break or vacation, but everytime I have had (1 or 2 weeks off), even then I'm still being contacted by coworkers asking to take shifts lol, so mentally it doesn't even feel like I'm away.

297,"So, my most politically-conscious relative has resigned himself to a life of drudgework.","Meanwhile, I'm looking into starting/joining a commune/similar with my buddies so we don't have to spend as much time at work &amp; away from each other. The problem is that he's one of my favorite people in the world and the one with whom I'd be most eager to share the extra time, security, &amp; freedom I'm hoping to achieve. 

Some context: He \*is\* my brother, so mid-20's. He holds similar views on sociopolitical topics, economics, etc.. I hypothesize that he wants to be able to follow his dream (tech development) but there's presently no way of doing that in a timely manner that offers a whole lot of freedom (think: educational burdens atop the average &amp; expected 9-5 workdays.) 

But the fact of the matter is the way in which he put this priority when presented with hypothetical alternative lifestyles: it was almost one of defeatism. Even though our ambitions aren't mutually exclusive in a non-capitalist, non-drudgework society (and might in fact be allowed to thrive outside of 9-5's), he feels he can only improve the world if he commits himself to a tech lab. He agrees that we're overworked, overused, underappreciated, and undersocialized, but there's no incentive in him to fight or fix this--there's some desire for it to \*be\* fixed on a grand scale, but not on an individual one, for his own life/sake.

Maybe he doesn't know enough about human needs and \*just\* how f'd we really are in (real, not just theoretical) terms of being able to meet our more sophisticated ones, let alone many of our more basic ones? Which is also unlikely, given that we are close to the same age and he's engaged to a future psychiatrist. Idk, it was just kind of isolating to hear that from him, of all people. I'd understand if it were someone from, idk, Japan, or someone from an older generation--folks who tend to view the sacrifice of their every waking hour as a ""noble cause,"" but to hear it from him was jarring.

Now, at first a third didn't seem that bad, but then I looked up the percentage of time we slept... And it was a third as well. That means the average person only is free for a third of their life. And then often they're expected to do other work at home (answering emails, paying taxes) that I'm sure the statistic doesn't take into account. How can anyone be pleased with that? How is this what we as a society have decided is acceptable? I understand that it's better today than it has been (in Medieval times, for instance), but it's estimated that cavemen living off the land only spent at most 20% of their time working.

I have a tendency to go to extremes. Either I work extremely hard or become extremely lazy. In my first job I was extremely lazy where I didnt tell people after I finished a task. I usually waited a few hours. Some asshole complained about me to the team lead.

In my second and third job(current), I worked extremely hard. Picking up new things as soon as I finished the previous ones. It gave me health issues such as memory problems. I was still called wrong by people. I got an extremely bad review and I was told I only care about myself and not about the team. I am not being a team player.

After my health issues and my recent review I realized that I am going to do the bare minimum. Something that doesnt affect my health but on the other hand does not get me a bad reputation.

I know what my colleague did. When he came back from holidays he read all his emails from bottom to top. This included even company mails that no one reads. However he went overboard and was later removed from his leadership position for not doing enough.

I call first thing in the morning and explain my situation. Apparently, I needed another permit on top of the parking pass to park in the lot.

I told her that with the amount of money this place makes with tuition and what not that there’s no reason we should be paying this much.

This post made me think of several stories I personally know of where a single shitty management decision has pushed out good workers, or turned them from peak performers into bare-minimum performers.

One of them at my last job: they paid someone a $40,000 bonus to move his whole family across the country for this very specialized job that paid a salary of $140,000 a year (3 times the average for this region). This guy worked from home his first month while trying to set up his household locally because the company needed him on board ASAP, then worked for 3 months with no issues. During the week of Thanksgiving his wife was traveling for work and his kid’s daycare was closed so he asked to work from home for 1 day because he didn’t have anyone local who could watch his kids. Request denied. This was 1 week after he had worked until 2am FROM HOME at his manager’s request to prep for a board meeting. 

This one short-sighted decision was all it took for this guy to realize his new company didn’t give a shit about him, so by Christmas he had given notice and was preparing to move his family yet again for a different job.

So does anyone else have any stories about this situation? Seems pretty common.",False,f7vmse,Unb0theredAF,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f7vmse/what_happened_that_made_you_go_from_peak/,19,1

350,Is there a way out?,"Hi everybody. This is a 23 yo dude posting here but this is no ""welcome to the adulhood"" type of post.  

Many of you might assume that I'm just another regular dude that just graduated college and got slapped in the face by reality but I can assure you it is not the case. Matter of fact, I dropped out of college 2 years ago, too much money in exachange of zero fucks given proffessors and information you could get for free on Google.  

Anyway, I went on my first corporate job at 21 years old, after a succession of typical part time jobs broke students go for, making uncle Bezos richer again. Quit that shit and went for my own thing 1 year later. Tried a business in marketing but failed miserably. After that, I went unemployed for a couple of months and then again, guess what. Another corporate job.  

The first corporate job you get is always the best, you're thrilled when they give you a lot of crap making you belive you actually can build your future there but it all fades away the second time. You get used to that shit, it doesn't impress you anymore, nothing is different. The pay, the people you work with and the way the office looks like are the only things that change. And I'm getting sick and tired of it, more than that thinking that ""this is what supposed to do for the next 40 years"". Man ,fuck you!  

So, the way out? Trying again at own business but man, the amount of time it took me to gather funds, open it, etc, and then fail, fuck that. Looks viable, still better that rot in a cubicle, yet I'm not still ready for it.  

Life of crime? I'll shit you not this idea starts looking more and more appealing to me by the days going.
I mean, yeah, the risk of prison and all but , sometimes I'm thinking that a couple of years behind bars in your 30's in exchange of hunders of k's if not even millions is 100x worth than spend the next 40 years of my life living paycheck to paycheck, sucking bankers dicks for a loan and retire to die at 66 of heart attack brought by a life spent like this.  

Play the lotto? Nah, only dumb financial illiterate motherfuckers always win, this is how the universe works. Somebody that has a plan but no cash will never win.  

Sell eveything and live off 2$ a day on some island in the pacific? Another appealing idea.

Yesterday I got a text from my boss telling us to be less selective about the leads we write...immediately after I’d just gotten a lead kicked because the guy didn’t want enough windows to be worth our reps’ time. And that’s on top of only being able to set customer appointments within a timeframe of four days, and not being allowed to set appointments for rental properties that the customer owns. After we stopped doing flexible times and only offering three time slots to choose from. And even if a customer fits all those hoops, if their spouse can’t make it they (and we) are SOL. You don’t even have to have your spouse present to buy a fucking house, and we’re just giving quotes!

I will be going on a month long trip in 1 month, so I am having trouble deciding if I want to leave before or after the trip.

381,Limiting workers' sickleave is dangerous and irresponsible,"Bit of an update/rephrase of my previous post, less angery and more measured. So what happened is one of the senior people in my team came to work sick for 3 straight days. Now 5 (me included) people out of our 10 people team are down with influenza (yes, we all had flu shots, sponsored by the company). His behaviour was highly irresponsible  because a) my country, Poland, doesn't limit sick leave if you're on a permanent contract (we are), b) our boss (and the whole team) is entirely pro people going home if they're ill, and in fact told mr. B to do so which B. ignored and c) B is one of the few people in our team who can work from home, so seriously, asshole. I do recognize that many countries have fucked up sick leave limits, or unaffordable/unobtainable healthcare, or employers discourage sick leave or pressure people into coming anyway (my mum works in retail, and this freaks me out because she goes to work with a fever and she works with FOOD). This is just the shittiest thing to me. Aside from the fact that taking care of your health is your right and your priority, it's retarded from the capitalist asshole's perspective, because half the office can go down due to one person.

386,Lost all hope,"I'm sorry if this sounds like a rant that does not relate to anti-work ideology. I just wanted to share my thoughts and feelings after 1.5 months of starting my second job. I finally came to the realization that there is really no good (full-time) jobs at all, at least not one that does not cost your mental health.

One of my friends who briefly went into the same field told me that ""xx field is toxic"". I passed the interview and started working in the exact field she had left. The first month was honeymoon phase and everyone was being nice. You can only judge how supportive a team is when things go to shit (or when it's about to).

I am always holding back my emotions on my current project team. The manager is nice sometimes but he also has ultra-motives in whatever he does. For example, he wanted to talk to me about my performance over lunch. But he went around prodding about my weekend plans, wanting to know how much time over the weekend I had actually spent on work. I feel that he's on the fence about being nice or being shit to his associates and it sends really mixed signals when you try to be friendly only to be met with a stern comment. Yet the same guy asked me why I am not outgoing and why I'm so quiet. The answer is simple. I have given up. 

Today, the dude took another associate, N, in our team to the project meeting. (There are only 2 associates including me) He summoned her from our company training event to join this super important meeting. I felt extremely sidelined. I am always the one assigned to do all the very menial tasks (which I am not complaining because it gives me some breathing space to observe and learn). I just feel like I am not part of the team. Even the project proposal does not have my name on it. I don't know if it's favoritism or what. All I know is that all these have made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcomed. So these are the multiple subtle ways that people are mean to each other but still nice on the surface. (Associate N is also super friendly but made back-handed comments to me that made me feel inferior)

The horrible thing about open working space, may I add, is that if you get humiliated, it happens in front of everybody. You get exposed under the bright sun. The whole department probably knows about the situation now and it's super embarrassing. But that doesn't really concern me. My only concern is if I am suited to continue working here or that my performance is always never enough for my manager who gets very irritated at mistakes that could be easily edited in 10 mins. Maybe he hates me. 

I'll try to make it to 6 months if the big bosses haven't already terminated my employment at the end of the 3-month probation. I don't think any job is worth the humiliation and bad treatment. We can all be anti-work at heart but reality sometimes demand us to work to sustain ourselves.

402,"The magic words to get prescribed antidepressants: ""my work life is being affected"".","So, after 7 months of going to a psychiatrist and telling him about some disturbing personal life stories that are *probably the factors that* led me to a constant dissociative and depressed state, I got prescribed nothing. **I didn’t WANT anything to be prescribed anyway**, all I was doing was seeking help. I even actively looked for psychiatrists that were specialised in similar disorders to the ones I felt I was struggling with, so I had the best chances at some sort of recovery. 

Anyway, he did nothing. Of course, the talking and psychoanalysis helps a little as an emotional outlet, but he couldn’t offer any solutions.

When I started a part time job, I said to my therapist:

&gt;“Well, this is going too far now, it is my first month at work and I was already severely late three times and missed it completely also three times - I already got a severe warning from my boss”. 

*(This was happening because I was severely struggling to get out of bed in the morning due to my depression)*

The therapist then proceeded almost automatically to prescribe me antidepressants on that very session. Huh, almost like that is what they are for.

The original idea for this post came to my mind as some sort of ironic /r/UnethicalLifeProTips post. Something like: “If you are struggling with depression due to personal problems and your therapist refuses to prescribe antidepressants, just say it’s affecting your work life severely”. 

It is like too easy to see the function those pills have in society. I feel like a fool and a functioning robot, but at least I don’t want to die everyday now and everything is neutral and easier to endure. I never skipped work again. And, by the way, when I said those things that got me my prescription, I didn't have any of this in mind. I was just scared shitless of losing my job in my first month.

407,Glad to have found you,"There is something comforting in finding a safe haven such as this sub. I understand that most people might not say they necessarily like work; but I have struggled for so long knowing that what I experience goes so far beyond that. Even those who don't like it, manage to do it. They might piss and moan occasionally, but, at the end, they are able to trudge along year after year doing the same mindless tasks: accepting the same dehumanizing, juvenile treatment. For the life of me, I can't figure out how.

Never have I been able to keep a job for more than 1 or 2 years at a time; typically, that range runs closer to the 1 year mark. In a way, this gnaws at me and makes me doubt my worth. I know I'm not a dumb person: I just can't find a point to it. I excel in any position I am in, but take no real pride in excelling in them. Why would I? They are menial, with no freedom, responsibility, genuine opportunity for advancement or chance to make change.   Hell, I even broke down in 2009 and decided to go to college, figuring that would broaden my prospects. Even though I did very well and graduated with a near perfect GPA, it has not paid off in the least.

If you'll allow me to vent: take my current position. It's not a horrible gig, but it is also a nothing job. Every day is the same thing over and over. None of it involves the slightest bit of challenge or critical thinking. Since being recruited 7 months ago, I have been the highest performing seller in the department every month; this includes individuals who have somehow done this for 4, 11, at 15 years!

Yet, despite being recruited away from another position, despite having an applicable college degree and management experience, and despite being the top performer since starting, I am micromanaged on a daily basis in regards to the the most inane aspects of the job.

It's just not enough that my performance is above and beyond. Nor is it enough that I am stuck in this building for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week; my only reprieve being 2 measly 10 min breaks and a 30 min lunch/day, along with a paltry 40 hours of pto every 6 fucking months. There is always something else that needs to be discussed, focused on, shoved in to fill that free time where I am basically robbing the poor company by not having something to do every minute of every day. Because, for a mediocre wage, overpriced healthcare, free coffee, and a cubicle: they own me. Every second of every weekday, I am their property.

What truly blows my mind is how the others in the department do it. Sure, 3 of them have been here long enough to be making a decent hourly wage, but I am the only person in the entire department that makes monthly bonus on sales. Seriously, the only one. That is really the only thing that even makes the job worth it. I have hit my highest level of bonus every month and that is the only reason I am able to tolerate this. How these others are doing the same job for so long, with no bonus structure, is beyond my understanding.",False,f6entv,Stonkinidiot,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f6entv/glad_to_have_found_you/,5,1

After getting kicked out of college, I spend like 10yrs of relaxing and enjoying my life. Entering my 30s, i got a full time job because I'm old and wanted a family of my own. Working full time for awhile now, I can't do this. I don't even care about having kids, a wife, a house, or anything else. I just want to die, I don't care about doing meaningless shit that makes me feel depressed. I dont know what to do with my life or where to go from here but I""m done. It's over.

413,Boss got mad at me for not going above and beyond at work,"
I work a desk job and had my weekly meeting with my boss yesterday. Boss was reviewing a task I completed for the week and was upset because I only completed the basic requirements but didn’t go above and beyond. Suggested I should’ve not only completed my task, but fully research it from all angles to fully understand the ins and outs of the task. Boss accused me of not taking my work seriously enough and said I need to put in more effort to do extra homework on the tasks I’m given, including using my weekends to work on work.

Ok...I tried to be understanding and named improvement steps I could take. I said I’ll spend more time and do background research for my next tasks. I even suggested that I could take a small course related to my job to improve my skills which will in turn allow me to perform future tasks better, allowing me to have better context of the work I do. Boss flipped out at this suggestion, like I just insulted them, and was all like “you DON’T need to take a course. Just DO THE WORK. What YOU need to do is take more initiative and own your work. YOU should know this. You should’ve not only finished this task, but come ready to talk about and present the findings from background research you did for it. YOU need to start taking more charge and responsibility. Research your tasks and actually do your homework!”

I’m confused. So I got yelled at because I completed the requirements for my tasks which apparently isn’t good enough. I’m not good enough until I put in extra effort and dedicate my weekends to work. Suggesting I take a course related to my skills to help improve my efficiency at work is apparently a terrible idea. Even if my boss thought taking a side course wasn’t the best idea, approaching it in a civil manner like “that’s a good suggestion but at the moment I think it’s not the most efficient way to approach your tasks. Here’s what I suggest...” instead of flipping out and accusing me of not owning my work, would’ve been appreciated. Did I not take charge of my task and complete it? Did I not just “do it”? 

I wasn’t even asking for a raise. I was just minding my own business and did what was assigned to me. So apparently this is what I get for being professional, respectful, and understanding. I get chewed out for being an obedient employee because I didn’t go the extra mile to research my task and sacrifice my weekends to work. Apparently “basic requirements” arent even basic anymore. So coming into work on time, doing my 9-6, looking presentable, not causing any trouble, being respectful to my boss and coworkers, suggesting improvements to help further my skills to ultimately improve the company, and completing my tasks isn’t enough now.",False,f70r2j,frozenpie222,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f70r2j/boss_got_mad_at_me_for_not_going_above_and_beyond/,16,1

415,Finally fulfilled a dream,"So to pre-face, this is my first post. I’ve lurked here for a while and my ideals on life and work pretty much line up with the views shared by all of you. 
So to the good part.... I live in the south in one of these “great” right to work states where unless you are the owners son or have a degree (accounting,medical etc) you’re going to make $10-$12 an hr. Don’t matter if you’re digging ditches in the 100 degree sun or sitting behind a desk, $10-$12 an hr. So, I find myself working at a fancy housing community, where no one has jobs and look down on the working class. But that’s a whole other subject we’ll go down on a different day. So to the actual job... easy stuff, file paper work, make copies, Yano office stuff. But the boss, is a Karen to a T. In the 3 months she’s been there, she’s has gone through two office admins. Has to be them, right? So anyways, long story short, boss takes 2 vacations in 2 months, leaves me by myself to run a club house on my second day, and does the schedule to fit her needs and home life but doesn’t consult with anyone else about theirs. So, I had enough. I called boss’s boss and asked for a private talk. Big boss shows up and I go on to explain that little boss is an asshole and they could train a monkey to do her job. Big boss looks like she just saw a monkey fucking a football. She then says that I’m way too comfortable calling my boss an asshole and she couldn’t make me respect her. I agreed that I couldn’t respect a boss who wouldn’t do what was expected of her workers. I knew what was coming, so I just took their key off my key ring and handed it to her n walked away. 
It felt great to actually tell a boss how you feel. Kind of like a weight off my shoulders.

416,I have to develope a concept to outsource one of our testing stations,"I'm a electrical engineer and I usually just work on our products. We develope them ourselves and build and test most of them ourselves.

But slowly and slowly we begin to outsource our assembly line.

We always had a part of our products made in a ""disabled workshop"" (a place where disabled people work at).

Now I got the job to develope a test station to outsource the product that is partially made at the disabled workshop completely. 

There are two problems about this.

- The first one is, our assembly line workers think that they get outsourced as punishment for joining the union, when in reality their only chance to keep their jobs is to be part of the union. Our management does a pretty good job with spreading fear about this.

- The second one is, the actual reason for outsourcing is because the disabled worker get super unfair (or let's say controversial) payment. 

And with this full automatic machine I'm building, they won't gain a additional workplace. But we will probably loose one (if this task is not replaced by something else. I actually don't know).

So however it works out, under the line, automatisation is again not used the way it should. I have never seen this process in person before. And although im a huge fan of automatisation this feels wrong, because no-one except our boss is going to benefit from it.",False,f7bof8,SemiBird,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f7bof8/i_have_to_develope_a_concept_to_outsource_one_of/,1,1

423,The trick society pulled on you.,"  Modern slavery is understood by understanding that we are slowly being stripped, as a species, from our ability to provide essential resources to ourselves independently from government or outside sources. They used several different means to secure food, water, and land. They don't have it all yet, but it's a big picture game, and they'll play inch by inch until they've accomplished complete control over everything we cannot live without. 

  You don't know how to provide yourself with food, shelter, or water, and you don't want to die. Instead of you knowing how to be truly independent, the government monopolizes resources that you cannot live without. Their system becomes the middleman to our survival. Subconsciously, this lack of understanding leads to a lack of security, which leads us to a position where we have no choice but to become, and remain involved with the game.

  Those who have not woken up are not slaves because they do not wish to leave.  They're so dependent on the system for their resources and happiness, that they cannot imagine a life without it. It's not their fault because seeing past the systems tricks require us to really come into acceptance that the system is incapable of fulfilling our true values, so it causes us to abandon old solutions in search of more novel ones, or it causes us to self destruct. 

  Most of us are brainwashed, and believe what we desire can be achieved by staying asleep or on the racetrack.

Seriously though. After a year of employment, and the highest possible rating from my boss, my company then decides to make a big fuss out of ""rewarding"" me with a 1.5% raise. Which is less than what I could get if they offered cost of living increases.

428,I don't want to start working (rant),"I'm in a particularly peculiar situation. I went to college at the tender age of 16 and got to study computer animation. I graduated last year and now I'm 20. Around a year ago I read Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber (highly recommended!) And around that time my political views shifted to Ayn Randian capitalist to socialist/anarchist especially after reading about the 2008 financial crisis (Matt Taibbis ""Griftopia"" was an amazing book on how badly and severely the world economy was on the brink of collapse). Since graduating I've done a few interviews and sent my shitty CV to several companies and got rejected by everyone. Basically I need to find an unpaid internship where I have to work for nothing or next to nothing under pressure for several months and move to a low paying position which will last for another few years until I get to the point where I can basically pay rent without help from my parents giving me money. The prospect of selling my soul to work at a company I dont want to work for to ""boost"" my experience is mind numbing. The whole facade of acting like I'm a good worker who will do everything to get the job to bullshit employers is humiliating and everyone knows it. Despite this I get told ""you have an awesome degree and you get to work wherever you want whereas most people work minimum wage and can barely feed themselves and their family"" however it's all the same, prostitute yourself to the boss and hope you dont get fired. I have highly considered working for myself and not having a boss but ofcourse that's after landing a steady job and becoming more skilled and knowing what I want to do. Am I being pessimistic here? 

Last note, during a presentation in college I had to give about my career I added this quote from Graebers book and read it out loud to the teacher and the audience.

431,misery in terms of 40 hour work week,"I wanted to share this four-year-old comment by user /u/-red-ataraxia . It was brought to light recently on /r/lostgeneration where I found it reposted, and it touched me in a profound and deeply personal way. It was almost as though this person knew me, and knew me better than the people I see and spend 8+ hours with every day.

By posting this here, I want people to know that you're not alone, and you're not crazy for having these feelings toward work, even when your coworkers, family, or friends insist that you just need to snap out of it and get used to your own personal version of hell. Even if we are complete failures in all efforts to change work-culture, policies, public policy, or even your own situation in life it's worth knowing, for the benefit of your own mental health, that there we are here, and you don't have to go through your suffering by all by yourself.

&gt;You and me, I think we're the exact fucking same.

&gt; I have an hour long commute. I have to wake up at 5 am, leave at 6 am, and be in by 7. I leave at 3 pm, and make it home at 4. I have to go to bed at 9 pm in order to wake up the next day not feeling like tired shit because the human body is a disgustingly inefficient thing.
&gt; 
&gt; The instant I get home at 4:30 pm, my mind goes into timer mode. I start counting the hours, the minutes, sometimes even the seconds. I have exactly four and a half hours to do things I want to do before I have to go back to the slog the next day. I need to cram that time with as much of the things I want to do as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; My weekends are the same. I wake up, and I start counting. Saturdays are less of a problem usually because I can wake up when I want and go to sleep whenever I want, but it's still there casting a shadow over everything. I get one day. One day out of seven where I don't feel stressed about waking up when I have to and sleeping when I have to. And when Saturday starts, I have twelve or fourteen or sixteen hours before Sunday. When Sunday starts, I have until 9 pm until my weekend is over.
&gt; 
&gt; When the forty-hour work week starts to get to you like it does to me, you start feeling stifled for time, and the paycheck you receive starts feeling worthless, because it's not like you can use that money to buy the time back.
&gt; 
&gt; This is your life, ending one hour, one minute, one second at a time, for forty hours a week. Maybe even more.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone asks you out, whether it's your SO or your friends, your parents, anyone, even if your relationships with them are happy and healthy, your brain can't help but make an automatic calculation. How much of my time will this take? How much will I have left until I have to go back to work? And when even the slightest thing goes wrong--if you forgot to get something at the store, if there's traffic, if someone makes a mistake and costs you more time, you start to resent it. You resent that delay, and the people who caused that delay, for wasting the precious free time you have, and every hour, every minute, every second that slips away is time that you don't get to spend doing the things you want to do.
&gt; 
&gt; Things you used to enjoy no longer provide the same fulfillment, because you can't stop that clock. You can't stop counting the hours, the minutes, the seconds. Even if you're enjoying yourself, even if you're having a blast and accomplishing a lot, even if at the end of the day you feel like a champion who is closer to your dream, that shadow is there, telling you that you only have this many hours, this many minutes, this many seconds left until you go back. Like a guillotine slowly inching its way towards your neck. And when you're having fun, that realization causes you to get jerked back into the real world.
&gt; 
&gt; Hey, fucker. Have a good time? I hope you did, because it's another forty hours until you can even start to get it back. Now start lifting, jackass. Your life doesn't become yours until we say it does.
&gt; 
&gt; My job doesn't suck. The work is nothing special, if a little tiring, but it's not murdering me. I work at a good company, my co workers are good people, my boss is a pretty understanding guy who always tries to be fair and helps out whenever he can. My pay isn't anything stellar but it's liveable, and some people would envy having it ($20 an hour).
&gt; 
&gt; But I get the sense that I'd feel like this with the vast majority of work. Forty hour work weeks, no matter what, get tedious, become meaningless, burn me out. The only way I can avoid it is to not work a day in my life--to do a job that I love. But how many people get jobs they love? How many people get paid liveable wages, enough to have a room and food, doing what they love? How many people even know what it is that they love to even pursue it in the first place?
&gt; 
&gt; The fact that the starving artist is a running joke in America--someone going hungry trying to do what they love--is the cruel reality. And the fact that we're okay with it and point and laugh with everyone else, even fake laughter, is the cruelest reality imaginable.
&gt; 
&gt; You want to do what you love? Fuck you. That's not how the real fucking world works, shitheel. Now hop to it, you've got forty hours of work to do, and if you want to fucking eat, you better fucking do it.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm reminded of that movie In Time, starring Justin Timberlake. It's a movie about a dystopian future where money has no more meaning, and people trade time. A coffee might cost thirty seconds, a cab fare might cost two minutes, a high quality mountain bicycle might be four months, a new sedan might be nine years.
&gt; 
&gt; There's a watch everyone has embedded in their arm that tells them how much time they have, and when the number reaches zero, they die. Some people have hundreds of years of time. Some people live minute to minute.
&gt; 
&gt; That's what I feel like. That some people have the rest of their lives to look forward to, with their 90 years of time, and here I am, scraping by with only a few hours on my clock every day before the clock hits zero and I die.
&gt; 
&gt; And in America, you can't talk to anyone about it. Nobody at all. Not really. Because even if some individual people might sympathize and wish they had less working hours alongside you, society will think of you as a lazy piece of shit who just wants to mooch off of others. All because you're not willing to surrender forty hours a week, one hundred and sixty hours a month, one thousand nine hundred and twenty hours a year for a paycheck. And you have to convince yourself that you need this paycheck, that you need this money in order to not get fucked in the ass by taxes and bills. You try, you try so hard to justify it. You need this money. You need to give up these forty hours to live. This is necessary. You try.
&gt; 
&gt; But it doesn't work. Not really. Not until it's too late.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been trying to search for a job where I can work from a home office. But for someone like me, there's no options. Everything requires more schooling, more experience, and getting schooling or experience requires time and money I don't have and can't get. And even then, I've only been at this job for a few months. I can't quit yet because I need to stay long enough for it to look good on my resume.
&gt; 
&gt; I know drugs will make it worse. Alcohol will make it worse. The most I can do is try to anesthetize myself with the activities that I used to like, activities that used to give my life meaning and purpose. I used to enjoy these things, but now the most these things can give me--these things I used to love and enjoy--is a distraction. A temporary illusion that I'm not miserable, which wears off at 9 pm every day.
&gt; 
&gt; There's a light at the end of the tunnel, and I can only hope that it's a train.

434,Hey all! Independent workers unite!,"I’ve seen this subreddit around but never subscribed to it before now and I’m contributing a bit to it.

I think we all should be able to decide our work. 

(this article is a super good read for dreamers and optimists: http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/ )

I dream, utopianly, of a future with a cohesive unit of countries that can build the most important infrastructural change of the way we see life, housing and work. 
This change is to give all of us a «platform».

I’m 21, but I began thinking about this when I was still in high school (2016). 

I know a lot of you here are like me; non-functioning in professional environments, not fond of routine, soul-crushing work and 40-hour workweeks (or more).

We are also creative souls, I’d argue there’s some burst of creativity in all of us when the platform of ours allows it.

I won’t go further in depth of all my utopian views on life (although I love talking about them) but I want to talk a little about this platform, and this vague idea of hope I have.

So essentially I dream of a collective platform for all human beings, with a package of a functional housing, food rations and other needed utilities.
Also essentially, how you’d imagine a scientist to plan a colony to live and function if they were set to live on Mars with sparse utilities.

With this collective platform, which we are more or less seeing built already today, to landlords big benefit
(hyper-functioning apartments with compact sizes costing a fortune for the ones living there), you’d have everything you needed for a humble living.

Not to go all Bernie Sanders on ya’ll, but if you’d do the math, I’m sure that the reason the enablement of this collective platform isn’t already available is one of greed, and not implausibility.

So with your basic essentials covered, it would allow everyone in this future to decide for themselves if they’d want to work or not.

You don’t want to work? No problem. You’ll not have an excess of currency that you can use to build on to your platform and your «resume», but you will be granted peace in your pursuit of whatever creative, earthly desires you want.

You want to work? Let’s redefine «work». Work is now *eustress*, meaning «positive stress», or stress that you are exposed to when working excessively towards a positive dream or desire.

This work, this *eustress*, is something I’d wager that absolutely most of us have. The value of your work is measured in your own enjoyment, and excess «building» towards your own platform is optional, not mandatory to live.

This idea is vague, not precise, but it captures the capitalist nature of the world and puts the humbleness of the working class up against the billionaire class.

The billionaire class is effectively opposing any worker’s utopia by collectively, subconsciously, using their own *eustress*, their dreams and workings, against the rest of the world’s *eustress*. 

Our current system, opposing our utopia, wishes constantly to measure and compare one’s work and wealth. This is extremely problematic when building a collective platform with a cohesive unit as it values one person over another, and there’s no way to do this consistently without it resulting in pure superficialcy.

Obviously, this will seem unachievable and utopian. Not to mention, *it is* possible to achieve a platform of stability and, thus, fight for *eustress* and one’s dream, in today’s system as well.

It is only natural that you’d work strongly towards your own well-being and your own dreams, especially when you know there’s a possible light at the end of the tunnel, instead of putting down your book and PC screen to fight the system that put the book and PC into your hands in the first place.

As said, my idea is vague, but here’s my ultimate goal of my idea: 

With a strong portion of the world sharing my burning desire of an *antiwork society*, I want to work one day to build a movement. For optionality. 

Tech automation is taking over the world. We should be able to, as humans, reap the benefits, not lose our source of income.

I hope one day I will have more clarity than I do today, in order to create a movement for a better world. I’ve learned that I can find happiness in just about any place of the world, as long as I’m working for something I believe in.",False,f6gprx,yung_pupper,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f6gprx/hey_all_independent_workers_unite/,2,1

438,Favourite antiwork quotes,"I'm looking for a quote to drop in at the beginning of a game I'm working on. I liked an snippet from Alan Watts' ""What if money was no object?"" speech. Here's the quote I liked:

...if you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time. You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don’t like doing, which is stupid. Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way.

I don't think speech is necessarily anti work, although it could be interpreted as such and that's why I'm thinking I shouldn't use it. I don't want to twist the message for a purpose it wasn't intended. The game itself is going to be a free release with no intention of commercial gain, so I think I have slightly more freedom in that sense.

My hopes are to start a small furniture repair/upcycle business but if that doesn't work out...well...there's always suicide. I just can't work for anyone else anymore and I'm only 28.

By friend's boss yelled at him in front of the entire office,

Because he was 13 minutes late to work.
“if you're late again, you won't have a job.”

He wasn’t even given a chance to explain himself. By friend
wanted to yell back, but bit his tongue, he needed the

income.

Over six months working at the company, it was the only
‘time he had ever been late.

In multiple occasions, he had even taken work home or
stayed late to prove this education.

During his lunch break he tested me: “I'm looking for
another job, let’s talk later.”

That's how fast loyalty can be destroyed.
Had his boss cared enough to ask why he was late, he
would've known about his very recent divorce and newfound
heart complications.

Now, my friend will never stay late or take work home again.

He will give his bare minimum effort until he secure another
position.

People leave because of poor leadership, to go where they
may be heard and appreciated.

Appreciation is more powerful than we think.
It can change someone's day.

489,hating work is a symptom,"on a daily basis we see the posts and comments dripping with hopelessness about OP hating his / her job. about office politics and how co-workers are making lives hell. crappy managers, jerk bosses, long hours and very often situations close to exploitation. asking for advice and wondering whether just quitting and even suicide wouldn't be a better alternative to the hell faced at work.

the reason why so many people are perplexed by why someone would hate work is that they dont understand that hating your job, that isnt the thing. it is a symptom. 

hating your job is a small piece in a large complex puzzle.

you dont hate the slog. you dont hate your boss. you dont hate your co-workers. you dont hate the commutes to work where you waste hours of your life. what you hate is the system and what it is doing to you. 

the system is forcing you to work because if you dont work you dont have money. if you dont have money all the dominoes come crashing down: landlord kicks you out, you cannot buy food, you cannot pay medical insurance. without money, we wouldnt be able to have this discussion.

this is how clever the capitalist system was designed: like a drug dealer it has made us addicted to the product. without it, our world spins out of control. think about the phrase ""to earn a living"". that has become more relevant than ever. earn the right to sleep under a roof. earn the right to eat. earn the right to be classed as ""normal"". ever look at a homeless person and think something negative about them? that is the system speaking in your voice.

everything you hate is a symptom of a bad system. a system using a mantra like ""hard work equals success"" as a carrot, always there in front of you and always out of reach.
 
hard work did have its place years ago. when the boomers were still in their youth. that is why most of the resistance to destroying the status quo comes from the boomer generation. It was easy to get a job. it was easy to raise a family. today: different ball game. how often have you heard the phrase ""when i was your age life was difficult""? sorry old timers, you have no idea what difficult is. today work has been weaponized and is used to keep the masses in line.

so the next time anyone says to you ""why do you hate your job?"" you could try to explain to them about how a system has been engineered to enslave us and is forcing us to work until we die, sometimes literally, or you could tell them to piss off.",False,f6p3sl,lovebrunettes,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f6p3sl/hating_work_is_a_symptom/,11,1

493,A wonderfully concise breakdown of why you hate working under capitalism (10 min read),"The following is a transcript of the 2-part video series titled ""What is capitalism?"" by Brendan McCooney.  I've taken the time to post them here as I feel this is the best 10-minute pitch of an analysis of capitalism I've come across on the internet.  Enjoy!

""Barter is a simple system of commodity exchange in which people trade one commodity for another. We can represent this with the diagram: C-C (commodity for commodity).

As trading grows, and there are more and more commodities to be traded, societies began to develop money. Money can be any universally desired commodity with a stable value: silver, gold, axes, cattle, etc. What makes money different from other commodities is the fact that it can be exchanged for any commodity. For instance, at one point in history the gold commodity could buy anything, but donkey commodities or potato commodities couldn’t. Thus, money became a way of expressing the value of any commodity—a property unique to one commodity which is singled out from all other commodities and given the name “money”.

So now, instead of C-C we have C-M-C (trading a commodity for money in order to trade for another commodity). Both types of exchange existed side by side for a long time before C-M-C began to dominate.

The establishment of money as a universal equivalent (a commodity which can buy anything) gives money status as the ultimate form of social power. People then, can be tempted to hoard money, not for the sake of buying commodities, but just for the sake of having more money.

Not only does money create this temptation, but it also requires some process where money is hoarded sometimes and then injected back into circulation at others. This is because we need to have just the right amount of money in circulation to represent the values of all the commodities that are being traded (C-M-C) at a given time. Commodity production is erratic. If we don’t have the right amount of money in circulation commodities either can’t circulate or circulate at erratic prices. The only way to solve this problem is to take money out of circulation when it’s not needed and then to inject it back in when it is.

So, with money there is both the possibility and the need for M-C-M, that is some process which circulates money just for the sake of circulating money. But why would someone want to trade money for an equal amount of money? This only makes sense if they are making MORE money from the trade than what they began with!

In C-M-C people are trading (with money) one commodity for another, because they have a use for the other commodity. In simple commodity production, people are exchanging these “uses” or “use values”.

But the purpose of M-C-M isn’t to trade use values at all but to get a greater quantity of the same thing: money. Instead of being qualitative it’s a quantitative process.

Now how do you get more money? With C-M-C exchange only happens if people agree to trade things for equal value. People measure the value of commodities with money and exchange them for money. If I sell something I’ve made for $10 and then go spend that $10 on stuff I am essentially trading $10 of my labor for $10 of other people’s labor. An equal exchange has taken place with the aid of money as a measuring of value. The value that is being measured corresponds to the amount of labor that has gone into making the commodity.

But if we are going to do M-C-M we need an unequal exchange. We need to end up with more money than we started with. How is this possible?

Well, I could sell a commodity for more than its worth, that is for more than its labor value. What happens when I do that? This can only work if I have a monopoly on selling this commodity, because if I’m selling for more than something’s worth other people can just undersell me. If I do have a monopoly I can count on the fact that I won’t have a monopoly forever. When one person profits from an unequal exchange it attracts other people into that industry. Soon there are competitors all trying to undersell each other, eating away at the profit margin until the product trades at its value again.

So, if there is a tendency for exchange to gravitate toward equal exchange, where do we get the profit we need for M-C-M? Exchange equalizes within a closed economic system where buyers and sellers are aware of what the money price is of all commodities. But what if there are were other people—somewhere else in a different economic community who valued commodities differently than us—maybe it was easier or harder for them to make some commodities and so we could benefit from unequal exchange with them. Or maybe commodity exchanged hadn’t even become generalized in their culture yet and so they didn’t have a good sense of the value of something.

This is exactly what the early merchant class was all about. Savvy traders traversed the globe looking for “bargains”: trying to find cultures willing to part with their pelts, spices, jewels and gold for less so they could return home with commodities and sell them for more. And when they couldn’t find unequal exchanges they made them in the form of theft. The early merchant class was rife with pirates who made a living from stealing commodities in order to sell them.

The other class that mastered M-C-M early on was the money lending class. By lending money to people and then charging them interest on the loan, the money lending class could turn a profit. This was called usury and it was frowned upon at many times in history, even outlawed at times.

It should be pointed out that neither merchant capital or usury actually created more value. They merely took commodities from one place and moved them to another. But this moving of commodities was such a source of wealth that it pushed traders and loans to the farthest corners of the universe in search of profit.

And so, the world was slowly brought together by merchants exploring the world looking for unequal exchanges to get rich off of. But whenever merchants pushed to the borders of the economic universe they found that the economic integration they had spawned had gone and created their worst nightmare: equal exchange. As cultures were brought into closer contact, as people began to find out how much things exchanged for in different places, as more and more merchants began traveling the same silk roads, it was harder and harder to find people to rip off.

And so those who lived by unequal exchange had to find new ways to make profit. They began to ask, “what if there was a magic commodity?  A commodity which could produce more value than it cost to buy?”

They found such a commodity—it was human labor.  


&amp;#x200B;

When I sell the products of my own labor on the market I get all the money myself. But what if I am selling my labor to someone else? If I sell my labor to a capitalist for a wage, the capitalist can pay less for my wage than he sells the commodity for. Thus, he transfers the inequality of profit in exchange into the production process.

Let’s take a closer look: when I sell something I’ve made myself on the open market, I am selling a commodity. When I sell my labor to someone else I am selling my labor power, that is, my capacity to do labor. How much I produce is subject to how hard I work, the quality of the tools and materials I use and the organization of the workplace. I’m paid by the hour, so the harder I work the more I can produce per hour. Thus, **the amount of money I’m paid doesn’t necessarily correspond to the amount of value I produce.** If it did the capitalist wouldn’t be making a profit. This is what capitalists do. They profit from inequality in the sphere of production instead of exchange. They are modern day pirates.

Why are workers willing to work for less than the value of what they produce? Wages, instead of being related to the value of the commodities workers produce, are related to the amount of money necessary to “reproduce the worker.” This is a fancy term for “what it takes to get the worker to show up for work the next day.” This usually means paying a worker enough for rent, food, entertainment and whatever else the general standard of living in a society requires. This cost of “reproducing the worker” varies from place to place over time as the standard of living adjusts to the whims of capitalist development. For instance, the standard of living for most Americans has fallen in the last 30 years making labor power cheaper for capitalists to buy.

But still this doesn’t explain why workers consent to this. After all, they choose to work for a wage rather than simply produce goods themselves. Well, many people do choose to work for themselves if they can. In fact, as real wages have fallen in the American economy the percentage of self-employed people has risen. But in order to produce commodities yourself you have to have access to tools, materials, a work area. We call all of these things “means of production.”

In a capitalist society a small amount of people (capitalists) own the vast majority of the means of production. Thus, workers have no choice but to sell their labor power for a wage to a capitalist. This has caused some people to refer to wage labor as “wage slavery.""

This didn’t just happen by accident one day. The process by which simple commodity producers—farmers, craftsmen, etc.—were deprived of their means of production so that they had to work as wage laborers was a long and violent one. It demolished communities, destroyed cultures, eroded feudalism, etc. This process, accomplished by dispossession, outright theft and usury, is often referred to as “primitive accumulation” to differentiate it from the “capitalist accumulation"" it made possible.

Along with the profits of merchant capital, primitive accumulation provided the money and capital needed to deprive most of the world of their means to produce and concentrate these means of production, as private property, in the hands of a relatively small class of people: the capitalist class.""",False,f6w9ak,m00py,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f6w9ak/a_wonderfully_concise_breakdown_of_why_you_hate/,4,3

1. No CEO has a salary + bonus structure that exceeds 20X the pay of the lowest worker

2.  No stock buybacks allowed using corporate cash or borrowed money^1

3. All employees are stakeholders and as such are entitled to a share of profits not to be less than 25%

4. All overseas production is if shipped back and sold in America is taxed at 50% of value.

5. Stock compensation is disallowed. 

6. Perks are considered earned income for those that enjoy them; private jet? The CEO pays for it or can choose to fly commercial.

For privately held companies, you'd be able to do whatever you wanted to do - pay yourself a trillion a year if you're the owner if you can get away with it.

And in the past months there was a lot of problems on the network meaning I often arrive late. My ""manager"" (horizontal management so no real manager but there is always one ""giving orders"" in a project in a big company) told me that I should be more cautious because everybody knows that bus and subways aren't reliable. 

But is it my resoonsability really? I mean, yes, I know that the company is expecting me to be there on time; but I usually am when the bus do their work. So why should it be my responsability to get up early to be sure to be there on time? I'm not stealing time from the company: the bus compamy does. So why should I take upon *my* personal time so that my professional time is not impaired? Am I asking to go out of work early because the bus might be late? No! So if buses are at fault I shouldn't have to try to go to work earlier. 

Sorry about the rant.

We don't share an office. We have separate offices right next to each other. They will often stand in my doorway or come into my office, sit down, and start chatting with me. I can barely manage to carry on with it lately. I smile and nod and say ""uh huh"" and ""oh that's nice"" a lot, trying to do my best. It's doubly hard because these two women are technically my bosses.

He then went on to say “how can you expect to be in this job for the next 40 years if you show up yawning? it’s not efficient.”

545,Work and the death of creatives,"I studied art at uni. I used to be so creative and motvated, I would make things all the time, I was able to see the beauty in everything. I can look back on the work I did then and even if I know I can do better now, I still love to see what I made during that time when there were no worries beyond finishng a project in time. 

Now I work a full time job doing something I don't care about. I finish at 6, get home after 7, have a shower and some dinner, and then it's basically nighttime. I spend my weekends doing chores, exhausted and ill from the dirty environment I work in. I've become an incredbly negative and cynical person. I try to make time for art and want to eventually go into creative freelancing, and I've definitely improved since uni, but with the amount of time and energy I have I'll be lucky to finish a single painting in less than a few weeks as long as I have this job. And even when I do, I can't feel it like I used to. I used to be able to immerse myself in my work on a level I can't even imagine doing today. It makes me sad.

Metallica and The Beatles didn't work full time, they lived off the dole and on tiny amounts they made from small gigs. They went on to become some of the biggest most respected musicians of all time. All the great scientists of the 1800's that laid the foundations for modern science were only able to do so because they were very rich and could spend their time not working. Hidetaka Miyazaki worked a bland job in an office and took an over 50% pay cut to go and work for FromSoftware and eventually create Dark Souls. What if he hadn't been able to survive after that pay cut? He would have wasted his life in a dull corporate job and the world would have missed out. We will never have another band as groundbreaking and influential as The Beatles. How can anyone have time to form one? Practicing all day every day like all the greats used to isn't an option anymore.

Imagine a society where everyone could dedicate themselves to the things that they're passionate about, instead of having to spend 40+ hours a week on stupid bullshit. How much great art never got made because the artist had all of their time and motivation crushed and ripped away by a system that doesn't give a shit? How many great scientists end up having their talent and ideas wasted so they can work at for-profit labs that do nothing to further human knowledge towards the greater good? I don't understand this mentality where people can just get a job doing whatever and as long as they have a job, they can spend their whole lives on it and not ever think of what could be and that's fine. 

I know a lot of people don't care about art, and especially outside the antiwork sphere it's dismissed as a hopeless career and even financial suicide. It's insanely competitive and only a tiny fraction of artists out there go on to actually get somewhere, and even then a lot of them just end up in advertising. But even people that think they don't enjoy art have surely enjoyed a book, or a movie, a song, architecture, fashion, photography, video games, or the many many other mediums that don't immediately come to mind when most people think art. It's about more than just paintings and sculptures art galleries, it's about making stories and adding colour and feeling to the world. And if art is continually dismissed in favour of a shit retail job or whatever, if people are not allowed to do things that aren't immediately financially lucrative, then the only art we will see will be in advertising or produced by a market research panel.

TL:DR 40+ hour work weeks are killing art and probably science too.

551,Work is actually a good thing. Please read it all.,"Work is a good thing. 

Hear me out before you downvote and move on please, people need goals to be satisfied in life. People need to work towards and achieve their goals. Many people who win the lottery blow it all, often become depressed, sometimes even commit suicide after winning massive amounts of money. That is because they never worked towards winning that money. Suicide, depression, defeatism etc is actually larger in developed countries than developing countries. The average suicide victim seems to be depressed middle-upper class. 

The problem is our work is often meaningless, the HR department that set the goals make it all very superficial, the rewards aren't really rewarding. Our idea of goal attainment as a society is very, very wrong. For example why do feminists always think of equality as careers, their is a big push to get people of colour and women into STEM fields and work in politics and science, and I just think why? If a woman wants to work as a painter and finds great enjoyment working towards her goals, doing a good job and making a living from painting why not just let her do that, only because of our society do we think she is not equal to someone working in a science field, it doesn't matter if she has no passion for science, they don't care, as long as she is working a job that fits societies expectations. 

In order for a human to not become depressed they need their own goals from a place of passion, not from societies expectations. 

It is just human psychology, why would anyone play a game where everything is unlocked from the start? people enjoy difficulty and working towards achieving their goals. Just look how many only video games are based on ranking up and competition with others. Think about how popular league of legends and counter strike is.

So basically this friend has worked in this job position for a meager salary many years with just annual inflation adjustment raise (about 2-3%). Sometimes the adjustment was even held up when the boss claimed ""funding problems"". She was even cut to PT for quite a while because of another ""funding problem"". She was taken for granted and belittled for so long that she finally got fed up and found another job.

The real drama started after she handed in two-week notice. The boss suddenly claimed her being ""irreplaceable"" and said ""although he didn't have problem with her going for a higher pay position, she should give two months of notice"". Later on, he even demanded her coming back on weekends to train his new staff on a VOLUNTEER basis without any pay or with a gift certificate gesture of $50 per day of work (even this was at the suggestion of HR personnel) after she departs for her new job. She was simply astonished and enraged at such narcissism.  She wondered what her soon to be ex-boss would do if she refused such ""generous offer"". Would he just spread the rumor to her new employer or ask HR to list her as ""ineligible for re-hire"" for the future background check?

Well, many of you suggested that you just quit the job you hate for your psychological benefit.

584,It looks like a cult or a sick play,"When I look for a job, all I see is demands like 'you have to be client-oriented' or 'motivated'. These things are generally vague and it seems most employers know it's all nonsense. 

So, in the end, you read all these requirements and write in you CV that you actually have these qualities. All the while you know it's absurd and you know nobody cares about this shit anyway. The employer reads your CV and understands that you have all the required qualities, but I guess, fully understands that people write that in their CVs because that's how you're supposed to act if you want to get a job. Thus, you know you aren't like that, the employer knows that no one needs most of these qualities (how do you measure it anyway?) and yet we all have to pretend like it's all very serious. It's like some experiment with dogs or monkeys: they have to put the ball in the right place, the red ball in one box, the blue ball -- in another. So, you have to read what you have to be like, write it in your CV and the employer will understand that you get the game. 

Talking to people during job interviews is very strange. They look like mostly normal people, but play this stupid game with all the jargon and all the techniques they've learned in those never-ending seminars about 'human resources' management.

But that's not really my point. This pissed me off so I applied to another job offering 15K more. I was hoping to leverage this higher offer into a raise at my current place. And then I did a ton of research and found it's not possible because I am not a human with wants and needs, there is no justice, performance doesn't equal recognition.

619,Boundaries in the Workplace,"I’ve noticed a lot of posts by people in this sub talk about being overworked, frustrated and sometimes suicidal because of their jobs. We can arguably chalk a bit of that up to a broken capitalist system that doesn’t favor the majority of people (American here, but I’m sure this frustration is felt elsewhere). Does the system need changed? Clearly. But in the meantime, the biggest impact I’ve had with general workplace frustrations has been to establish boundaries for myself and to follow them as much as I can. 

These are things I’ve noticed over the years that I’d assume to be universally true throughout the workforce; I’ll refer to them in this post as ‘truths’. I’m going to use them as fact here for the purpose of this argument and these boundaries:

	◦	There will always be more work. 

	◦	You will be asked or told to take on more tasks than you initially had.

	◦	You will be asked or told to work more than what you should average.

	◦	You are responsible for your own actions, thoughts and feelings. 

	◦	You are not responsible for the actions, thoughts and feelings of others. 

	◦	You cannot predict the future with reasonable or realistic accuracy. Not necessarily a work thing, but it’s important.

There’s arguably more (your boss is not your friend), but these listed truths feel more universal to me. You can add or subtract as you wish, and if you notice other universal truths that I may have overlooked, I will edit them into this writing and cite your username.

I can reasonably adjust my boundaries, but I MUST have them and I MUST stick to them. This is the power I have, and I will not give it away. I cannot predict the consequences, but I recognize that there will be some; most of the time, my direct supervisor has respected my boundaries. But I see the struggle every day on these forums and at my own workplace, and having boundaries might help deal with at least some of the listed truths we all face. 

The Starting Place for Boundaries

	◦	Proper safety gear/regulations: you have the right to be safe at work. If you don’t have the right equipment/protective gear to perform a task, I’ll make sure to provide it if I can, or find someone who will. I won’t perform tasks without proper equipment. If it’s not safe to do something, I voice that concern through the chain of command, and if I still don’t like the answer, I move up with that concern until it’s fleshed out enough to show it’s not a concern or until something is done about it. If someone comes to me with a safety concern, I’ll follow up with a safety rep and get that issue addressed. If someone asks or tells me to do something that’s unsafe, I politely refuse, and if possible, I suggest alternate ways to complete the task. I never ask anyone to perform work that’s unsafe. 

	◦	Proper training: some jobs will wear your body out or just generally be unsafe if you don’t have the proper technique. On top of that, if you’re not properly trained, you will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of workplace performance. Most places I’ve worked have subpar training courses, and some have had none at all; it’s all tribal on-the-job experience with no direction at all. If I’m not sure what’s going on, I find out what I’m supposed to be responsible for, and make sure I understand that job and what’s expected of me. 

	◦	Roles and responsibilities: Your roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined. During a training at work recently, they mentioned not knowing what’s expected of you accounted for the majority of stress in the workplace. Personally, when I’ve been in that situation, and when I’ve seen people in that situation, it gets noticeably more stressful. If your role, responsibilities, goals or deadlines, etc aren’t clearly defined, ask for clarification. If that’s not clear, persist until it is clear. 

	◦	Workplace culture: you have the right and responsibility to create a workplace culture that is fair, inclusive, and generally positive for yourself and others. I’ve met some bitter people at every job I’ve had. They shit on every single thing that comes up without thought; if it’s happening, it’s bad. Did we get a raise? The raise isn’t enough. Are we reworking processes to make jobs easier for people? They’re doing it wrong. I don’t want to be like that; I want to be open to ideas from anyone, even if they aren’t necessarily feasible. Encouragement requires nothing, and opens doors to everything. I also try to call out elitist behavior, racism, sexism, age discrimination, slurs, and any other bullshit; sometimes it’s difficult to do but I always win those battles. There’s no reason to denigrate entire groups of people like that. I’m not perfect and nobody else is either, but there’s a pretty clear line when it comes to those behaviors listed. 

	◦	Respect in the workplace: you have the right to be respected, and it’s your responsibility to respect those you work with and for as well. Demand it in your every action. You’re putting in the time like everyone else. Working hard doesn’t matter; it’s a bullshit misnomer to get people riled up about their fellow peers. If you or your coworkers aren’t able to complete the tasks as assigned, that’s the fault of the business, not the employee (don’t argue outliers; jobs should be doable by damn near the entire bell curve of people qualified). In my 8 years at this company, I’ve never let anyone yell at me about doing my job. And even when they get heated and make threats or whatever, I make it clear that I’m doing my job as assigned, and that’s all I’m responsible for. If I feel like doing extra, I will. But it’s not required and I won’t work like it is. My company has clear rules against retaliation that management takes very seriously, but you have the right to be safe from retaliation. 

	◦	Hours and Days worked: you have the right to know your schedule in a reasonable amount of time before those days or hours arrive; in jobs with flexible schedules, you have the right to set your schedule as needed, and your employer must work with that without retaliation. Every job is different here; some places have set schedules, some have flexible ones, some are dependent on business. But realistically, any business should know how many people they need, when they need them, and for how long. There’s algorithms for everything; just make a usable schedule. Flex people: Once you set a schedule, and your employer okays that schedule, they need to stick with that, and when they make a mistake, it’s their responsibility to correct it without retaliation. 
	◦	Overtime: you have the right to be paid overtime in accordance with state and federal laws (check them out; my employer is badass so I’ve never had to question it but there’s obviously shysters out there). You are giving a set amount of time in exchange for a wage; when you give more than that, you deserve fair compensation. This applies to any hourly or salary employee. Again, check the law, and track your time, and hold your employer accountable for payments owed to you. 

	◦	Working from/at home: you must be compensated for the time you put in for your employer. In the modern age, working from home is a privilege that is offered to some people so they can handle family situations like children and such, but some people put in their time at work, and then bring their work home. If you are not getting paid for 100% of your time, you should not be working. Don’t answer emails, don’t take calls, nothing. If you’re not being paid or you haven’t arranged to be compensated for those activities, you should not be doing them. 

	◦	Pay or wages and benefits: never work for free. You have the right to a fair and living wage. You have the right to negotiate your wage. You have the right to talk about your wage with other employees or people outside your place of employment. A defined living wage probably depends on your geographical region; it’s more expensive to live in New York than Alabama. But if you’re going in for a job, you should negotiate for the wage you need. And if they don’t bite, or just shit on you about it, you don’t have to accept that job. Again, this is gonna be subjective as hell, but if we want serious wage changes, we have to draw lines in the sand that we will not cross. If benefits are given to you, you have the right to claim them without retaliation. Sick days should be used. Vacation should be used. Since they’re given to you specifically to use, they are yours and you use them without shame or guilt. 

Boundaries aren’t limited to these alone, but this covers some of the basic things that happen in every workplace. If we draw that line, and stick to it, employers will make changes; they need us, whether they admit it or not. Enforce these boundaries, and make sure others see you do it. Post them somewhere for people to read. Add to them based on your own workplace. If you’re an employer, post them in your workplace and follow them; encourage others to follow them as well. Change happens when people take individual stands and then unite in an effort to improve conditions and expand opportunities. This is your own personal revolution.

Full disclosure: I know that I’m privileged here. I’m a young-ish, white male, college educated, and I work in a white-male-dominated auto factory in a state with a mostly white population, which runs pretty conservative. I didn’t start in an office job, but it was clear I had a leg up to get there based on testing, education, skin color and youth. I worked a lot of shit jobs before that, and I’ve worked some shit jobs in the plant as well. It hasn’t always been a cakewalk but it’s much easier now that I’m in a position that’s more mentally challenging for me, as well as a good wage. So before you take these boundaries as gospel (or bullshit lol), just keep in mind what kind of edge you may have in your own workplace, and what kind of pitfalls might be around the corner without these privileges. Only you know what works for you. And while ideals feed our motivation, meals feed our bodies. 

Good luck to everyone struggling out there. Hopefully with enough resistance we can make some change happen for the better.",False,f3dfnd,JohnJonJaunJahn,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f3dfnd/boundaries_in_the_workplace/,1,1

One day in th grade our principal came into the
homeroom class and wrote on the board ""$19.32"" in
big numbers. He got our attention and announced to
the class: ""His (pointing at the number) is what you
are worth. Very day you come to class, the school
gets $19.32 from the state for each of you. To if

you are sick, you should still come to class, go to the
nurse, and get sent home. That way the school will
still get its $19.32.""

That was the day I stopped daring about school. I'm
pretty sure he was trying to increase attendance
and believed what he said was positive. But when a
person you're supposed to respect tells you you're
worth less than a 20 dollar bill. ..

Today 9a.m. came and went and I didn’t receive the call (that we confirmed yesterday evening 😒) and instead got an email from the same dude asking when I’m available today. Umm...wtf. So I replied and said something to the effect of “hey sorry I thought we were scheduled for earlier this morning and I was under the impression you’d be calling me since your contact number wasn’t provided and you have mine. Let me know if you’d like me to call you instead.” 

The response “oh no worries, so can you do 1:30 pm today?”

No explanation as to why a reschedule was needed, no apologies for wasting my time, nothing. Nope. I’m not playing this game.

627,I was basically fired for not letting my employers treat me like trash.,"This might get kinda long, fair warning.

I recently took a job at a warehouse for minimum wage. Things are pretty rough in unemployment department where I live and the job I had wasn’t consistent enough to pay the bills, so I basically had to suck it up and take the job even tho it’s way less than I usually get paid. The job is also about a 2 hour bus ride both ways and often I wouldn’t get home til very late giving me no time to do anything for myself and too exhausted to look for any better employment.

Now for minimum wage I expected to just be a cog in the machine and they’d give me some menial task to keep me busy all day. To my surprise the boss is introducing me to everyone and telling them I’ll be in charge of shipping through the day shift. I just think he means I’ll be back there doing shipping things all day or whatever, but after a few days I slowly realize how much responsibility is being shoved in my lap. The training was fucking terrible with nobody wanting to properly explain anything. I like to pride myself on being very quick to learn on the job so I picked it up very quickly and within 2 weeks I was already training new employees, of which there were new ones almost every day do to the high turnover rate, as well as catching shit for stuff that would happen in “my area” since I was in charge of shipping. I’ll be honest tho, I was crushing it and was really trying show that I’m worth more and deserve a raise, and it seemed like I was actually going to get one. On Thursday my boss mentioned wanting to talk to me about taking on even more responsibility at work and I was fully ready to tell him no for unless I got more money. The day was crazy busy and we never got to talk tho. The day was actually so crazy busy that I was having trouble finding time for my breaks all day. I was visibly frustrated when night shift came on and the shift manager basically told me I wasn’t allowed to take a break until a bunch of skids were finished and loaded up. This whole job was on my minimum wage shoulders and I had reached my boiling point. I angrily finished the work and loaded it and still was denied my break because for some reason the paperwork and computer stuff was also my job, even tho I’d never been shown how to do it. This lead to a screaming match with the shift manager who then sent me home with only 15 mins left on my shift.

Well I come in yesterday fully ready to quit unless they pay me more. Even had a very good conversation with the boss and he was going to go make a case for my raise to the branch manager. Instead he comes back with my final pay cheque. They had decided based on the word of the night shift manager, who had of course lied and exaggerated the whole encounter, to just let me go. My boss didn’t even get a chance to pitch my case and the person who decided on my firing had never even seen the quality of my work. I had basically put that entire fucked up busy day on my back and carried it to the finish line, but none of it mattered because of what happened in the last 15 mins of my shift after I was treated like a fucking dog with zero rights.

And people wonder why I feel like employers are just out to scam me wherever I go. They fucking are.

I just wanted to let out some steam.
I work at custom support for an online casino, since I've started studying I'm only there 3 times a week so it's bareble although the work is terrible. Anyway, honestly I fell like I could write a whole blog about how terrible my job is and how much I hate it despite that the money is not to bad I guess, but that's exactly the point of this post today because what is all the money in the world good for if you're just miserable.

So at work we have this policy that they except you to come a little bit earlier before your shift starts, which I  understand, if you don't start on time your co-workers are forced to take call or chats from customers although they might be on break or something like that. So I understand it's only fair to the others. Also they pay us extra if get there earlier starting from 20 minutes erlier. But as I have mentioned I started studying now and lately I couldn't make it that early and I even came a few minutes (5 minutes top) to late. I just have been really stressed with a lot of things and I just couldn't make it that early to work. 
The other day we received a message form work that we should manage our time better since a lot of people have been coming ""too late"" (meaning not twenty minutes early). Today I was 3 minutes before my shift starts at work and I alr already got shot on by the shift managers. I told them them that I understand that I should be ready to work when my shift starts but that I'm here and I will be ready and so I was, exactly when my shift started I started taking chats and phone calls. Later my boss talked to me(to be fair it was a friendly talk). I repeated pretty much what I said before and told him again that I usually do come earlier to work sometimes even 30 minutes. Now he said he would mention it to me if it weren't a problem. Whatever I smiled it off told him I will try to come earlier again and that's it. But then I checked my clock-in times. Well as you can imagine and as I mentioned before I'm actually always on time and start shift as requested earlier. Fuck this place.

\- Passion for the work I do

\- Pay my bills and debt

\- Support my loved ones who may not be able to work themselves (due to numerous genuine reasons)

\- Need a reason to shave, shower, make my hair and groom myself 

\- Not get depressed staying home

Passion:

Ok so, if you’re doing it for passion, would you still work if you weren’t paid for it?  Money wins always. What you call passion is actually something else. It’s an incentive which is recognition or appreciation leading to money J

Pay my bills:

Ok this is a genuine reason. Not refuting this one. But what a life it is to live just to pay bills. Rather than work, explore other options in doing some small business or create a plan to get rid of bills forever (other than suicideJ).

Support loved ones:

Alright so you have kids and you need to support them since they can’t work as of yet. Genuine reason. Period.

Need a reason to shave and groom

Comon man, you can do that even better if you don’t work. These nuts….

Not get depressed:

If you don’t work, you have 8 hours to do countless shit to not get depressed. Go figure. The very idea of working to not get depressed is itself fuckin depressing.

So, going through all dis, I guess **supporting loved ones** and those who cannot work (very old good parents, sick wife or husband etc) is a genuine reason. If that’s your reason, by all means, continue to work because it’s the only thing left in you to make you human.

660,I'm getting a lot of guilt trips for not wanting to move closer to my new job and it's making want to pull my hair out.,"I don't even know if this is the right place to ask. I'm stressing out of my mind here. 

I work in a small town paint store and I was offered a management position in another smaller town 50 miles south of where I am now. Me and my family have a lot of roots where we are at. Our parents are here, my wife's business, dentist, eye doctor, pediatrician, tax people, best friends, etc. 

Me and my wife settled on perhaps living just south of our current town to cut about 10 minutes off my commute time. Instead of taking 50-55 minutes it would take anywhere from 35-45 to get to work. Me and my wife got really excited thinking about this prospect, but my family and my current boss/fellow employees are throwing all sorts of doubt.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of years before he was convicted of securities fraud, Martin Shkreli was the chief executive of a pharmaceutical company that acquired the rights to Daraprim, a lifesaving antiparasitic drug. Previously the drug cost $13.50 a pill, but in Shkreli’s hands, the price quickly increased by a factor of 56, to $750 a pill. At a health care conference, Shkreli told the audience that he should have raised the price even higher. “No one wants to say it, no one’s proud of it,” he explained. “But this is a capitalist society, a capitalist system and capitalist rules.” 

This is a capitalist society. It’s a fatalistic mantra that seems to get repeated to anyone who questions why America can’t be more fair or equal. But around the world, there are many types of capitalist societies, ranging from liberating to exploitative, protective to abusive, democratic to unregulated. When Americans declare that “we live in a capitalist society” — as a real estate mogul told The Miami Herald last year when explaining his feelings about small-business owners being evicted from their Little Haiti storefronts — what they’re often defending is our nation’s  peculiarly brutal economy. “Low-road capitalism,” the University of Wisconsin-Madison sociologist Joel Rogers has called it. In a capitalist society that goes low, wages are depressed as businesses compete over the price, not the quality, of goods; so-called unskilled workers are typically incentivized through punishments, not promotions; inequality reigns and poverty spreads. In the United States, the richest 1 percent of Americans own 40 percent of the country’s wealth, while a larger share of working- age people (18-65) live in poverty than in any other nation belonging to the THE 1619 PROJECT Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (O.E.C.D.).

Or consider worker rights in different capitalist nations. In Iceland, 90 percent of wage and salaried workers belong to trade unions authorized to fight for living wages and fair working conditions. Thirty-four percent of Italian workers are unionized, as are 26 percent of Canadian workers. Only 10 percent of American wage and salaried workers carry union cards. The O.E.C.D.scoresnatiioionsalong a number of indicators, such as how countries regulate temporary work arrangements. Scores run from 5 (“very strict”) to 1 (“very loose”). Brazil scores 4.1 and Thailand, 3.7, signaling toothy regulations on temp work. Further down the list are Norway (3.4), India (2.5) and Japan (1.3). The United States scored 0.3, tied for second to last place with Malaysia. How easy is it to fire workers? Countries like Indonesia (4.1) and Portugal (3) have strong rules about severance pay and reasons for dismissal. Those rules relax somewhat in places like Denmark (2.1) and Mexico (1.9). They virtually disappear in the United States, ranked dead last out of 71 nations with a score of 0.5. Those searching for reasons the American economy is uniquely severe and unbridled have found answers in many places (religion, politics, culture). But recently, historians have pointed persuasively to the gnatty fields of Georgia and Alabama, to the cotton houses and slave auction blocks, as the birthplace of America’s low-road approach to capitalism. 

Slavery was undeniably a font of phenomenal wealth. By the eve of the Civil War, the Mississippi Valley was home to more millionaires per capita than anywhere else in the United States. Cotton grown and picked by enslaved workers was the nation’s most valuable export. The combined value of enslaved people exceeded that of all the railroads and factories in the nation. New Orleans boasted a denser concentration of banking capital than New York City. What made the cotton economy boom in the United States, and not in all the other far-flung parts of the world with climates and soil suitable to the crop, was our nation’s unflinching willingness to use violence on nonwhite people and to exert its will on seemingly endless supplies of land and labor. Given the choice between modernity and barbarism, prosperity and poverty, lawfulness and cruelty, democracy and totalitarianism, America chose all of the above. 

Nearly two average American lifetimes (79 years) have passed since the end of slavery, only two. It is not surprising that we can still feel the looming presence of this institution, which helped turn a poor, fledgling nation into a financial colossus. The surprising bit has to do with the many eerily specific ways slavery can still be felt in our economic life. “American slavery is necessarily imprinted on the DNA of American capitalism,” write the historians Sven Beckert and Seth Rockman. The task now, they argue, is “cataloging the dominant and recessive traits” that have been passed down to us, tracing the unsettling and often unrecognized lines of descent by which America’s national sin is now being visited upon the third and fourth generations. 

&amp;#x200B;



They picked in long rows, bent bodies shuffling through cotton fields white in bloom. Men, women and children picked, using both hands to hurry the work. Some picked in Negro cloth, their raw product returning to them by  way of New England mills. Some picked completely naked. Young children ran water across the humped rows, while overseers peered down from horses. Enslaved workers placed each cotton boll into a sack slung around their necks. Their haul would be weighed after the sunlight stalked away from the fields and, as the freedman Charles Ball recalled, you couldn’t “distinguish the weeds from the cotton plants.” If the haul came up light, enslaved workers were often whipped. “A short day’s work was always punished,” Ball wrote 

Cotton was to the 19th century what oil was to the 20th: among the world’s most widely traded commodities. Cotton is everywhere, in our clothes, hospitals, soap. Before the industrialization of cotton, people wore expensive clothes made of wool or linen and dressed their beds in furs or straw. Whoever mastered cotton could make a killing. But cotton needed land. A field could only tolerate a few straight years of the crop before its soil became depleted. Planters watched as acres that had initially produced 1,000 pounds of cotton yielded only 400 a few seasons later. The thirst for new farmland grew even more intense after the invention of the cotton gin in the early 1790s. Before the gin, enslaved workers grew more cotton than they could clean. The gin broke the bottleneck, making it possible to clean as much cotton as you could grow. 

The United States solved its land shortage by expropriating millions of acres from Native Americans, often with military force, acquiring Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Florida. It then sold that land on the cheap — just $1.25 an acre in the early 1830s ($38 in today’s dollars) — to white settlers. Naturally, the first to cash in were the land speculators. Companies operating in Mississippi flipped land, selling it soon after purchase, commonly for double the price. Enslaved workers felled trees by ax, burned the underbrush and leveled relic of the conflict between federal and state power over the earth for planting. “Whole forests were literally dragged out by the roots."" John Parker, an enslaved worker, remembered. A lush, twisted mass of vegetation was replaced by a single crop. An origin of American money exerting its will on the Earth, spoiling the environment for profit, is found in the cotton plantation. Floods became bigger and more common. The lack of biodiversity exhausted the soil and, to quote the historian Walter Johnson, “rendered one of the richest agricultural regions of the earth dependent on upriver trade for food.” 

As slave labor camps spread throughout the South, production surged. By 1831, the country was delivering nearly half the world’s raw cotton crop, with 350 million pounds picked that year. Just four years later, it harvested 500 million pounds. Southern white elites grew rich, as did their counterparts in the North, who erected textile mills to form, in the words of the Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner, an “unhallowed alliance between the lords of the lash and the lords of the loom.” The large-scale cultivation of cotton hastened the invention of the factory, an institution that propelled the Industrial Revolution and changed the course of history. In 1810, there were 87,000 cotton spindles in America. Fifty years later, there were five million. Slavery, wrote one of its defenders in De Bow’s Review, a widely read agricultural magazine, was the “nursing mother of the prosperity of the North.” Cotton planters, millers and consumers were fashioning a new economy, one that was global in scope and required the movement of capital, labor and products across long distances. In other words, they were fashioning a capitalist economy. “The beating heart of this new system,” Beckert writes, “was slavery.” 



Perhaps you’re reading this at work, maybe at a multinational corporation that runs like a soft-purring engine. You report to someone, and someone reports to you. Everything is tracked, recorded and analyzed, via vertical reporting systems, double-entry record-keeping and precise quantification. Data seems to hold sway over every operation. It feels like a cutting-edge approach to management, but many of these techniques that we now take for granted were developed by and for large plantations. 

When an accountant depreciates an asset to save on taxes or when a midlevel manager spends an afternoon filling in rows and columns on an Excel spreadsheet, they are repeating business procedures whose roots twist back to slave-labor camps. And yet, despite this, “slavery plays almost no role in histories of management,” notes the historian Caitlin Rosenthal in her book “Accounting for Slavery.” Since the 1977 publication of Alfred Chandler’s classic study, “The Visible Hand,” historians have tended to connect the development of modern business practices to the 19th-century railroad industry, viewing plantation slavery as pre-capitalistic, even primitive. It’s a more comforting origin story, one that protects the idea that America’s economic ascendancy developed not because of, but in spite of, millions of black people toiling on plantations. But management techniques used by 19th-century corporations were implemented during the previous century by plantation owners.

Planters aggressively expanded their operations to capitalize on economies of scale inherent to cotton growing, buying more enslaved workers, investing in large gins and presses and experimenting with different seed varieties. To do so, they developed complicated workplace hierarchies that combined a central office, made up of owners and lawyers in charge of capital allocation and long-term strategy, with several divisional units, responsible for different operations. Rosenthal writes of one plantation where the owner supervised a top lawyer, who supervised another lawyer, who supervised an overseer, who supervised three bookkeepers, who supervised 16 enslaved head drivers and specialists (like bricklayers), who supervised hundreds of enslaved workers. Everyone was accountable to someone else, and plantations pumped out not just cotton bales but volumes of data about how each bale was produced. This organizational form was very advanced for its time, displaying a level of hierarchal complexity equaled only by large government structures, like that of the British Royal Navy.  

Like today’s titans of industry, planters understood that their profits climbed when they extracted maximum effort out of each worker. So they paid close attention to inputs and outputs by developing precise systems of record-keeping. Meticulous bookkeepers and overseers were just as important to the productivity of a slave-labor camp as field hands. Plantation entrepreneurs developed spreadsheets, like Thomas Affleck’s “Plantation Record and Account Book,” which ran into eight editions circulated until the Civil War. Affleck’s book was a one-stop-shop accounting manual, complete with rows and columns that tracked per- worker productivity. This book “was really at the cutting edge of the  informational technologies available to businesses during this period,” Rosenthal told me. “I have never found anything remotely as complex as Affleck’s book for free labor.” Enslavers used the book to determine end-of- the-year balances, tallying expenses and revenues and noting the causes of their biggest gains and losses. They quantified capital costs on their land, tools and enslaved workforces, applying Affleck’s recommended interest rate. Perhaps most remarkable, they also developed ways to calculate depreciation, a breakthrough in modern management procedures, by assessing the market value of enslaved workers over their life spans. Values generally peaked between the prime ages of 20 and 40 but were individually adjusted up or down based on sex, strength and temperament: people reduced to data points. 

This level of data analysis also allowed planters to anticipate rebellion. Tools were accounted for on a regular basis to make sure a large number of axes or other potential weapons didn’t suddenly go missing. “Never allow any slave to lock or unlock any door,” advised a Virginia enslaver in 1847. In this way, new bookkeeping techniques developed to maximize returns also helped to ensure that violence flowed in one direction, allowing a minority of whites to control a much larger group of enslaved black people. American planters never forgot what happened in Saint- Domingue (now Haiti) in 1791, when enslaved workers took up arms and revolted. In fact, many white enslavers overthrown during the Haitian Revolution relocated to the United States and started over. 

Overseers recorded each enslaved worker’s yield. Accountings took place not only after nightfall, when cotton baskets were weighed, but throughout the workday. In the words of a North Carolina planter, enslaved workers were to be “followed up from day break until dark.” Having hands line-pick in rows sometimes longer than five football fields allowed overseers to spot anyone lagging behind. The uniform layout of the land had a logic; a logic designed to dominate. Faster workers were placed at the head of the line, which encouraged those who followed to match the captain’s pace. When enslaved workers grew ill or old, or became pregnant, they were assigned to lighter tasks. One enslaver established a “sucklers gang” for nursing mothers, as well as a “measles gang,” which at once quarantined those struck by the virus and ensured that they did their part to contribute to the productivity machine. Bodies and tasks were aligned with rigorous exactitude. In trade magazines, owners swapped advice about the minutiae of planting, including slave diets and clothing as well as the kind of tone a master should use. In 1846, one Alabama planter advised his fellow enslavers to always give orders “in a mild tone, and try to leave the impression on the mind of the negro that what you say is the result of reflection.” The devil (and his profits) were in the details. 

The uncompromising pursuit of measurement and scientific accounting displayed in slave plantations predates industrialism. Northern factories would not begin adopting these techniques until decades after the Emancipation Proclamation. As the large slave-labor camps grew increasingly efficient, enslaved black people became America’s first modern workers, their productivity increasing at an astonishing pace. During the 60 years leading up to the Civil War, the daily amount of cotton picked per enslaved worker increased 2.3 percent a year. That means that in 1862, the average enslaved fieldworker picked not 25 percent or 50 percent as much but 400 percent as much cotton than his or her counterpart did in 1801. 

Today's modern technology has facilitated unremitting workplace  supervision, particularly in the service sector. Companies have developed software that records workers’ keystrokes and mouse clicks, along with randomly capturing screenshots multiple times a day. Modern-day  workers are subjected to a wide variety of surveillance strategies, from drug tests and closed-circuit video monitoring to tracking apps and even devices that sense heat and motion. A 2006 survey found that more than a third of companies with work forces of 1,000 or more had staff members who read through employees' outbound emails. The technology that accompanies this workplace supervision can make it feel futuristic. But it's only the technology that's new. The core impulse behind the technology pervaded plantations, which sought innermost control over the bodies of their enslaved work force.  

The cotton plantation was America’s first big business, and the nation’s first corporate Big Brother was the overseer.  And behind every cold calculation, every rational fine-tuning of the system, violence lurked. Plantation owners used a combination of incentives and punishments to  squeeze as much as possible out of enslaved workers. Some beaten workers passed out from the pain and woke up vomiting. Some “danced” or “trembled” with every hit. An 1829 first-person account from Alabama recorded an overseer’s shoving the faces of women he thought had picked too slow into their cotton baskets and opening up their backs. To the historian Edward Baptist, before the Civil War, Americans “lived in an economy whose bottom gear was torture. 



There is some comfort, I think, in attributing the sheer brutality of slavery to dumb racism. We imagine pain being inflicted somewhat at random, doled out by the stereotypical white overseer, free but poor. But a good many overseers weren’t allowed to whip at will. Punishments were authorized by the higher-ups. It was not so much the rage of the poor white Southerner but the greed of the rich white planter that drove the lash. The violence was neither arbitrary nor gratuitous. It was rational, capitalistic, all part of the plantation’s design. “Each individual having a stated number of pounds of cotton to pick,” a formerly enslaved worker, Henry Watson, wrote in 1848, “the deficit of which was made up by as many lashes being applied to the poor slave’s back.” Because overseers closely monitored enslaved workers’ picking abilities, they assigned each worker a unique quota. Falling short of that quota could get you beaten, but overshooting your target could bring misery the next day, because the master might respond by raising your picking rate. 



Profits from heightened productivity were harnessed through the anguish of the enslaved. This was why the fastest cotton pickers were often whipped the most. It was why punishments rose and fell with global market fluctuations. Speaking of cotton in 1854, the fugitive slave John Brown remembered, “When the price rises in the English market, the poor slaves immediately feel the effects, for they are harder driven, and the whip is kept more constantly going.” Unrestrained capitalism holds no monopoly on violence, but in making possible the pursuit of near limitless personal fortunes, often at someone else’s expense, it does put a cash value on our moral commitments. 

Slavery did supplement white workers with what W.E.B. Du Bois called a  “public and psychological wage,” which allowed them to roam freely and feel a sense of entitlement. But this, too, served the interests of money. Slavery pulled down all workers’ wages. Both in the cities and countryside, employers had access to a large and flexible labor pool made up of enslaved and free people. Just as in today’s gig economy, day laborers during slavery’s reign often lived under conditions of scarcity and uncertainty, and jobs meant to be worked for a few months were worked for lifetimes. Labor power had little chance when the bosses could choose between buying people, renting them, contracting indentured servants, taking on apprentices or hiring children and prisoners. 



**This not only created a starkly uneven playing field, dividing workers from themselves; it also made “all nonslavery appear as freedom,” as the economic historian Stanley Engerman has written. Witnessing the horrors of slavery drilled into poor white workers that things could be worse. So they generally accepted their lot, and American freedom became broadly defined as the opposite of bondage. It was a freedom that understood what it was against but not what it was for; a malnourished and mean kind of freedom that kept you out of chains but did not provide bread or shelter. It was a freedom far too easily pleased.** 

In recent decades, America has experienced the financialization of its economy. In 1980, Congress repealed regulations that had been in place since the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, allowing banks to merge and charge their customers higher interest rates. Since then, increasingly profits have accrued not by trading and producing goods and services but through financial instruments. Between 1980 and 2008, more than $6.6 trillion was transferred to financial firms. After witnessing the successes and excesses of Wall Street, even non-financial companies began finding ways to make money from financial products and activities. Ever wonder why every major retail store, hotel chain and airline wants to sell you a credit card? This financial turn has trickled down into our everyday lives: It’s there in our pensions, home mortgages, lines of credit and college-savings portfolios. Americans with some means now act like “enterprising subjects,” in the words of the political scientist Robert Aitken. 

As it’s usually narrated, the story of the ascendancy of American finance tends to begin in 1980, with the gutting of Glass-Steagall, or in 1944 with Bretton Woods, or perhaps in the reckless speculation of the 1920s. But in reality, the story begins during slavery. 

 Consider, for example, one of the most popular mainstream financial instruments: the mortgage. Enslaved people were used as collateral for mortgages centuries before the home mortgage became the defining characteristic of middle America. In colonial times, when land was not worth much and banks didn’t exist, most lending was based on human property. In the early 1700s, slaves were the dominant collateral in South Carolina. Many Americans were first exposed to the concept of a mortgage by trafficking in enslaved people, not real estate, and “the extension of mortgages to slave property helped fuel the development of American (and global) capitalism,” the historian Joshua Rothman told me. 

Or consider a Wall Street financial instrument as modern-sounding as collateralized debt obligations  (C.D.O.s), those ticking time bombs backed by inflated home prices in the 2000s. C.D.O.s were the grandchildren of  mortgage-backed securities based on the inflated value of enslaved people  sold in the 1820s and 1830s. Each product created massive fortunes for the few before blowing up the economy. 



Enslavers were not the first ones to securitize assets and debts in America. The land companies that thrived during the late 1700s relied on this technique, for instance.  But enslavers did make use of securities to such an enormous degree for their time, exposing stakeholders throughout the Western world to enough risk to compromise the world economy, that the historian Edward Baptist told me that this can be viewed as “a new  moment in international capitalism, where you are seeing the development of a globalized financial market."" The novel thing about the 2008 foreclosure crisis was not the concept of foreclosing on a homeowner but foreclosing on millions of them.  Similarly, what was new about securitizing enslaved people in the first half of the 19th century was not the concept of securitization itself but the crazed level of rash speculation on cotton that selling slave debt promoted. 

As America's cotton sector expanded, the value of enslaved workers soared. Between 1804 and 1860, the average price of men ages 21 to 38 sold  in New Orleans grew to $1,200 from roughly $450.  Because they couldn’t expand their cotton empires without more enslaved workers, ambitious planters needed to find a way to raise enough capital to purchase more hands. Enter the banks. The Second Bank of the United States, chartered in 1816, began investing heavily in cotton. In the early 1830s, the slaveholding Southwestern states took almost half the bank’s business. Around the same time, state-chartered banks began multiplying to such a degree that one historian called it an “orgy of bank-creation.”

When seeking loans, planters used enslaved people as collateral. Thomas Jefferson mortgaged 150 of his enslaved workers to build Monticello. People could be sold much more easily than land, and in multiple Southern states, more than eight in 10 mortgage-secured loans used enslaved people as full or partial collateral. As the historian Bonnie Martin has written, “slave owners worked their slaves financially, as well as physically from colonial days until emancipation” by mortgaging people to buy more people. Access to credit grew faster than Mississippi kudzu, leading one 1836 observer to remark that in cotton country “money, or what passed for money, was the only cheap thing to be had.” 

Planters took on immense amounts of debt to finance their operations. Why wouldn’t they? The math worked out. A cotton plantation in the first decade of the 19th century could leverage their enslaved workers at 8 percent interest and record a return three times that. So leverage they did, sometimes volunteering the same enslaved workers for multiple mortgages. Banks lent with little restraint. By 1833, Mississippi banks had issued 20 times as much paper money as they had gold in their coffers. In several Southern counties, slave mortgages injected more capital into the economy than sales from the crops harvested by enslaved workers. 

Global financial markets got in on the action. When Thomas Jefferson mortgaged his enslaved workers, it was a Dutch firm that put up the money. The Louisiana Purchase, which opened millions of acres to cotton production, was financed by Baring Brothers, the well-heeled British commercial bank. A majority of credit powering the American slave economy came from the London money market. Years after abolishing the African slave trade in 1807, Britain, and much of Europe along with it, was bankrolling slavery in the United States. To raise capital, state-chartered banks pooled debt generated by slave mortgages and repackaged it as bonds promising investors annual interest. During slavery’s boom time, banks did swift business in bonds, finding buyers in Hamburg and Amsterdam, in Boston and Philadelphia. 

Some historians have claimed that the British abolition of the slave trade was a turning point in modernity, marked by the development of a new kind of moral consciousness when people began considering the suffering of others thousands of miles away. But perhaps all that changed was a growing need to scrub the blood of enslaved workers off American dollars, British pounds and French francs, a need that Western financial markets fast found a way to satisfy through the global trade in bank bonds. Here was a means to profit from slavery without getting your hands dirty. In fact, many investors may not have realized that their money was being used to buy and exploit people, just as many of us who are vested in multinational textile companies today are unaware that our money subsidizes a business that continues to rely on forced labor in countries like Uzbekistan and China and child workers in countries like India and Brazil. Call it irony, coincidence or maybe cause — historians haven’t settled the matter — but avenues to profit indirectly from slavery grew in popularity as the institution of slavery itself grew more unpopular. “I think they go together,” the historian Calvin Schermerhorn told me. “We care about fellow members of humanity, but what do we do when we want returns on an investment that depends on their bound labor?” he said. “Yes, there is a higher consciousness. But then it comes down to: Where do you get your cotton from?” 

Banks issued tens of millions of dollars in loans on the assumption that rising cotton prices would go on forever. Speculation reached a fever pitch in the 1830s, as businessmen, planters and lawyers convinced themselves that they could amass real treasure by joining in a risky game that everyone seemed to be playing. If planters thought themselves invincible, able to bend the laws of finance to their will, it was most likely because they had been granted authority to bend the laws of nature to their will, to do with the land and the people who worked it as they pleased. Du Bois wrote: “The mere fact that a man could be, under the law, the actual master of the mind and body of human beings had to have disastrous effects. It tended to inflate the ego of most planters beyond all reason; they became arrogant, strutting, quarrelsome kinglets.” What are the laws of economics to those exercising godlike power over an entire people? 

We know how these stories end. The American South rashly overproduced cotton thanks to an abundance of cheap land, labor and credit, consumer demand couldn’t keep up with supply, and prices fell. The value of cotton started to drop as early as 1834 before plunging like a bird winged in midflight, setting off the Panic of 1837. Investors and creditors called in their debts, but plantation owners were underwater. Mississippi planters owed the banks in New Orleans $33 million in a year their crops yielded only $10 million in revenue. They couldn’t simply liquidate their assets to raise the money. When the price of cotton tumbled, it pulled down the value of enslaved workers and land along with it. People bought for $2,000 were now selling for $60. Today, we would say the planters’ debt was “toxic.” 

Because enslavers couldn’t repay their loans, the banks couldn’t make interest payments on their bonds. Shouts went up around the Western world, as investors began demanding that states raise taxes to keep their promises. After all, the bonds were backed by taxpayers. But after a swell of populist outrage, states decided not to squeeze the money out of every Southern family, coin by coin. But neither did they foreclose on defaulting plantation owners. If they tried, planters absconded to Texas (an independent republic at the time) with their treasure and enslaved work force. Furious bondholders mounted lawsuits and cashiers committed suicide, but the bankrupt states refused to pay their debts. Cotton slavery was too big to fail. The South chose to cut itself out of the global credit market, the hand that had fed cotton expansion, rather than hold planters and their banks accountable for their negligence and avarice. 

Even academic historians, who from their very first graduate course are taught to shun presentism and accept history on its own terms, haven’t been able to resist drawing parallels between the Panic of 1837 and the 2008 financial crisis. All the ingredients are there: mystifying financial instruments that hide risk while connecting bankers, investors and families around the globe; fantastic profits amassed overnight; the normalization of speculation and breathless risk-taking; stacks of paper money printed on the myth that some institution (cotton, housing) is unshakable; considered and intentional exploitation of black people; and impunity for the profiteers when it all falls apart — the borrowers were bailed out after 1837, the banks after 2008.

During slavery, “Americans built a culture of speculation unique in its abandon,” writes the historian Joshua Rothman in his 2012 book, “Flush Times and Fever Dreams.” That culture would drive cotton production up to the Civil War, and it has been a defining characteristic of American capitalism ever since. It is the culture of acquiring wealth without work, growing at all costs and abusing the powerless. It is the culture that brought us the Panic of 1837, the stock-market crash of 1929 and the recession of 2008. It is the culture that has produced staggering inequality and undignified working conditions. If today America promotes a particular kind of low-road capitalism — a union-busting capitalism of poverty wages, gig jobs and normalized insecurity; a winner-take-all capitalism of stunning disparities not only permitting but awarding financial rule-bending; a racist capitalism that ignores the fact that slavery didn’t just deny black freedom but built white fortunes, originating the [black-white wealth gap that annually grows wider](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/racial-wealth-gap.html)— one reason is that American capitalism was founded on the lowest road there is.",False,f338by,thenomeer,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f338by/in_order_to_understand_the_brutality_of_american/,6,1

&gt;At work, you get very few sick days, so that implies that you are an **incredible super human that rarely ever gets sick.** If you happen to be an *inferior specimen* and you ***have to*** skip more days at work for your health's sake, you will probably get fired, right? If you suffer from any physical condition that makes you feel like shit and unable to work 10, 20 or even 30 days a year, you are completely fucked. **So that's ableism, right?** By definition? But we already knew work was ableist; I think that is far too easy to see if you think about major diseases, but I'm also starting to notice that the system is also discriminatory to anyone who isn't the most polished and refined human specimen.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Same thing goes for mental health issues, but worse. If you suffer from **basically any mental problem,** the tolerance is **zero.** I guess there's no word for this exact type of discrimination but putting all this together you get that:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*If you weren't born a completely 'fine' specimen, you will be discriminated off the system.* Holy fucking fuck.

694,What would you do in my situation?,"For context I’m 29, been working in corporate for close to 8 years now. Currently in a technology firm and have been working here for a year. It’s a standard M-F 40 hours kind of job. 

Pros: 
1) Hours are pretty flexible. I normally arrive around 9.45-10am and leave around 6.30pm. 

2) We can wear jeans and sneakers. 

3) Office facilities are pretty nice and suited to a millennial workforce (think coffee machines, pool tables, bean bags etc). 

4) It is a 30-minute commute one way. I’ve been in jobs with &gt;1 hour commutes each way and that was hell. 

5) The pay is pretty decent. 

6) I can work from home probably once every two weeks. If I have emergencies the company also allows us to work from home. 

7) I also have a few close friends at work but none from my immediate department. 

Cons:
1) It is an open office + hot desking kind of setup. We have to arrive earlier than most to be able to get the desks that we want. We have lockers to store our personal things and we have to leave the desk entirely empty when we leave everyday. I really hate this and have sworn to not work in this kind of setup ever again. 

2) The job makes me want to hang myself. I have to deal with bootlickers and backstabbers, people who push responsibilities to others, people who blame me for things that are out of my control (and out of my remit), and management that doesn’t want to listen to employees. They’ve made jokes about firing someone and I felt extremely uncomfortable as I really don’t think that such decisions should be made lightly. You’re joking about taking away someone’s livelihood for gods sake. 

The head of department is a joke. I’ve tried giving him feedback since he asked me for it, and he became defensive, turned the tables around and started talking about all my flaws instead. 

3) Sometimes I have so much free time at work, but I have to pretend to look busy for 8 hours. It drives me insane and sucks my soul away. 

4) When I do have work my boss hounds me like hell. She has zero chill and always wants things done yesterday. She sucks up to the higher ups instead of defending our position and oftentimes makes me look like I’m the bad cop for not falling in line. 

5) I’ve made very little progress in my one year at the firm. Learnt and did very little, nothing that I can talk about in future interviews. If I change jobs and continue this bullshit wage slavery I want to be able to demand higher pay, but higher pay doesn’t come without more experience, and this job isn’t giving me it. 

6) My own team alienates me. They are also filthy backstabbers. They have turned against me more times than I can count, and talked shit about me behind my back. 

7) I dread every single work day and constantly think about crashing my car on my way to work. I live in a high rise and have thought about jumping down more times than I can count. I am suffering from depression (from personal issues) and have been on medication but this job has made it worse. I feel like I have lost myself. I no longer care for things that used to interest me. I snap at my SO after work because I am always in a foul mood. I don’t even care about my friendships anymore. I have trouble sleeping and I currently find no meaning in life at all. I used to cut my wrists as a form of self harm but stopped close to 2 years ago. Now I catch myself thinking about doing it again. The thought of working like a slave for the next 30 years or so makes me want to shoot myself in the head. I am just so tired. My anti work sentiment has been growing stronger over the past weeks and as a result I have been growing even more depressed knowing that as a society things will not change, at least not in this lifetime. 

I have done the calculations and have enough of a financial safety net to last about 6 months jobless. I just want time to refresh myself and to find myself again. I had short breaks between jobs in the past (1-2 months) and those breaks were the best times of my life. I want to be able to like what I used to like doing. To be able to be happy. I can’t even smile a true smile anymore. I don’t even care for money and have never chased for prestigious corporate titles. I am on the verge of a breakdown every single day.

713,A short story how I found out that I am anti-work,"When I finoshed school with 18, in my country I have to chose between military or civil service for a year. Not eager to go to the military I decided on civil service.

The job sucked. Civil service was simply a means to get people to do stuff nobody else wants to do. So in true corporate fashion you simply go to papa state and make them force people to do it.

I didn't even have the worst job. Instead of working as a nurse I worked in a christian youth club. Had to clean up and make food there. But well. being as anti-social as I am it simply wasn't for me. But as you are forced to do it there's no other choice.

My boss there was pissed off by me. Because well. Me being fresh out of school thought that they tell me what to do and that's it. Yeah. She wanted me to find everything which needs doing myself. Basically that meant stuff like cleaning floors I never even deemed dirty to begin with. So well.

Days flew by, I hated them. It stressed me out and I noticed it taking a toll on me. So I went to the doctors. Told her about it. How I am stressed. How I think stuff like that is just slavery with extra steps.

She looked at me. Gave me this disgusted look. Acted like I am crazy. And all she told me was basically: Duh! That's life. Deal with it.

Time goes by. I tried to do my best at the job. But well. It wasn't me. The most christian thing I did - letting a girl scared to go back home sleep at the club - was heavily punished. Boss told me that she could call the police and so on. Basically made it clear that she thinks of everybody at the club as possible thieves. Jesus Christ. And this person was in charge of a CHRISTIAN youth club.

 Anyways. My time there came to an ende. I went back to school to get a university entramce degree. Yadda, yadda.

Shortly before getting it I had to go to the aforementioned doctor again. This time not on my own accord though. I basically went crazy. Fear and Panic disorder. which, as people at the psychologic hospital told me, can be the result of being stressed for too long. Great. So basically MAYBE the doctor should've taken me serious the first time I visited her ...",False,f26flc,Responsible-Elk,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f26flc/a_short_story_how_i_found_out_that_i_am_antiwork/,5,1

Work in a relaxed manner. In a manner that does not put you under stress.
It's so much easyer to go to work every day then.

717,Serious anxiety about work,"As soon as I wake up in the morning, I dread and am anxious about going to work. As I'm brushing my teeth, washing my face.. I have to drag myself to do these things. On the way to work I can only think about how many hours of my day work is going to take away from me. Then, while at work, I feel trapped. I'm not free to go where I want or do as I please. I am trapped by the promise that I will be available during these hours to do work.. but what if I don't want to? And I don't.. I don't want to do work that has no relation to me or my wants or goals. 

I'm killing myself over a job that I don't even really care about other than for money and health insurance. But I don't even get paid well. Two days ago I saw a coworker get bitten so many times and so hard by a client that she was bleeding. We don't get paid enough to be dealing with this shit but yet here we are. 

I should be leaving out the door right now to go to work.. but I'm just here writing about this dread I feel. This anxiety. I want to run away so badly. I was never a drinker, now at night it seems like my only escape from all of this is to have a few drinks. I don't even WANT to drink but it calms me enough to be able to sleep so I can put myself through all of it the next day. I'm killing myself and for what??!?! So when I inevitably end up in the hospital over this job I'll have insurance to cover it? FOR WHAT?! To go on working and have it happen all over again? You know why insurance is tied to work?!

729,"Rise of fin-tech apps proof of financial services industry scrambling to indoctrinate Millennial/Gen Z into working harder and funneling more money into the ""free"" market for minimal returns?","Obviously we all know that apps like Robinhood, Acorns, Stash, etc are growing their user-base rapidly, with the average age of users being somewhere in their mid 30's. Anybody else feel like these apps are sort of the last frontier in trying to stop people from waking up to the horrors of Capitalism and work culture?

My problem with these apps:

1. Obviously the fact that the only way anybody could conceivably make money off of these apps is by owning stock, ie being complicit in the exploitation of labor and the destruction of our environment all the while funneling money up into financial institutions never to be circulated in the markets in which most people actually participate. Whether or not someone is cognizantly aware that value is only created through exploitation under Capitalism, it gets young people comfortable with participating in the system in such a removed and seemingly innocuous way as to prevent this realization from occurring, or getting people into a ""means justify the ends"" mindset.  They're breeding grounds for the next generation of morally bankrupt CEOs.
2. The language and marketing tactics of these companies seem to align a lot with the ""self made"" or ""hustle culture"" talk  (just the name ""robinhood"" implies seizing value from the wealthy (LOL), or Acorns' ""mighty oaks grow"" slogan) that has conveniently risen with 1099 work and other gig systems, established for no other reason but to further deny workers basic dignities like healthcare, minimum wage, workplace protections, etc. while pushing a narrative of radical individualism.  People want to be financially secure, and these apps are exploiting that aspiration, all the while profiting off of money held within these accounts, as well as the transactions taking place on the platforms to, AT BEST, pitch some pennies at their users, who are engaging in a basically unwinnable system for an individual investor.  Essentially, like Capitalism or the lottery, they're selling a conceivably winnable system that they know is set up to extract more value than it can deliver to nearly every person engaging with it.
3.  The notion that extracting value from public markets is possible positions those markets as ""good"" things for people.  People can see minuscule returns by shifting money between different companies, ipos, mutual funds, etc which undeniably evokes positive associations between one's self as an ""owner"" of these properties, and the properties themselves. One might buy a share of Amazon and flip it for a couple hundred dollars and think ""oh man, I love Amazon"", all the while this company is passing off the cost of its rampant environmental destruction, and the decimation of local markets on to everyone to the tune of inconceivable amounts of money in the long term.
4. The concept of longterm investment or retirement investment for middle and working class individuals is predicated on the manufactured reality that selling the majority of your waking hours through laboring for a company does not entitle you (in a civil society) to survival (healthcare), the ability to own a subsistence level of property (like a home, source of transportation, and food), a reasonable degree of postsecondary education, the basic dignity of being able to raise a child or two if one chooses, and the right to retire when you are reasonably unable to work. Their existences pose financial failure as a personal failure, and further push the notion that an inability to survive or plan for the future is YOUR fault, not the fault of Capitalism, and the only way to overcome the horrors imposed on you by the ""free"" market, is to pump even more money into it.

I don't think that this is a conspiracy or anything- really the same could be said for investment firms generally.  But the reason these apps emerged and play so differently on the unique anxieties of young people than do companies like Fidelity or Schwab, is because research is showing that young people don't trust financial institutions, and are growing increasingly disillusioned with the free market.  The financial services industry needed a makeover and these apps filled in that gap.  I really hope people see through the narrative that they're pushing and realize that they need to focus that energy on working toward a society in which workers are entitled to a larger slice of the value that they create, not a society in which a person needs to throw their money at the market with the prayer that it will dick over someone else so that they can get a percentage of return that isn't even keeping up with the rate of inflation.",False,f3ovn1,retiredpartyplanner,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f3ovn1/rise_of_fintech_apps_proof_of_financial_services/,2,1

I decided to use my tonsillectomy surgery as an excuse to cover up the actual reasoning. My other boss was an inept moron who had no idea how I managed to finish my work so quickly.

 In a recent post I read about standardizing online applications/CVs, the most upvoted comments were basically saying ""well, even when we filter all the candidates, there's just too many and so we have to work extra hours, so the process has to be tedious so that the people who put in the effort actually want the job"". At no point did these people stop an think that maybe the fucking company should hire more people to deal with the hiring process.

Get employed at the post office. Post office are managed by the government (just like schools) so the working conditions are generally good. The pay is basically the same one as a teacher, but it's a job with a far more relaxed working rhythm.

Get employed at a funeral agency. Almost nobody want to this job so it should be easy to get employed. The pay is really good, but the working hours may be a lot (because it's the canonical 40 hours + extra hours if someone dies when you're not working).

&gt;In our country, the sphere of operation of the law of value extends, first of all, to commodity circulation, to the ex-change of commodities through purchase and sale, the ex-change, chiefly, of articles of personal consumption. Here, in this sphere, the law of value preserves, within certain limits, of course, the function of a regulator.

**But the operation of the law of value is not confined to the sphere of commodity circulation.** It also extends to production. True, the law of value has no regulating function in our socialist production, but it nevertheless influences production, and this fact cannot be ignored when directing production. As a matter of fact, consumer goods, which are needed to compensate the labour power expended in the process of production, are produced and realized in our country as commodities coming under the operation of the law of value. It is precisely here that the law of value exercises its influence on production. In this connection, such things as cost accounting and profitableness, production costs, prices, etc., are of actual importance in our enterprises. **Consequently, our enterprises cannot, and must not, function without taking the law of value into account.**

...

&gt;Is this a good thing? It is not a bad thing. Under present conditions, it really is not a bad thing, **since it trains our business executives conduct production on rational lines and disciplines them. It is not a bad thing because it teaches our executives to count production magnitudes, to count them accurately, and also to calculate the real hings in production precisely, and not to talk nonsense about ""approximate figures,"" spun out of thin air. It is not a bad thing because it teaches our executives to look for, find and utilize hidden reserves latent in production, and not to trample them under-foot. It is not a bad thing because it teaches our executives systematically to improve methods of production, to lower production costs, to practise cost accounting, and to make their enterprises pay. It is a good practical school which accelerates the development of our executive personnel and their growth into genuine leaders of socialist production at the present stage of development.**",False,f16yo1,AndrewEldritchHorror,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f16yo1/stalin_was_the_hr_boss_or_antiwork_is_communism/,8,1

782,I quit and here are my reasons,"Time to vent.

1. Boss paid some of the wage in cash, some in transfer to the bank account (tax evasion).

2. Five hours of public transportation every day (and really **really** crowded public transportation) is unbearable and gives me back pain. And I have no free time left after 9 hours of work and 5 hours of commute in total and 8 hours of sleep.

3. The manager is unmanageable. I feel like I have to manage the boss while doing my job and it gets on my nerves. He tells me that I'm taking too long and I'm really slow (impossible to explain to him that if I rush and don't double check there will be mistakes that he won't know how to fix). Eventually I turn in my work, he says he'll look into it and give me revision instructions and further things to do. He took 3 fucking days and every day I kept asking if he looked into my work and what he thinks. He said he didn't get around to that yet. Bitch why the fuck then do you keep hounding me for being slow if you are gonna take 3 fucking days to review my shit? 3 fucking days of sitting around and doing nothing being bored out of my mind.

4. Co-workers are snitches who will snitch your every little mistake to the boss while smiling to your face with all the fake smiles and shit. I'll return it with a fake smile as well but I'm onto you fuckers. Well, I was, I quit, so you guys have fun. You have a ""tip-of-the-tongue"" phenomenon one time while talking to a customer on phone and co-workers act like you don't know how to talk. I came 3 minutes late from lunch break once and had to endure my co-worker's passive-aggressive bullshit, while she did worse herself.

5. Boss and co-workers gossiping behind customers. No big deal honestly but seems a bit unprofessional for my taste. There are plenty of other things to gossip and complain about in life.

6. Boss demanding that I should be clean-shaven and dressed sharp always even though I have little to no contact with customers. Literally I form at most like 4-5 sentences every day to customers. If I'm going to sit in front of a computer for 9 hours I'm doing it with comfortable clothes (within reason of course). And I'm not going to wear a tie to make minimum wage.

7. It is physically impossible for me to fall asleep before 3 AM and wake up at 6 AM. All my life I did my shit at night. I'm used to starting to work at night until the sun starts rising. It's also impossible for me to not be in a semi-conscious state dreaming while awake when I'm sleepy. Combine those and I got a boss scolding me for being sleepy at work. What about society as a whole works, sleeps and eats according to MY circadian rhythm instead, and I scold you if your body isn't used to that?

8. Boss telling me I should socialize with my co-workers. This complaint of his came right after him scolding me for being slow at my job so that was surprise. I'm this fast by pretending to listen to my co-workers, how fast I'm gonna be if I actually interact with them? What about you give me a fucking task to do, and I fully concentrate on it without having to listen to some inane bullshit my co-workers wants to spew at me, and you give me something else to do afterwards so I don't feel like wasting my time at least? Just give me a task and a deadline and fuck off.

9. Now this reason enters luxury area a bit and I can understand why you'd disagree with me or think I'm being bratty, but I require certain amounts of cigarettes and alcohol to function. I'm not going to drink at work, but boy, I really understood the value of having short breaks to smoke. Too bad boss is vehemently against that. Solution: I chain smoked at lunchbreak instead. I never feel hungry at lunch break times anyway.

10. Meager pay, little benefits, boss treating you like a kid, but I guess most people complain about this anyway. It's one of those problems in work life that should be fixed, but everyone else complains about it anyway, so it kinda becomes the standard.

I recognize that I'm financially secure at least to a point where I afford to be unemployed for some time and not suffer a dramatic drop in my quality of life.

plants and help them grow is an appealing fantasy for some.

However, there is a sinister side to the happy-go-lucky players in Harvest Time.
Layers don't actually own a farm due to a lack of in-game money, so they work
for someone else. The farming simulate has its own loot box system in the form
of chests that players can get from simply playing the game. These two features
create a hierarchy where players get addicted to getting chests and powerful
farm owners are explaining their manual labour. His need for chests means that
working in Harvest Time, as Przybytek describes it, is like having a second job to

786,I don't know anymore,"**This is kind of a rant**

As I struggled through high school I already knew I couldn't make it in college or university. I had no path and no motivations so going with either of those options seemed to be a big waste of money. 

I got told to learn a trade and did manage to complete a Pre-Apprenticeship program (worthless) but after thinking about it a little more I didn't think I wanted to pursue this path either.

This is a problem for me as my parents (especially my mom) are really not okay with this. My mom and my grandma love to gossip about everything which unfortunately includes me and how I suck. My mom is always telling me that because I'm at the bottom I don't get a choice and should just choose something and stick with it. Problem is, I literally don't want to do anything like sometimes I wish I just didn't exist. 

We're an Asian family so not going to College or University right after High school is already like weird.

I don't think I'll ever understand why I'm expected to just suck it up and let the world and everything take turns beating me up. This seems to be the general mindset regarding people who think like this ""that you'll have to get used to it"" or the other ""There are people who have it much worse than you"". 

I learned myself that staying home is not good for my mental health either so my only plans at the moment are to get some sort of job that will get me out of the house and doing something I can tolerate just to keep me busy.

I wished work life had some kind of a break every year like a month or two where you could just take that time off to recoup and come back refreshed. But nope, no such vacations or “sabbaticals” exist in your career life. Hell, I had taken a six month sabbatical a few years back and when I mentioned this in one of my interviews, the employer looked at me as if I was from a different planet!

Let alone holidays, employers now expect you to work when you are sick and expect you to be back ASAP even when you have had a major event in life like a kid being born or parents being ill or an accident - yes they don’t even spare you in that time.

Fucking hate this life - yesterday I asked my boss I want 3 weeks leave because I want to visit my parents who are on the other side of the globe (I usually save all my annual leaves for this very reason) and he was like “Forget that this conversation happened and you asked me for 3 weeks -  the max I can offer is 9 days for all sorts of “staff shortage” reasons and expected me to be grateful to him for being offered such a generous leave.

How is everyone okay with slaving themselves for 40hrs a week? 

Life doesn’t have to be like this - we are choosing it every day that you go to work.  We can end this by staying home. Refusing to do work for other people. 

It’s such a clever system they’ve built. They give us juuusstt enough so we don’t revolt. Just enough to make us comfortable, but not satisfied so we want more. 
It disgusts me.  I don’t want to be a part of this system. I don’t enjoy work in anyway, shape, or form. 

I would be much happier doing the same job - less hours - for no pay knowing it benefited a community and that we all worked for the greater good of each other - as it should be. 

There are communities out there, all over the world, that don’t use money.  

Money is made up garbage that keeps us enslaved and I hate that we value it so much that people are dying everyday for a made up idea - it’s not even real!

803,I got a promotion,"I know lots of these posts are jaded, for good reason, about our toxic work culture and the lies of capitalism, but I am extremely lucky. 

I believe everyone deserves what I have and I don’t buy into the meritocracy, so I hope to use my privilege for good and assert that it was not uniquely “earned,” but that it is truly deserved by everyone. 

I work at a place that allows me time and location flexibility, encourages my autonomy and my manager values me as a person. I previously had about 6 weeks paid vacation and as many work from home day’s as I needed. Now that I got promotion, I have slightly more than a comfortable living wage to be able to also appropriately save for retirement. There are quiet rooms where you can rest and recharge in the middle of the day - and people are actually encouraged to use them as such. I also now have “flex time,” so there is no cap on the paid day’s I can take off. Typically companies do that and then assign you so much work that you can’t take time off, but based on the last six years and the fact that they said they want me to keep doing what I’m doing even with the promo- I don’t think that’s going to happen as of now. We are not punished for making missteps, we are actually coached and people aren’t afraid when they mess up.

I know this could flip at any moment, and that I could be replaced like it’s nothing. But I really feel like I am getting a taste of what work should be. It’s sad but true that much of this privilege I have is indirectly at the expense of others based off of wealth and the class system in the US. I am a Black woman, and of course there is a disproportionately smaller portion of us in this environment. 

My life has improved significantly- health and mental health and even relationships, since starting this job. If you’re in a bad spot, I encourage you to leave because your next opportunity may be worlds better. I know that’s not always the case, but I truly never thought I would have this. I still don’t really consider it a “success story” because again, I am lucky and I’m just experiencing what we truly all deserve and could give each other if it weren’t for income inequality and greed.

I tightened my expenses but I have more than enough to live working 4 days (car paid off, cheap bills, couple holidays per year)

Work's trying to offer me promotion (on basis that I work more hours), sure extra £ would be nice but I'd need to sacrifice day off and sometimes work late.

Family saying to take it, get extra money, pay to mortgage or save. Work colleagues think I'm insane for working 4 days (their opinion is irrelevant though).

My thinking is I value my mental health, day off to go to gym etc more than an extra few hundred a month.

The workers got paid piecework.  That is, every meal they assembled, they got paid for.  Normally this would result in these guys getting paid less than minimum wage.  **However!**  The ones who were on the autistic spectrum, being ever the smart cookies, realized that they could dramatically boost their production with about 30 minutes of prep work prior to their shift, thus boosting everyone up from their sub-minimum wages to, oh, $13/hr.  So these guys showed up extra early, did prep before their shift started, and busted out some serious productivity.  More kids get meals, productivity targets get exceeded, workers get paid decently.

'We like to treat each other like family' - A disfunctional family. One that calls you and makes a lot of demands of you in your spare time. You can't turn down our demands, though, because we're like brothers right?

'Must be able to multitask exceptionally well' - You will be working the jobs of three people and being paid half the salary of one of those jobs.

But one part of it was very fascinating to me, and it was the way the community worked together to do important tasks. 

If you have not seen it, it’s a documentary about an extremely religious (you could probably use the word cult here) community located in New Zealand. They all live in a town they built themselves, very insulated from the outside world. Now, it *is* my view that it is a cult of some sort. But the community works together to do important tasks, such as running a factory to bring in money, some farming (from the looks of it), cattle raising, etc. A lot of the things you need to run a community. 

Now, I did have a lot of issues with how this was implemented. There is zero room for any individualism or free time in the cult/community. I disagreed with that entirely. But I liked seeing people pull together to produce something for everyone, and it’s something I’ve been thinking about.

Of course, I am still very much anti work. I didn’t like that people’s jobs were picked for them, and that they were forced to work for long hours. All of the single young women were forced into childcare and kitchen duties, whilst the men built the actual communal buildings and worked in their factories. I had a lot of issues with that as well. 

I think if this kind of community (sans all the insane shit) were to be run by an atheist/agnostic/anti work  person, it could be run in a way where you only work two out of the five days for the community, or perhaps you dedicate 3 hours of your day 4 days a week. Something of that nature. Everyone would benefit from the communal work, and you would still be able to pick your job (although some jobs just need to be done—I’m not sure how to reconcile that). You’d still have time to be your individual self, so to work on your hobbies in your ample free time. 

Of course I do not have the logistics for this; this was just a thought experiment I was mulling about in my head. And I was curious to see what others thought of tight-knit communities that pulled together to get things done.",False,ezm9gg,Midna0802,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ezm9gg/has_anyone_seen_the_documentary_called_gloriavale/,1,1
839,What Feels So Sad About Our Economy,"I'm a freelance writer and editor mostly doing content marketing (which I could write a whole other post about, but I'll save it). I left a full-time job two years ago, moved abroad for a bit, and now am back in the U.S., though another, cheaper (though still expensive) city.  Although I'm freelance, I'd rather be full-time at this point, simply for the stability and benefits, not because I like the idea of being in an office anymore than I did when I had my old job. Since I write and read about tech I read a lot of booster-ism about how great our new world of work is — we can work from anywhere, at anytime, with anybody. But something that happened to me today reminded me how impersonal and disconnected this new world of work can feel. I had a phonecall with a health tech company that's looking for a writer for their blog. The woman started the call not realizing what it was about (because someone had scheduled it for her) and then asked me some quick questions and said they would start with me writing an article for them. I said that sounded good, I just needed a contract. She said okay, she'd send it over. When I hung up I realized how I'd never met this person before and she'd offered so little detail about herself or the company.

847,My observations,"(Disclaimer: The word “you” is used in a general sense, so please don’t think I’m targeting any of you here)

Developed society is at a point where people work for hours on end for meager pay just to afford basic shelter and enough food to quell hunger pangs. We’ve created a system wherein people demand unnecessary things - and things, and things, and iterations of more things - to fill the void left by modern life. Yet, when those who are poor and cannot afford the things upon things that consumers are inundated with and hypnotized to “need”, they are shamed. They are told to get another job or to pull up their bootstraps and deal with it because that’s what everyone else does. They ignore the fact that these people are oftentimes working 40+ hours a week and are incapable of missing one day of work in fear of being unable to afford the cost of living. The cost of living, for crying out loud. Not the cost of frivolous extras that we’re convinced are essential to operate or a 25 room mansion in the hills - just the cost to wake up and breathe every day. We are so enamored by the so called “American Dream” that we dismiss anything that even hints at the possibility of our country’s societal foundation having faults. You may not deem flipping burgers or waiting tables as actual work, but that doesn’t remove the fact that the people working these jobs are dedicating their time to something less-than-pleasant just to be able to afford some semblance of life. Then you laugh at them and make a mockery of them in front of a restaurant full of like-minded elitists, all the while utilizing their services. Services that without you would likely starve because you’re too stupid, too lazy, or too entitled to perform the tasks that you denounce as “not real work.” You, on the other hand, do “real” work akin to twiddling your thumbs in your butthole, which affords you a cushy life in which your hardest choice is what tie you’re going to put on every morning.

And then there are those who have worked their entire lives, dedicating 40 or more years to their chosen career, only to be forced to subsist on ramen noodles and crackers to be able to afford the cost of life at an older age with the limited pension and social security the government doles out (if you’re lucky enough to have anything). These people prepared and contributed money like they were told, only to be shafted when they reach the age that they’re finally allowed to be “free.” Some rejoin the workforce because they just cannot cope, effectively relinquishing their “freedom” and literally working themselves to death. Now, think about those who never had stable careers and only worked random jobs to afford the necessities. They aren’t granted the option of social securities or pensions. If they don’t work, they become homeless or die, yet if they choose to rely on the government to afford their basic needs, they are deemed a leech or a drain on the system. People would rather others die at their places of work than to contribute the taxes to help their fellow man. There is no winning here.

866,What antiwork means to me,"Fair warning, I will most likely delete this in a few days as I am a lurker at heart and leaving behind old posts/comments gives me anxiety.

My parents both hated their jobs so I went to school and started working in a career that, to others, “sounds so fun!!!” Well, it’s not. My ACTUAL work I don’t mind, it’s all the stupid shit around it I hate: pointless meetings; project requests DUE ASAP with insufficient parameters so I have to chase people for details; deadlines I kill myself to meet before finding out they were just arbitrarily chosen; dealing with people who believe their uneducated opinion is just as valuable as my experienced, highly educated opinion; people who will obsess over a pointless detail, making me do extra work all because they can’t “pull the trigger” and move forward. And OMG the emails I get, asking me to resend the same damn things over and over again because I have 60+ people in my current job that refuse to learn how to search their emails or save/organize what I send them the first time.

People say “work somewhere else”. I’ve worked in other places and joined professional groups and read blogs and they are all like this, even the “good companies” are riddled with stupid inefficiencies. 

People say “work for yourself”. Yeah, so I can spend even less time doing the actual work I spend 7+ years training myself to do? Because finding jobs, pitching clients, handling all the administrative work myself, or worse hiring people to do it for me, that I must train and manage, all eats into the time I could be spending doing real work.

And THIS is why I am “antiwork”. It’s not about being lazy or that I’m in the wrong career or I need to find a better job. I’m doing exactly what I went to college for. I couldn’t imagine doing any other job. And yet, this bullshit system of going all through school for a job and then paying for a degree to get a job and then finding a place to live close to a job (or jobs) and buying a car just to get myself to a building I don’t want to sit in for 40+ hours a week, where I earn 1/4 - 1/10 of what I am actually worth, all so I can pay back the loans for the degree and the house and the car for the job that is sucking the life out of me? It IS a fucking rigged game and I am sick of playing. 

I’m also sick of occasionally meeting my boomer parents and their friends for dinner and they all talk politics and complain that Universal Basic Income is a pipe dream, and no one deserves welfare or $15 an hour when they sit on their asses, demanding that below-minimum-wage-slaves scurry to bring them free bread and refill water for $3 an hour plus a $2 tip. And they all have pensions and social security (yes, SOME earned it and others are using their spouse’s benefits because they could afford not to have to work) and they all bought their houses low and sold high and have priced everyone young out of the market.

This job, this LIFE just isn’t worth the effort I’ve already put into it, and I get why people fight so hard against people in this sub. It is fucking terrifying and hopeless to admit that your entire life has been structured around “getting a good job” and even the lucky few who hit that mark are pretty miserable most of the time. It reminds me of that scientific study (or studies maybe) that prompted parents several times a day to notice what emotions/mood they were feeling. Ask a parent what they think of parenthood and they say it’s “so rewarding” and “wonderful” and “the BEST” and yet while they are actually doing it their emotions say they are “exhausted” and “frustrated” and “bored”.

Some of it’s manual labor, but overall I’m not unhappy. I can get away with working 4-5 hours a day and taking days off when I want, which I feel very fortunate for. 

My significant other is pressuring me to get an office job. He insists I can get one with my degree and it’ll make a lot of extra disposable income, but I’m already making enough to pay the bills and don’t need extra money or material crap to be happy. My worst nightmare is having a job where I’m physically stuck at one place for 8 hours a day whether there’s work or not, and when things are slow, pretending to work when managers walk by. He insists that most office jobs aren’t like this, but my friends who work in offices are always talking about how bored they are, or how they’re just getting paid to browse reddit and chit chat so much of the time. And to be honest, the opposite situation of being worked to death and constantly stressed about having more than I can manage doesn’t exactly appeal either.

878,Employer's and economic interests above health safety!,"I don't know how this is handled in companies you guys work for, but I think mine does a horrible job in protecting their employees against this serious health hazard in form of this new virus spreading. I work for a european company in the aviation business with around 130k employees, so maybe you can guess which company I'm working for. We have customers and employees all over the world including a LOT of customers from the Chinese mainland. There are still a lot of them coming here and our country and our employer doesn't take any responsibility to protect their people/employees e.g. there are currently no travel-restrictions for these people so far, but at least our biggest national Airline cancelled all flights to the Chinese mainland atleast until the end of March. I suspect due to a lot of cancellation by passengers themselves, so it isn't profitable to fly there atm.  

Back to the beginning: Although we have lots of travellers here, that might pose a certain risk to our public health, nothing is done! We only got two E-Mail within one week. The first was issued on last Friday and the 2nd Mail was sent last Monday to all employees. The first one from Friday was stating just to be careful and maybe postpone some business trips and that you should wash your hands.Ha! The 2nd was sent only 3 days later after the weekend and was not much more helpful, only that you should review travel restrictions issued by China and that you should get to a doctor if you're in China atm and show any symptoms (No, Sherlock!?). We only should maintain good personal hygiene and carry hand sanitizer for use when water &amp; soap are not available and we should just follow advice given by our country or regional health authority. Regarding visitors/customers, that come here they only stated the following thins:   

'Treat visitors from mainland China no differently to as you would visitors from other affected areas (No, I won't, because it is evident, that there's a rampant spread of the Virus in mainland China!)

Welcome colleagues from mainland China or other affected areas with respect and in line with our company values. There is no requirement to impose quarantine on them (I'm sorry , but I don't understand the mentality by the people coming here and imposing the risk on us aswell. Please just stay there, until this thing is solved, thanks. That's what web conferences are for!)

Visitors should follow personal hygiene guidelines and monitor their health in a similar way than employees returning from travel (How would they know? We don't have any advisories on how to inform them about such guidelines)

Yeah, so it is much more important to conduct business and usual and sell as much as possible. Maybe they won't be so lax, when employees begin to become sick at our site. Apart from the two Mails they sent to us, there was nothing communicated by our management. My boss still insists to shake hands and hates me now that I refuse to do so. I am not in panic rn about this new Virus, but I don't want to suffer from other disease and the flu either. Since I can't stay at home, because I'd lose my job then, I have to come here everyday and atleast have to sit here in the office with my colleagues. There are no precautions, there is no hand sanitizer anywhere to be found and I feel like our employer give zero f\*\*\*\* about their employees as long as business is running as usual.

900,Paralysed by Fear,"Hello everyone! This is my first post so please forgive any lack of common reddit etiquette.

I recently confessed to my Mother that I have been unemployed since late November last year. I was working a job in telesales and went 9 days without selling anything. I was expected to make 4-5 sales on average per day. Before quitting I had tried everything I could think to do to improve my output. Getting up at 5am so that I would be in a work oriented head-space for the 9am start, watching motivational content in and out of work, regular meetings with my superiors to identify and resolve issues with my pitch. Nothing was helping me turn things around. I eventually confessed to the boss that, even if I were to make a sale today or tomorrow, I wouldn't be capable of hitting my monthly targets consistently, if at all. He respected my honesty and we mutually agreed to end things there.                                                               

I didn't tell my parents that I had quit my job, they put a lot of pressure on me to find work immediately without any emotional support or concern for my emotional health. I do not function well under the veil of shame and pressure that is placed on me so I lie to them whenever I find myself unemployed and try to live off of the money of my final wage for as long as possible. They now know, as stated above, because I was unable to pay them rent. My Mother was at least understanding and friendly, to my surprise, my Stepfather was neither of those things. Since I have been home our only conversations have been about me getting a job, ''Job job job.'' is something he's chanted at me once I've expressed my frustrations with his confrontational attitude. Once, I flat-out explained to him that his methods make me feel depressed and will never be the catalyst for my success. He flashed his anti-depressants at me asking me, ''Where's yours?''. He also denied that there is anything wrong with me mentally and that I am ''a lazy twat.''. He has made very little effort to ask anything about my life, outside of work, for years - something I brought up to him, ''Need a job.'' was his reply. It's a fairly hopeless situation.

I'm sure many of you understand how I feel without an explanation, but I would like to share my thoughts and feelings towards work, for the sake of potentially receiving better advice. I am ridiculously hesitant to apply for almost any job because I quite simply despise almost all types of work. I was sent out of my classroom during career day because, ''I'll just work in a shop.'' was the honest answer I gave to the question, ''What do you want to do when you grow up?''. I have such a hard time getting work done because it feels absolutely meaningless to me beyond earning the money to survive and that scares the shit out of me. I often find myself in a new job, motivated and ambitious, only to find as the weeks pass that I lose the ability to care and/ or motivate myself to work. I find loopholes and exploits to get the work done quicker or to avoid the work entirely until I simply cannot take the feeling of depression I feel the job causes. I quit or am caught out or fired.

I'd hate to write myself off as simply 'lazy' because I feel it so strongly that I would be unrealistically productive towards things I enjoy like making YouTube content (filming + editing), Parkour/ freerunning, studying philosophy &amp; refinement of 'The Self', Drawing, painting, music etc. As you've more than likely deduced, I am a creative type. I love to make things and expressing myself through artistic means; creating content on YouTube is my dream career and is the only career I can confidently say I want to puruse. 

I don't want to apply for a shitty job at McDonalds or in a telesales office only to repeat this cycle of ambition and depression. I don't want to have the constant, ignorant pressure of my folks every few months. What I really **DO** want is to be earning so I can save for my relationship and my many passion projects, YouTube included; I can't seem to utilise these desires as a motivator because the work induced depression always becomes overbearing. I am stuck in a place of fear, I suppose. I feel confused and hopeless with regards to what I should do next. 

If there is anything any of you could suggest I would be eternally grateful - I have no desire to remain like this forever!",False,f1ojiw,Repudia,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f1ojiw/paralysed_by_fear/,9,1
901,"""Letting your gifts go to waste""?","This will probably be rambling and only semi-coherent, but maybe it'll be thought-provoking or something someone else can relate to.





I'm alright at writing, and have been since I was little enough to think that Goosebumps were a bold new literary phenomenon. Not alright enough to be the next Douglas Adams or Walt Whitman, but better than, say, Stephanie Meyer if she's drunk and has one broken hand. Everyone's always told me, ""You need to write something! Your gift shouldn't go to waste!""





The only problem is that I really, *really* don't like writing (excepting occasional short posts here on Reddit, which I tolerate to get my message out).





I've tried my hand at writing before, and even managed to get something vaguely book length written (a 60K-ish word superhero novel, nothing special). Didn't like the process at all. I didn't like the result of the process, and would truthfully compare the finished draft to a soggy shit sandwich.





At friend's and family's urging, I've tried writing other stuff too, most of which was abandoned after 10K words or so. A magical noir thriller. A nonfiction collection of essays. And so on. Hated doing all of it, despite being supposedly ""good at it.""





It all feels so much like work to me, doing something I don't like to do for the benefit of some nebulous and currently non-existent ""readers who would love it,"" all for the flimsy reason that I'm supposedly good at it. There's this pressure I feel from people that I should love the things I'm good at, especially if those things even tangentially contribute to the world/culture/the arts/whatever. 





I don't know if I can really get across well the things that I've been feeling, but basically it feels like there's this pressure to commodify your talent, whatever that may be and even if you don't enjoy it. And while, with traditional ""flying a desk"" style work, some people will recognize that such work isn't fun or fulfilling, no one that I've talked to seems to get the fact that ""creative work"" can also be unfulfilling. Like, I could write the next Finnegan's Wake and have the literary world set ablaze with discussion for the next thousand years, and it wouldn't matter to me one bit. It would just be some word count I'd have to get through. It would be work with a social pressure as a driver rather than work with an economic driver.





Anyone else feel this way, where you have some amount of skill or ability deemed ""valuable"" that, try as you might, you just can't get excited about? Anyone else feel the pressure to produce based on your skill or ability, even when you have no interest in production?





**TL;DR: I'm alright at writing, but hate it and find it draining. Friends &amp; family think I should love it and make it my career or a career supplement. Can't seem to make anyone understand that I don't want to take on a job flexing my creative muscles, because a job is still a job.**",False,f1u7k5,Times_Hunger,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/f1u7k5/letting_your_gifts_go_to_waste/,7,1

917,Entrepreneurship is another form of slavery (BLACKPILLED insight),"I see a lot of people here shit talking the 9-5 hell (and you are absolutely right, it sucks) and I decided to share my personal experience with being self employed/starting your own business and no, it's not at all how they describe it!

Not sharing too many details bc I don't want to get doxxed but my business is 95% run online. After years of working for dumb, incompetent, abusive bosses with one digit of free days per year and drone coworkers, working from home in your own business seemed like an unfathomable utopia.

Let's analyze some of the expectations:

1. You work from home: 

Fantasy: getting up any time you want, getting all the necessary sleep, work your own hours.

Reality: Your clients are from all over the world and you often stay up at any time of the day or night for the important ones, no such thing as ""your own hours"".

2. Expectation:
No problems with traffic since u don't have to drive to work.

Reality: True, u don't have to drive to work, but hello hell of courier services, problems with internet connection, problems with equipment, problems with foreign bank accounts....a whole new universe of problems...which lands us magically to number 3!

3. 
Expectation: YOU ARE YOUR OWN BOSS HELL YEAH!

Reality: You are also the IT, cleaner, secretary, advertiser, promoter, stylist,accountant, exorcist and for whatever problem you have there is no one to ask and esp if u have a small initial budget there is a lot of trial and error and being in the twilight zone.

4. Expectation: You keep all the money u make, finally no more a slave to the Matrix!

Reality: You get used to the horrific reality called ""unfrequent paycheck"" aka making in one day 5 times as much as you used to make in your 9-5 job and then...nothing for 2 months! If you don't have titan level skills when it comes to budgeting, by the end of the second month, u will be on the street!

5. Expectation: as a self made and self paid member of the community, you enjoy the admiration and respect of your social circle.

Reality: Until you become a self made millionaire (assuming that's possible), u will be facing the contempt and envy from literally everyone u know who is still as 9-5 slave and tries everything they can think of to talk u out of your plan so that they feel less bad about their dead end job and general sleep walking through life.

I could go on, but I am sure you get the point. Everything that I wrote describes how I felt in 2017 when I was first starting. Now things have somewhat stabilized but its still MUCH HARDER than a 9-5, there is no holiday, no lazying around and different difficulties in every turn. I don't know if it will end up the idyllic ""I made my own million and started a travel blog to see the world"" hipster millennial way, but it is nothing like I imagined and definitely not easier than 9-5.

There are a lot of poser entrepreneurs lying to cope and make themselves look important. Next time you see some narcissistic ""Company CEO"" bragging on their Twitter about how much they ""love being their own boss and making their own hours"" don't feel jealous in the slightest. Either it's a lie or the person works at daddy's company or it's someone who started 10 years ago and gave themselves amnesia about how hard the first 3-4 years were.

Last week my boss took off because he broke his foot and I felt kind of relaxed, without him breathing down my neck

However Thursday I ended up having a bad day concentration-wise (3 of my family members has been in and out of the hospital, and I forgot to take my ADHD meds, and then was also slightly dissociative on top of everything)

My other boss took me off incoming calls for an hour so I could work on the cases I already had, since I was at a relatively high amount. She had sent me a list of high visibility cases to prioritize, so I worked those 10 or so cases. She came to check up on my progress at the end of the hour and she said ""what's up you only closed one case"" like in a tone of voice that made it seem like she was disappointed in how unproductive I was. I told her that I worked all the cases she sent me but was having trouble concentrating (foolish of me to think she'd be understanding)

Like an hour later she's like ""boss want you to call him"" and then didn't give me any additional information, even after I asked why. So I call him and he says he's sending me home, something about ""no need to be at work if you can't perform your job duties"" and said we would use my sick time or PTO, or unpaid if I didn't have either of those available, and then ""we'll talk about it on Monday, ok?

I would actually Go to block parties and get to know my neighbors instead of hating them due to my customer service job turning me off idiot humans.  I would spend way more time with my pets, and maybe I would have some kids. I would spend so much time cooking from scratch, pies, breads, pastas, and I would spend more time actually trying to date and find the right guy.  For fun, I would still do real estate bc I like the hustle of the industry but I'd be more about helping folks while gaining a bit of extra cash, instead of just raking folks over the coals bc I have bills and deadlines.

937,How my old job almost drove me insane,"I had a job that required shifts that were between 12-48 hours, many of them being night shift (the so called graveyard shift). The pay was good and I have always being a nocturnal person, so originally I didn't mind at all. Soon enough though, I realized that there is a huge ""bonding in the work environment"" culture that was mandatory.

My colleagues were major life scripter drones who have been content in slavery all of their lives.They have been studying hard at school, then going to college, then getting that job and by the time I met them many were married with small kids. Things like hobbies or creativity or friends outside of work were alien infidel ideas. But because they NEEDED something to post on Fakebook, they had established this rule where they would all go together for drinks after work to...talk about work.

I am schizoid, so after 12 hours around neurotypicals, the idea of going out with them AGAIN was pure torture. Yet I went SOME times which was met with complaints and digs.

Then, the weekend bonding started. Using seminars as a pretext they would travel together AGAIN in other towns or countries, of course for work (they had nothing else going) and I was ""expected"" (demanded) to participate.

I was spending a ton of money to essentially endure the company of morons, while I had no time to write my book, or go to the gym or see my actual friends that weren't from work even in the weekends. Eventually I decided to set a boundary and say that I will come MOST weekends but not ALL weekends and ...work sabotage started! Important appointments missed be someone told me ""accidentally"" the wrong hour, documents misplaced etc.

I had legit reached a point where I was buying take out bc I had no time to cook (hello 20 extra pounds) and buying (cheap) clothes bc I had no time to do laundry.

Then one day the final nail in the coffin was when one of the alpha work bullies (an ugly woman) came to my desk to confirm if I was going to the work brunch next Saturday. I said no. She demanded to know why. I gave her the death stare and said word by word ""because that brunch happens during the only 2 hours I have free in the entire week and I am looking  forward to spend it writing"". She had the nerve to tell me that ""I shouldn't isolate myself bc it's bad for the work morale and will affect my performance"".

Then I told her extremely calmly that I am done with her and to never talk to me again bc the work culture can go to hell and last time I read a history book slavery has been abolished. She looked at me with her mouth and eyes open like a dead fish and left.

I quit that job and have been self employed and it was the best decision I have ever made. If u want to know what happened to them (I check their fakebooks once a year or so), they are fat, miserable,look 10 years older at least and still post photos of their schadenfreude get togethers.

938,Why does this sub focus on CEOs instead of owners?,"I'm not saying rhey're not pieces of shit - they are, and have to be to rise to their level. The occassional not-pice-of-shit might make manager but to become CEO you have to have a lot of nepotism, bootlicking and heartlessness no doubt.

But ultimately, they are just middle management. Another hollowed out shell of a person, replaced by bootlicking and productivity programming. The owners are the ones who sit back and create the trickle-down suffering by demanding infinite growth from everyone. The ones demanding maximum profits at the expense of human suffering. All of middle management, including CEOs, are just degrees of separation, buffers to put as many stooges, bootlickers, and impotent despots between the worker and the owner. 

So unless the CEO is also an owner(common), he's once again just another slave to overlords who thinks he's one of them because he has power over someone beneath him.

952,Should I use this “opportunity”,"Hi.
I’ve been working in a creative agency for 7 months. First 3 months were wonderful, it was fun and everyone was so nice but then it totally became a nightmare. I was working overtime without getting paid for that extra time. I talked to my manager and convinced him to let me go when my shift is over. So it’s great again. My salary is kinda low and that’s the only problem now. I love people here, and love the projects we make. It’s not stressful (it is sometimes but it’s normal). 

So I recieved an email from a job application I applied 2 months ago when things were bad. They say they want to meet me, I said OK but it freaks me out to think about leaving my comfort zone. (Of course it’s not certain that they will hire me but I think it’s a 80%.)The email came from one of the biggest mobile game companies in the world and they have so much benefits. Like a fully paid private health insurance, travels, a high salary, an incredible office etc. But they want you to be “perfect”  in response. I can’t handle work stress, that’s why I ask this here. It sucks the life out of me. 
All my friends are saying “wow you’re so lucky, definitely go for it”. But I’m not really a hard working, working over time kind of person. I just want to leave when the shift is over and that’s it.  And I love my current co workers.

So what should I do? Am I being too emotional?

967,I'm getting laid off.,"It honestly couldn't be at a better time for me, but there aren't any other jobs in this city that pay the same.

968,“Get a trade”,"“Just get a trade bro they pay well and you won’t be in debt” 

Nothing makes my blood boil more than hearing disenfranchised, hustle-culture bros say this.  If you can’t find a job, if you have financial hardships, if you can’t make enough money to make ends meet, then you’ll often be met with this response.  

Let me guess, you read one headline about how the trades have a rapidly depleting workforce and you have an uncle/brother/cousin that “makes good money working as a (insert trade here)”.

I took this advice myself after I graduated high school.  I used to spend my summers in high school working for local companies doing basic labor shit, so I thought they would be a good fit for me.  For 2 years after I graduated I worked for various contractors doing plumbing, carpentry, and HVAC.  

The trades fucking suck.  

“Oh you make a lot of money though” 

No you don’t.  There’s this huge misconception that skilled laborers are in such high demand that you’ll be rolling in cash immediately after getting a job.  

You’ll make a lot of money only if you 

A:  Own your own company

Or 

B: Work through a union (which means you’ll be working 60-70+ hours a week)



I worked for a property management company at one point and we only had one full-time plumber and he was a fucking master plumber (was also a fully trained HVAC technician with 30+ years under his belt).  He made 30$ an hour.  30 fucking dollars.  That’s like having 2 degrees and a masters and only making minimum wage.  He said he only stayed with the company because he liked working less than 9 hours in his old age.  

It takes a certain kind of person to work in the trades forever.  The type of work you’re doing sucks.  You’re constantly dirty, tired, sore, hurt, in a crawl space, cleaning up shit, dealing with assholes, lifting heavy shit, etc.  50s-60s is the retirement age for most guys (which is why the workforce is currently depleting).  You’re body gets destroyed.  I still have back problems from working in the trades.  My friends who still work as carpenters are constantly in pain, going to chiropractors, going to doctors, etc.

Trade culture is also incredibly hostile and toxic especially towards younger guys.  It’s like a form of hazing.  You will be given shit for the most trivial of offenses.  And it’s not like a quick critique, you will get a new asshole ripped.  Yeah sometimes someone will fuck up and deserve it every now and then, but this kind of hazing is so much more different than that.  There is little to none when it comes to positive feedback.  Trade culture is a constant dick measuring contest and it is usually accompanied by vicious slander.  No wonder no one wants to work in the trades nowadays.  You’re working long hours, doing shitty work, while getting constant negativity from boomers with massive superiority complexes.",False,eybxr1,Xx420noscopeXx98,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/eybxr1/get_a_trade/,30,1

975,Should I quit?,"I'm writing this on my phone at my desk as my computer faces the wall and I can't look at or do anything without my colleagues commenting on it.

I'm seriously considering quitting my job, but I'm undecided and I'm wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation. I work in an office in an educational establishment, which shall remain nameless, in a customer facing role. I was time (Monday-Friday 9am-5pm) from June 2015 until September last year, when I dropped to 3 days per week to study a postgraduate course that I'm enjoying.

I hate work. I'm in this sub, so you probably could have guessed that, but I thought I'd make it clear. I dread going in, it is mind numbing, and I'm always just thinking, there's so much more I could be doing rather than wasting my life here. I have essays to write, other reading and work for my course to do, and then things for enjoyment and health like working out and stuff.

I technically don't have to work. My partner earns more than enough to keep us not only afloat, but fine with bills and food etc. but still able to go away and enjoy ourselves. He has said that he is happy to support me if I quit, but I feel bad. We would get way more time together, which we would both love, but I'd feel I was being selfish not earning. As it is, he makes 4-5 times my monthly wage.

I'm just worried I will regret quitting if I do, if I will feel terrible on my partner, but then I am planning to advance my career in a way I hope I will find stimulating whilst studying my course, so it's not like I won't be doing anything.

This is probably a bit muddled as I think I'm trying to sort it out in my own head. I've been considering this for a while, but then today my colleague spoke to me so awfully that I came to the bathroom to cry. This isn't usual for me, and it wasn't even about a work related matter. It was so strange and out of the blue, it's not like we are actual friends or anything but we've normally been cool with each other at work. Most of the rest of the office treat me like a weird outsider. There's loads of extra out of hours stuff I have to do too, that is not worth it, and my experiences today have just made me question if I should just go for it.

People are in a work culture where they are seen as wimps if they expect to have a reasonable work load or even in some cases decent reward for their work or time off.

People who self-harm or have suicidal thoughts is increasing. Medication is reported as the most common type of treatment for a mental health problems. This totally ignores the cause while treating the symptoms. It is painful to watch society wring their hands and ask the question ""why, why is this happening?"" when it is so blatantly obvious.

- And if you are already get a lot of money right now (so if you are get paid higher than your supposed rate level allows) you wouldn't get a rise every year, till you fit in your rate level with your coworkers.

2. Those 4 people in this company who are getting that much, are getting so ridiculous much more, it should be illegal.
3. You can give always a rise, you can't just pay less, it's up to you, not the union.

1033,"Anti-intellectualism, antiquated class-warfare-ism, and ideologues","This is a response to the popular thread from a few days ago on ""Petite bourgeois aspirations..."":  [https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ewmo6a/petite\_bourgeois\_aspirations\_porky\_apologia\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ewmo6a/petite_bourgeois_aspirations_porky_apologia_and/) 

I think it is clear from the comments that not all r/antiwork users are 19th century, class-warfare-minded communists. And there are some, frankly, anti-intellectual and problematic positions espoused in the thread. My goal here is to address some of the major issues that I have seen, both in how leftist strategy is portrayed in this thread, as well as to address the ethical problems and issue of moralization. 

I approach this as a reader of Marx, Zizek, Laclau and Mouffe, Antonio Negri, and several other contemporary and classic political economists, cultural theorists, and philosophers. 

I grew up working class and have restored old 1920s rental properties and rent them out at fair market prices to people in my small town. That has led several users to call me a ""leech fucking landlord,"" a ""tic,"" and a ""Vampire."" Do I disagree? Not entirely. But there is much more nuance to it. Do not forget that you indulge in global capitalism, as well, every day. 

I am not a strategic enemy of the left. If a teacher making $50k in the Midwest with a couple of properties is a strategic enemy of the left, then the left is extraordinarily confused about its priorities. Luckily, the left is more complex than OP has made it out to be, in the linked thread. 

I wanted to make a couple of points that I think are quite important:

* Laclau and Mouffe, in their revered ""Hegemony and Socialist Strategy,"" recognize that an effective strategy for the Left will not fall along class lines and must organize a number of autonomous movements, stakeholders, organizations. It's not the 19th century anymore. Global, technological capitalism is complex.
* Slavoj Zizek, the revered, contemporary Slovenian anti-capitalist and philosopher, has stated in many lectures that good leftists will learn to play the game of capitalism to build the necessary wealth that will be needed to bring their strategy into action. In other words, you must ""play the game"" of capitalism, not only to survive, but to allow a strong leftist movement to arise and function (how else would you organize a movement, if not with capital, within capitalism?). 
* Contemporary socialist strategy, political economy, and ethics are much more complex than the name-calling class-warfare positions taken up in this thread. 
* Ideologues, when challenged, revert to name-calling and the espousing of dogma. This seems to be the case with much of the antiquated Marxism in the linked thread. OP uses terminology like ""crocodile tears,"" ""pearl-clutching,"" and ""Vampirism"" to attack users rather than explain political, economic, or social positions. 
* We are all guilty of exploitation in global capitalism. Anyone using Reddit on a smartphone, laptop, or PC is using a device that was created with components manufactured in several countries around the world created with materials mined in, likely, horrifying conditions that are extremely exploitative. So I challenge users in this thread to assess their own house and being before attacking others. I.e., ""If any of you is without sin, let him be the first to cast a stone."" I mean this seriously. The things you do everyday are indulgences in global capitalism. None of us are guiltless. That does not make us unethical beings. 
* I worry that young users in /r/antiwork will miss out on valuable financial information and opportunities to improve their positions in life because of the rhetoric of ideologues like in the above, linked post. Working class people have very few methods to obtain wealth. Private property and investments are two of the most effective methods. These things can be used carefully and thoughtfully to improve one's position. 

That is probably it, for now, though there is much more we can discuss. To summarize, 19th century class-warfare politics is antiquated and not helpful for most users, and it certainly discourages active discussion that could allow people to envision new political realities. 

There are many folks who use this sub, and there are many reasons to dislike work or want to abolish work. Similarly, there are a limitless number of methods to re-imagine the distribution of resources in a global economy. **We should be open to self-education, discussion, and critical and analytical thinking, rather than siding with ideologues.** That's my case. 

And in defense of my self, since I was called out and attacked in the ""porky apologia"" thread, is that I have restored, by hand, buildings from the early 1900s and converted them to rentals. I grew up working class. I have slept in a car. I know the suffering of life. We live in capitalism. If small-time landlords did not provide rentals to low-income families, families who are starting out and young, or college students, who would? Massive real estate investment firms, who would charge much more, exploit much more. 

I am not the enemy of the left. 

And even if I were, there are lots of people who use this sub, r/antiwork, and I would like to remain here and have intelligent discussions with other users about how they might find a way to live without working. For some that is FIRE. For some it is LeanFIRE. For some it is vanlife. For some it is communes. 

For some, unfortunately, it seems that they will clutch to an outmoded fashion of class-warfare ideology, will never invest in anything, never improve their position in the world, and will stay in poverty as a martyr while imagining that they are fighting imaginary enemies who never existed.",False,eyvruc,DefenseofLostCauses,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/eyvruc/antiintellectualism_antiquated_classwarfareism/,25,1

1036,I have obtained a sustainable 24 hour work week in the USA. Now how do I prevent loneliness?,"I am a M (23).  To those curious I am a registered nurse.  My hospital offers a 'weekend warrior' program.  With the schedule change as of this week, I now work 2 12 hour shifts and get paid for 32 hours, am still considered full time for benefits, but all my shifts must be Saturday/Sunday.  I can take off a weekend for vacation quarterly, amounting to a month paid vacation a year.  If I pick up one additional four hour shift per week I will earn the same paycheck I did previously, still working less hours total, but with my budget that isn't even necessary if I don't want to.  The weekends I factored as a small price to pay, because my job previously required I work every other weekend anyway.

This is a much more manageable schedule for me.  I am anti-work, I loathed putting in my 36 before.  For the most part I am an independent person.  I live alone and there are many activities I perform solo everyday.  Personal fitness is a big priority in my life.  I work out most days, but I have been struggling to eat healthy so this is something I'm trying to focus on.

I have lived alone for going on four years now.  The loneliness has been catching up to me after a while, and I fear the one drawback of this schedule change is that it could make this worse.  As I said I am mostly a loner, but all this time spent living alone after so long is getting to me.  I am worried the additional free time may only make it worse.

At my age, living in the U.S. most of my friends work a 40 hour week, many regularly upwards of 50/60 hours.  And for the most part these jobs occupy their Monday-Friday, and for some they work every single day, spare a random day off every now and then.

1040,"I’m thankful for my worst boss, because she taught me exactly who I never want to be.","My last boss was my last typical “job” before dedicating myself fully to becoming an independent contractor. To be honest, working for her solidified that if I had to do this “work to survive” thing, I would rather be an independent contractor than be an employee subject to awful treatment. 

During the interview process, I related to her a lot. She was almost like the more arrogant version of me. There were a lot of points in our conversation that we agreed on, but her ego peaked through during the interview process. If I knew what I know now, I would’ve just said no and kept it moving. But, I said yes, and that tiny ego that I experienced in that office only grew to be one of the most arrogant people I have ever met.

This was a small start up. The CEOs were titans with amazing resumes. To give you an idea of what kind of ego my boss had, she was an executive assistant to someone huge and very frequently on the news. Not sure if her former boss is running for president, but he’s mentioned it many times in the past.

Through the small office tour, I should have known I was walking into a shit storm. Everyone looked miserable. 

After working there I realized it was normal for the CFO of the company to go on these venting rants with the other employees because of how awful the CEOs were. Yes, you read that right. The CFO of the company. Apparently it was very normal for the CFO of the company to cry because of how absolutely mean one of the CEOs was to her. Disgustingly degrading. Despite being the CFO, she had no power, and was treated worse than anyone.

I felt like I was living in an office version of Mean Girls. 

The CFO who was training me for my job kept constantly telling me that if I had any problem I could vent to her. That was the culture of the office.

The CEOs were so arrogant that if you needed clarification on what they were saying, they wouldn’t want to clarify anything. They would say something like I said what I said. It’s not so hard. Yell.

One day when I was calling the CFO to talk about a particularly tough day, and that I was thinking of quitting she said “Quit? Where would you go? Every job is like this.”

Even though I encouraged her to find another job where she may be happy, the CFO told me that since every job is like this, she didn’t see the point in leaving. I don’t believe that to be true. I think in this really tough world, you need to find a space that makes you happy. It made me sad that she didn’t even want to try.

In order to keep up with this job, my hours didn’t exist. The hours they assured me during my interview did not exist. If I didn’t work beyond those hours, I was scrutinized. However, that’s what needed to be done to keep up with this job. Like, be attached to your computer, and even work on answering emails before bed. That kind of level.

One day when the CFO went to a wedding, the CEOs were saying that she would probably respond back despite taking a day off.

When I said “But, she’s at a wedding...”

Their response was “I’m sure there’s Internet access there.”

How disgusting.

To cope one of the other assistants partied hard and drank heavily on the weekend.

I also saw how my boss was with her kids. I feel so sorry for them. Her son was obviously going through a bad emotional time. He was just a kid that needed to be listened to. But, just like she treated all of us, she ignored any try for a good conversation, and insisted it was her way or nothing else.

One day, I realized I couldn’t make her happy. When I took one mental health day, the work that piled up was so much that I couldn’t catch up. She was furious, but I knew I couldn’t make her happy.

So, I sat her down and told her I didn’t think I could work at the capacity she wanted me to work.

She said something to the effect of “I made things so simple for you. I trained you. None of this was hard.”

She also said something to the effect of “Every job is like this, so I don’t know what you would be capable of doing.”

I know I’m capable of doing a job where I treat myself kindly, have a life, and if I work well with other people I will pride myself on not acting like an employer version of a bridezilla.

I’m capable of kindness and listening. I wish she was capable of the same.

She made me realize that sometimes in chasing your dreams and aspirations, you could become really full of yourself and ignore all the outside noise. When it gets to that point, you really need to evaluate yourself as a person. If you don’t, you could become just like her.

She taught me to not admire someone just because of their resume. You know what they have accomplished, but you do not know what kind of person they are.

1044,Let me tell you how stupid rich my boss is...,"Let's just say my boss is an exploitative asshole.

Some of my co workers are ""independent contractors.."" who accept cash tips only for their  services. 

They have to pay a large portion of this to the owner. If they dont get tipped a certain minimum... policy is, get this bullshit, they still have to pay the owner out of their pocket for service provided. So hypothetically, you could go to work and have a really shitty day, and end up owing money to your employer.

That is some fucked up exploitative shit. 

Now, since its cash, and these 'independent contractors' are not on the clock, .... the owner doesn't necessarily *have* to report that to the Gov't. 

Ha... yeah.. it gets better...

My boss is very VERY cheap when it comes down to the actual business. I am luckily in a different department than the independent contractors, so I get an hourly that's not much above minimum, but I also accept tips. I can make full time money in about a quarter of the time usually.

So the place I work at just had some renovations done, and theres so many other things that need to be done but the owner just refuses to put the money into it. 

Why is it that business owners sometimes dont understand that you really need to maintain your business and that means putting some real money into it in order for it to thrive in the changing generations. 

So, okay we have, exploiting the employees, and not maintaining the business properly... and yet still raking in serious cash...

1062,"""Come in half an hour before your shift every day unpaid""","I work for an insurance company taking and assessing claims. 

The computers we work on are ancient and we have quite a few programmes we have to load up before we can do anything which usually takes a while. 

Yesterday I got in to work 15 minutes before the beginning of my shift, logged in to my phone (that's basically how we clock in so they know what time we've got here) and started opening everything on my computer. It took 20 minutes for everything to open so I didn't change my code to available until about 10 minutes in to my shift. 

Today my manager emailed to ask why I wasn't available until ten past. I was honest and said I was waiting for everything to open but as he could see I was there 15 minutes before my shift started. He told me he'd have to mark me down as late for my shift and said I should come in at least half an hour before the beginning of my shift to open everything (any time before my shift starts is always unpaid).

If I'm ""late"", which also includes coming back from break 1 minute late more than twice in 2 months I'll get put on a lateness plan and most likely fired as I've seen happen to former colleagues.

It sucks so bad because I have a chronic illness and would do anything for just a 5 day work week. I've been desperately applying since Thanksgiving but got nothing so far. 

Its like the entire aerospace industry is fueled by young men with no families and cocaine. I literally have no time to do anything anymore. I am a husk surviving just for this rich man's project, praying they'll give us a hint of even a $500 bonus (which I still think would be really low for the type of work/project and committment required).

I dream of being able to self publish some more books but despite other writers snarkishly yelling at people over the internet to ""stop procrasinating &amp; just go write"", I have no energy in me when I get back home to use my brain to write. I pick up a video game and smoke, eat something frozen and go to bed.

Its such a shame too because I work so much that I'm probably spending a lot of money on frozen food and I LOVE TO COOK. 

The worst part about it is I'm such a bad person according to my family (who know I've been sick) to dream about finding a 5 day a work week job. I fantasize about how much writing I could get done. Not only writing but simple things such as... going to the post office. Going for a walk outside. Meeting someone at the local tea place around 8-9pm (usually always in bed by that time).
