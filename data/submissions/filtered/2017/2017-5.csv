The core of this idea is that all persons, regardless of whether they work or not, shall have the unconditional right not to starve &amp; not to be w/o shelter."" - Erich Fromm [x-post]",many of the evils of presentday capitalist and communist societies would disappear with the introduction of a guaranteed yearly income the core of this idea is that all persons regardless of whether they work or not shall have the unconditional right not to starve and not to be without shelter they shall receive not more than is basically required to sustain themselvesbut neither shall they receive less this right expresses a new concept for today though a very old norm demanded by christianity and practiced in many primitive tribes that human beings have an unconditional right to live regardless of whether they do their duty to society it is a right we guarantee to our pets but not to our fellow beings the realm of personal freedom would be tremendously enlarged by such a law no person who is economically dependent on another eg on a parent husband boss could any longer be forced to submit to the blackmail of starvation gifted persons wanting to prepare for a different life could do so provided they were willing to make the sacrifice of living in a degree of poverty for a time modern welfare states have accepted this principlealmost which actually means not really a bureaucracy still administers the people still controls and humiliates them but a guaranteed income would require no proof of need for any person to get a simple room and a minimum of food thus no bureaucracy would be needed to administer a welfare program with its inherent waste and its violations of human dignity the guaranteed yearly income would ensure real freedom and independence for that reason it is unacceptable to any system based on exploitation and control particularly the various forms of dictatorship it is characteristic of the soviet system that even suggestions for the simplest forms of free goods for example free public transportation or free milk have been consistently rejected free medical service is the exception but only apparently so since here the free service is in response to a clear condition one must be sick to receive it considering the presentday cost of running a large welfare bureaucracy the cost of treating physical especially psychosomatic illnesses criminality and drug addiction all of which are largely forms of protest against coercion and boredom it seems likely that the cost of providing any person who wanted it with a guaranteed annual income would be less than that of our present system of social welfare the idea will appear unfeasible or dangerous to those who believe that people are basically lazy by nature this clich has no basis in fact however it is simply a slogan that serves as a rationalization for the resistance against surrendering the sense of power over those who are helpless that was an excerpt from the book to have or to be by erich frommhttpsenwikipediaorgwikierichfromm a 20th century psychoanalyst social thinker and humanist noted for his critical dissection of what he considered to be many of the social ills of contemporary society i highly recommend the book to everyone in this sub originally posted in rbasicincome and rfuturology but i would also recommend it to people in this sub  much of his writings can even be found online and his interviewshttpswwwyoutubecomresultssearchqueryerichfromm can be found on youtube,6ch11e
