4,The problem with working too much,this post was originally on r productivity  a user told me you folks would appreciate it too     ----  for the ambitious among us  we feel that success in today s hyper-competitive world can only be obtained by pouring more and more time into work  long hours grinding it out in the office is almost taken for granted as a prerequisite for success   ascending the corporate ladder or making your business succeed can come to seem like a punishing endeavor  especially considering that we have other important priorities like spending time with our families or keeping up a social life   however  the scientific literature shows unequivocally that more time does not translate to more productivity in the long term  it seems we have been seriously mistaken in our approach to work  in fact  working for longer hours can actually be detrimental to your work     the problem with overwork  in the productivity project  chris bailey examines the optimal amount of time we should spend working per week in order to maximize our productivity    gt one study found that when you work sixty-hour weeks  in order to accomplish one more hour of work  you need to work two hours of overtime  yet another study found that your productivity  falls off a cliff after 55 hours so much so that someone who puts in 70 hours produces nothing more with those extra 15 hours    after thirty-five to forty hours of work  studies show that your marginal productivity begins to drop  until  at approximately eight 60-hour weeks  the total work done is the same as what would have been done in eight 40-hour weeks  the same study found that with seventy- and eighty-hour weeks  you reach the same breakeven point in just three weeks    studies show that the ideal number of hours to work every week is even lower than that  they suggest that the optimal number is roughly thirty-five to forty hours   the human brain cannot handle long hours  it simply does not have the capacity for such prolonged periods of concentration  beyond a certain point  you simply do busy work instead of meaningful work that actually moves the needle forward   you might feel a lot less guilty when working longer hours  but those hours aren t really contributing to anything  when you consistently work long hours  it s usually a sign that you re not spending your time and attention wisely not that you have too much to do     where did long hours come from   today we treat stress and overwork as a badge of honor  we brag about how little sleep we get and how few vacation days we take  we even want to be known as workaholics  the time we spend at work is seen as a direct indicator of our commitment to the job  but where did this deeply pernicious idea come from   our tendency to pile on more time is a remnant of the industrial age  when more time actually did translate to more productivity  back then  the work was mostly physical  in actual factories  and creating tangible products  it didn t require high levels of concentration    gt measuring time first became important during the industrial revolution  when factory owners needed their workers to arrive on time  today  in the knowledge economy  if you want to become more productive  managing your time should take a backseat to how you manage your energy and attention     when we transitioned into the time economy  we began to trade our time for a paycheck  but as we have transitioned into the knowledge economy  we ve begun to trade so much more than just our time  most people who work nonfactory jobs trade some combination of their time  attention  energy  skills  knowledge  social intelligence  network  and ultimately their productivity  for a paycheck   now  we are all very much knowledge workers  in factories and fields  we could point to physical products at the end of the day  but in the knowledge economy that s not possible  the  product  is intangible and projects may take years to complete  but we still assume that spending more time will lead to better work  simply pouring more time into work does not improve the quality of the end product   rest    gt the assumptions that knowledge is produced rather than discovered or revealed  that the amount of work that goes into an idea determines its importance  and that the creation of ideas can be organized and institutionalized  all guide our thinking about work today  when we treat workaholics as heroes  we express a belief that labor rather than contemplation is the wellspring of great ideas and that the success of individuals and companies is a measure of their long hours   santiago ram n y cajal  in his book advice for a young investigator  argues that a view of work as demanding countless hours of dedicated effort as a kind of  intellectual work leads investigators to waste their energy on small and superficial problems   rest    gt but this was a style of work  ram n y cajal argued  that led to asking only shallow  easily answered questions rather than hard  fundamental ones  it created the appearance of profundity and feelings of productivity but did not lead to substantial discoveries choosing to be prolific  he contended  meant closing off the possibility of doing great work emphasis mine     the proper approach to knowledge work  so if not time  then what  how do we get ahead   the proper approach to knowledge work is  according to santiago ramon   cerebral polarization or sustained concentration  in other words  working with great intensity of focus and concentration also known as deep work   knowledge work requires vigorous concentration of mental energy  this state of sustained concentration  writes ramon   refines judgment  enriches analytical powers  spurs constructive imagination  and by focusing all light of reason on the darkness of a problem allows unforeseen and subtle relationships to be discovered   except  it doesn t seem possible for the human brain to sustain such intense focus for too many hours each day  the daily maximum is about 4 hours  any longer  and your thinking becomes hazy and nebulous   all manner of high achievers attest to this rather contentious assertion  charles darwin s daily  work  schedule consisted of just three ninety-minute periods  g h  hardy  one of the leading mathematician s of the first half of the twentieth century said   four hours creative work a day is about the limit for a mathematician  countless writers including charles dickens and anthony trollope express similar sentiments  in fact  this is even endorsed by modern tech entrepreneurs  as alluded to in paul graham s  maker s schedule http www paulgraham com makersschedule html   deep work can only be sustained for a limited time each day  work too little  and you re not maximizing your progress  work too much  though  and you increase the likelihood of simply resorting to busy work  draining yourself mentally  or burning out  to succeed  you must avoid exhaustion and limit work to an amount from which you can recover on a daily and weekly basis   thus  if you want to achieve maximally in your job  the proper approach is to break your workday into a few sprints and recoveries  the foundation of high performance is balancing rest and recovery  during sprints  you focus all your energy and intensity and work forcefully  then  you recover  you allow your mental energy to replenish by resting  you go on a pleasant walk  take a nap  do some breathing exercises  practise yoga poses  listen to some music  read a magazine  eat a snack  take a shower or do anything else you find pleasant and relaxing  a good rule of thumb is to schedule an inviolable twenty-minute break every 90 minutes   the utility of recovery is most obvious in the lives of scientists  many famous stories of breakthroughs involve periods of intense work  then during a break  the answer suddenly appears in a flash of insight  in contrast  the scientists who cram their schedules with shallow work sacrifice profound insights to carry out a lot of superficial tasks     work for the sake of work  nietzche wrote   what could destroy us more quickly than working  thinking  and feeling without any inner necessity  without any deeply personal choice  without pleasure as an automaton of  duty  this is the very recipe for decadence  even for idiocy   you see  many of us work for the sake of work  we tend to see work as meaningless drudgery  we may work so that we can feel  productive  or so that the boss can see us sweat hard  perhaps we might even genuinely feel that all the hours we re putting in are really making an impact  all of this does not lead to great work being done   if high performance is our goal  we need to understand the necessity of rest and recovery  rest is not the adversary of work  rest is its essential partner  rest and recovery allow us to perform maximally  it replenishes our mental and physical energy  and permits us to give our best  it is for this reason that american business journalist berties charles forbes wrote   how we spend our non-working hours determines very largely how capably or incapably we spend our working hours   the data is in  the conclusions have been drawn  we should not be working long  gruelling hours  it s bad for our productivity  and for our lives  instead  focus your energy and intensity into sprints  and work with sustained concentration for shorter amounts of time  make rest a priority   in the modern era  we have overridden the natural rhythms of work  the challenge now is to deliberately create boundaries and take time for recovery      this post first appeared on  conceptopia net https conceptopia net  go on and check it out if you liked this article ,l9v5dr

7,I genuinely think we will see a change in the future,no  maybe not in 5-10 years  hell  maybe not even in 20 years  but it is blatantly obvious that people ages 12-30 do not have the same outlook on life as their parents did  our parents were driven by their work  they define their life and their success based on how their work is going  it s all they know  the internet has allowed us all to share our experiences and deepest secrets  it has allowed us to tell each other things we are too afraid to speak out about publicly  we ve realized nobody likes work and it s okay to admit that  our parents are afraid to say this because it defines them  if they say work is stupid then they re admitting their life is meaningless    seeing how unwilling younger people are to take shit from authority  or as older folks would call it  being lazy  gives me hope  the internet allows us to join up in larger numbers  we actually wield a small amount of power now  albeit still nothing compared to the government  but alas  we can make a difference  when we become the ceo s and when we become the parents  we can change the rules  and i m confident we will to an extent  the world is changing  and i believe we are opening up to the idea that life is more than just working  this sub s success is proof of that  do you think a newspaper section about antiwork would ever garner support in the 50 s  hell no    so don t give up  fight and stand up for yourselves  one day we ll see a change  even if it s only a little change  it ll be worth knowing we did something to improve not only our lives  but the lives of the future generations ,l8g0iv

10,How do we successfully achieve/maintain life without work?,hopefully this makes sense  i m sorry if it doesn t  but i m all for just existing  creating and genuinely enjoying life and actually just living  what i m wondering  is realistically how could we make that possible  how could we still live survive  acquire shelter  food all those kind of things  do those who want to work still work  help from technology  do we still trade some kind of labor for our necessities  i m very genuinely interested in what others think about how we survive not having to work  like i said  i m all for it but this is one question i m always asked   how do you except to live if you don t work     just to be clear  i do not doubt this way of life  i absolutely believe it s achievable  i m just wondering how could we actually make this possible especially in today s world  not what we do to get there  a lot would have to change  but how we maintain it  how would everything basically  function  ideally  would money still be used or not  assuming we can t really go back to the basics  do we become completely dependent on technology   not sure what kind of technology  but i think it could potentially be an advantage ,l91kwk

16,The actual meaning of working/studying and us losing touch with it,i am a social worker and yesterday me and my manager had a talk between shifts  one of the subjects being how overworked she was since there is so much to do  the most interesting thing she mentioned was that working five days a week or even more felt fine when she had the same position as me  no managerial responsibilities but only direct frontline work  since it was more about actually working with the clients and focusing on their needs instead of having to attend meetings  being available around the clock  dealing with bureaucratic bullshit  having to be a liaison to every authority or organization involved etc on top of the usual work  now five days a week feel like just too much for her which is understandable   for those of you who have a client contact based profession  you probably recognize this dilemma  the higher up you become in the field  the less in touch you are with the clients and the heart of the work  you become more responsible and have an opportunity to change how things work from within  however you lose much of the relationships you build directly with them  which  for me  is the core of actual social work   using your interpersonal skills to empower  support and help clients through this society filled with poverty and terrible work environments shaped by inequality  racism and bureaucracy jungles    after i graduated university  i moved to another country to do the same type of work  one of my colleagues back home asked me why  i said  why not  i want to travel and learn and do things that make me happy  his response was  yes sure  but don t you want to have a job that is more  prestigious  all i could think was  if you think having a prestigious job is the most important thing  you re going to be a terrible social worker   humans are natural learners and labourers  we all have different types of skills that could contribute to our society  the value being the products  itself  and not the money be get in exchange for it  this doesn t only apply to actual materialistic products  but other human intra- and interpersonal skills such as being a good listener  giving advice  singing  problem solving  sharing knowledge  storytelling and so on  however all these skills are losing their actual face value since it is now more about how much you can work and how much money or status you can make instead of actually accumulating and developing abilities  what is the point of  doing what you love  if you re going to water it down or even drown it with thoughts of climbing up some status ladder  and for what  apart from improving your resume  the worst thing you can do is letting others expectations ruin your passion   has anyone experienced or have general thoughts about this meaningless and almost hysterical climb-the-career-ladder-mantra  especially in north america  in some way that has affected your interest for your actual work studies  how did you cope  i would love to know especially if you work in a different type of field  whether it s being a lawyer designer factory worker  anything really ,l8th4t

21,No Degree-Customer Service Trap (Rant),so  college has never really been for me  i attempted to attend community college after high school in 2011  over the past 10 years  i've lost interest in countless classes and continually either fail out or drop out voluntarily  truthfully  the only reason why i've tried at college so many times is because i've felt pressured by society and family friends  i am knowledgeable in many areas including photography  computers  and writing  however  the problem is that i don't have the piece of paper that says so   i love to learn but on my own terms  am i just destined to work jobs that provide little-to-no respect  garbage pay  and often times have to deal with customers    i'm on my 18th job in 10 years  and it's gotten no better  my friends who graduated from college still work sucky jobs  i have strong opinions about work in general  so trust me  my goal in life isn't to find some dream job  but they at least get to do things that are somewhat interesting  i always get stuck working with customers or being someone's assistant in one way or another  right now  i work for a software company  it's monday-friday  9-5 30pm  i hate the schedule  and it has me completely burned out  the job was supposed to be for a desktop support technician  but  of course  it turned into a role where i call rude customers on the phone and help them with software-related issues   sometimes i sit at my desk and i just get a wave of depression because  it's like  here i am 10 years later  and i feel that i'm in the same boat i've always been in    of course  when i tell most people about this  they call me lazy and say   what can you expect  you have no skills  even though  no offense  but most of these people can't even form a proper grammatically correct sentence  but they have a degree  so they feel superior to me  i'm not lazy at all  it's just that none of my interests provide profit and my knowledge has come from my own learnings instead of a classroom    so  is this it for me unless i submit to higher formal education  even though  i suppose  it may be no better  we all just end up working for some asshole and are supposed to be grateful for it   i don't know  i guess i just needed to vent  maybe someone else feels the same way ,l7yvf7
22,What is The Solution,medium link   https medium com the-way-out-of-this-mess chapter-1-what-is-the-solution-1ad34e7bda36 https medium com the-way-out-of-this-mess chapter-1-what-is-the-solution-1ad34e7bda36   the solution is the decommodification of everything through sustainability  automation  and essentialism  easy right  in more concrete terms  the solution is to strengthen the relationship between production  consumption  and sustainability  the solution is to design society in such a way that things are not just produced  for-profit  but actually for the benefit of humanity as a whole  this means abandoning the concepts of money  unending growth  and thoughtless consumption  and instead of building a society based around community  intention  and sustainability  to do this it is not possible to work within the current bounds of liberal democracy  it is also not advisable to try and seek a violent nonconsensual revolution   let s go over what i just postulated in detail  decommodification is the process of taking things that were once traded as commodities  i e  for our purposes branded products in a capitalist market  and turning them into something else  a good example of what this looks like is the free u-pick fields in the midwestern united states  these are fields of usually blueberries that have been left to grow and now are a community resource that you can harvest from freely  another example from before capitalism took hold were the british commons before the enclosure movement  these resources weren t traded weren t branded they were just resources that existed  making resources the property of all is not the only way to decommodify resources  for soldiers in the american military  mre and other government equipment are not commodified   sustainability can be hard and nebulous  to define  it s often much easier to start off with what not sustainable  and then try and postulate what a world without those things might look like  therefore a world with no unsustainable elements   a more sustainable world  things that are unsustainable usually produce nothing of usable value to either nature or humans after they have been used  due to the nature of thermodynamics  everything will eventually end up in this state  but how long it takes to reach that state give a good metric by which we can measure the sustainability of a given object  how long until everything associated with it is unusable  or a system  what sustainable vs unsustainable distribution does it produce  or a society  how do many of the systems which make up a society are sustainable  by this definition  there are very few things that are unsustainable but there are plenty of things that aren t that sustainable  for example  many plastics are considered unsustainable because once they are used they can t be recycled into new high-value items  but they can be used for all sorts of things they are just of lower value  building material  decoration  synthetic thread  etc  so we see that certain plastics can be rated on how after each use how much value does it lose after each use  both to humans  and to the environment  and how other plastics such as bioplastics  for example  are very sustainable because after reuse they maintain a larger percentage of their value and actually gain value to the environment  applied to products this means practices like planned obsolescence are unsustainable because they are built upon the product losing value over its lifecycle  applied to systems this means that inflation is usually unsustainable as it makes the store of value such as the dollar lose value overtime with no gain in its worth to the environment   automation is not really that hard to pin down it is the completion of labor  the process of adding or transmuting value  being done by a non-human autonomous self-managing  agent  that means tool use is not necessarily automation having a better axe does not make one s job more automated  usually  this takes place when machinery s lifetime cost is less than that of a human laborer s  this can only happen however is the machinery s initial cost can be paid  integrated automated systems lead to an astonishing network effect of rapid and efficient just in time manufacturing   essentialism is an offshoot of the minimalist movement  with minimalism being a response to hyper-consumerism  the goal of both minimalism and essentialism is to consume less  essentialism goes about this by practicing  the disciplined pursuit of less  what i am advocating for is not the mainstream version of either minimalism or essentialism  what i m advocating for is what i d like to call  the disciplined pursuit of nonsuperfluous self  which combines the tenants of essentialism  non-alienated labor  and zen buddhism  the idea is to have an intimate relationship with the things you come to possess by making sure you only possess things that you truly care about  what this looks like is when let s say you need new jeans you either find an artisan that knows how to make jeans and make an arrangement by which you receive jeans you love and they are fairly compensated  or you learn the craft of making jeans or realizing that the particular type of jean does not matter to you go and get a generic utilitarian  comfy pair   putting all these concepts together results in something magical  completely automating the supply chains of things allows for those things to become decommodified without having to endure the  tragedy of the commons  through this  you can then treat those automated decommodified supply chains like you would a 3d printer meaning that for essentialist consumption it allows you to customize every step of the manufacturing process allowing consumers to have more say in the products they consume  ultimately leading to less waste  and more self-identification with the product  this whole system can be engineered from a systems design approach from the beginning with a mathematical definition of sustainability in it from the start allowing for it to rated on sustainability   as long as these things can be produced sustainably after the startup costs are recuperated the things produced by these supply chains need not be bought or sold  the end result of this means that there is such a way in which you could set up a society like ancient athens where for the citizens the basic necessities of life can be guaranteed without cost to anyone  this society is the solution  a society where production  consumption  and sustainability are inseparably intertwined  this society where things are produced for the benefit of each and every member of the society  this society in which money is a construct of the past  where consumption is not the rule of the day ,l8o1ad

33,The sheer madness of just trying to find a basic job.,due to covid and being out of work for 5 months now  i'm been looking for anything to get money coming back in  my job hunt over the last few weeks -    10 hours a week 'temporary' cleaning job for 4 weeks   - must have 2 years of cleaning experience   its just 10 hours a week for a month  i clean my house for the last 2 years is this enough  obviously not as i never heard anything    shop shelf stacker or as they call it stock replenisher   - had to answer 8 questions on how i would handle certain situations with customers and then a short personal questionnaire where you had questions like  would you be happy to do overtime  do you see yourself as a team player   do you look to go above and beyond in your job   it almost feels like entrapment as you have to say yes to these questions to get any chance of getting the job then if you do they can hold you to it  then finally if i got that far i would need to have an interview  its just stacking shelves    part-time estate agent administrator -  needed someone to help with basic admin tasks consisting  of generating letters  printing out contracts   no selling house  no advising people  just paperwork   required - 3  years of property experience    its seems the more basic and lower wage the job the more they expect from you to get it  i saw another role which was minimum wage   40 hours  a week and in their words a generous work package which included  20 days holiday  20 days  the average is normally 22 to 24  how can they see that as generous    back 20  years ago when i was fresh out of college i never remember it being this hard to get a basic temporary job i used to go into a recruitment agency down my local high street hand over my cv and be starting a temp role the following monday ,l8kk0q

62,Leeching Off Taxpayer Money? Not Quite.,i hear this argument a lot in critique of anti-work and leftist thought that many of us are lazy and entitled  and are living off taxpayer money  it's usually meant to express outrage from people who are financially successful and have been working hard  however  since the argument is both pervasive and illogical  i thought it perhaps worthwhile to write a brief-ish response      to begin with  if you have been financially successful  consider yourself lucky  increasingly  most of us do not have that privilege  and  i do agree that taxes are too high  this is because most of your tax money is going to pay for wars  prisons  and billionaire subsidies  moreover  the welfare that does exist  such as medicare  as inefficiently run to the point where the people administering the service make more than the people benefiting from the service itself  so if you don't like paying high taxes  first take a look at where they are going      secondly  though i can't speak for others  i myself have three to four sources of income at any given time  i own a motor home  and an rv  by the legal classification in my country  i'm homeless  ie without a home  rent is too high  food is expensive  medical care is too expensive  i must rely on subsidies in one form or another- even with all the money i make  the rich people of my country  america  have monopolized real estate and cornered various markets to the point where they have collective monopolies  put together  they can charge whatever price they please and pay their employees whatever wage they like      so perhaps you can imagine the feeling i might have when i see someone come in and say  work harder  or  you're just lazy  i know it's not true  i know that many of us here in this sub actually do work hard  we're just tired at the end of our shifts  and we have little to nothing to show for it  we're being squeezed from all sides  we're doing the best we can  trying to survive in whatever way know how      if you're this angry at us  the working class  the poor  then you're on the wrong side  we're like you  we're tired of things being expensive  we want to have a bit of money set aside at the end of the month  we don't like the fruits of labor disappearing down rabbit holes we can't reach  we don't hate folks like you  in fact  most of us don't mind when someone works their way into success honestly  that's something to be celebrated  be proud of yourself  for you've done well      the animadversion comes in when you judge us  even though our struggle is so much like your own  when you try to set yourself up as above us  as though you are a better class of person- somehow  the vast majority of us aren't tax assessors or politicians  we don't determine the taxes you pay  a lot of us don't even like politics to begin with  please keep this in mind the next time you try to be judgmental and insulting      we're all just trying to live and get by  that's all ,l93hvv

88,MONEY ISN'T EVEN FUCKING REAL LMAO,i get this sounds like a stupid sophomoric stonerism but that doesnt change the fact that it's fucking true   the renewed furor at wallstreet and the billionaire class and the amount of people 'waking up' to the understanding that 'the game is rigged' is both inspiring and frustrating because while it's a step in the right direction to understand that the game is rigged it still falls short in acknowledging that we rig the game ourselves and that  money  is literally shaped and influenced by our collective ideas about it - it's an  egregore  - if we want to change something about it's form it's as  simple  as altering our shared beliefs - admittedly that's not that simple   unless of course we had some kind of technology that allowed for instant and constant communication between hundreds of millions of people all over the world   if 90  of us agree that the weekend begins on friday and ends on sunday  then that's all it takes to be true   if 90  of us agree that billionaires have no right to exist  then that's all it takes to be true   the problem up until now has been organizing the working class to act in unison - as an unstoppable force of nature - but with the curtains being pulled back thanks to the internet and our self-reflective and constantly connected culture  it seems more and more possible that organizing that kind of collective action is really only a meme away   i know leftists love a good revolution and rightfully want the rich holed up in their ivory towers quivering in fear - but guillotines can only separate a head from flesh - to behead an  idea  the meme is the only 'thing' that at our disposal that can destroy some other 'thing' with no physical form   and that meme is something along the lines of money isn't even fucking real lmao,l82vo5
89,"Work isn't bad, capitalism is",work is the way in which humans relate to their surroundings  many on here would love to step away from their jobs and create art but that creation is obviously work  for others they may find more traditional jobs as fulfilling as we find out art  what's important is that our work comes from a place a creativity instead of from the threat of poverty  the problem is not work  it's capitalism  in our current economic system in which profit is valued over human need  many are forced into debilitating work to serve the uber-wealthy who screw us over at every turn  we have the resources  man-power  and drive to house  feed  and pay for everyone to live comfortably  we could raise the standard of living of everyone without them even needing to work  the rich do not need their wealth  they tie it up and keep it from the public  for the sole purpose of profit  if those resources were fairly given  everyone could  right now  live without having to work  of course many would remain at their jobs  but now if you can't deal with the crushing forces of capitalism  you can step back and create something truly valuable without the threat of poverty  instead of scorning those who've been beaten by the bourgeois  we should stand together and show the true benefit of our work  we are creatives and we are artists  unvalued in this system despite the vital importance of our work  you're enemy is not work  it is capitalism,l8ytso

Spread the message.,  they've been deleting comments like mine that are trying to wake people up to the lies  now they've turned off comments on this video  and possibly others on the entire channel and maybe all of the news channels   money is taken as a result of your efforts  without people putting in effort there is no way for them to tax you  because you won't be putting in effort to earn money  therefore no tax can be taken from that money  because where does the money come from to begin with  it's created out of thin air by the banks  how  because there is a law that states banks are allowed to create print money that we the tax payer are expected to pay back in the form of interest  tax  you see what a scam it is  they create money that they never had that we have to put in effort to get  why should we  what effort did they  the banks and ruling elite  put in to earn it  they didn't  they expect us to believe the lie that money has intrinsic value  it doesn't  never has  never will   people are waking up  i don't use netflix or instagram  i torrent pretty much everything  why would i pay some corporation for movies when i can get them for free  i don't  because i know if i were to pay that money would end up in the hands of the ruling elite somewhere down the line  if every single person on the planet torrented and otherwise didn't use money for anything digital their precious toilet paper  money  would lose it's  value  so fast that their heads would spin   brokerage firms and the ruling elite are liars   so basically they  robinhood  brokerage firm  had no money to cover but they took people's money anyway  that is a scum move  it is bullshit   so the retail investors  us everyday people  put in our time and effort for essentially nothing  we are working for free  stop believing that money has value  it doesn't  never has  never will  the ruling elite need to be held accountable for lying to us  money has never had any value  stop putting in time and effort for nothing  to be clear when you go to work you are not getting anything of value for your time and effort  ask yourself why are you even bothering   watch and learn  you'll begin to understand how we've all been deceived and controlled since birth   i already knew this before i ever heard of anonymous  and before the internet was mainstream as it is now   anonymous message to the citizens of the world iii  https youtu be zpnzj9avwne  anonymous - if you think you can handle the truth  well here it is   https youtu be kqhsbh1plg8  the sad reality of this world - you have no choice ft george carlin  https youtu be 3fgq8pf3wyu   https youtu be v3pcjzdvyew,l985j6

178,One True Good Boss,i feel like i might get downvoted for this but i just want to share a positive experience with everyone to shine some light through the darkness   i legitimately have an awesome boss  he is the branch manager for 10 employees in our city while our headquarters are in a different city  that being said he is in the same trap as all the rest of us and does his best to make working as bearable as possible  im not talking buying lunch for everyone from time to time which he also does  im talking he is a genuinely good person to work under  i was hired right before the pandemic started  into a position that does not deal with any customers  when paycuts  and layoffs happened  he fought for everyones jobs  i personally never recieved any pay reduction  or hours lost    only 3 months into my job i ended up in the hospital with kindey stones and the guy did not so much as question the situation  he simply told me to do what i needed to do and get better  and if i needed anything to let him know  he didnt even ask for a doctors note  when i tried to return to work a couple days after i had surgery he told me not to  and to just stay home and rest  then sent me home when i came in that day anyway   he also payed me for half the days i missed without me using vacation or sick days mind you    i also had a tendency to fuck up a lot early on  im talking shit that would just instantly get you fired anywhere else  instead of giving me shit he checked in to make sure i was alright and worked with me to correct the things i was doing wrong  he never wrote me up  or disciplined me   another thing he did for me was put through paperwork to get all my education costs covered 100  by my company  under the pretense that it is relevant to my job and work   the last thing that he does that most bosses dont do is understand peoples situation  i have aspergers and severe adhd  this can have a huge effect on my ability to do certain tasks and work with people  i told him this and he was totally understanding  in fact he has made an effort to make sure that i do not have to do work that i would struggle with   this all happened since my very expensive fuck ups    he has let me take dr appointments without making me use sick time  and one day when i could not make it to work because of multiple feet of snow  he called me before the work day and said to stay home that no job was worth risking my safety for  i got payed for that full day  despite not working   i know working sucks but there are some genuinely good people out there  who are willing to take the time  and if you happen to work for them it makes working so much easier and less of a chore   anyway like i said i just wanted to share something positive in all the negative that there is  have a good day everyone ,l4qft5

212,I need input on a problem,i was working a seasonal position with burlington coat factory  all employees were supposed to use an app called ''v-time'' to get updates on my flexible schedule  i had never used this app prior to working at burlington as my previous jobs were student work placements that omitted certain routines from the work schedule    on my first day  the store managers was helping me set it up but due to bad internet my phone was taking literal hours to download the app  and neither i nor the store manager had that much time to wait so they told me they would help me set it up on my next shift  this never happened as every time i had a shift  the store manager just told me ''next time'' and resorted to simply putting me on literal call in which she would call me in to work through text or phone a day to 30 minutes ahead of my scheduled shifts  apparently  this was common with seasonal employees    according to all the documents  my seasonal position was supposed to end on january 11th  my last shift was on january 4th and absolutely nothing happened on january 11th  after january 11th i tried applying for more jobs to no avail    tonight i just got a call from the assistant manager telling me that i had a shift scheduled to start 30 minutes ago  i informed her that i received no notification of this  was never able to set up my v-time due to the manager always rescheduling it and i was under the impression that my work term ended on january 11th as according to my employee profile  she told me not to come in and she would speak to the store manager    i've had a very bad day so far and this has just added to it  i don't know if i'm in the wrong or if my manager is and i think it's very likely that i'll be fired for this    i suspect that i may be at fault here  i have asperger's and one of the many problems i have is that i can't remember who is who in the chain of command at a job  especially a job in a large store where the chain of command and number of employees are obviously larger  i may have been going to the wrong people at the wrong times and i never tell an employer that i have mental disabilities because that just guarantees that i won't get the job  so basically  to them  i'm acting like a complete and total idiot   i don't know what to do here and i need input from people ,l6mms6

214,My boss doesn’t give me any space,i graduated college recently and spent six months looking for full time work  my father  who is just as antiwork as me  always told me the only silver lining to working is working from home  so  i spent the last six months trying to find a remote job  and got to the final 2-3 people several times for jobs i really wanted  then was rejected   my biggest reason for seeking remote work is partially because of the pandemic and partially because i don t want to have to go to work and act like i care  but the biggest reason is because i m a musician and want to play gigs every night once the pandemic ends  and i want time to work on my music everyday   i got a job as a social media coordinator last month  and when i heard the hours were 10-5 instead of 9-6 i thought i won the lottery  those hours are perfect for what i want to do  i can sleep in and still have the whole night ahead of me  plus social media is trendy and i had a few internships doing this before  i told myself no matter what i will keep this job  even if it s awful  just because i need to move out and to a new city where music is booming   but i m finding it very hard  every day that goes by i m more depressed  my boss never leaves me alone  she texts and calls me on my off hours  i ll wake up at like 9 and she s already trying to call me  she ll text me at 9 at night asking me to do something  she makes me do shit on my days off - including new year s day  i had to wake up and immediately do something to our website  she spent over two hours on the phone with me last friday night after i was already done with work telling me what to do  she s incredibly narcissistic  thinks she s the shit because she built all of her companies from the ground up and makes it clear that nobody should work with her unless they are willing to not have a work life balance  she also makes it clear that she does not care about other people and will do anything to step on them and rise to the top   even though i work from home  i truly feel like i am never home  all of a sudden i have no work life balance  and am constantly thinking about work  both my parents work from home and get to leave at 5 and don t have to worry about it for the rest of the night or weekend  me  she s always bothering me  always giving me shit to do  i guess people were right about working from home - they ll exploit you because they think that just because you re home  you re not busy  i found myself looking at indeed yesterday even though i should be perfectly happy - it s everything i asked for  but not everything i imagined,l6z8mv

219,Please act your wage!,so i work in a large clinic hospital organization where i check in patients and schedule follow ups or other appointments  not a bad job but not something i want to do for years on end  despite supposedly high turnover we have some people who are complete lifers  cliques and stockholm syndrome are strong  i'm not knocking people who stick with one job but goddamn it'd be nice if we could rotate some of these people but that's me ranting because i know it's not a good idea but it still sucks    amp x200b   i'm a little biased because as for what department i work in it actually varies  it sounds like a bad thing but for me it's a good thing  i am a floater so where i am working day to day can change  if i don't like somewhere i have a very good chance of working somewhere else and trust me some of the clinics aren't that great  there's been times where i've been at the same clinic for a month and other times i've worked three different places in a day  that's cool because it's something different  my schedule and hours are always the same though and the schedule actually works for me and my family so that's good    amp x200b   there's one clinic i am in a lot and for the most part it's really easy  and a few people i really get along with and there's one person i have really hit it off with and we have a good time working so i sometimes look forward to going there more often than not  however we have two people who have the same name and they are both annoying but the thing besides name they share in common is that they do not act their wage  what do i mean by this  they act above their pay wage thinking they are supervisors and trainers  they are at a higher pay-grade as my job has various levels tied to  production  and to keep that level you have to meet the production  i'm not really a fan of this concept    amp x200b   look  i'm not against or above needing assistance but in this case i didn't need it and i had something today that really pissed me off  i've spent most of my time in this clinic as i've been working this job  anyway  i was checking in a person and they wanted to speak to the nurse which they normally don't see for this appointment  i let the patient know when they get back there they can request to speak to the nurse and i was almost done checking them in but one of them butted in and were like  well you can zoom the nurse if you look in the directory and get their name  oh they write it for the supervisor  or zoom the group  of which we have three zoom groups for the same job in the same clinic  oi  i could have done this yes  but honestly  the nurses are busy dealing with imo more important things like patient care  they may be in a meeting  a training  the schedule may change  they may be at lunch  busy helping another doctor etc and it may take a while for them to get back  i'm not afraid to approach a nurse if i need something but i'm not always going to make it the main solution  would you want a nurse to always rely on the doctor for everything they do or that comes out of their mouth  so they are doing this while i am helping the patient i'm pretty much put in a position where unless i want to look stupid or rude i have to call the nurse  they surprisingly answer and get the same answer i told the person initially - bring it up when you come back  if someone says something that needs a clinical answer i always tell them to say something when they get back there  jfc    amp x200b   i was going to say something to the supervisor of that clinic but they are aware of how the person acts - way too perky and too eager to help to where they butt in  it's a lot like spongebob and a couple other characters i can't think of right now and he's never done anything and you know what why would he  turns out they supposedly do a lot of his work if what i was told is true  do too much work in general and are too eager to jump in anything and everything that arises  it's ok to say no  it's ok to stay in your lane  if you want to be a supervisor or trainer then do it  we have a supervisor position open  but that will require you to leave this clinic    amp x200b   tl dr - act your wage  if you aren't a supervisor or a trainer please don't act like one ,l7ff25

244,Got my vacation request denied.,my workplace has a policy  if you schedule a vacation day either the day before or after a weekend  you aren't subject to mandatory overtime that gets scheduled on that weekend  so  on wednesday i saw the writing on the walls for overtime and opted to schedule a day preemptively to avoid it  my boss tells me he's leaning towards denying it  but he'd get back to me on his decision  fast forward to today  he comes to a conclusion  he denied it on the grounds that they need all hands this weekend  i don't give a  fuck  what you need  hire more people then  oh  turnover rate's high  maybe because you keep assigning us obscene amounts of overtime making a lot of people pick between family and work  naturally  i'm raising hell  i'm sick of it  if i get fired  so be it  i have more than enough saved to live a few years without them  the conversation was as follows   supervisor  4 39 pm i must decline the request for this weekend  we are all hands on   all trainers scheduled as well   me  4 41 pm with that being the reasoning behind declining my request  is this setting a precedent  that if vacation time is scheduled  it will be denied anytime everyone is scheduled  i just want clarification on what to expect here   supervisor  4 42 pm the decline essentially comes from higher than me due to the current time taken  me  4 43 pm despite the fact that the time taken was the bonus time i'd earned and not at all yet cut into the standard 11 days  i don't mean to be overly contentious  it just seems like the decision was made in poor judgment to myself  with all due respect   supervisor  4 45 pm i dont know of an easy way to answer   the decision came after discussion with sevral others   there are times we double down and throw down together as a team   it comes down to judgment  this request is determined to be one that is declined   i feel for your disinterest for ot   this weekend is one we need you   me  58 min though i feel that my vacation time should be just that  my time to use in whatever manner i please  i do however acknowledge the decisions made  as much as i believe they're poorly made  there's a high turnover rate now and decisions like that are not in any way conducive to turning that around  if  when these discussions come up  you could mention that i have ideas that could both help with turnover and help with  company name  i would appreciate that  a complaint without suggestions to improve is whining  however i do have suggestions to improve the situation if they have the ears to listen  on that note  i find it odd that the decision to approve vt doesn't lay solely with you  my direct supervisor  but i do digress   on that note  what hours will our department be working saturday  i'm guessing regular hours as that's what all the other departments seem to be getting  and similarly  which department will i be expected to report to   supervisor  37 min i would love these suggestions  i have had some of my own of late and look forward to any thoughts if ever the chance to discuss comes about  thank you for your thoughts in regards to potential improvements  i know there is a lot that happens over my head  and a lot that happens on the floor too  i find myself oddly stuck in the middle  at times right on  at times out of touch  saturday is a day for picking  all trainers and you as cubiscan scheduled to assist in picking  i ll see who needs the help and discuss with  general manager name   me  32 min just feels like it sets an extremely bad precedent in my eyes  that time scheduled could just be canceled at the leisure of upper-management if they just want us in here  rendering vacation time kinda moot if  you know  you can't even use it  it makes me lose any shred of faith that managerial staff is working in good faith with us and shows a distinct disconnect between them and us  especially respect for our lives outside of the building  like i get denying if  like  i'm trying take weeks off in a row in january  that's excessive  but attempting to utilize it within reason is just an extreme faux pas and further increases employee resentment towards them and the decisions they make   though i will say  despite things turning out as they have  i do at least appreciate you for letting me speak my mind without repercussion  anyone else would just shrug me off and probably attempt to write me up for insubordination  so kudos to you on that front   and understood  though i sincerely hope i wind up going to skf as i know it well  a question goes unanswered though  regular hours  correct   me  29 min  and i know you would love my suggestions  you have an ear out for me  but honestly  i want the chance to give these suggestions and feedback to upper-management myself  i  the humble floor worker  want to be the one that they hear it from so they can get the words directly from me exactly as i want them to hear them  no paraphrasing ,l7d40c

255,I feel like I want to say this under almost every post I see,the unfortunate reality is that we all need income to survive and unfortunately i can't give you a solution for that problem  however there are some things that you can do right now   the first thing you need to look into are worker co-ops  basically the workers own the business and get to vote on important matters  and the best part is that all those extra profits go right in to your pocket instead of some asshole ceo  this way get more influence and agency in the workplace and overall better working conditions  you also get better pay for the same work or you can keep your salary the same as in a capitalist business but work less hours  if a cooperative is doing very well in terms of revenue there are several options which might be bizarre in a capitalist enterprise  option 1 is to raise wages  this is always a winner and you can't really go wrong here  option 2 would be to keep wages as they are  but reduce working hours and hire more people  option 3 would be to keep wages the same but lower prices of products and services  in either case you are more competitive and a better place to buy from and be employed at  if you hate landlords look into housing cooperatives  the way you feel about work and jobs is shared by many and they will be willing to start a cooperative with you   the other thins that is super important is mutual aid  that is when you work for no pay  but you take care of your local community and they take care of you  a strong community makes sure everyone has what they need  it serves as a safety net so the members of the community can focus on doing more fulfilling things and not worry about basic stuff like food or shelter  so  if you are unemployed and get bored at home  or if you aren't and just want to help  think about lending a hand to some volunteer groups or homeless shelters  if a mutual aid network doesn't exist where you live try starting one  of course  covid is still a thing so be safe and if you or your family members are high risk just stay home   none of the work you do is worth it if someone dies in the process ,l5edyn

258,The Way Out Of This Mess: Prologue,the way out of this mess is an anti-work  post-capitalist manifesto  outlining in detail an automated society which provides for all  it is based on marxism  anarchism  and inspired by jacque fresco  bjarke ingels  paolo soleri  and many more  but it is written to attract moderate americans  would love to have somebody else read it and give me feedback   medium   https medium com the-way-out-of-this-mess https medium com the-way-out-of-this-mess   prologue   people  we re fucked  i mean like reeeaaaally fucked  i m writing this at the tail end of 2020  we are in the midst of a global pandemic  due to which many people have restricted their lives  leading to a 7  drop in carbon emissions   in spite of all this  2020 is shaping up to be  if not the top  at least in the top 3 warmest years on record  climate change isn t coming  it s here   it s not just the climate though  income inequality is the highest it s been in 50 years  political polarization is at levels not seen since the last civil war  which is keeping us from foreseeing the upcoming thucydides trap  and employment crisis due to automation  human civilization is rushing headlong into a cyberpunk dystopia   if we don t do something and fast then we can kiss this  long peace  goodbye  now i m not the only one to think this  even mainstream news outlets have caught on that the jig is coming to an end  plenty of people are looking to solve our current problems through ideological means  the revitalized american left seems mainly to think that through electoralism they can shift american policy enough to avoid the impending climate catastrophe  to put that in perspective the ipcc says that to mitigate the worst effect of climate change on human society  we should limit warming to 1 5  above preindustrial levels  that is not to avoid climate change that s just to mitigate the worst effects  2016 was 1 1  above preindustrial levels  the wmo says that we will hit 1 5  above preindustrial levels by 2024  to be honest given the current geopolitical situation we can kiss our nice stable climate goodbye  that doesn t mean that there s no hope  it just means we have to switch the current paradigm of thinking around climate change   the current idea is that we will get all the nations on earth  to drastically reduce their co  emissions and keep them down  not only does this require levels of global cooperation never before seen  but it also disproportionately benefits rich countries who have the money to transition to cleaner fuels  that s just for the climate issue  instead of relying on a moonshot that the world is consistently making more and more infeasible  i propose a different approach  instead of waiting for governments to change  i propose we change  instead of hoping that the climate doesn t change  i propose we change so that it doesn t matter  if we re are not only going to survive but thrive in the next 50 years  then we need to  with intention  plan out a route from our current catastrophe through sustainability the lands us in a promising future   we can create a better society  we have to create a better society  one that can stand up to the problems of climate change  and wealth inequality  and finally secure a basic livelihood for all  to do this we need to realize that there are two major fronts that demand attention and intention  that being the technical issues of how to build a climate change-resistant  sustainable society  and the epistemological how to organize that society sustainable  equitably  and such that it doesn t collapse  now this book is strictly meant to deal with the technological side of this issue  though if you subscribe to certain sociological theories then the technological mode of production implies a certain sociological structure   this book is more of an introduction to the types of solutions we could apply to the problem of work and non-sustainable production  i have limited my scope to make the task manageable however  this means that not everyone can partake in the society that i am laying out  i don t take this to mean that there is not a sustainable solution for all  it just means that i cannot as an individual find it  i propose that the approach i take in this book can be applied by others to their own circumstances to produce similar results   resources  full bibliography in final book,l6dv8i

283,Dont ever try to stand up to your superiors,i work as a reserve firefighter at this podunk department is the square middle of nowhere  for 3 years i have let this department get away with some pretty fucked up shit that theyve said and done to me  everything from antisemitic remarks  being taken away seasonal shift do to a minor mistake that  embarrassed the fire chief  to even being actually assaulted by another reserve  for 3 years i sate and took it like a champ  last night i show up for training and i get told that apparently there was a complaint about me from the police  for 15 minutes i get fucked with on a matter that i m kept in the dark about  everyone else present at the time basically gets a front row seat to me getting shit on  eventually figured out what they are talking about and recounted the way the incident went with the pd officer  the reality was that there was no complaint  one of the officers got nervous because after a call we once had i kindly asked him to not bring up my personal life during calls  i thought i was doing the right thing i stood up for myself in a calm collected manner and explained myself to him  but basically he now thinks that i m a  sensitive snowflake whos is to easily offended  so he goes and he tells his police chief that there could be a complaint from the fire house because of me to cover his ass  a month later the guys at the fire house go to the police for something and the pd chief tells my battalion chief about what i said  so the guys at the fire house see it as an opportunity to fuck with me  i show for training last night and so the shit show starts  i m told i was  rude to one of the sergeant  and i get no real explanation just kept getting fucked with  a matter that i thought was serious was taken as a joke and was used to berate me in front of everyone  eventually i piece it all together and said my side of the story  the battalion chief says  oh he is right  to which i then responded  fuck all of you guys  basically that then he gets upset with me  after training he goes to the office with me and continues to berate me  even though i didn t do anything wrong  he says  from now that officer will never talk to you or mess with you because he thinks you re to sensitive  that means that you are also to sensitive for us to mess with so from here on its all business  then he gets to the part where i said  fuck all of you guys  and he takes out of context and say  you ever tell me to go fuck myself in front of everyone and you will be  terminated immediately  you think that shit would fly in another department   so basically the moral of the story is don t stand up for yourself  never try to explain your situation  and obviously never ever snap at anyone ,l31hav

311,A letter to myself - Why must you try so hard?,i was trying to study my homework for my college class  but i kept thinking about the naive and young new college grad i'm training at my job  i kept thinking of all the things i'd tell not just her  but a younger less experienced me   for context  the industry i currently work in is highly conservative  and the workers of this industry view themselves as extensions of law enforcement  eww  i have also worked the normal shitty food retail jobs and generally approach tasks with a perfectionist and caring attitude in spite of knowing it leaves me vulnerable to increased exploitation  i just can't help it     approach to handling corrections from management   it is middle management's job to find problems and fix them  if there aren't any problems to fix  then upper management might think middle management is not needed   thus  if everything is going smoothly middle management changes either the pace of work  faster  or the amount of work  higher  and see if you can handle the new requirements under pressure  these new job requirements do not require an increase in pay  as they fall under the catch-all clause of  other duties as assigned  a clause that is in virtually all job descriptions and contracts  another technique is to point out the 1  of things you got wrong  the more detailed your work tasks are  the greater the opportunity for error and correction   so  it follows that while it is admirable and of strong character to try to do the best job you can  at least in my view  in a perfect world people would endeavor to take care of each other and their environments in a thoughtful and thorough manner  you can never do things perfectly  not just due to minor human errors  but for the fact that management  needs  to find flaws in order to maintain their station  status  and the larger social hierarchy  by putting you in your place  workers put in the most effort when they feel easily replaceable  disposable  workers who are not as assured and confident of a stable place within the company will be more obedient  less challenging to the established norms and conventions    this is especially true in industries and particular companies that by their nature  the importance of risk management  business expense reduction  and the maximization of profit  and their organizational structure  banks for example make money on large loans  not deposit accounts - checking savings cds  especially not personal deposit accounts for which the bank must pay interest  this drives sales-focused service  tend toward a conservative culture   the ladder to the top of the corporate pyramid is built of coworkers' heads    amp x200b   i appreciate constructive criticism of either the writing or content  i know a lot of this has already been said  and i would like to read more theory  but am not quite there yet ,l486cm

Huge potential! 🐝🥧🕒💪,mining crypto on your phone is a great way to passively earn coins that could have value in the near future when they hit the market  i personally use three awesome apps to mine crypto every day that don't have to be open to mine and don't drain battery  between the three of them if i accumulate a few 100k coins and they are valued at like 10 cents i make  10k for have apps on my phone i click once a day   seems worth it to me  check them out  pi network  this project has been around for a few years now and is looking to hit the market late this year or early next year  the mining rates aren't as high as they used to be but it's still worth getting in before they have again  pi network and use my username  joegrower420  as your invitation code    bee network  this one is kind of a clone of pi but it started up recently in early december and has caught a lot of traction  hitting one million users in the first month  definitely worth getting in on while the mining rates are high  here is my referral link for bee network  get 1 free bee when you join bee  joegrower420  download at download the application   bee network   timestope  this last one is newish as well starting last october and still isn't on ios so it's rates are high and you get 9 4 additional coins per day per user you refer right now  with the coins being valued a little over a cent each  definitely worth trying  time stope - time collector  time miner  mine 24h - apps on google play use my witness code joegrower to start earning time with me  ,l41t6f

361,Anybody out there living the (mostly?) antiwork life?,i ve never really been ambitious regardless of my proficiency in anything i did  and have always  wanted to enjoy my life as much as i can for as long as i can  as of right now my income is quite low  but enough to cover all expenses and then some which is complimented by roughly 8 months of cash savings  i  work  4 hours a week in which my work is actually me working out with two clients from an old gym i worked at and became good friends with  considering fitness is the one thing i m exceptional at and enjoy doing  i love this shit  i spend so much time with my dog  i have time to research recipes to grill  i ve been to more trails and parks and never felt better physically  and i still have so much time left in my day  i never stress about grades  deadlines  covering last minute shifts  juggling my schedule and overworking myself  obviously i d like to be able to live out my fantasies and become a rich  successful  and retire on the beach with a drink  but i m young  in great shape  feel great  love having no real stress  and wouldnt mind never doing anything else ever again  it s definitely not the best route for a full  complete life  but it seems like majority of the people i know are unhappy despite their circumstances,l3r3rc
362,My anti-work “solution”,for years i perused this sub at my office job  obsessing about quitting and all the ideas we talk about here   like many  i started to think that i d rather die than live the miserable work loop   the entertainment industry is so exploitive that i was being watched like a hawk by managers  having timed bathroom breaks  if you were in the bathroom more than 5 mins you d get reprimanded  and other constant belittlement by the company   i was beyond burned out   in summer 2019  i finally cracked and chose to quit my job without any prospects of getting a different one   it was incredibly reckless from a normal person s perspective  but to me it was simply the tipping point   with only a couple thousand saved up  i realized i had to relocate out of the insanely expensive los angeles  where i had been living in the past decade   i moved 2000 miles to a state with a much lower cost of living   i have a creative profession  where essentially i am paid to create artistic products   shortly after moving to my new city  i picked up a remote job at a company and i have been taking full advantage wherever i can   basically  the company has no idea that what i produce for them in a work week actually only takes me something like 10 hours of committed work   but they absolutely adore my work and couldn t be happier with me at the company   they think i m a superstar   they believe i m working my ass off but since the job is remote there s no way for them to know what i m really doing all day   i m just astounded at this enormous change in my life  from absolute misery to being loved for my talents   this  i think  is further proof of how bullshit office culture is - it s the product that matters  not the means to get there   if i can produce something that a company finds extremely valuable in just a few hours  then shouldn t that be all that matters   if they want to believe it took me 40 hours then fine  but this proves to me that what i do has always been very valuable   so fuck my old employers  fuck office culture  and i thank my past self for having the balls to give it all up   risks can pay off,l4c5ad

390,The only thing worse than a day of retail wageslaving is a day of retail wageslaving with a career retail bootlicker.,first day with a co-worker as the second person on my shift and     she tells me that she times how long the other person has a break for and reports if it is a few minutes longer    shames me the second i'm are not doing something even though there are only so many times you can dust a shelf before your brain breaks    tells me i should be studying the company's website and products in my own time at home  yeah no  sorry  i'm too busy for that and i will do my learning on paid time    got annoyed when i was studying the company website when there hadn't been a customer in the store for over an hour     looked down on me for being in university all  what will you do with a master's  hopefully not being in your shoes in 20 years time     flexed about how she comes in half an hour early to catch up on what is happening  again  you can catch me up on paid time  my unpaid time is my time    i wasn't sitting down or anything and she asked what i would think if i walked past the store  without going in  and saw a sales assistant sitting down or not doing anything  fishing for me to say  i'd think they look super unprofessional  and was clearly thrown off guard when i said  i wouldn't think anything to be honest  i don't concern myself that much with what other people do  sorry not sorry i refuse to buy into the bullshit that expects retail workers to stand for 8 hours on hard concrete floors without needing a break    expected me to know a ton of shit because  you did that in training  um  i was given 6 hours to cram a bunch of learning units into my brain  i wouldn't exactly call it training conducive to learning but ok     got mad at me because a customer didn't want my help  as if i had control over that    going on about how i need to hard sell so she can get her pitiful bonus  she doesn't even realise that she is busting her ass to be tossed crumbs   i always knew bootlickers were in insufferable  but i had no idea just what painful kissasses they are   i can't believe people like this will be part of my future for the next 4-5 decades until i can finally retire  fml ,l4l5ou

395,"I feel like the lottery is my only chance at life now, but the odds are discouraging me. I don’t care about “long-term” investments that might make me comfortable when I’m OLD. I’m 25, not sure I’ll even be around next year.",i am a 25 year old male virgin  i ve never even had a girlfriend  this is now worsened  odds of it happening anytime in the near future  by the fact that i ve struggled with  basic  retail jobs  and now been working in a grocery store as a goddamn bagger for the past 2 years    barely  10 an hour  abused by customers  threatened and humiliated by supervisors management  i ve been accused of slacking  even after honestly being really productive all day  i d quit and walk out if i didn t feel suicide is my next option   they re talking about firing people for  not being friendly enough to customers  and for the past week i ve started going by their script  making sure to  properly greet customers  the word by word way  immediately after the cashier right in front of me just did    i get scolded by one of the supervisors for not shouting hello as soon as the customer walks up to the lane to checkout  even though a store manager actually told me  to wait until the customer has gotten up closer to me so they can actually hear me through the masks  common sense    but it doesn t matter  i can be on a perfect streak  and then that supervisor points their goddamn finger at me and whispers  make sure you re speaking to our customers  i just want to smash something  or someone  and walk out and never go back   but then  it won t be long before my parents are on my ass again  for being unemployed  and it will likely get to a point of me ending up in me getting arrested  i can t deal with society  i can t deal with the system  i can t even socialize very well  it s definitely hell being required to socialize as part of a job   i failed my fucking driving test  i still feel overwhelmed at getting back on the road  i just started community college but haven t been in a year after my first semester because i tried to let covid pass  covid doesn t just pass  apparently  and i m not even super sure what i m doing there   i m an antinatalist  thanks to my miserable childhood and family s  traditional  and fucking religious and conservative views making me hate life  and definitely religion  even more   i m against bringing a child into their world against their will  and that s kind of how it works  even if i have a woman who wants to procreate with me  i can not  it goes against my self-morals now  i wouldn t be a healthy parental figure anyway  and that s kind of mg whole point in assigning a negative value to birth    but i wouldn t even be here if my parents didn t procreate me  i know  i kind of wish they didn t   i sure as hell refuse to accept my  assigned  gender role  i identify as male  not never cared for a lot of  traditional  male interests  i am attracted to women  never got any real attention from the opposite sex  but that s another problem and not what this post is about    i don t really care to be a  productive member of society  at least not as much as living the way that makes me happy  which requires  being a productive member of society  because that s how you afford to live  many jobs pay less than a living wage  like my current and past ones   my dad has always been a  hardworking  but also a real cheapass  he thinks he s been living the way an adult is  supposed  to  but where has it gotten him  yes  the alcohol is why you got divorced and we live away from you  but if you re so good at working hard and saving money  why do you still live in a house that s physically falling apart in the middle of nowhere  you talk about wanting to do more  but apparently you have to keep doing what you re doing because  i guess it s just the right thing to do  where has your  responsibility  gotten you in life  doesn t seem like it paid off  but hey  at least you can blame the alcohol on your misery now  right   and my mom  thinks she s doing the right thing working a full-time service job  making maybe even less than me  but it s ok because step dad pays for all of the big bills  never mind his constant rage and threatening of divorce   god  wanted it to be so the man provides  not sure where that leaves single women  but   i don t want to be dependent on anyone else  relying on remaining employed under someone else is bad enough   i m losing my parents health insurance in a year  my ssri and other medications will cost hundreds a month out of pocket  ssri withdraw is the worst  just google pssd and dyskinesia   i need to just  grow the fuck up and pick myself up by the bootstraps  although  i just lack a lot of apparently  basic  skills and experience in life    and the way i feel   working for a living  serves no purpose when i don t even want to be alive   oh  but i can pay taxes to help the poor  nope  the us government doesn t do that  probably just goes into rich politicians pockets   i can t believe that the lottery seems to be my only chance at life now   but i ve already missed so much of my life  idgaf about 401 k  or whatever slow long-term investments to have a little social security or retirement when i m old   i don t even want to live any longer now  and even if i do  i ve already missed out on my entire youth  idgaf about my oldass    that s why quick turnaround money is important to me  but unfortunately  becoming rich overnight is extremely random luck based   i don t know what the fuck to do ,l376iz
396,Free land minimum,nobody ever brings this up so think about it  back in the day people could be hunters  gatherers and farmers  they d put there house somewhere and everything was r antiwork friendly  then one day kings and queens said the farmer who only has food for his family had to offer more to them that they didn t have  god only knows what they did to the family that didn t pay the forced taxes  and that s where we lost our right to land  nobody ever says we need a right to land and if someone does the other people argue  people would just claim huge tracts of land  but we re civilized and thankfully i don t think like a wild animal so i thought of the free land minimum  a minimum square footage for every adult that can be zoned  a minimum because overpopulation is a serious problem even if we are fine now and if you want a lot of land you should pay because we have limited space until space travel is perfected  homeless people would have somewhere to go  the only work people would have to do is grow their own food and work to build a fee less shelter  and people could pursue dreams like arts  athletics  or learning skills  instead of wasting most their life doing useless tasks they could do something good for human evolution  please advocate for this because people aren t and it s disgusting  our greater grandparents had this right so what would they think if we didn t fight for it ,l1do1c

424,Received job offer but so much anxiety over whether or not to actually accept it,i ve officially learned to dissociate myself from my work career and as much as i don t want to work  i have been fucking around for 9 months with no income and i ve been spiraling into a depression and having serious suicidal ideations  i need to support myself even if i hate it    i ve applied to near 1000 jobs at this point with only a handful of interviews  i received one other offer that i accepted in october and i walked out on the employer because they treated us like garbage and the puny pay and lack of benefits reaffirmed i needed to leave so you can see just hesitant i am to accept this new job offer   this new job requires me to be there at 4 30am every morning which sounds painful unnatural that i need to be sleeping by 7pm every night and waking up at 3 am    some other red flags  i interviewed last thursday  received offer this past monday  wants me drug tested by friday  paranoid i won t pass bc of thc despite being in a state where it is legalized  and start this coming monday  glassdoor has 2 star rating  poor management  negative work culture  expensive insurance  no 401k match  when i received intro call  hr told me multiple positions were opened  because the job didn t match expectations of these employees  or  they left due to personal matters  i was also told that i need to be open to working overtime daily  plus is that they would pay double every additional hour  total red flags  during the interview  i asked my interviewers what the best part of working there was and both of them seemed to struggle to formulate their words  they truly looked like they hated their lives    is it a no-brainer to accept this job considering i have not heard back from anything else and am struggling financially  i m kind of going in expecting to get hazed and bullied and abused at work ,l2269p
425,"""Leisure is essential to civilization, and in former times leisure for the few was only rendered possible by the labors of the many. But their labors were valuable, not because work is good, but because leisure is good.""",from  in praise of idleness  by bertrand russell  which is in the r antiwork library  great little read  it's true that through a variety of channels  we've been sold the myth of the  nobility  of work and overwork  usually by people that don't engage in it themselves  we're so conditioned to work  that we don't understand that leisure itself is the area where monumental progress due to unfettered creativity and freedom have occurred   but because of exhaustion  leisure in modern day societies is very passive  non-participatory and unfulfilling  combine that with work being merely for the sake of helping people who don't perform actual labor making a profit  and you have a recipe for a miserable society  if we truly cared about work for its own sake versus work as a means of maintaining control  then leisure would be mandatory  for its in leisure where we come up with the greatest ideas to enhance and ease work itself ,l2fbxh
426,My hatred of work pushed me into living a minimalist lifestyle.,there's a few reasons for that   to start off  minimalism allows me to save a lot more money  naturally this puts my mind at ease about finances   the other main reason  if i get so sick of my job that i decide i've had enough  i'm fucking gone  and have enough to get by for a while  i  love  that feeling   if i lived a lifestyle where i bought a bunch of expensive shit all of the time  then i wouldn't be able to get as much of that feeling as i like  for me  knowing i can quit a job comfortably is far more pleasurable than buying a bunch of stuff   curious if any of you have arrived at a similar conclusion ,l1spsn

428,Men and Breakdowns,i ve noticed something about the male figures in my life  it seems at some point  they break  it s like they can t take the stress or fake it any more  my ex-wife s dad has an episode where he questioned everything including his religion  my uncle has had episodes  my current girlfriend s dad seems to be having in a similar manner while under a lot of stress at work  my own dad  though very tough mentally masked his issues well  once told me  without any sort of prompting   son  make sure you have a job you like because there are millionaires out there who are miserable  i ve tried to take his advice but the jobs i like don t pay well enough for me to get by    i ve had multiple similar reactions where i have existential crises and not even out of my twenties yet   when i worked on ambulances and we d get called out to car wrecks  i d think to myself  what an awful way to go  to die on your way to work   i know women have these issues too but it just seems more prominent with men  is the lack of comradery in the work place and the isolation that comes from it  is it because we realize the consumerist ideal that are pushed on us from birth are absolute bull shit and we re tired of pretending like they re not  i often times feel like guy montag in fahrenheit 451 and i just want to the world to go a little bit slower ,l271je
429,Undercover Boss thoughts,i know this is an old show but there is a common theme between most episodes  the ceo or whoever always gets upset when the cashier doesn't live and breathe for the company  really  they're not even being paid a living wage  even if they worked full time   the executive always puts so much emphasis on how important the front line workers are  why not pay them more then if they're so important  just makes me happy this thread exists  it's ridiculous  these executives are making millions but can't give their employees a few more bucks an hour for a decent living  no one is going to live and breathe for your stupid company for  9 hr sorry not sorry  just did a quick calculation  to raise employees pay by 5 dollars to  14 an hour to get them to care it would cost the company roughly 41 million for 4k employees  that's nothing  most of these companies net profit is over half a billion if not over a billion ,l1ncya

436,Employers need to understand that it's the workers doing the work.

445,Do I hate nursing or just working in general?,when i first failed a nursing class my teacher asked me why i went into nursing  as an immigrant  my immediate thought was to help my family out of poverty  she said that that was not a valid reason to go into nursing and that i should be going into it because i wanted to care for people  yes i do care for people but i care about myself and family more  why is it wrong to want to improve your economic level   fast forward to now  i've been a nurse for almost 2 years and can't seem to be satisfied with any workplace that i go top   i love caring for patients and their families  but every nursing job i've had is always short on staff  every  single  fucking  one  they always ask   oh can you please stay we're rly short plz  and so tons of us would feel guilty so we end up staying for a whole ass 16 hours and then go to work the next day with less than 5 hrs of sleep  also  missing your 15 min 30 min breaks is the norm  lots of times i'm charting or doing paperwork during my break even though i'm clocked out for lunch because our supervisor gets mad at us for missing our lunches  how could they get mad at us for missing lunches when they don't even give us the fucking support that we need  and don't even get me started how it was like working in a nursing home  all i can say is that don't end up in one if you can avoid it ,l2ajyq
446,They are literally kicking me out of my office. And they have no where to put me.,i work in the legal industry for a good sized firm  today the office manager came in to my office and told me that they need my office for a new employee  they are hiring a new hr drone  the kicker  they don't have anywhere to put me because the owner managing partner of the firm is richer than croesus  but won't spring more money to purchase rent a larger building  so the office manager  in all her disorganized glory  is presenting options to my superior   1  have me share an office with the chief operating officer  2  have me work from home   honestly  2 would be the better solution  but of course they won't provide any computer or supplies for my home office if that were to be the case   this is pretty dystopian  i'm so fucking tired of this place ,l1hqev

450,I hope my boss likes the new asshole I tore her,so  i work at a certain three lettered pharmacy  and as you can imagine  because of covid  the workload has increased massively  we have 7 techs who share responsibilities in the pharmacy      of the 7 techs  4 are vets and 3 of us are 'new'  all been there less than 2 years  so not really new-new      once covid started  we started doing covid tests  for those who don't know  covid testing basically requires a dedicated tech for the entire day  and it's extremely boring  so we're basically down a leg at any given time  and also our pharmacy is located right in the ghetto and accepts medicaid  and it's the only pharmacy in the area that accepts medicaid  so we process an immense amount of prescriptions  average of probably 500-600 per day  our customers are extremely entitled and demanding  despite the fact that they're paying nothing       and my pharmacy manager decides to put up four techs for full time covid vaccinations  so now we only have three techs  right before committing the techs  she gave me a piece of paper to sign  asking how many extra hours i was willing to work  and requesting that i work overtime  i told her no  and checked 0 extra hours on the paper       she went and scheduled me for 2 straight weeks of overtime with no days off  which i stupidly worked without complaining  so she went and did it again       two nights ago  she demanded a girl come in to work while sick  and the girl caved  she ended up getting me sick  and that was the final straw     amp x200b   i showed up to work in person to let her know that i won't be coming in for the next 2 days  demanded a raise  and told her if she ever fucking schedules me for more than 30 hours without asking me first  i fucking quit       i have enough money to last me 7 months of mortgage and i just got my stimulus check  i can very easily find a new job  but me dropping right now will fuck up her schedule         just something to throw in - she's moving to another state on the other side of the country in 2 months  so she's been working us extra hard because she's trying to get bonuses before she leaves  but at the cost of hurting us workers  i have a son  who i never get to see  and one of the new girls has elderly family members that need her  the other one has school and she hasn't even had time to start her new classes because the fucking cunt pharmacy manager has no heart ,l1s4gg
451,The Burnout Society by the philosopher Byung Chul Han,full article here   link https psychology-spot com the-burnout-society   han points out that the society of the 21st century is no longer disciplinary  but a society of the performance nor are its inhabitants called  subjects of obedience  but  subjects of performance  these subjects are entrepreneurs of themselves   this change  which apparently empowers and is liberating  actually becomes a boomerang that soon beats us with all its strength because it hides a great psychological risk of which we are not aware   the violence of the society over its members has not disappeared  but has been camouflaged and is now based on the self-exploitation of the subject   this is much more effective than the exploitation by the others  because it is accompanied by a feeling of freedom  the exploiter is the same exploited  victim and executioner can no longer differentiate  this self-referentiality generates a paradoxical freedom  which  because of the structures of obligation immanent to it  becomes violence   in this society of obligation  each one carries with him his forced labor field   basically  our society would be the evolution of the disciplinary and controlling societies of the past  but in reality it does not imply more freedom  but continues to exert its power over each person through the introjection of the  duty  this situation turns us into slaves of overproduction  super-performance  work  play and sex  or supercommunication   the most emblematic example of the problems caused by this social pressure for performance is depression  this philosopher thinks that in reality  what sickens is not the excess of responsibility and initiative  but the imperative of performance  as the new mandate of the late modern labor society    the depressive man is that working animal that exploits itself  that is  voluntarily  without external coercion  he is  at the same time  executioner and victim  the depression is unleashed at the moment in which the subject of performance can no longer do anything   the depressed is tired of the effort to become himself   the problem is that the  i can t do it anymore  leads to a destructive self-reproach and self-aggression when we realize that we can not achieve everything we wanted to do  we feel frustrated  but we do not think that society has deceived us but we self-reproach  feeling that we are incapable ,l2nkvq

457,Why I support women being housewives and homemakers,after reading all these posts i have to agree  working 5 days a week  week after week  sucks   so this makes me like the idea of what the older generation did  which was that the men slaved away at the job  and women didnt have to work but just took care of the house  took care of the kids  focused on hobbies  making themselves pretty  socializing  travelling   so one gender had to deal with the harshness of work  accepted it and embraced it  but the other got to enjoy life  and focus on higher pursuits  and retain that innocence kinda  and ideally a man's wife helped him relieve stress from the harshness of work   i am not advocating for controlling women  but for doing this on a voluntary basis   like for myself  when i had a girlfriend in the past  i remember that her beauty  love   support etc really helped me to push harder at work  and i would gladly  if i had the money  let my girlfriend or wife renounce work  or work less hours  or work at something she is more passionate about that makes less money  the way it is now  both genders  everybody  has to deal with the harshness of work  but if only one gender had to deal with that  and the other didnt  im sure the world would take a step towards being a happier place  please ask questions if i said something that seems off or doesnt make sense    in the older generation  there was a lot of male abuse of women  that is unfortunate and not ok   edit  sorry  i thought this was the sub r antiwork,l253qq

482,Anyone else have coworkers who just put on a performance,i have this so called competent smart business minded guy i work with  he barely does shit but the bosses love him  i think it s because he puts on his work face and acts like he s  getting stuff done  it s a matter of how you act like you re doing a lot  speaking to people like you re the boss  taps just finger on the desk  with every word  when he s on the phone to drive the point home     what s annoying is how you have to watch the performance  a show on display  while also seeing that person fail to grasp elementary concepts such as why wearing a mask over your face and not pulling it down is important during a deadly pandemic   it s hard for me to reconcile that this person is any of those things beyond just playing a role  you come in  speak authoritatively on things that have little consequences  speak to people as if you re the  ideas guy  but you re really just pretending to be that   it s very weird but it seems to work for him  i know you can be good at a job and an idiot at the same time  it just sucks to watch it everyday  when it s done to this extent ,l23q9q

497,"People need to change the attitude that exists about work, particularly in the Western mind. Meditation should be part of the work, not separate from it.",people need to change the attitude that exists about work  particularly in the western mind  meditation should be part of the work  not separate from it    work and relaxation are not contradictory  in fact  the more you put yourself into work the deeper you can go into relaxation  so both are important  the harder you work the deeper you can relax  work is valuable  it will bring humbleness and silence  people should feel that their work is something very special  and that whatever work they do is respectable    the emphasis should be on full-time work  6 hours a day is perfectly okay  work is part of the whole program   when you work  work as if it were a group therapy  call it  work meditation  if you really want to meditate and get into yourself  at least 6 hours work is a necessity   is part of the whole change in your energy  it is scientific  for 6 hours you should forget everything else   forget the whole world  forget your problems   whatever work it is  be total in it  then something is possible -osho   insomnia is not a disease  insomnia is a certain way of life    man is made by nature to work hard for at least eight hours  unless he works hard for eight hours he does not earn the right to have a deep sleep  and as a society grows richer  people are not working hard  there is no need  others can work for them  the whole day they are doing small things which they enjoy doing  but it is not hard work like that of a stonecutter or a woodcutter  the body is made so that after eight hours of hard work it naturally needs to fall into sleep to rejuvenate its energy  but it seems difficult you have earned enough money and still you are chopping wood for eight hours  then for what have you earned all that money  it seems stupid  you could have chopped wood even without becoming a millionaire  so if fifty million people in america are suffering from insomnia  that simply means these are the people who are not earning the right to sleep  they are not working to create the situation in which sleep happens ,l1egei

504,"Do what's good for the company, not the customer.",i work in a cell center and we often send technicians out to a site  think directv dish network   well when we schedule an appointment for the customer  we have a window of time  and that window of time can be broken down into 3 four-hour windows instead of say 8am to 8pm   well when i started  i always offered the four-hour windows after people commented they  did not want to sit around for 12 hours  i mean  can you blame them  i sure wouldn't   well after looking at my call feedback  they seem rather upset that i do this  because we are  supposed to push the 12 hour window  and only offer a shorter window  if asked   this is one of several things that makes my call unnecessary long  because i know what the customer wants  they don't want a 12 hour window  maybe some retirees or people who are disabled and house-bound    this extremely frustrates me  in all my years of retail and customer service jobs   do what is right for the customer  is supposed to be pretty high up on business professionalism    there is no reason to offer such a large window at first  other than  it's the rules   this is also not the only thing that they do similar to this  we have to ask questions  many of which are assumption based and thus a waste of time  for example  if someone is calling because they need a technician out due to signal loss  and they start off with  hello my name is raspootin and i'm calling because the signal has gone out  then obviously asking  is the tv display a picture currently  is a waste of time  because they wouldn't be calling in with signal loss  otherwise   but we have to ask these questions anyway  and then they wonder why my calls take so long  i could literally address the customers concerns and cut the call time in half by skipping half the questions  but we are required to ask them  which often times upsets the customer because they are being asked questions with painfully obvious answers ,l1q6yn

I don’t mind really as we have sporadic income...am I nuts for thinking this way?,   we are scraping by financially  i get his attitude toward employee exploitation and i understand his philosophy of life  i feel our lives  as a race  are really unfair too  he gets a job and if he agrees to do it  it has to be sociable hours  decent salary etc  then he doesn t last longer then 3 months  he s asked for pay rises within weeks  he s openly addressed bullying and if there s any favouritism he questions the bosses  any health and safety issues then he threatens the managers with being reported and he s been escorted off premises by security guards   he homes in on bullies and makes them squirm  i m in bad health and waiting surgery but i m not a spender  means that we survive on very little  i ve got a peaceful life but we have had to use food banks before as we get that skint  we don t drink or smoke etc  my plan is post op to return to my career as i do enjoy mixing with people and it would be nice to have some money  i m worried that we are not compatible as he is happy to have a sparse life materialistically but i m struggling a bit with poverty  i haven t had a haircut now for over a year and we couldnt afford to buy people gifts at christmas  he s a good partner  my dad died of covid and he was absolutely wonderful  so yeah  i love him and i know he loves me too  i just want to know am i nuts  i used to have money but was so unhappy  oh  i think you re all great by the way ,l1g4xv
508,Internet hiring ruined the job market,i m sure you have heard the stories about getting a job with a firm hand shake and a paper application  applicant tracking systems have ruined that  they see if you match 70-90 percent of the job posting  why is that a problem  you can t learn a new skill or switch careers  also if it s a receptionist job and you were a secretary the applicant tracking system may accidentally throw you out   employers know qualified people are thrown out using this system  this also leads to employers paying less and demanding more  they say they have 100-300 applications for a job when 5-10 are actually interested  this makes them demand weekends and pay you less  stop applying to low paying jobs online  and stop undervaluing your time  if you have 15 years of management experience stop accepting minimum wage  i shouldn t have to tell people this  respect yourself more  i m tired of hearing  apply online  for a minimum wage job  job searching shouldn t be this complicated  why is it  when you apply online you build their applicant pool  they will always be accepting applications because the current staff is replaceable  i don t mind working but i m done with group interviews  if you re over qualified don t apply  demand more out of the employers  i shouldn t be expected to have  open availability for a 9 00 job with no benefits  i saw another job posting that said they need a babysitter  they wanted you for 3 hours and wanted to pay 15 00 a day  that is 5 an hour  which is highly illegal ,l1ea35
509,Finally lost my job,i am a 47 year old man who has been working for many years  i hated doing it and i hated work in general really but i kept doing it  finally  yesterday  i had enough and sabotaged my work  thus getting fired   it was the most liberating moment of my life  i sure hope i will have enough money to feed my family and that i won't become homeless ,l2007l
510,So I'm sick..,so yesterday morning before work i noticed that i straight up did not feel well  i live in an area that has been extraordinarily fortunate in terms of covid-19 - i have no cough or difficultly breathing and my public health line basically told me i just have the flu   so yesterday morning i called in sick  something that always makes me extremely anxious  i'm smack dab in the middle of a project that is  not gonna lie  driving me crazy and i've made that clear to the techs i'm doing it with  so they already guaranteed think i'm lying  we also have a number of frankly elderly office staff who have already  understandably  gotten irritated at people coming to work while they were feeling a little sick   normally i'm the  power through  type - and i never call in sick two days in a row  yet here i am on my second day of this flu completely tearing my hair out with anxiety over the fact that i really should not go in  why do i feel like this ,l1vp07

520,What is the alternative?,i discovered this sub a week or two ago and i ve just been so baffled by it  the main piece of information i seek from this post is what the residents of this sub would prefer to the status quo    some post really for increased regulation and cultural change so that people can work less and better working conditions  which is not a new idea  and one that i am not surprised by  however  some post seem to suggest that we need not work at all  and the world s labor can be supplied by a small percent of the population or by limited work from the larger population    upon first glance the majority of ideas i ve found here have seemed quite absurd to me  and i d like to try and understand the arguments and proposed alternatives better  i m not looking to debate anyone  just to understand the beliefs and philosophy of this group better ,l2g8da
521,An interesting story about work and priorities...,i was recently reading phillip short's biography of pol pot    hold your horses now  this isn't some diatribe about bringing back a khmer rouge  year zero style revolution   lots of the book examines khmer cambodian society and how why it works the way it does   the great angkor civilisation  builders of angkor wat  were so successful because they used irrigation to grow rice 3 4 times a year  rather than being locked into one seasonal harvest  the 20th century cambodians pre khmer rouge revolution had regressed to just once per year  leading colonists to deride them as 'lazy'  a famous phrase went 'the vietnamese grow the rice  the cambodians watch it grow  the laotians listen to it grow'   so  onto our main story  an american entrepreneur visited cambodia post overthrow of pol pot to teach farming techniques to farmers who were still using quite medieval methods right until the 80s 90s  using machinery  fertilizer and pesticides they were able to double their rice yields  let's say from 40 tonnes to 80 tonnes  the khmers were ecstatic    2 years later the american entrepreneur returned  to find the farmers were continuing you use his methods  however  they were now only working half as much land as they had before he'd instructed them  they had chosen to use the gift of efficiency to cut their work by 50  continuing to grow 40 tonnes of rice  whilst only working half the land   short  the writer  tells this story as a sort of 'gotcha' moment  to illustrate that this society is in fact more concerned with leisure than work  although he does concede that it's also due to essentially people being happy with what they have and what they need  rather than striving for 'more and more'   i think the story has some pretty big lessons for us too  over the last 30 40 years we've developed incredible technologies that have cut the time it takes to do things in half  or more  and yet  we continue to work  or be forced to work  a 9-5pm schedule  if not more  working hours are going up  rather than down  clearly we are doing more work achieving more producing more   yet  we are not earning double triple what we were in the past  in fact  we've gone from a scenario where one breadwinner was able to provide for a family with children on a sole income  to working couples struggling to combine their incomes to cover the bare essentials  while home ownership and having children remain a distant dream or a seriously stress inducing risk    tl dr - cambodian farmers worked out a way to do half as much work  while producing an equal quantity of product  giving them more leisure and the same amount of wealth  our society demands that we work more  produce more  while rewarding us with less and tying our happiness to greed ,l2fqsx

549,Ramblings of a disgruntled night shift factory slave,this is mostly a rant  and the only way i could truly vent this because i could never express this to coworkers   glad i found this sub   for a good portion of my life i could never really find the words to describe how i felt about work  i never vehemently opposed it  but i hate the mundane nature of most jobs  whether it was working at a pizza place and being slaved by corporate policies  or working in a small business and being exploited there  i could never truly find a job where i felt like i wasn t some mindless simian performing a task that could be done by anyone with basic motor functions   i had just graduated from uni  thankfully it allowed me to avoid working anything full time or long term  however  now that i m not doing anything and looking for an actual career  i took it upon myself to make fast cash in a local factory  i won t mention the name of corporation i serve  but they re a well known decoration chain in the us and canada    my dad had asked me if i could handle nightshift  for those wondering  he worked in a factory for most of his life because he grew up fairly poor and didn t have a choice  i told him  it can t be that bad  right   i could not have been more wrong in my presumptions about this job  i signed as a regular warehouse associate ie slave that can get moved around anytime any day  i work 11pm-7am every day except saturday  we get 1 10 minute break then a 20 minute break throughout the 8 hr shift  but we often work  mandatory ot  every other week  we only get an extra 10 minute break for getting to work at 9pm   the job is physically grueling  the one shift supervisor saw me on my first day and moved me from a relatively decent spot sorting boxes to manually loading an avg of 1000 box orders into a truck  so  i stand in a fairly dark box in 15 degree weather for 8 hours every night  i ve seen about 10 people come and go since i arrived about a month ago  and that s just in my department  the people i work with are all older men who have been reduced to limps  no seriously  all of them are limping and look visibly in pain during our shifts  they have cameras in front of every truck dock to nonstop monitor us  so if we sit down or go on our phone they ll send an underling to yell at us for not working    i do the bare minimum  i function on a workflow of 50  efficiency nonstop  it s mundane to work overly hard because they carefully made it so that boxes come down in certain intervals  so you basically work until the final minute of the shift  apparently coworkers snitch on eachother all of the time for phones  falsely believing they ll get some sort of handout or pat on the back by higher ups for rating out your coworker  the coaches and supervisors constantly preach about being a team and helping eachother  yet everyone is so cynical they won t help eachother out regardless of if we re busy or not   i don t exactly subscribe to the communist and capitalist bashing that s prevalent in this sub  i get it though  the whole worker being exploited thing  i see higher ups who literally sit in their office playing youtube videos and having a ball of a shift  meanwhile i m over here trying not to get hypothermia at 4am  i m only at this job to save up enough money to last me into the summer so that i can find a decent  non physically demanding  job and move out of this god forsaken town    does anyone know how to make the time go by faster  i feel like my days just sorta blend together now that i have no inherent free time for myself cause i have to catch up on sleep otherwise i ll be a zombie for the next shift  it s really soul crushing  i m not sure how people do this for years on end  i hate it ,l02f6m

559,Why is it normal for people to just casually ask whether (or where) you work?,i don't know whether this is a global occurence  but in my country  this is like an illness  whenever you meet someone  even if you don't know them very well  the first or second thing after a greeting will be a question on your work situation  i do not understand it  i cannot fathom why anyone should give a shit about this  and why the hell am i supposed to answer them instead of telling them to fuck off and stop asking personal questions     i would love to know the psychological and societal reasons behind it    the only reasons i can guess are    - checking whether i have it better or worse than their kid  so they can measure penis size   - checking whether a peer has it better or worse  so he can decide whether to hate them or patronize them    i can only see it as a dick measuring contest  there is 0 chance that someone is asking so he can give you a better job in case you have a shitty one  it's disgusting  and it really messes with my self-esteem  soo many people have asked me  it's like  they have no fucking question to ask me so they ask where i work  like  go and fucking ask me about the game or the weather  instead of stabbing me every time so i have to get over the urge to tell you to fuck off and die  and meekly respond about my employment situation      it's doubly disgusting because i live in a town which is like a village and everyone knows everyone and likes to tattle and gossip about everyone  if you have a shit job  you are a loser who never amounted to his potential  and if oyu have a good job  then you definitely got it immorally and through connections so you are scum and everyone is envious  and if you have none  then you are literally a sub-human leech who does not deserve to breath     you can't win   ,l1ax5k

569,My job at Pizza Hut was living hell.,i feel like there's nowhere else i could post this without people thinking that i was exaggerating  over a year after leaving this company and i still struggle with learned anxiety that has never left my body    the worst part of my job was that i never got to leave on time  my shift was usually about 8 am to 4 pm  but we had a list of prep every morning that we had to do  i'd make the doughs  sauce them  and cheese them  usually about 20-40 in every size and style  so most mornings about 120-200 pizzas  and yes  i have pictures of my prep lists left to me  but i had to cook those pizzas if anyone ordered them  and so after lunch rush i essentially would have to remake the prep from scratch  alone  as the only cook  every day i was stressed out to no end just trying to get it done -- because i knew the managers wouldn't let me go home if i didn't   and usually  even if i did  if we got busy  or if the person after my shift didn't come in  he was a teenager  so he missed often  they also would refuse to allow me to clock out  and then as the cook  i'd have to stay for the full dinner shift until it calmed down completely at around 7-8 pm  but some nights they forced me to stay until closing  said i couldn't leave until the store was cleaned up and everything was packed  so every day around 4 pm i would feel the most tremendous anxiety because  either i got to go home  or i might not for hours upon hours   this also got in the way of my dates with my girlfriend  i remember getting yelled at for having to call her because they refused to let me clock out  i realize that this is completely illegal  yes  but if i had said no they would have fired me  and to put this kindly  at the time i was  eating out of the trash -- me and another co-worker waiter would split untouched leftover slices people left on their table  or we'd salvage a burnt pizza later after throwing it away  in a cardboard box  in front of the boss   there's more  too  if you're willing to hear it  the main manager that i worked under was an extremely loud  ridiculously aggressive woman who scared the absolute shit out of me  a 17 year old  she would brag about how her son threatened to call child control on her and say  in regards to it   i laughed in his face and told him to go ahead  see if he'll have anywhere to live  i feel like she couldn't talk to anyone without screaming at them and it terrified me so badly that i'd freeze up  she thought that was even more funny and so she'd wait for me to do things like walk inside and would scream at me about how i was in trouble and then laugh when i got scared and flustered    and she was mean to me in other ways too  she'd shove her crotch in my face when i ever leaned down to take ingredients out of the fridge below the make table    there were some saving graces  occasionally we would get a waiter that i'd become friends with  or a particularly motherly female employee that would step between me and that manager  but these were good people  so within weeks or months they'd have quit to find better jobs   i described in some comment on here that i felt like i had low-grade ptsd from working  it seems fucked up to say that when it's a real disorder but i've never been the same since working there  having people raise their voice at me or indications that i might leave somewhere late cause me such deep panic that they scramble me up really bad   and i do feel like this is stupid and pathetic and i don't know why i'm putting it on the internet  but i feel like you guys would understand  when my parents put pressure on me that i'm lazy and need to find a job that they don't understand it but my head rationalizes it as them wanting me to go through all of those bad things again    as a cook i made no tips  i would be asked to come in early some mornings to cook ten  or fifteen  or twenty pizzas for a school or a local car dealership  they always worked me as an only cook  so i'd make the pizzas with dough i prepared  cook them through the oven  cut them and box them myself  and then the manager would get a big  20 tip for it by the company  that i couldn't have any of   i couldn't go to my boss either  our strongest pizza hut managee was the area coach  but he despised me  he accused me of being a pothead  even though i was arguably the only one of the entire staff who didn't smoke weed  and threw similar insults at me  and i feel like i was a worthless piece of shit sometimes too because everytime he was near us i would hide  or change stations  or do anything to get away from him ,l0ea6n

594,Company starting new policy punishing employees for situations outside of our control LONG RANT,i work for a huge multinational company in the uk who sent the work force to work from home since march  in the surveys that they've sent out the majority of the people had a very positive response   since then the offices have slowly and partially reopened  now with the people that cant don't want to wfh working from the office  currently at less than 5  capacity   of course with working from home there are some additional problems that can arise  internet and electricity issues may not be common  but with several thousands of employees it wouldn't be weird that it happens    however  they will now roll out a new policy where any downtime will be taken out of your pay  or you will need to use pto  their reasoning for this was that there are apparently people who haven't worked at all since march and it's losing the company a lot of money   now the obvious question is why they wouldn't just do something about the people not working instead    but the worst part is that they brought up an example  where the city was doing maintenance on the fibre of her street  and knocked out the internet of the whole street for 2 days  it could've been the isp or whatever but the point still stands  a situation completely out of your control just caused you to lose 2 days pay  and you can't just drop into the office as that needs to be planned 7  days in advance   the even more interesting thing is that we have paid sick days  so if you get a power outage the most financially wise decision is to call in sick    they did however say that in extraordinary circumstances there may be exceptions  the example given was if there was a city wide power outage   now this may be understandable if internet power issues were common  i can of course only speak of my team but i don't think anyone in my team in the past 9 months have had issues more than once   sorry for the long rant i just had to get it off my chest ,l03g2g

605,I got fired today for standing up for my morals and code of ethics. Fuck employers.,i m a barber  and this pandemic has been fucking awful for me  i ve lost 70  of my clientele and new clients have been really hard to build  i worked at a shop that was recently bought by a new owner  and i started after they opened under the new name  our cuts are  25 across the board  but i have had some clients come to me that either have a very simple haircut that takes less than 10 minutes  or are elderly and on social security older vets that barely have income  i have 3-4 clients that i charge less than  25  everyone else is  25    so now boss wants to raise the prices to  30 across the board  i m not comfortable with that and i say so  i tell him that most of my clients are able to pay  30 and will do so gladly  but a very select few cannot pay that or shouldn t  a cut on a 3 year old that takes me 15 minutes isn t worth  30  and that is unethical in my opinion  boss starts going off on me about discounting and making our shop seem cheap  no man  i just have empathy and actually care about my clients  one of the  discount  clients is a developmentally disabled man that s living off of disability checks and lives with his elderly parents  he s basically bald and does one guard size all over  and doesn t even let me shave his neck  5-9 minutes in and out  i charge him  15  somehow that is worth  30 in my boss  eyes    today he called me and told me that i wasn t pulling in enough money for them and that their  business ideals  aren t congruent with mine  i know i ve struggled to build a clientele  but i ve brought in a couple dozen brand new clients in addition to the 40  that followed me  i ve had clients switch from their barber at that shop to me because i m a way better barber  honestly top 2 working there  and i clean the shop for free  did i mention that i m an independent contractor and i don t get paid unless i m doing a haircut  fucking garbage  i ve done so much unpaid labor for these people and they just fucking fire me because i m not pulling in enough money during a fucking pandemic    they immediately signed me out of our booking service that has all of my clients names and numbers  i have the vast majority saved to my phone thank god  and changed the lock code on the door  i ve never proven myself untrustworthy and they immediately start treating me like a fucking criminal  all of this after  we just have to work together to get through this  if we all stay the course and wait it out it ll be worth it  this is such a good lesson i m never trusting a single employer again  every job i ve left is because of a terrible fucking boss  i ve also never ever been fired in 7 years of working  i feel like fucking trash and like i got taken advantage of so hard  i m humiliated and i ve been anxious and nauseated all day  if you read this far  thank you  i m gonna be doing everything in my power after this to get myself set up truly independently so that i don t have to rely on greedy fucking assholes ,l0ak7a

632,Few thoughts and questions on the responsibilities of the individual in the world.,there is this notion that goes un-interrogated quite often about the purchasing power of the individual somehow being ultimately responsible for finding and funding the solutions to all the macro complex systemic problems of the age  all the wrongs in the world  at your feet and yours alone   don't like sweatshops  then don't buy at h amp m don't want battery hens to die in misery  then switch to plant-based don't like your carbon footprint  then buy solar panels  etc   those things definitely matter  they really do  that is how cultures change - very slowly  and through the habits of discreet individuals   but is the onus really entirely on you to fix the world  through your wallet  only expressed through thousands of little transactional increments at a time  hoping for change   it's not the responsibility of the actual people directly manning the levers of industry and government  not anyone in positions of authority in a board room or an elected office to just stand up and do their job one day   nope  apparently it's entirely yours and the only way you can express this is to petition these people with money and prayer  like they're a minor god  on the off chance that maybe mcdonalds will start stocking a vegan patty or some paltry shit   so you're the input and if you're 'strong' enough they're the mechanism for getting you what you want  that's how it is  does anyone looking around today really  truly believe that is what is happening here   this is what billions of people believe they are reduced to and accept  does that not frighten you some   that there are dopey fucking people walking around today acting like when they bought the wristband in 2005 they actually made poverty history ,l0vo13

640,Lack of appreciation at work / productivity is all that matters.,the company i work at pretty much exclusively cares about productivity and we are project based  every single project my manager asks me if i can find ways to raise my productivity or do more in less time bla bla bla   every time i get the usual bullshit remarks like  colleague x did it once  why can't you  or  it really isn't that much work  just do it and make some overtime     you know what  she's right  i could do it  i could run so fast my legs would outpace my ass and do overtime and be stressed the whole time    it's unhealthy though and they don't pay me nearly enough to endure that   i work in a laboratory and one tiny mistake can ruin a whole days work  so the more i have to run  the more likely i'm to miss some small detail and that gives me anxiety     i'm not going to get a goddamn burnout for this shit      especially with our company being way over profit targets all the time    like  fuck that shit  they make way more profit than they anticipated and they're still cracking the whip  they can go to hell    and when i make extra effort on my own  i've made a couple of python scripts that automate parts of the job such as processing data  instead of appreciation i get shit for it      i did those things on the easy days where my workload was relatively small      i've happily shared it with my colleagues and shown the managers  you know what they told me    where did you find the time to make this   why didn't you spend that time on more productivity instead    why didn't you come to me when your planning was finished    and now they think that i have all this extra time on my hands and are demanding even more productivity from me  what the hell   and during my evaluation they ignored my extra efforts and went straight for the mistakes i made  even showing me a list of aaaall the things i did wrong  like forgetting a signature  failing to add a couple of reports bla bla bla bla  all insignificant paperwork crap that can be solved in 5 minutes       you made too many mistakes so we cannot give you a higher raise this year   i'm fucking sick of it  next time i make something that makes work easier i will keep it to myself and the time it saves me will be my extra break time  why would i bust my ass for this fucking crap ,l0e2jd
641,I'm tired and feeling pretty depressed,english is not my first language  so please bear with me  this is my rant because i have no other place to get it off my chest  i'm from brazil and i didn't know this subreddit until today  it's good to see that it's not only me that think that this work culture and the corporate world sucks so much   i'm a  privileged  software developer working 44h week making 48k reais   year  just for comparison  a brand new 2020 toyota corolla  the cheapest model  costs 100k reais  i have a master's degree in computer science and many of my friends with the same experience are making much less than me and i can't complain with people around me because  i'm privileged   i've joined my current company in january of the last year  i e  1 year working there  this is the worst job i ever had  during this year the company earned more money than ever  increasing revenue by approximately 60  and at the same time  30  of the workers resigned complaining about high pressure and high workload  the company started the year with 100 employees  today i complained about high pressure and the manager just said to me that they will hire more people and after they do this i'll probably stop feeling it  the problem is that the first person of these 30 people that resigned complained about it as well  so it doesn't matter how many workers there are  this high pressure is part of the company's culture  one of these people was earning 84k reais year and now that he left they are trying to find someone to replace him for 156k reais year  so they were basically paying him half of what he did to work more than 50 hours per week   before this job  i've worked for a company that has almost no pressure and with a better work-life balance  but only earning 31k reais year  some ex-coworkers said to me that the salary has increased and considering that i'm f d i thought   maybe i could go back there with the same salary i'm earning now but with less pressure   last month this old employer asked me if i wanted to come back and i said no  but now i'm considering accepting this request  i've messaged him today and he asked me how much i was thinking and i said 60k year  but considering that now i've finished my master's degree and have more experience i thought it was fair  i also know that my ex-coworker that doesn't have as much experience as me and doesn't have a master's degree is earning 56k reais there  so what he said to me is that he would see the  step  and the  salary  that was available and talk to me later  but he thought it is a little less than 60k year   he also said that they are  increasing the pace  there  so the pace is not the same as before  i think it will be much better than my current company or maybe it's a red flag  i'm just tired of this sh  he even said to me that if the company goes well and i'm being productive i can earn more in the future  wtf man  this company probably makes more than 50m year in profit   i hate everything about this corporate world  you can't be sick  can't work less  can't have a bad day   can't say anything wrong because your manager could not like   these employers have all the power in their hands and they don't hesitate in using it because they know people need to eat and to pay rent ,l0as51

681,My job lied to me about my hours and now I don't know what to do...,i applied for a job over the fall with pretty good pay and hours that actually worked for me  6am-4pm  4 days a week  i don't mind the 10 hour  4 day format since i would rather have 3 days off anyway  so i start back in november and for a bit it's okay  then  the hours change to 6-2 30 5 days a week  kind of annoying  but getting out early is a plus  then last week they changed again to  you get to leave when the work is done and you're required to come in on saturdays with no notice if we say so  this is absolutely not what i agreed to  and it was also bot communicated to me whatsoever  i've already talked to the main manager and he insists that we were told during orientation when i know for a fact we weren't  even one of the leads agrees with me that they suddenly changed it out of nowhere  i have an elderly person that i help care for on the weekends and i can't get fmla for her  i barely see my boyfriend anymore even though we live together  not to mention i also have a dog on time sensitive heart medication  the job pays well  and i obviously need it i'm looking for other employment with consistent hours  but i'm not sure if there's anything else i can do here before just quitting entirely once i find something else ,kz6yiw
682,I have been called “rebellious” for expressing that I don’t want to work all my life,it s crazy how often people just accept this notion that we should work all of our lives  i just feel like my family and friends do not understand how i am feeling  whenever i express that i don t want to work my whole life  amp  feel stuck want to find a way out  they basically just tell me to suck it up and that everyone has to work and that s just the reality of life to work  someone just told me that i need to stop this  rebellious phase  and accept that i have to work ,kywi6a

685,I worked for a company that pretended the mandatory minimum wage hike was actually a raise,this was a while ago now  back when minimum was  10 in my state  it was pretty common knowledge that the sate had moved to bump it up to  11 by the summer of that year  a few months before  i had a review  everything looked really good  so i asked about a pay increase  they told me  not right now  but lets talk in a few months  few months went by  and they sat me down again and said  we wanted to give you a pay increase of  1  for all the good work you've done    turns out  everyone in the company got the same sit down  and some actually thought it was serious  learned a good lesson in bullshit that day ,kzq9op

692,A realization that I just had about filling out past salaries on a job application for the chronically underpaid.,a company that your applying to will base their salary offer on what you entered as your previous salary  if you worked for years at 20  below market  you will likely get an offer that is below market  and they will keep you there   do market research on the job title you are applying for  have a printout of an average job description and pay scale  and compare it to what they're offering  obviously it could be off-putting if you get too intense about it  but there is no harm in doing research and advocating for yourself   if you are chronically underpaid and you don't feel comfortable advocating for yourself in that way  your only option to break out of the cycle of underpayment may be to do the research ahead of time and give them a plausibly inflated rate of pay for your last job  it's dishonest  but you need to break that cycle   i suspect that hiring managers would feel uncomfortable flat out asking a past employer about someone's rate of pay  unless it seemed suspicious  they mostly want to know that you exist and weren't a known thief  addict  sexual predator or psychopath  depending on the job   i don't usually advocate for dishonest practices  but i know so many people who are underpaid at their job and it makes me so sad ,kyr0ww

698,My father’s job deteriorated his quality of life and health. I’m bitter.,my father worked his way through undergrad and grad school  he majored in physics and biomedical engineering  after school  he somehow ended up in ultrasound  it was very new at the time so there weren t any 2-year programs for it he learned on the job  fast forward 40 years he is miserable  his job has turned him into a completely different person  my entire life  i feel like 90  of our conversations are about how much he hates working and how stressed he is  and 100  of our problems come from his work  for example  he s an alcoholic  though he won t admit it  he s depressed  incredibly anxious  stressed all the time  he works on holidays  he takes call and has to go into work at 2 am only to go back in at 7    he s always said he wishes he could be an archaeologist  but he couldn t go back to school at this point and the pay is far too low  isn t it terrible that we can t do what we really want to do because of     anyways  for the last 40 years his life has been  wake up  work  get home late  answer calls from the hospital  go into work during the night if on call  repeat   amp  now his time off is spent drinking  sadly i have to set boundaries and cannot really interact much with him because of this    today we had a really horrible falling out and it made me reflect on the way that work had completely changed him from a happy  laid-back  track-star jokester  as my mom would say  to an isolated  dishonest  grumpy  closed-off  moody  and sick  not in a mean way just being honest  person    i blame his work  not completely  but a lot of it ,kzjr0w

701,Engagement of BIPOC: is using the term wage slave hurting more then it helps?,my main concern here is how to engage bipoc in the cause  not to discredit or minimize the pain and suffering endured by those under in capatilism   i think that by using the term wage slave in present day america it encourages the listener reader to compare it directly to the atrocities of american chattel slavery  and as a result people will want to focus on the differences between the two and take a stance on which is was worse and this is completely unnecessary  and this can even extend to  ranking  oppression based on race v class  encouraging people to take sides and encouraging people to ignore how they are intertwined   and if the comparison is involved  but the differences between the two are not dicussed it will only disenfranchise and disengage bipoc    if anything the differences speak more to how american chattel slavery went above and beyond the minimum threshold of what is required for something to be considered slavery  it reached into genocide  eugenics  forced medical expermination  physical torture  rape  stealing children and the dehumanization of people into literal animals   i understand that some of these things happen under modern-day wage slavery  but it's akin the difference between coercion and duress  abuse and neglect  first-degree and second-degree murder  they're both awful and often the results are the same  but they are different  and there is no need to compare the two when each are individually reprehensible on their own merits   but when it comes down to it  wouldn't the cause benefit from speaking in language that seeks to engage and reach out to bipoc  any thoughts ,kyh5ev

707,Giant Space Rocks,interstellar objects pass freely through a star system   what should be done   developing a system to protect a planet from a collision should be the top priority for any civilization  this planetary protection system would require both detection and defensive capabilities in order to be effective   once a civilization has developed their planetary protection system  pursuing other goals becomes practical and desirable  such as space exploration  the search for other forms of life  etc    but what happened here on earth   as soon as our ancestors developed an understanding of impact craters - which are clearly visible on the surface of earth and especially on the moon - they should have immediately recognized the threat of extinction and began planning a solution  so where is our planetary protection system    how did the conversations go    giant space rocks have hit the planet and killed most living things  said the person observing an impact crater    yes  but  what about those people with different skin color  what about those people who worship different imaginary beings  what about those people who speak different languages  what about those people who govern differently  said almost everyone else    giant space rocks  will  hit the planet  and  kill most living things  the crater-observer clarified    yes  but what about controlling people  controlling their appearances  hairstyles  clothing  and what they do with their genitalia  controlling their beliefs  their hopes  their dreams  controlling what they consume  and what about all the punishments  we need to punish people in order to control them  the masses clamored back at the crater-observer    none of that  all those bad ideas  will matter when a giant space rock hits the planet and kills most living things  the crater-know-it-all said    that crater looks really old  the planet doesn't get hit very often  we've probably got plenty of time  it won't be too bad  i've never met anyone that went extinct  humanity's near-consensus sang out in unison    all life as we know it will come to an end  the human-skeptic warned    let's talk about money and how much it's going to cost  giant space rocks are expensive  the damage they do  sounds  expensive  can we really afford to spend money dealing with giant space rocks  what about the economy  what about the stock market  how will we fund this giant space rock program  which social services should we cut from the budget  said a nation's government  the one best-equipped to deal with giant space rocks    we should devote all of our resources and efforts toward saving the planet  it's the only planet we have at the moment  the crater-propagandist opined    this planet is disposable  and so is the human race  because our brains cannot understand priorities  we forgot that our planet is our first priority  instead we became obsessed with the concept of governance  obsessed with controlling human behavior  so we created these labyrinthine systems of laws and customs  the human conscience grumbled from its coffin  its raspy voice escaping as the hammer of capitalism took aim at the final nail  a nail forged from the skeletons of logic and reason    imagine an alien planet  the crater-preacher proselytized   we  the human race  observe the aliens living on their planet happily doing their alien activities  one day  we notice a giant space rock hurdling toward the happy alien planet  to our surprise  rather than do anything about it  the happy aliens just keep going about their routine  busily conducting their alien business  practicing their alien traditions and so on  as the giant space rock gets closer  they start eating alien cakes    how silly  why would the aliens eat cake instead of blasting away that giant space rock  the dying breath of humanity chuckled    because they  like  cake  the crater-fanatic proclaimed   the aliens enjoy cake and that's all they know  their whole existence revolves around pursuing the things they enjoy  and their entire alien culture was designed to prioritize consumption    so what happened to them  did the aliens just eat cake all the way until the end  the ghost of humanity asked  wiping away the royal icing and belching methane into the atmosphere      we know giant space rocks enter the atmosphere  i've seen first-hand evidence of their treachery  i've visited their impact craters and watched those demons streak across the sky  both in person and through electronic representations of them  i also know i'm not the first to understand a little about their evil  world-ending quirkiness   so it was a bit of a shock when i  as a child  started learning about our priorities on this planet  you see  we teach children  everything else  is of utmost concern  except giant space rocks  sure  the gsrs could be mentioned at some point in a science class  if science education is available to the fortunate child  but they are certainly not prioritized ahead of everything else  and if they are actually ever taught  gsrs seem to only feature in relation to the dinosaurs   humans like dinosaurs  they like them so much they want to go extinct like them   is it an issue of time  it happened too long ago  it won't happen again in my lifetime   then i say   tunguska  and every near-miss since   at around the same time i learned about the dinosaurs  i was also informed of a new version of mail that would replace traditional postal mail in the future  a good idea  i thought at the time  and i couldn't wait for the electronic version to take over so we could finally bring an end to the era of the papyrus scroll   but  no  we decided to cling to bad ideas like we've clung to the papyrus scroll era  the disregard for our own survival is a death-wish  actually  and it thrives in all aspects of human endeavors outside of the science to stop gsrs  surely  once humans developed an understanding of the cosmos and the threat of giant space rocks  they must have also had the potential to  at least  start preparing a plan  is it still an issue of technological limitations   tycoons could have done more  the industrial magnates of the modern era could have focused on our survival  especially the ones dabbling in natural resources  but they chose to exploit an injured and dying planet rather than try to save it  short-term thinking  for industrialists and for the human race  they could have become famous for building humanity's giant space rock defense system  humanity's  planetary   survival system  but instead they chose to build automobiles and railroads and sell products and trade resources and    why are more people not upset about tycoons destroying the planet instead of saving it  we should have already had a head start on solving the giant space rock problem  and it is a huge problem  and always will be until we either build the planetary defense system or follow the dinosaurs  it is a problem that will  never  go away   but we procrastinate  if the news broke that a planet-killing space rock would hit us in a century  i imagine several tycoons would get to work today saving the planet  or at least start developing actionable plans for the next generation  they might see it as an opportunity to exploit the burgeoning industry of space industrialization and colonization  but i suspect some minor progress would be made toward building a solution    it will most definitely need to be built  whatever the giant space rock defense system may ultimately turn out to be  and it will require abundant resources  technology  and engineering on a scale never attempted before  the  device  or whatever will actually redirect the giant space rocks away from the planet  will be the most important human technological development of all time  perhaps even the final product of the earth-based human era  whether we survive or not  so what are we waiting for   however  if the news broke that a gsr would strike in several millennia  i doubt much would change from our current state of inaction  we have plenty of time  they would say  since no one currently alive will need to worry about it  that's what we do  act like we have plenty of time   but without a perfect detection system in place  able to detect all objects over a certain size at a certain distance  time is an unknown variable  it would be a good idea to proceed as if we have limited time to defend the planet because   actually  we have limited time to defend the planet  everything is limited for humans  in our current state of existence  limited time  limited resources  limited intelligence  we're down to just one single habitable planet  not that we ever had or deserved more than one  and we act as if everything is  un -limited   humans feel the same way about our closest star   oh  sure  it'll blow up one day  but that's too far in the future for me to care about  let's go back to hurting each other and fighting over nothing while we exploit our only home  exploding stars and giant space rocks are not part of the current human agenda  but there may be more interest in the future  one can never truly know for sure what ideas may captivate the masses   survival became too easy and commonplace for certain groups  those groups became so successful at the game of resource acquisition that they also became lazy and forgot about the difficulties of planetary survival  their forgetfulness and complacency lulled them into a false sense of security  belief in an afterlife didn't help   i often return to this idea of giant space rocks whenever life seems absurd  because nothing is more absurd than humanity continuing without a planetary defense system  are other analogies helpful   for those still living in the  wild-west  imagine an infinite number of bullets being fired at your home from all directions  for the entire time that your home exists  you'll never know when a bullet will hit you  and it could the size of a  22 or  50 bmg  it could even be the size of a cannonball and kill everyone in your home  since huge caliber ammunition has killed almost all of the previous inhabitants   would you try to detect the bullets before they hit your home  knowing about the bullet may be helpful  especially where and when the bullet will hit  and whether it will be a flesh wound or a bull's eye   would you try to stop the bullets in some way  preventing the bullets from hitting your home will help you and your family survive    wild-westerners  respond  'your analogy means everyone on earth is my family  and i'm not entirely comfortable with that  in fact  i'm downright offended  are you even legal in this country  you-people are the reason i carry guns '   does anyone else need an analogy      how grotesque and absurd is it that we don't already have a planetary defense system  how is it not a global human effort to stop the giant space rocks from killing us all  find any headline from the news and re-contextualize it by adding   and in other news  another giant world-killer was successfully diverted  humanity will continue after all   our little stupid priorities  our stupid money  our stupid governments  our stupid religions  we're so accustomed to killing people ourselves we can't fathom a real entity that will do it for us  instead we invent imaginary beings who exterminate humanity with silly floods  and other things that frightened ancient people  but while stupid people made up their silly stories  the real humanity-killer was always out there  on its course  careening through space and time  a speeding bullet with our name on it   who wouldn't want to contribute to the global human effort to save the planet  anti-globalists  if an extinction-hungry space rock has us in its sights  is there another job someone would rather do    you guys can go stop the planet-killer  i'm fine staying here  sticking with the wage-slaving  people gotta eat  you know  while the giant space rock is being diverted   sure  yes  life and commerce would continue in some form while humanity dealt with the gsrs  but how long would capitalism and the labor-consumption cycle persist after humanity successful dodged a space bullet   cynics  and perhaps everyone  would say profiteering would be commonplace after a near-apocalypse  with industries and commercial interests taking over the maintenance of the planetary defense program  others would say the militarization of the space defensive system is inevitable    i say the threat of a giant space rock would cancel capitalism   would an industry or an individual business refuse to supply the anti-gsr effort  how would that play out on earth   if the global effort to build a defense system against giant space rocks required  for example  an enormous amount of natural resources that were scarce on earth  capitalistic interests would attempt to control and profit from the demand for those resources  if capitalists were allowed to do so  a scenario might occur where humanity could not afford to save itself   apologists would say it could never happen  that if the planetary defense system truly needed a specific resource to be successful  then the people who control that resource would acquiesce and  donate  it to save humanity  instead of demanding payment  why should we assume capitalists will resort to charity when the world is about to end  do we want to take that chance  that mr moneybags tycoon will give away his resources for free   tell me how a stubborn individual - who happens to control a rare commodity and also wants to watch the world burn - will be convinced to donate their resources to the global protection effort  or a rogue nation that is the sole producer of a specific resource - how will they be convinced   capitalism allows resources to be controlled by individuals  it also allows and in many ways encourages the hoarding of resources  what are we to do if the planetary defense system requires a rare element and only one individual  or corporation or nation-state  owns the lot of it  sorry  world  we can't afford to buy the last bit of pure promethium off the florida-man hoarding it  i guess we can't finish building earth's meteor defender   if not promethium  then some other element  for historical reference  think of it as oil  or diamonds  or gold  or spices  or any of the other multitude of  possessions  humans have killed each other over  we are experts at fighting and killing each other for resources  perhaps that will be the plan  to negate capitalism and simply exterminate those hoarding the elements and utilize them on the planetary defense system  does property still exist when the world is about to end   it is entirely a possibility that humanity will continue to produce individuals who will encourage our own extinction  will capitalism become associated with suicidal tendencies in the future  is anything more misanthropic than our  labor-consumption cycle   i imagine a tycoon sitting on his golden throne  watching the world burn because we couldn't afford his fancy space lasers  or more realistically  perhaps he's watching earth burn from the comfort of another planet  or moon  or space craft  because nasa couldn't afford his srct  space rock capture technology  perhaps that will be the philosophy of the future space tycoons  exploit the planet of its resources to ensure  their own  survival  while simultaneously bringing about the extinction of everyone else  perhaps the future planet-killers will actually be just resource-hungry space tycoons  sailing from planet to planet  stripping them of resources and bombarding them with space rocks on their way out  who needs evil aliens   can we afford to save the planet  the question itself is absurd  yet how many people read it with a straight face  let's examine the costs   giant space rocks are located in the void  so our technology will have to travel in the void as well  but luckily we have experience in that arena  we know the rockets in the apollo program used several tons of fuel  per second  to achieve escape velocity and reach orbit  now  taking into consideration the duration of the flight  the weight of the payload and the cost of kerosene  we can calculate the enormous cost with an average of twenty tons per second and   see how easy it is to become absurd under capitalism  to begin saving the planet  we would need to calculate the cost of fuel   is saving the planet too expensive  is there a more complicated question that capitalism  cannot  answer  what are our alternatives    start sharing resources now  so when our survival truly depends on it  we'll be ready to pool everything together and succeed   i don't believe a single space agency is capable of building and maintaining the planetary defense system  and even a collaboration of agencies may not be enough  private business interests may surpass and dominate government space programs  but this is an even worse idea than allowing capitalism to exist in lieu of a planetary defense system  can you imagine a hostile space corporation allowing a small space rock to hit their competitor's headquarters   or one nation's space program letting a few village-killers land in their enemy's territory  not every country will be able to contribute financially  or at all  to the planetary defense program  so perhaps we should let them get wiped out by a tiny meteor  cut out the middlemen between the resources buried in their ground and the planetary defense system in orbit above them  they were just getting in the way  and then the mind wanders to the other side of the equation and ponders the concept of using space rocks as offensive weapons   no human would consider such a thing  that's not in our immediate future  right   what are we going to do  who has a better plan than what were currently doing  which seems like almost nothing  will we just keep killing each other arbitrarily over nothing until we all get wiped out ourselves    'oumuamua   all of these interstellar objects that seem to just magically appear in the vicinity of earth need to stop  and by vicinity  i mean within any distance of our star where the object can be given a name by the media  the speculation about where they originate is neat and everything  but the fact that they zip through here in the first place should have alarmed everyone into action   oh  look  another mysterious interstellar visitor we knew nothing about  hey  wait  it's already left our star system  it's moving that fast  came out of nowhere  barely knew it passed through  more importantly  what are we going to name it   wild-westerners  imagine a bullet whizzing past a person  but instead of trying to figure out who shot at them  they're more concerned with everything else they falsely believe is a priority  hey  buddy  there are many more space bullets on the way  so you better stop what you're doing and figure it out before its too late   as a child  i assumed adulthood meant working on the planetary defense system  in some capacity or another  perhaps employed in the electronic post office  delivering electronic mail to the meteor-hunting robots in space  but  no  let's not get ahead of ourselves  the papyrus scroll tech  was  a good idea  right   good ideas are the most limited resource on a planet without a defense system   just think of all the things we prioritize instead of the safety of our planet  how are we not overwhelmed by our collective shame      perhaps it's too late for humanity to change its course  so i like to imagine plans for other emerging civilizations who might fare better than we did  what would this plan look like   first  before you do anything else  develop the technology to defend your planet from giant space rock impacts  keep your planet clean until you can find another one  which leads to the second part of the plan  find another planet  or moon  or figure out how to live permanently in space  all of this requires resources  so make sure you've  optimized  your utilization and  allocation  of those resources  see the first step  keeping your planet clean   by all means  don't waste resources and  whatever you do  don't allow anyone to hoard them  don't let the idea of  ownership  or  property  evolve on your planet  if capitalistic ideas do take hold in your civilization  find a way to educate your people and move past that stage of greed and selfishness  it is merely a phase of early development of civilizations  constantly remind everyone of the giant space rocks looming above  giant space rocks   every time a person says something belongs to them  correct them by gently informing them of the needs of the planetary defense system  we may need that particular resource to save the planet  so it cannot  belong  to you personally  property is a myth   when a giant space rock is going to end life as we know it   ask a capitalist   who owns the giant space rock that will exterminate the human race  an absurd question  you may think  as it's just a lump of detritus floating in space  but at the same time  humans claim ownership of this lump of detritus floating in space that we call home  we believe we  possess  something when  in fact  it is the other way around  the planet possesses us and we are most certainly its temporary  disposable possessions  we are beholden to the planet - it owns us  we are the planet's servants until we can become its custodians   until we reach a different realm of existence  if that's even possible  there are no other decent alternatives to having a place to live  whether it's on a planet  moon  space station or spacecraft  we are delusional and falsely believe we still have options or time   you can't ask the dinosaurs what is more important than the threat of giant space rocks  but you can ask yourself  what have i done to protect humanity from giant space rocks      imagine  if you will  mr moneybags tycoon  with his infinite wisdom and bottomless coffers  proceeding to undertake the business of saving the planet from the giant space rocks  he uses his own business to facilitate the construction of the detection system in orbit  utilizing corporate partnerships in various industries to supply the materials and labor  for the defensive component  he partners with the military of certain governments  but not others  the planet is saved by his business   but what happens after that  is his business accused of monopolization  is the tycoon himself deified  is there any dimension in the multiverse where this actually happens   i suspect there is not  it seems logical to me that giant space rocks exterminate most civilizations in the universe  especially the civilizations stuck in the labor-consumption cycle  perhaps most civilizations never progress beyond that stage  the era when they thought they had the  luxury to choose  to ignore the threat  perhaps the labor-consumption cycle is the greatest filter   suppose they are not such a big deal  these giant space rocks  and dealing with them is actually easier than we think  the technology may be less resource-demanding than we assume in our doomsday  worst-case scenarios  but as i type these words  there is not a single thing happening in the entire world that convinces me people are ready to undertake  any  of this  the senseless deaths during an avoidable pandemic are just an example of how ill-prepared governments and humanity in general will be when dealing with the magnitude of giant space rocks   giant space rocks  we couldn't handle face masks   the extinction of the human race  we executed people during a global pandemic   instead of executing people  why not declare them  essential workers  and sacrifice them that way   we are simply not ready  half of a country joined an anti-reality  fascist death-cult during a global pandemic  some of them even died  still in denial  of what was killing them     giant space rocks are an alien hoax    less than one percent of civilizations get struck by giant space rocks  young civilizations are immune from giant space rocks    i don't trust your planetary defense vaccine  it's unnatural  the atmosphere has enough natural immunity from giant space rocks    we believe these two things simultaneously  1  the planetary defense system will suffocate us and  2  giant space rocks will pass right through the planetary defense system  so what's the point  clearly alien mind control propaganda  right   never forget  many millions of people voted against their own interests  like healthcare during a pandemic  these same people would vote to dismantle the planetary defense system if they could  something that  like healthcare  is in everyone's interest  always      what are your priorities  how will your life change when they discover a giant space rock will strike the planet during your lifetime  in ten years  in five  next week  tomorrow   what will our excuses be  we were busy  we had other priorities   they love to refer to certain eras and the people from those eras as  great  generations  but what will they call the generation that builds the first planetary defense system  the generation that actually saves the planet   some people ponder the  reason  or  purpose  or  meaning  of life  those people could use a job working for the global effort to develop our planetary defense system  once that's taken care of  they may experience a brief lull in their quest for meaning but  i can assure you  finding another habitable planet will be a top priority for every future generation  why  because that's the other  meaning  they are searching for    finding other forms of life in the universe   yes  another great  long-term goal after surviving the giant space rocks is obviously to find other life forms in the universe  need more reason  more purpose  figuring out why most of the universe is invisible to us is another great long-term goal  surely  we must pursue an understanding of dark matter and dark energy  advanced civilizations will have answers for most of our questions  what else does anyone need to know   surviving giant space rocks  leaving earth and finding other civilizations  or their compendiums  to teach us about dark matter and dark energy are admirable and achievable goals for humanity   but who actually supports giant space rocks in their quest to destroy us   bad ideas  religion  science denialism  the spreading of delusions   capitalism  in all its forms  valuing property and commerce over human life   politics  the death-cults  the obsession with governance and control  the perpetuation of the labor-consumption cycle   please join me in redirecting humanity's priorities toward creating a planetary defense system  it is how we save the planet from    giant  space  rocks    while we solve gsrs  we also need to discuss gamma ray bursts in my next post  ,kzkleb

723,"Don’t know what this is.

726,Just discovered this community and I'm worried about my father.,i'm in grad school but with reading everything on here it's become clearer my dad was the perfect model of person for the work culture to exploit  he's selfless  has low self compassion and wanted to provide for his family any way he can  so he worked 2  sometimes 3 jobs  my mother sucked money out of him when they were married and still does with alimony   my dad's a software developer that works for a bank and he teaches on the side  he works 6 day weeks  all day long  i'm really worried about him and i feel like this lifestyle is crushing him - he's constantly tired and drained and taking naps whenever he can but they're not good naps - because of the demands of both jobs  but especially the bank one  also the bank is supposed to be  socially conscious  and progressive meanwhile they appear to be driving their employees like cattle at least from what i see   this culture seems to have gotten him so much that even when his gf who has a high paying job and much less hours came into our lives  and offered to help with his debts bills  my dad feels wrong for being a  mooch  like goddamn  i wish i could do something  feels like he lost his whole life to working and supporting us and i wouldn't be lying if i said i felt guilty  being one of those he had to support   any advice about anything would be appreciated  otherwise  thanks for just reading ,kzvldr

740,Modern jobs and management are an absolute joke.,i recently started a new job because my old one was  the worst  - maybe one day i'll make a post about how much of a joke that was  y'all will love it  they made me work while i had corona  refused to pay me  and regularly guilted me into doing illegal shit   just started at this new place and they have all sorts of unnecessary policies that scream  we don't trust our employees  you have to log in to this monitoring software at the start of your shift  when you go on lunch you have to set up your monitoring bs to show  lunch  - just this morning i was about three minutes late logging in and my manager called me on my mobile asking why i wasn't working yet  monitoring software had frozen on startup  every day there's some mention from the manager about this that's phrased as a joke -  we're watching you so don't run away from your desk  they repeatedly say they can't wait until everyone is working in the office so they can keep an eye on them  giving me babysitter vibes   the icing on the cake was about two weeks ago  everyone is working from home  which some people love and some people hate  i don't mind it too much - it's mentally exhausting  but not the worst thing in the world  for other people that have kids it can obviously be  horrible  especially those that have to answer the phone and deal with customers 8 hours a day  management said in the weekly meeting that they were no longer going to allow people with kids liberties on their tracking software  and that they can't keep taking twenty thirty minute breaks in the afternoon to handle the kids  if they did  this would be reflected in their performance reviews and they could suffer hr meetings or pay freezes  i hated this  there are only two people with kids on the team  and targeting them like that for having  reasonable problems with their children while everyone is home during a pandemic  in front of everyone made me feel filthy   the job is advertised as  flexible working hours  - as in  you can start and finish any time you like between set hours provided you hit your 40 hours a week  i thought this was great - my job is very data heavy and not dependent on other people being around  so i thought i could essentially work from 8am to 7pm two or three days a week and finish earlier on friday  provided i had finished everything i need to do  or take an early finish one day to run errands and catch up later in the week  the managers made this very clear on day one that this isn't the case  i start any time before 9 and finish any time after 4 30  but i  have  to work at least 7 and a half hours every day  and hit that 40 hours every week  how does that help me  how is that flexible   oh  and management is also fishing for people to work overtime  but won't offer anything other than the standard hourly rate  for context  every other job i've worked in has offered at least 1 5x pay for working nights and weekends  and from the sounds of it  lots of other people i work with hold this standard too  fucking hell  i got 2 5x pay working bank holidays  christmas eve  and nye working in a shitty independent restaurant when i was 18   i recently offered to handle some data management for my team  if you can call it that  as everyone seems pretty computer illiterate  the task was basically to move data from an old server up to a new cloud server so it could be accessed across the board by everyone in our organisation  it was basically a drag and drop process but took like two days  mostly because i had to fight for the permissions to access the right folders  but i eventually got the data over and let my manager know that the job was done and the procedure could be rolled out to the rest of the team  i didn't get a thank you or even an acknowledgement of  oh you finished that thing  instead  i was asked if i could build a database for some other task other people were struggling with  i don't want a medal  but a thank you for something that everyone else seemed incapable of doing would have been pleasant   i was already disillusioned with the corporate life before i came here  my best case scenario is to work in a field i love  but covid makes new jobs so tough to find  and don't see that instantaneously changing post-covid   my frustration is that i show up  i do my job  i don't cause problems and i don't bring problems to management unless i can't solve them  i have gone beyond my job role multiple times and my two performance reviews i've had so far are marked at 100  i still feel like managers don't trust me and won't leave me alone despite my on-point performance  adults can do their jobs  gasp  without someone breathing down their necks   it's also been a shitty week for me for other reasons  but i really needed to get this off my chest here  it's hard when everyone is locked away and there's nobody around ,kzt1wz

873,Perspective of a 16-year-old,for the past week  near all of my free time i have been engrossed in the reality of the world of corporate america  poverty  increasing unemployment  increasing job dissatisfaction  and the seeming impossibility of a healthy work-life balance  as someone who has never really worked a full 8 hour shift in their life  and whose parents don t work up to as many hours as the typical 40  this reality is quite foreign and incredibly terrifying   of course i am a dumbass when it comes to the complexities of these topics  and any real world topics   just a list of some of my thoughts   - a universal basic income is absolutely necessary  the fact that cost of living is so high that minimum wage workers often can t get by is absolutely ridiculous to me  we should be provided basic needs and have to work for wants    - rich people don t have to be so rich  like seriously  why the fuck are they allowed to hoard so much  if we go off the  probably quite incorrect in many ways  data that jeff bezos makes about 9 million an hour  then that means he makes 600 000 more than his employees  he certainly hasn t worked 600 000 harder than them   - office culture seems like cancer    - the average person shouldn t have 5 8 hour shifts a week  from what i ve heard that extra time is never needed  if science says that 32 hour work weeks make people more productive than 40 hour  why not do that and save money on office upkeep   - the standards for hiring seem ridiculous  people used to be able to buy a house with a carpentry job from working straight after high school  why are bachelors degrees considered so worthless   - life should be measured by happiness  the idea that more money equals more happiness is stupid  though i would like to say that everyone can be happy even with poor financial situations  the fact that access to basic necessity isn t always available can kill a person s soul  - hustle culture is so toxic and keeps the mindset that you have to impress other people to be happy  - the fact that many people are made to feel guilty for not doing overtime or having a side hustle is so unbelievably sad   - automation might cut about half of my ages potential careers  - working enough  not the hardest to make the most of your free time shouldn t be shamed  - i want to volunteer really badly but covid has stopped that  i had a previous weekly position at a kid s church program that was cancelled and it sucks to not see the kids and the other volunteers just as it felt i was starting to be a part of a community  volunteering right now seems really important to get experience and learn what i like  but that has been taken from me while i have the most time to pursue it as a high schooler  - i already know i m going to have to live with my parents for a long time compared to how they went about it  - going to university is seen as an expectation at my school  but i don t see it being worth it for a lot of my schoolmates  - though i am impressed by their motivation  it is sad seeing my schoolmates be so focused on making every moment of their time an opportunity to study more or fill out college applications  i feel like so many will burn out and regret not reaping the rewards of being a kid   - i just want to earn enough to live a modest life  i want a job that doesn t burn me out that doesn t take so much of the day  i want to be able to see my loved ones happy and not burnt out too  i want to  live in the now   - it is getting harder to believe that hard work will pay off  - for such a troubling time  i don t feel people my age have the discipline to keep up  - the very close relationship between ethnicity and social class for the african-american population is simply because of the abolishment of slavery not coming with a chance for slaves to  join the working class  so they were left with no money to give to their children   - elon musk is a fucking idiot  not really related but i hate the perpetuation of the story that he lives a rags to riches kind of life when that couldn t be farther from the truth  - minimum wage jobs shouldn t expect anything more than minimum wage work  - i don t think the idea that the homeless are lazy and stupid is all that accurate  and even so  they should be treated with the respect and support to get better   - goddammit  responsibility comes at you pretty fuckin quick  doesn t it   - the future seems pretty bleak when it comes to the shrinking middle class and wage slavery  the more i read the more i can see me and my friends dying on the streets from starvation and exposure  - invisible additions to already expensive medical bills seem like life-enders  - why are so many dying and suffering and so little care  a lifestyle of living to work kills all human passion for nature and common good  excuses are always made  look at the cambodian genocide  look at the rwandan genocide  the un and the states promised to never forget  yet i had never even heard of anything about them other than the name what genocide means  - the knowledge that i will almost be guaranteed to be depressed in my future makes me depressed now  - success in capitalism is built on luck  i am eternally grateful that my family doesn t have to worry financially even if there was a medical emergency,kwyqlg

877,What is your opinion on refusing tasks at work?,although i am anti work  i feel i try to have a decent attitude towards it and i have never refused a task before  sometimes meaning i take on more than i should    i work in a bank and my role is a mix between doing cash at the tellers and opening accounts maintenance etc  in an office  one of the tellers is taking more time off than usual as she needs to babysit her kids on school holidays which means she has been working around me and when i can cover the tellers  this obviously means i am falling behind on my  office based  targets  which i feel is out of my control and there s been increased pressure on me lately to  catch up    so  yesterday was an extremely busy day  i had half finished tasks that i needed to complete and i also hadn t had my lunch break  i have family stuff going on and my mental health isn t as great as it usually is so when my manager approached me and told me he had 2  account openings for me to do 15 minutes before we shut  this would take me at least 45 minutes  30 if i am lucky  i calmly said  look  i am feeling really overwhelmed with my work load at the moment  i also have stuff going on at home  didn t have my lunch break and i m not feeling it  i don t refuse stuff very often but i am not taking this on  the customer can come back tomorrow and i ll do it then  my manager stood at my desk and questioned what i had to do  he also said   this will be good for you  you need to reach your targets   after him standing at my desk for a few more minutes he walked away    this morning i came to work and had my first panic attack in several years  when i approached him about needing to go home he was at first supportive but then said   you can t keep refusing customers when you have a target to reach   i guess the reason that i am asking this question is because i was made to feel like i was being unreasonable and in the wrong when i at first thought i was being perfectly reasonable and i guess i need reassurance on that    i am at home now and after an appointment with my psychologist i have decided to book a doctors appointment tomorrow and have a sick day tomorrow too  i am genuinely upset by this as i have more important things to worry about at the moment and the passive comments and unnecessary pressure is not needed    i would also love tips on how i can approach my manager about this as i don t think i did anything wrong    thank you if you have stuck around to read this  i hope you have a wonderful day ,kwycmr

896,Humble brag post: reached the laziness goal I didn't know I could ever achieve,not sure posts like this are allowed or if there's a better subreddit for this since i do work a bit but here it goes  feel free to delete   over the last few months  i've been putting in less than 8 hours a week at work  from home  i'm still getting an average  but nowhere near google-level  software engineer salary  i've read stories similar to this in the past but never imagined i'd be in this kinda situation   wish i could help ya'll find a situation like this but for me this happened out of privilege  laziness  and a lot of luck  laziness for the obvious reasons but also because i was too lazy to get a new  better job  this job wasn't always like this  i've wanted to leave for over a year but i was just too lazy to interview  and then covid happened  people got laid off  priorities switched  management got shuffled around multiple times  salaries got reduced  so i started slacking off a bit here and there and wow that was a slippery slope  now here i am doing a few hours of work a week   one reason this has worked so well is that my manager isn't technical at all  this is probably why they have been super happy with my work over the last few months and i'm not sure but i guess their boss is as well  whenever i finish something  they're like omg i can't believe this is done already thanks so much  confetti emoji   the rest of my  team  is only 3 other technical people and they're working on different products since everyone else got laid off due to covid  they don't even work in the same programming language and they're not exactly producing much either  to top it off they've all heard horror stories about the projects i'm responsible for  some things are not easy to accomplish and people have quit due to burnout back when the workload was more intense  so that gives me a decent out if something is taking a while longer than it seems like it should  overall  not really worried about them getting me fired   sometimes i've been feeling a little bad about slacking off so much but i have to remind myself they're not exactly helping to cure cancer here  they're mostly salesmen making huge commissions because they  or their dad  are rich or know someone rich   fuck em    and yeah i'll go fuck myself too  thanks ,kxar33

917,I quit my job in Sept. And I am happy!,i want to preface this by saying i have been anti-work for a long time  and have known for that workers mean nothing to employers  for just as long     i only work as a means to an end  but would gladly not work again my entire life  if possible  that does not mean  however  that when i do work  i don't put in effort  if i am doing something  i like to do it well  in all aspects of my life      i was employed at a major hotel company up until a few months back  working nights from 11pm to 7am  technically on a 0 hour contract  on minimum wage      i was there a year  and did well  got employee of the month straight out of the probation period  helped them cover my managers role for a while  and i was put forward again for employee of the month  just before lock-down happened     the team consisted of me  the assistant manager  and manager  with others coming and going  as it wasn't the best hours  or best wage  never more than 4 on the team though    towards the end  the 3 of us were getting annoyed with everything  we were all looking for other jobs  as this one was not good    nights increasingly had more work piled on us  while the days literally stood around  or sat in the office  for most of their shift  the gm and dgm  2 males in their 30's  were extremely biased towards the day staff  who were all women girls  we were regularly understaffed  and when covid hit  we were made to clean dirty rooms  without even leaving them the required amount  as well as shitty pay and shitty hours    the assistant manager had accepted a job offer  and put in his notice  which was about 1 month   the general manager asked if i wanted to apply for the position of assistant night manager  already knowing what the current assistant manager was on  i asked how much it would be     the salary would have been a whopping 3 pence higher than minimum wage  and because i would be salaried  i would not be able to get overtime    i later looked online  as i knew they usually post for those positions  they were advertising more online  than for what i got offered   i decided right then that it was my time to leave too  i waited until the night before the assistant manager was leaving  and handed in my resignation  effective immediately    best choice i felt i could make  and it was      right now  i don't really do much  i take each day as it is  but because of lock-downs  covid  etc  i am mostly in the house  playing games  talking to people  watching whatever i want  cooking  and all around generally happy    thankfully  i had money saved  so i have been spending the last few months riding on that  it has been the best time ever    but i'm getting towards the end of my savings i had allocated  and i reallllly don't want to work again  work makes me anxious  and depressed  i feel i have no life  and work just to survive  i have never found any job that i even like  let alone love  and this realisation that i will have to start looking for another job  and signing on  uk unemployment  soon is killing me      i am happy i had a nice few months  i guess  but this whole situation has solidified that  even if an employer seems to notice your hard work  you are worthless and replaceable to them ,kx4b32

920,RANT: Pandemic + working,so  my brother and his girlfriend work at a large petstore chain here in canada  she is a groomer  he works stock  a couple weeks ago they both got  as a 'thank you' for putting their health at risk in the middle of a pandemic  10 dollar gift cards to mcdonalds  and some dice and a deck of cards  the filthy rich bastards who own the company also made videos of them sitting in their million dollar homes thanking the wageslaves of their company for putting their lives on the line for laughable amount of money they make    so  i sent customer service an email    good evening   my brother and his girlfriend both work for   and i'd just like to say that i think it is incredibly insulting that  's 'thank you' to them  and the other employees there  was a 10 dollar gift card to mcdonalds  playing cards  and a video of the billionaires who run it sitting in their cozy mansions  safe from this virus  thanking them for risking their health and potentially their lives  for the measly paycheck they get  i understand whoever receives this is not at fault  and to whoever does read it i hope you stay safe during these times    regards     this was the response       thank you for contacting   with your feedback    we sincerely apologize for the misunderstanding caused by this we completely understand your concern  and are happy to assist     we appreciate the time you've taken to share your comments regarding your concerns  we value any feedback that you can provide as it helps us to understand how our pet parents feel and gives us an excellent opportunity for self-evaluation      your comments are definitely welcome  we continue to be committed to providing you and all of our pet parents with the highest standards of service in this industry  pet parents such as yourself are truly important to us and deserve the best of what we have to offer      if you have any other questions or concerns  please let us know  thank you for shopping with   for all your pet supply needs    i had worked for them  but was laid off right as the pandemic started  was told by my manager that i wasn't and that this was happening to everyone at the store and to be patient  then found out  later through a co-worker that i was actually laid off  no call from my manager  no text  nothing  i'm 22 years old and i am honestly tired of being told to accept shit like this  i got written up once for not noticing a fork behind a garbage can  told i wasn't 'professional'  told that when i asked if i could switch to pet care that i would be 'someone elses problem' if they did  i have add and was in the middle of getting new meds  which i made sure they were aware of  funny considering how the first day of my job i was sat down to watch training videos and do quizzes and one of their first guidelines is that employees who might need accommodation are not only entitled to it  but encouraged to seek it out if needed  all i was asking for was a bit of understanding while i was getting my meds sorted out  not to be treated like royalty  not only did i not get understanding  but my manager took to hiding things under shelves for me to find to make sure i was  cleaning properly  she also got mad when i would miss pee stains somewhere in the store  it is one of the bigger stores  and i know i did my best keeping up with it  and went on about how it would turn pet parents away  but would leave it there for days to show me when i was scheduled next  so it was okay for the pee to be left then  but not when i missed it  one of the real kickers was when it was december of last year  5am i'm waiting outside the store to be let in for my shift  it's snowing  freezing cold and nothing is open  my manager showed up two hours late and was snarky the entire shift  last but not least  the shit show that was petcare  there were a few good people there  but not good enough apparently because animals was consistently escaping from the room behind petcare  three times in one month it was a python that i found when i was cleaning under the isles  another time it was a robo hamster on the brink of death because it had escaped and had been gone for who knows how long  a majority of the time the bottles in the cages were set up way too high and the hamsters couldn't reach them  you'd think a pet store would actually take better care of their animals    all in all  i have no hope for the future right now  this pandemic  the fact that money rules everything  and the fact that the system works to create mindless wage slaves as opposed to enlightened and free people  makes me feel so sick i want to throw up    stay safe everyone ,kxtd76

938,Work-Life Balance Is A Lie, work life balance  is among the dumbest of corporate slogans that has been created   it is an attempt to brainwash people into thinking such a thing could even possibly exist when you work from sunrise to sunset and use all your energy before you are let to go home and rest to repeat it again tomorrow  there is no  work-life balance  in this slave system  corporations use up your productive hours of the day  and leave you to go home once you've been milked for the day   imagine this - doing 8 hours of one activity  every single fucking day  do you take 8 hour showers everyday  do you eat 8 hour long meals  how about when you watch a movie  do you like them 8 hours long   how about you give me true  work life balance  and have me work every other day rather than 5 on followed by 2 off  that sounds a little more  balanced  doesn't it   if i have  work-life balance  then the amount of time i spend working should be fairly shared with the activity time i spend not working  it isn't  i guess i shouldn't be surprised  just another dumb hr driven  brainless concept that rather exposes the corporate world as the actual opposite of what they are trying to be seen as   tl dr - no  work and life isn't fucking balanced  not by a long shot ,kxfjj3
939,My work has had rhe busiest 2 weeks we've ever had and I'm dragging my feet.,i've poured my heart and soul into this company  and developed multiple health issues due to the stress it has put upon me  i began smoking cigarettes a few weeks after being hired years ago to try and find some relief as nothing else was working   we've had back to back phone calls for the past 2 weeks  and most days i'll do my very best to stay on top of things  but today  i'm just not feelin it   too many rude ungrateful customers have led me to want to sit on my ass and do nothing  the company only cares about the money they're making and not the customers who have to suffer due to our high volume  and i'm burnt out on it  i don't care about these people anymore  and i no longer believe in the company i'm working for   i'm sitting here browsing reddit while my team is dealing with the high volume  and honestly  i couldn't care less  this company can crash and burn ,ky1v6p
940,Work will always be there,you're going to have days where you can't enjoy your own free time because you're too exhausted spending your whole day at work  you come home and you accidentally fall asleep just to wake up and see that all the little amount of time you have before its time to start getting ready for work the next day is gone    you can't enjoy spending time with your family because you're so mentally drained from everything you are required to do on a day to day basis  sometimes they may even notice you're more irritable than usual   you and your friends don't ever get to see each other anymore because everyone's priority is getting money to make sure all the bills are paid and all the little free time you have left you're inclined to spend it on yourself because its literally all you have left   many of us wake up every day just to make breakfast  shower  get dressed and then go take our daily commute  unless you work from home  just to spend time at a place that we really do not care about at all for 8-12 hours a day 5-6 days a week  what makes all of this worse is when you are surrounded by a bunch of overly optimistic people who might snitch on you because you're  not in the mood  or how about the obsession with working overtime that many people romanticize and brag about how they worked like 58 hours last week  or having a boss who acts like this place is their second home and expects everyone else to have the same mindset    you're not always going to have quality family time  spend time with friends  and even have a lot of free time for yourself but you can bet that you have plenty of time spending the rest of your life working all day everyday just to make somebody else richer ,kxoplp

1018,Employer not giving a single flying f**k about Covid.,alright  this is gonna be a long one so i apologise  tl dr at the bottom  i just need to get this off my chest  i'm based in the uk doing sales for a company that claims to have values that promote employees working with each other  helping each other and keeping employees safe   however  during the time that the part of the uk that i am in was placed in tier 4  basically government advice was to work from home when you can  the company decided that we should all come into work  sit at desks that are within touching distance of the person next to us  and answer the phones all day  which are as busy as before covid so no reduction in staffing levels  instead of allowing us to work from home    when asked about this  they said that it was because of the phone system that they use not being flexible enough to allow working from home  essentially meaning that a year into the pandemic they hadn't planned ahead at all  this isn't a small company  this is a company that has sales figures in the millions each week    they then gave employee of the month to a colleague who came into work for two and a half days with all the symptoms of covid  before announcing at lunch on the third day that he felt ill and wanted to go home  meaning that everyone in the office had to isolate and a couple of members of staff have since tested positive    when we raised concerns with management  we were told that they would be unhappy if someone caught covid in the office  as they had apparently taken all' reasonable steps' to ensure employee safety  yet did absolutely nothing when their 'reasonable' steps were proven to not work  that quote above was from a manager who has been working from home since march  so hasn't been into the office in about a year    just to clarify  the employee of the month thing happened several months ago  at the end of the first uk lockdown  i've only just got reddit tho so didn't have somewhere to rant about this until now    tl dr i'm sick of employers claiming to care about employees health yet not doing anything to actually keep them safe   edited to make it actually readable not just a block of text as i'm on mobile,kwtbjn

1023,"Rant on work, from a teenanger's perspective",please excuse errors or maybe even this post in general  i am young and not a native speaker    sometimes i wish it was still the 1950s and i was supposed to be a housewife  i feel like saying that is like saying you're a n zi but honestly i really do feel like that  i know women deserve to be treated equal to men and have the opportunity to educate themselves and work  in fact from what i've seen women girls outperform men boys quite often  but the right to education and the right to work is not the freedom for women as some people think it is and society makes it out to be in my opinion  v awkward because i've always considered myself a feminist   for me  eventhough as a child i was labeled smart i cannot help but wish my life was different  again  it feels weird to say that because i am a woman living in a first world country in the 21st century- how could i possibly complain  well  i always thought of the ability to work as freedom  but as i've grown up i realized i have little  a job is what you need to feed yourself and your family  an education is a requirement and a completely soulsucking experience that will also leave you with not only the wish you were struck by lighting or hit by a bus every once in a while but a nice debt    speaking of family  i wish i could have one but how am i gonna combine that without impacting my career and in this economy  i dream of having a big family sometimes but can't imagine having more than 2  a child is so incredibly expensive and time consuming from what i've heard  daycare costs alone  it makes me sad  i also feel like getting a house is gonna be so hard  i am nineteen and already constantly thinking about money  i still live at home and don't lend money because i don't wanna fucking go into debt when all my pimples haven't even disappeared yet lol   my dreams of becoming an astronaut or hockey player or whatever the fuck i soon realized were completely  unrealistic  i am but my competences and weaknesses and there will unfortunately always be too many that outperform me at every fucking thing i do  didn't choose the right subjects when you were 15 and had no clue how important it would be  sorry  you're fucked now    futhermore  with every major i'm reading on  im switching majors  i get extremely worried about the job market and how people are gonna perceive my major and job  i am sorry society  but i prefer history and english over math and psychics  people around me tell me  don't worry  but how can i not worry  every major i like gets ridiculed and i hear stories about ppl studying it and not getting a job  psychology   after you finish that you stil got nothing  x   you should just learn how to get on benefits in the mean time  also  many people here are highly educated  meaning that a bachelors that used to be considered impressive is now a requirement  i feel so much pressure to not be an embarrassment and do a prestigous major  eventhough i truly want to do something most people think is riduclous  and have a successful career  i look at my female friends who were smarter than me and do prestigous majors and feel like a failure  i long for a simpler life with less stress  honestly i am a total homebody and love cooking etc  and i despise the idea of having to go to a soulsucking 9 to 5 job with a boss that dictates me around  think i'm too pessimistic  it's just reality for many people  i will try to get a job i like and a major i like  but at the end of the day we all need to pay our bills  but all society does is tell me to suck it up and think of the people in third world countries that have it worse    the parttime jobs i've had were hell and make me pretty scared for the future  i could write about them for hours  mistreatment when you weren't your boss' bff  having to stand for 8 hours behind the cash register with less than 1 hour break  being the only one on the floor while it was busy and i had worked there for 3 months bc my boss and coworkers wanted to get lunch  being paid scraps  not being paid for more than 30 minutes everytime i worked  but 5 minutes late qnd you commited a war crime  hearing the music from the store and feeling like i was on a boat at the end of the day in bed  i cannot imagine what is must like to be poor and not be able to quit a job  at least i have something to fall back on  somewhat of a choice  some freedom  but god i cannot wait to be financially independent and god am i jealous of people like kylie jenner   i am expecting negative reactions  maybe i am somewhat of a brat  but it feels good to get ny thoughts out and felt like this subreddit won't be too judgemental ,kw19z1

1083,Did an interview for a university,i think i've exposed the fraud of the interview format  last week  a day before the capitol hill riots i basically predicted something like this would happen when asked about my own research  i really despise interviews as i find myself always inadvertently saying something that will upset them  for example i asked where they saw the department going with online teaching in light of covid and their course development in general outside of that context  they immediately took me up as saying i just wanted to teach online  i clarified that wasn't the entire content of my question  that i also meant in general but nope  in one ear and out the other    anyway at no point did they tell me anything about the position  just asked me questions about how i would teach and my research projects  when i mentioned that my future research project explores the limitations of neoliberal policy and its corrosive effects on civic institutions leading to collapse  i could see the micro winces on their faces  academic departments really have been defanged   for 12 years i have been applying for positions in vfx or academia that would lead to some semblance of security and career progression  i never get them  maybe it's because i may be partially autistic  not diagnosed but i have trouble relating to people  maybe it's because i'm not intelligent enough to think on my feet when posed with an unexpected question or maybe i'm just not good enough overall i mean i was interviewed twice by the same vfx studio and never got work with them    however i think it reveals something  namely that the interview format is a lie  they say they want the  creme de la creme  but they usually have someone already picked  which i think was the case in this instance  or it devolves into a high school popularity contest where you get to join their clique  the majority of adults are mostly babies in their behaviour  i found the experience humiliating  they were aloof and rude  given 12 years of failure which has condemned me to future economic poverty  i'm walking away from this shell game  i refuse to participate in something so rigged as i have nothing to lose  it's already over ,kvrb0q

1104,"Now, even WFH has me feeling done with the whole thing", tldr  i had already been antiwork until i got a  temporary position in my field from home--which has been awesome  i may have fucked up and cost me the chance to stay employed and i'm back to being glum about everything again    i've been a member of this sub for awhile  and i guess i just need to vent to some who would understand where i'm at right now   i recently rejoined the workforce after having a kid  feeling ambivalent about the state of my career and then ultimately the pandemic had kept me away for a total of 2 and a half years   then out of the blue i got kind of lucky and stumbled on to this opportunity to do something in my really specialized field remotely and completely online--which i had considered rare to impossible to find  the only caveat is that they were recruiting only temporarily for seasonal help as their volume would greatly increase over the holidays  they couldn't guarantee any opportunity to stay working with them after the first of the year  but also asked if i was looking for something long term  so it seemed like a possibility  they are also giving us seasonals a sprinkling of work right now even though it's after the 1st--keeping us dangling on in hope  of course the 2 dozen or so others that were recruited withme are just as hungry as me to get this opportunity and i can tell that they all see this like i do--a rare find and something to fight for the chance to keep   them hiring me got me really motivated to work again and figured i would do my damndest to stand out and show that i was worthy of a permanent position  also  working from home is amazing  compared to the last decade or so in my field  it's a freaking cake walk  i had always needed to be on site for years and my past jobs had been physically  mentally and emotionally demanding  usually fast paced with a good amount of stress  no work   life balance    again  this online job has been an absolute breeze and a breath of fresh air  it doesn't pay quite as much as i had made before but in these times  i wasn't going to complain too much   20 an hour is something i know a lot of people wish they had  it's using my defined skill set without the crappy face to face interactions with customers  co workers or management  no being told to smile  no having to worry about having a certain type clothes to wear to work  no long commute with transportation delays fucking up your arrival time  you get the picture  it really opened my eyes to the nature of work itself and firmed my belief that we have been whoring ourselves and our precious time out for corporations' benefit  for a measly income good enough to just live for working   so here i am doing the most bang up job i can possibly do and hoping i stand out when i made a fatal mistake today  last night as i was signing off from a shift i briefly checked my schedule to verify my in time today and saw that it was 1-6 pm  cool  shut my laptop and headed to bed  well i'm an idiot because i had actually glanced at next week's schedule instead not realizing  i was really supposed to work from 8am to 1pm today and didn't realize it until an hour or two into working when i wanted to check my break schedule    i think the new schedule for the following week had just come out and the last time i accessed the app i was checking that and when i reopened to check my schedule i didn't take careful note of the week or actual date i was viewing  stupid mistake i know but given everything going on these past few days maybe my mind has been a little distracted  whatever not here to excuse my momentary stupidity    what really bothers me though is how much i fear what comes next for me now  i've been feeling physically sick about it all day and almost shaking  how stupid is that  sure they could overlook this one infraction but i am not even fully employed there    they keep talking about how they are in the process of  making decisions  about their staffing needs for 2021 this could be a deciding factor in whether they decide to keep me among their permanent staff  i could have ruined my chance with this one stupid mistake  seems dramatic i know but that's a potential reality   perhaps i'm just carrying over a little residual emotion  from when my previous job a couple of years ago terminated my employment right when i was about to go on maternity leave for some stupid technicality and it completely traumatized me  the termination caused me to lose my stored vacation pay and disability pay i was going to use to cover living expenses during maternity leave and it completely screwed me  i had to take out cobra insurance and i was super stressed about the whole thing i ended up getting induced early because my blood pressure was high from the stress of being fired    now i'm just sitting here today sick to my stomach about looking at my schedule wrong  i feel like i'm back in that place i was 2 years ago feeling the absolute terror of being jobless again    i decided to be forthcoming about it as soon as i realized i was working the wrong shift and immediately messaged my lead person on microsoft teams to tell them i screwed up  no one had even seemed to notice that i showed up 5 hours late when i made my sign on greeting--maybe i could have just kept working acting none the wiser and maybe no one would have even noticed on their end  but i felt that was way more risky and could get construed as me being sneaky so i told on myself lol  i even said that i wouldn't mind staying on to 6pm to take clients like i had originally thought i was scheduled  the lead was very matter of fact that we were just too slow to have extra people on and that i needed to clock out   if this is it for me with this company at least i can say i have my integrity and i didn't try to hide my mistake  but again  why am i beating myself up so much about this one mistake  it doesn't define me as a professional  people do shit like this all the time  send the wrong email  show up to the wrong day for a meeting  send out a false nuclear missile warning to an entire island of people causing a major shit storm  people make mistakes and this wasn't some huge thing that screwed the whole company over  i can't believe how physically ill this has made me all day  i can't even get up the nerve yet to write an apology email to my manager  i will leave that for the morning with a fresh cup of coffee   anyway way too long of a rant i know  but if anyone reads through it and gets me  then it makes me feel a little better ,ku6luv

1142,"I loved not working during the pandemic, but I feel guilty af for several reasons.",2015 - 2019 - completed my arts degree  mid 2019 - mid 2020 - my gap year  ruined by coronavirus   ever since i finished my degree  i had no clue what to do  i looked for jobs related to my degree but i wasn't interested  i loved doing my degree but it had no real prospects  anyway  i worked hard in two retail jobs  i genuinely gave my all in those ungrateful places  i wanted to save as much as i can for a trip somewhere in 2020  i had told my parents  who were hellbent on me getting a proper job and securing my future  that the gap year will allow me to think about what i really wanted to do  before the pandemic hit  during my gap year  i considered 2 different courses  but i didn't end up continuing either of them   then the pandemic hit and the lockdown came into force when i was 3 4 into my gap year   my parents pressured me to leave main job as it was dangerous  side job closed due to the pandemic  i had enough cash to spare to survive months  i really enjoyed being at home  waking up when i wanted  watching so much tv  doing my hobbies  listening to music etc  at times my mental health was bad but overall i really liked it   anyway  by mid 2020 my gap year ended  if everything had gone to plan i would have solidified on a course to pursue after my trip  in reality  i still hadn't found anything to do  the lockdown was still in place and the world - a mess  i also lost my side job who let me go after reopening  my parents were still asking me every week if i found anything  i kept saying i'm looking  i researched for several weeks before i found something  it was just an okay course  it was a bit boring in fact  but the job that i could get at the end  pays alright so i decided to go for it  it's a self-paced course that takes most students 9 months however you have 2 years to finish it and i would receive tutor advice for 2 years  i aimed to complete it in 9 months  lol   it has now been 6 months and i've barely halfway through 1 8 modules   i have been procrastinating and i feel like shit  i've been watching so much stuff  just chilling out  that i didn't want to do any work  my parents regularly ask for updates and i say i'm progressing well  i wasn't  and lie which module i was on  it's come to the point now where they think i'm halfway through the course  now   thinking back  i liked working at my two jobs because i was there to achieve a goal  make money for the trip  and i dreading dealing with customers and just being there  i realised i didn't really like working  it was just something to do i guess  i just want to sit at home  chill and exist  but since i signed up to this course  i've just felt so guilty about all this shit  the lying to my parents to keep them happy  i feel lazy and stupid for feeling this way  i feel as if i'm insulting those out there putting themselves on the lives for us etc ,kt9fru
1143,[Advice] How do I convince a close friend to work less? Is that morally okay for me to do?,let me know if i should post this elsewhere  i'm leaving out a lot of details for privacy  but here's the gist   both me and my friend have mental problems and suffer from general fatigue and low energy  despite this  he seems to be constantly working on something  he's in school taking some advanced science course in hopes of getting a dream job in the future  he's also keeping up a job way below minimum wage for his state  he gets mountains of homework and seems to be doing it continuously  even during winter break and even while at work  me and another friend wanna hang out with him but he generally tries to do homework at the same time as hanging out  he drinks lots of caffeine and has prexisting problems with caffeine addiction and overdose   understandably this is bad for his mental health  less importantly  it's sad to see him working constantly even when he's supposed to be taking breaks  but despite me asking him repeatedly  he doesn't want to stop or even attempt to streamline or reprioritise  he's determined to keep working hard for perhaps ten  years to get this dream job  i don't want to tell him to abandon his dreams  but i also deeply care for this person and i feel useless just watching him work himself to death  he vents about the stress frequently  the stress is causing him to have muscle tension problems that require medicine to cope with    his mother isn't a great help as she encourages this workaholic behaviour  his dad is also a typical narcissistic dogshit money hoarder manager who lives in another state makes  300k  a year  which he doesn't give a cent of to his wife or son   is this a lost cause  or are there methods that i could try  this feels morally questionable ,kv3sun

1146,Why does my work environment suddenly feel better just before I plan to leave?,this happened to me thrice  whenever i'm in my last few months of work  before moving over to a new job  then suddenly the workplace that i hated becomes calm  easy going  it makes me doubt moving ahead   on 2 different occasions  i left a job for a better position  more experience  and in this case now  better pay  i enjoy the work i do  but my company abuses me by overloading me with work  2 years now  and underpaying me  we've had numerous discussions regarding pay and it's always empty promises    i have now decided to switch careers  higher pay  less hours  also a field i think i would enjoy  however  suddenly my current job situation seems better  manager is suddenly starting to make  empty  promises again and trying to encourage me to stay  talking of all the opportunities  workload seems lighter  maybe its in my mind    i think he gets the feeling that i'm thinking of moving on  and is trying to talk me into staying before i make decisions    have you guys ever experienced this  its like being in a toxic relationship  and when you finally decide you want to leave  things are suddenly calm and makes you question why you're leaving in the first place  but then you also know that the same shit will just continue happening if you stay  overworked   underpaid   empty promises ,kv2jnh

1217,"For those spreading around ""learn to code"", be very careful.",for about half of 2020  i was spending some time studying web development in the hopes of a better life  i ended up leaving partly due to a developing disinterest in the field and my own ineptitude  but there was another reason  the work culture seemed extremely toxic  i was using a free online resource called the odin project  the curriculum is excellent and is maintained quite well by a passionate volunteer community  the issue is  the community  elitism seems to be the norm in this field  as you can see in places like r cscareerquestions  and that was no exception for this community    i was in the discord for it for the longest time  and i went to them for help with various things like setting up linux dual boot  understanding some quirks of javascript  etc  and they were good there  but whenever you started a conversation about working in the field  that's when it got concerning    there was a time when this guy got his first job in the field and he was excited  he mentioned that it paid pretty low comparatively  about  31k a year  but he wasn't complaining because it was his first one and that salary was enough for him in his situation  instead of being happy for him  some of the people who work in the field started belittling him for settling so badly  saying he should have negotiated harder  saying that working for such a low salary is going to screw himself in the future because other employers will think he was paid low because he wasn't a good worker  etc    i defended this guy  saying that i personally would be ecstatic to make  31k a year because that's double what i make now  i mean shit i could probably live on that for life since i don't want to have kids  it ended up started an entire debate about how they said that you should see more worth in yourself  where i responded  why does one's salary judge your worth  how does he even know how much he's worth as an employee if he's never worked in the field before  and they responded  you studying the subject and making projects shows your worth  short selling yourself for such a low salary is damaging because you need to see that you are worth more than that   idk  it came across as extremely  better than thou  coming from somebody who claims to make six figures after 2 years in the industry  i know this is just one instance but i warn all of you to be cautious  it seems that programmers are extremely judgmental over things like that  i didn't even scratch the surface of how they got judgmental with me over not being as  passionate  about it as they were  i literally was just studying this because i could get a job without going to college  the subject bored me a fuckton ,kt6j0j

1260,Finally got fired and wanted to share how I exploited my employer, hey all  most people think i m a bum for my actions  but i think i m pretty cool with how i treated my most recent job  i hope you feel the same     i got to my most recent job in 2018  and a month into the job they flew me out to california for a week for some conference  i had a fun time with some people there and saw california for the first time  i miss walking to in-n-out and getting a milkshake every couple of nights  a few months later i went on vacation to japan and singapore for 3 weeks  and i still received paychecks during those weeks lol  it had been a dream of mine to visit those countries and i did so on company dime     i got back from the trips and it was time to work  my work had me going to cities and looking at buildings  after i finished my work for the day i would usually chill in the city i was at or hangout with friends if they were near  fast forward to march and quarantine hit  so i started working from home  i worked from home for a few weeks before i was furloughed  i took this as time to focus on myself and get back into some hobbies     trading and investing have been hobbies of mine since high school but i never had the time to fully put some time into it  i finally started a roth ira in april and it s up to  23k now  i learned a lot about trading and such and designed a trading model that has given me my weekly salary  or more  from options consistently for a few months  in may i was off furloughed and set to return again  i slacked off completely from may to just now lol  i would go to the supermarket with my family  play video games  trade  build lego  continue learning japanese  and study python  all on company dime     a typical  work day  for me would be 9-5 if i cared about the job  but i woke up at 9 25 to see how the stock market was doing  trade for a bit  and then nap from 10 to 11  i would work on my interests and eat from 11 to 3pm  and then i would work for an hour or two before going to the gym  i eventually built some cool programs that would go on my resume  and i made a twitter account for my trading that has paid me already and i hope to make it an actual company one day     earlier in the week i was skipping work and went to do some errands  i was at the doctor s office and my manager called me to say i was fired  my reaction showed that i didn t care at all and i was so proud of myself  in the time that i was focused on myself while i had this job i found out how to get paid a good living while doing things that are actually interesting to me  i hated that job and what i was forced to do  i cried driving one time when i had to drive 10 hours in a day twice in one week  no more will i do things i don't like  i m currently looking for a job with programming or stocks that ll actually interest me  and using my options model to help pay bills while i find a job  until then  i hope you can all find my story interesting  i really exploited my employer  and i hope a lot of you do the same in the future ,kswo9l

1264,Failing my first semester of university. Don't know what to do.,i'm in the uk  19-years old  first year in uni   before the lockdown started in march  i was in my last year of sixth form  i was severely depressed for two years prior  but would numb myself because i've never been able to open up to anyone about my feelings  i never handed in any assignments in my final year  used to fake sick to stay home  would cry in the bathroom at school  always had my earphones in underneath a beanie during my classes because i needed stimulation    i never wanted to go to university  my parents forced me into my course  i started the semester in september  and haven't had any motivation to attend a single online class  i've skipped since september  haven't handed in any assignments so i have 0s  i haven't done any homework  quizzes or lab work  i have a big project due in 14 days worth 70  of my grade  and an oral exam due in two-days  also worth 70  of my grade  i'm fucked for both units because i've done jackshit since september    on top of that i haven't even told my parents that i'm failing  i've just been lying to them  telling them that i'm up-to-date with my assignments  and studying even though i'm using video games and entertainment to escape my life because those are the only things that keep me sane  i'm suicidal without a plan  and unable to do anything because i have zero motivation    it's not laziness  this affects every aspect of my life  i'm not even able to do the things that i want to do  i just don't see the future consequences of my inaction  i used to be able to get through sixth form and secondary school with pressure from deadlines  but depression has killed that  i feel nothing when deadlines pass now   i believe that i'm struggling with adhd-c  autism  depression and anxiety  my anxiety is crippling  i have asian parents who don't understand mental illness  so i have no clue how to explain adhd  autism  depression and anxiety to them without them just assuming that i'm lazy because i play video games instead of studying when one thing is clearly more fun than the other  i feel guilty for wasting  9 000  and because i've not received any diagnosis and i'm not on any form of medication i don't know what to do  especially because i live in a tier-4 area and i'm in lockdown   i never wanted to go to university in the first place  i have zero interest in my course and i'm so far behind  i wouldn't mind working a dead-end job for minimum wage and working on my dreams even though i have zero work experience  however  that isn't realistic in this shit world that requires you to be a robot just to survive    i'm an infp btw  don't know if you really care  i hate the entire concept of working and school  and i really don't understand how people are motivated by it and actually enjoy it  i wouldn't mind working  but the whole concept of work and school makes me want to kill myself    i have dreams of being a youtuber or singer  but those are unrealistic pipe dreams  so i see no other option other than killing myself  i don't have a plan to  just telling myself that gives me peace    i'm sure that i don't have a neurotypical brain  and it sucks that we're in a global pandemic right now  i don't know if my parents would let me drop out since they're paying for it  or if they would let me take a gap year so i can sort myself out mentally    i'm scared to open up about my mental struggles and how i've done nothing all semester  i don't know how to tell them   what should i do here   sorry for the long read  the semester ends on the 15th by the way ,kre41u

1280,"I dont have an aversion to labor itself, but I cannot work under a capitalist or as a capitalist (nor am I a leftist, at least not one who believes in industrialism)",when i say i am not a leftist  i mean the modern industrial leftist  i like values that are grouped with leftism under our modern political discourse which is based on the industrial revolution  such as 'from each according to his ability  to each according to his need'    i can labor and genuinely enjoy it when i am laboring for myself and my small community  i enjoy growing food  chopping wood  tending to my chickens  and even building my cabin that i am in the process of building  i love it  and all of this is extremely rewarding  however  every time i've ever had a 'regular job' in a waged or salaried position at a corporation or any job of the sorts within the system where i am a mere cog in a gigantic machine performing incredibly alienating and specialized labor and then having the majority of the value that my labor produces extracted from me  i get extremely suicidal after a matter of weeks    i do not care about money  and i do not wish to have an income so i can buy things  im very privileged to own land and already have the money to pay property tax on it for the rest of my life  so i will not have to work for another man again  if i do make money  it will be through the occasional freelance film or photography  but i will not be dependant on it to avoid homelessness and starvation    if you are looking for a way out of this soul crushing rat race  i highly urge you to consider homesteading  i know land acquisition is a dire situation for young people  but if you want to avoid being a slave for the rest of your life  then grow your own food on your own land and produce everything you need off the grid  even if you have an aversion to 'rural' living  as i used to have  i promise you that this lifestyle is as fulfilling as it gets in our modern world for people who have a deep need for dignity and autonomy  if you will never be able to purchase land  consider joining a commune somewhere    i wish the best to all of you ,ks1lli

1282,[Rant] Took the job listing offline before the deadline,so i've been at my soul-sucking job for over 4 years now and through a friend  i finally came across a job listing for a position that actually excited me  i'd be applying for a job with an actual benefit to society and it would even pay better than the job i have now   of course  i still have to go through the motions of investing my own time into drafting a letter to explain why they should give the job to me  showcasing that i stand out from all the other applicants like i'm in a fucking talent show in which the winner gets to work to ensure rent payments  but that's fine  this is one of the few times that i'm actually excited about a listing  so i suck it up and start spending a couple of hours on that letter  choosing my words carefully and musing on what i need to put in there to make sure they understand how suited i would be for the position    the deadline for the application was the 14th  i was working on my letter when i pull up the website to check the listing  just to make sure that my highlighted competencies correspond to the demands in the listing and it's  closed  they just fucking closed the listing  no explanation  it just says 'closed'   i've now invested hours of my own time on something that is instantly completely irrelevant because of this bullshit system in which a worker has to invest their own time and resources to show an employer that they are worthy of providing value to them and the realization's just hit me hard   fuck this fucking entrepreneur of the self bullshit ,ksoblx

1285,Most people who work aren't contributing anything necessary or even useful to society.,anything involving selling or money isn't required by nature  which is the majority of jobs  all of the following types of people are contributing the same amount to society as a person who does nothing  salespersons  cashiers  customer service reps  order fillers  accountants  auditing clerks  bankers  insurance reps  sales reps  sales supervisors  auditors  tellers  financial managers  bill collectors  landlords  sales managers  telemarketers  loan officers  purchasing agents  claims adjusters  market researchers and stock trader  these are all man made jobs that are again  not required by nature to form a functioning society    you could also throw anyone who works in the entertainment business as doing something that isn't required  i'm not saying we shouldn't produce entertainment  just saying it's for fun  not because it's required by nature  as long as we're giving people lives for doing things that aren't required by nature  i'm completely comfortable doing nothing for society like them ,krhxxd
1286,Asked for a raise recently [rant],i ve been working at the same job on and off for about three years  when i come home from college for winter or summer break  i m put back on the schedule to make a little extra cash between semesters  i m a trusted  valued employee and my boss often reminds me of as much  and i am one of four out of twelve employees at this location trusted with a store key despite the fact that i only work there for a month to three at a time    for brief backstory  the coffee shop i work at is very understaffed  where we used to be open until 9 pm  we re now only open until 7 pm and  before i came back  hours were reduced to being open until 1 pm with a staff of just four people  the management of the coffee shop is  in my opinion  sloppy and  in the states opinion  illegal    among many other past offenses  my boss has forbidden us from discussing our wages  illegal  discouraged us from taking breaks  illegal  by telling us that  oh  we just don t take breaks here  and only scheduling two baristas for any given shift so we can t leave the store without abandoning the other  and disallowed us from sitting in the cafe area while not providing any seating in the back and disciplining us when she finds us sitting on the tables or floor in the kitchen where the customers can t see us during our eight hour shifts  probably illegal   when i came back in the beginning of december  i immediately knew someone had reported her behavior  within the first fifteen minutes of my first shift back  my boss informed me that we are required to take our  federally mandated  breaks because she  had no idea you guys weren t taking breaks  and  suddenly  enough people were scheduled for us to do so  because of covid  our cafe is closed and she said that the couches were treated as a place to sit when we weren t working  everything seemed a lot better    maybe it s the rise of communist ideologies in my brain or my general discontent with capitalism  but i quickly realized that i was being asked to do  much  more work than i was being compensated for  on top of me training the mostly new staff on tasks they should have learned during their actual training with our boss  i was given the title of senior barista  making me responsible for my and the other employees side work being completed while i was on shift and locking up and opening the store when i worked   i know being a barista is a relatively cushy job  but i get paid minimum wage  7 25 hour in my state  and my back has been in constant pain for a month straight from standing all day  in addition  our boss told other employees that business has never been better because the starbucks near us has shut down for a quarantine period  i also am often closing  because other baristas have time commitments at night  where i walk away with  5- 10 in tips as opposed to the morning shift s  30- 40    so  about a week ago i asked my boss for a raise  my boss  we ll call her sarah  owns the franchise location i work at of a small chain of coffee shops  the following is basically how the conversation went with me having memorized the first thing i said to reduce my anxiety about talking to her about it    me  i ve been thinking a lot lately about my worth to company  and between being a senior barista  training new employees  functioning as a manager when you re not in the store  i my labor is worth more than i m being paid  last night  i closed the store alone and not only was it done well  i completed it earlier than most other employees could  while i have no issue with the fact that i closed the store alone  the fact that i did and that you trusted me to do so shows how valuable my labor is to company  these are just a few of the reasons that  after three years of hard work  i am asking for a raise to reflect this    sarah  i agree that your labor is valuable to company  and i appreciate everything you do  but we just don t have a structure set up for giving raises  when we formally establish a title that comes with a raise  we can talk    me  i thought that was the function of senior barista  to show that we re the more experienced team members who have more responsibility    sarah  well  we ve also had issues in the past of some employees getting paid more than others and discussing that  leading to employees asking for a raise and quitting when i tell them they don t work hard well enough to play one     i started to get what she was saying and played along   me  i don t plan on discussing my wage with other employees    sarah  well  i know you would t do something like that and of course i would never ask that of you  haha  but so close to the holidays is such a stressful time for me and my family and i m sure understand    me  i understand that you re busy  but i ve put in a lot of hard work for company and i think you know i would only talk to you about this if it was something i really believed in    sarah  well  how about we talk about it the next time you come back  i m sure we ll have something figured out by then   i had already told her i most likely wouldn t be returning because i ll be graduating from college soon   so  i took the hint  thanked her for her time  and hung up  recently  one of my coworkers who worked at a franchise location owned by someone different told me that at their old store  the title of senior barista always comes with a  1 hour raise    so  now i don t really know what to do  i ve been trying to discipline myself into only doing minimum wage level work  but that just fucks over my coworkers who are also making minimum wage  i guess i m just frustrated and wanted to rant to likeminded people  idk,kre943
1287,How to build a voluntary safety net,i'll be upfront and say i don't believe in the inherent goodness of people - if a voluntary safety net was created  it would largely attract those who are looking to do as little as possible  amp  have more potential takers than givers    i think it would be a good idea to give   to people who are stuck in a bad system  like minimum wage in america that doesn't pay enough to live  so they could get a basic qualification  amp  climb up the ladder a few rungs  i live in australia so we already have a decent safety net  if people want to rise through effort they can do it  but in third world countries  amp  america it seems like people at the bottom are trapped    even with democracy there's no party that wants to fix a broken system so being politically active seems like a waste of time  that's why solutions like a voluntary safety net that bypasses government seem attractive - but it has to be designed in a way that works with human nature  if it was just something like everyone working contributes 10  of their income  amp  this is split between those who currently don't have jobs  this scheme would be finished within a couple of months  mostly due to freeloaders wrecking it for everyone else  those people who had no intention of ever getting work  so if you had a voluntary safety net it would have to exclude those who only wanted to take  amp  not give - it would have to be exclusive  and there are some people who aren't freeloaders but have disabilities  amp  are just not able to work - would anyone be happy to support them if they weren't family  i'd like to say yes but they'd have to make up a small   of the network else again people wouldn't want to join    one idea for a network is that to join everyone puts in 5  of their annual income to start with - this will attract those who aren't living a hand to mouth existence  those who are in a position to contribute  then people who are currently trapped but can see a way out of it can make their case to the network for   to improve their lives  the network votes on how to divvy the cash  if the person given the   successfully pulls themself out of poverty then they are given an invitation to join the network  amp  are expected to contribute a portion of their salary  if members get into financial strife they will have priority over non network members - but all money will be allocated by voting  but eventually the voting could be replaced via a computer algorithm  members could also vote on how much to donate to those with disabilities   the thing i don't like about the above is how complicated it is  if you were to design a voluntary safety net  how would you do it ,krem1d

1314,"Is anti-work just a sub for venting? If not, what do you think the logical conclusion of anti-work will be?",on the one hand  i completely sympathize with people who dream of a life without work  i work 70hrs week  6 days a week  at 2 jobs myself   on the other hand  i think anti-work people are only thinking of themselves and what they really want is for me  amp  other blue collar workers to start working 140hrs week so they don't have to work at all   personally  i think having a job is psychologically important  what is bad is our current work system  i think rather than anti-work  we should be  pro-fair work  less hours  more pay  more vacation  etc   i've thought about this a lot and i truly cannot see any long term positive outcome to anti-work   taken to it's extreme logical conclusion  we are all replaced with robots and virtually no one works and we all survive on a ubi  some people still need to work though  would we accept robot teachers  doctors  psychiatrists   what about the military  you can't use robots in the military because the parts required to build a robot could come from regions we are at war with  if we wanted to start building more robots here  we would need to force people to work again to at least get new factories  amp  mines set up for production  these factories still need a human to look over it  amp  repair the robots too  very few people will join the military if there is no money college incentive  so soldiers would need to be paid  very  well  you will end up with a corrupt militarized country   there will still be people who own companies  and the few people that work  will all be ultra wealthy compared to the rest of us who can't work  amp  survive on ubi  this can only lead to a corrupt corporate country  the only way to fix this imbalance is for the government to control all means of production  communism  and distribute the profit evenly among its people  but some people will still need to work  they will want more than people who don't work right  very very few people will be okay working for free  so we will still end up with a higher class and a lower class and only the high class has the money to influence the direction of the country   additionally  communism sounds bad in general  some people like expensive things or traveling and if they want to work their butts off to get it  that's fair but in an anti-work society  that will be impossible  the available jobs will be so few  amp  will be highly specialized   everyone on ubi will only be able to afford the exact same things  ubi would probably only cover basic necessities as well   if ubi were to include spending money for recreation  how much do you think it would be  how much would you want  do you think what you want is reasonable realistic ,krysxt

for the holidays          were you tempted to go abroad  did you visit europe  did you riot  in all the abandonment of a wage slave let loose  among the pleasure haunts of the world   perhaps you went to the riviera  perhaps you luxuriated in ecstatic worship of that glorious bit of nature s handiwork where the blue waters of the mediterranean roll in all their entrancing splendor against the shores of classic italy          perhaps you rambled among the vine-clad hills of sunny france  and visited the spots hallowed by the hand of that country s glorious history          perhaps you sailed up the castellated rhine  toasted the eyes of bewitching german frauleins in frothy german beer  explored the recesses of the legend haunted hartz mountains  and established a nodding acquaintance with the spirit of the brocken   perhaps you traversed the lakes and fjords of norway  sat down in awe before the neglected magnificence of the alhambra  had a cup of coffee with menelik of abyssinia  smelt afar off the odors of the streets of morocco  climbed the pyramids of egypt  shared the hospitable tent of the bedouin  visited cyprus  looked in at constantinople  ogled the dark-eyed beauties of circassia  rubbed up against the cossack in his ural mountains  or   perhaps you lay in bed all day in order to save a meal  and listened to your wife wondering how she could make ends meet with a day s pay short in the weekly wages   and whilst you thus squandered your substance in riotous living  did you ever stop to think of your master your poor  dear  overworked  tired master          did you ever stop to reflect upon the pitiable condition of that individual who so kindly provides you with employment  and does no useful work himself in order that you may get plenty of it          when you consider how hard a task it was for you to decide in what manner you should spend your holiday  where you should go for that one day  then you must perceive how hard it is for your masters to find a way in which to spend the practically perpetual holiday which you force upon them by your love for work          ah  yes  that large section of our masters who have realised that ideal of complete idleness after which all our masters strive  those men who do not work  never did work  and with the help of god and the ignorance of the people never intend to work  how terrible must be their lot in life          we  who toil from early morn till late at night  from january till december  from childhood to old age  have no care or trouble or mental anxiety to cross our mind except the landlord  the fear of loss of employment  the danger of sickness  the lack of common necessities  to say nothing of luxuries  for our children  the insolence of our superiors  the unhealthy condition of our homes  the exhausting nature of our toil  the lack of all opportunities of mental cultivation  and the ever-present question whether we shall shuffle off this mortal coil in a miserable garret  be killed by hard work  or die in the poorhouse   with these trifling exceptions we have nothing to bother us  but the boss  ah  the poor  poor boss   he has everything to bother him  whilst we are amusing ourselves in the hold of a ship shoveling coal  swinging a hammer in front of a forge  toiling up a ladder with bricks  stitching until our eyes grow dim at the board  gaily riding up and down for twelve hours per day  seven days per week  on a trolley car  riding around the city in all weather with teams or swinging by the skin of our teeth on the iron framework of a skyscraper  standing at our ease outside the printing office door listening to the musical click of the linotype as it performs the work we used to do inside  telling each other comforting stories about the new machinery which takes our places as carpenters  harness-makers  tinplate-workers  labourers  etc  in short whilst we are enjoying ourselves  free from all mental worry   our unselfish tired-out bosses are sitting at home  with their feet on the table  softly patting the bottom button of their vests   working with their brains   poor bosses  mighty brains   without our toil they would never get the education necessary to develop their brains  if we were not defrauded by their class of the fruits of our toil we could provide for education enough to develop the mental powers of all  and so deprive the ruling class of the last vestige of an excuse for clinging to mastership  viz  their assumed intellectual superiority   i say  assumed  because the greater part of the brainwork of industry today is performed by men taken from the ranks of the workers  and paid high salaries in proportion as they develop expertness as slave-drivers   as education spreads among the people the workers will want to enjoy life more  they will assert their right to the full fruits of their labour  and by that act of self-assertion lay the foundation of that socialist republic in

1407,It sucks trying to have a meaningful conversation with anyone because how deep the propaganda runs.,wealth is an illusion and it's a carrot on a stick to keep the illusion up that hard work pays off    only 7  of households are officially millionaires and even today with inflation  being a millionaire isn't anywhere near as prestigious as it was 30  years ago    most people who are  wealthy  are in reality up to debt in their eyeballs  capitalism peddles consumerism hard and people who increase their income increase their home size  number of cars or msrp of cars  clothing choices  etc  so while they make more money  they spend so much that they still don't have much money  people justify this endless keeping up with the jonse's lifestyle and binge watch shows like  keeping up with the kardashians    my sister makes probably around  100 000 per year and is constantly stating she  doesn't have much money  i make less than a quarter of that and rarely run my checking account into the red    in fact is has it's own term  it's called  lifestyle inflation    anyway to stay on topic  as people have mentioned before  the poor see themselves as temporarily embarrassed millionaires    you have a 1 in 3 000 chance of being struck by lightning in your lifetime  1 in 500 000 in one year    you statistically have a better chance of being struck by lightning this year than ever becoming a billionaire    hard work pays off is an outdated concept  sure working your ass off can bring in more money  but only to a point  jeff bezos makes  2 500 per second and i highly doubt he works 625 000 times harder than anyone else    i also think the brains limited understanding of numbers plays a role in this lie  if i were to give you  180 000 per day  not per year  but per day  since the birth of jesus  it would currently take you 76 more years on top of that to match bezos's net worth ,kq02wb

1414,Complete &amp; utter lack of respect,so i used to work at a pretty toxic company  one of the silver linings was my department head  really good bloke  went in to bat for us several times with upper management  we weren't particularly close while i worked there  but we've become good friends since i've quit   the company adopted a corporate model awhile back  amp  installed a ceo  who immediately decided to fold our department as he deemed it high risk  amp  also really did not like that we were paid so highly  the gfc hit the same time  amp  for 3 years our department carried the company  while the other departments ran at a loss  so we got to stay   last year after more than 30 years of service  the ceo sacked my old boss  essentialy for being too old  he was planning on retiring in about 3 years  he wasn't offered a redundancy package  amp  they advertised his job before sacking him  offering about 30k less a year   my friend is a bit lost  he would have averaged 60 hours a week there over his 30 year period  he had a few different surgeries when i worked there  amp  he always came back to work the same day as the surgery as work was really his life ,kpy2x1
1415,How do you cope with that horrible feeling of stagnation and routine?,i think the absolute worst part about having a stable job is that you're not really progressing towards anything anymore  this is what you're going to do for most of your days until you're old  work to survive and survive to work   i think the grind would feel better if there was some attainable goal within a few years but there isn't one  i'm all set in a career and it sucks  i don't want this ,kpuzog
1416,Not sure I’m cut out for this - Quick Rant,i actually just started a new job at a non profit a few weeks ago and have been bored to tears since i ve started  i m chalking it up the pandemic and it being slow bc of the holidays - it s not a typical desk job as i work in operations for a mental health clinic so i can do a variety of work  not sure if i m just scared because i don t know what i m doing or if i m just dreading this job already because it s taking up so much of my life   40hrs  9 30-6  i get paid a pretty decent wage and have decent benefits and finishing an undergrad degree online  apart of me wants to just leave and just focus on my college courses and find something part time again  i feel dumb for feeling this way but i absolutely hate being aware of how pointless these jobs can be  even in the non profit sector  i m just feeling scared bc if i truly feel this way  would getting a degree change much  does anyone else just wanna do their own thing - live in a monastery or a van and be done with the capitalist framework ,kq02ej

1420,"Started working a job that works everyone like slaves, and it is bullshit",i started working at a distribution center  that distributes grocceries on trucks to grocery stores    the job works like this  the supervisors give you a set amount of time to pick certain items for pallets that you are stacking your items onto  if you have 60 minutes to do it  then you have 60 minutes to reach 100 percent of the  goal  they will fire you after 1 month  if you do not reach 70 percent of production and will fire you  if you do not reach 100 percent 9 months later  but here's the thing  the times are unreasonable as fuck  i am fast walking light running the entire time on my shift  i am stacking as fast as i humanly can  i lift weights  am in good shape  and used to working physically intense jobs  but this job still kills me  i also have plenty of experience operating equipment and working fast paced my entire life  i am a very hard worker and guess what   i only got 60 percent of production this last day plus in addition to wearing a mask the entire shift  which makes it harder to breathe  if you even use the bathroom  drink your drink  or take a slight breather  it fucks your time up and you will not get anywhere near their standards  and then there are variables out of your control  such as having to wait on other pickers in the aisles getting done  waiting for forklift operators to get out of the way  having to climb to reach product which slows your time down  etc     i see people working as hard as they possibly can  and failing to meet their  production  standards  these people are damn near running their entire shifts  they are also wrecklessly operating their equipment  and they have no regard for anybody's safety in the warehouse  you have successful people  but again  they are literally slaving the entire times on their shift   i just think it's fucking bullshit osha has never come into this place and deemed it unsafe to work with the standards and the way this company is ran fuck this job ,kq2532

1428,The Hated Coworker,does anyone else have the privilege of being the  hated coworker  i am usually the one that calls out the exploitation and the wrongdoings of the companies i work for  i have no shame in complaining and confronting managers  i ll admit  i end up talking a lot of shit about the company job  my coworkers will also confide in me and voice their concerns as well  however  ther always comes a turning point where i become the  bad guy  my coworkers begin to resent me  even though they themselves have voiced dissatisfaction in regard to the company job  it usually happens when they see that i truly don t care and am not afraid to put my job on the line to defend my values  it seems like at the end of the day these people start to develop a liking for the taste of boots ,kqisrt

1431,Work hard Play hard as a life philosophy,this is one of the worst concepts invented to keep the exploitation of the masses that unfortunately so many people subscribe to gladly   i live in a culture where this concept is venerated  literally  like  it's perfectly ok to work long hours  without adequate compensation  as long as you have the promise of a fun weekend  it's perfectly ok to endure humiliation at work regularly and experience hopelessness as long as you can count and see friday coming    people spend enormous amount of money on entertainment on the weekend  which includes heavy drinking and recreational drugs among other things  this is pretty much everyone i know    the sad thing is that most people like to forget how sad and meaningless their lives are by overcompensating on the weekend  but they are not obviously aware of the problem  because it is very common to hear someone proudly say that their life philosophy is  work hard  play hard  they are oblivious to the dangers of this type of thinking and who it benefits in the end   this is of course encouraged by the capitalist system because  1  you know people are more likely to endure any form of exploitation and shit as long as they can count days and have the promise of a weekend to look forward to  and  2  the enormous spending capacity these individuals have - not because they are wealthy in most cases  but because they are willing to spend whatever they can on entertainment and making themselves feeling good  feeding into the consumption economy and the capitalists' wealth   please be aware of how delusional people who subscribe to this concept as a life philosophy are in most cases and be prepared to challenge them on their beliefs and values   what is the situation where you live  as i said  where i live this concept is literally a substitute for religion and people gladly and proudly subscribe to it  and speak about it as a way of life    i went on a date with someone who told me that their life philosophy is 'work hard play hard' and i knew immediately that we have next to nothing in common  this motivated me to think about the subject and share my thoughts    i would like to ask you to be alert whenever you hear this someone saying proudly ,kqpbbc

1442,"Unfulfilled by my cushy 9-5, what to do?",it was a happy accident that i happened to discover this sub on the eve of my first day back in the office this year  so i thought i'd get some feedback from you all on my situation   i work an office job in it that pays well  has decent benefits  my co-workers are great  and my boss treats me well  good work-life balance  i e  no contact on my free time  never any questions if i ask for time off or a sick day  and my boss genuinely seems to care about my well-being  most people would be grateful to have this job  which makes me feel guilty  but it simply isn't cutting it for me   despite being a near  slam dunk  for me  i dread going into work each day because i find it so unfulfilling  i'm so unmotivated that i have to make a very conscious effort to be productive or else i'll spend my days browsing the web or chatting with co-workers on our corporate chat application  and fear having my boss ask me what i did that day only for me to have to lie or stretch the truth   it's getting so bad that i've even begun taking sick days just to get a day off   i would look for other work since i'm clearly unhappy  but i have a mortgage and bills to pay that were all undertaken under the assumption i'd be making the salary i do now  so i feel kind of handcuffed to this job   outside of work i enjoy watching movies  playing video games  playing and listening to music  and reading  i've considered starting streaming on twitch in my free time to see if i can get that to take off  a lofty goal  i know  but it's the only thing i can think of doing for  work  that i'd actually enjoy   has anyone here been in a similar situation  what did you do   thanks for the vent ,kq5n0v

1446,I hate how companies have the right to drug test and revoke an offer/fire you because of it,trying to find work is stressful as hell and of course god forbid you smoke weed to relax and unwind after a day of stressing about finding a job  i guess this isn't necessarily anti-work but more anti-work culture   it just annoys the hell out of me that a company can choose to drug test me for weed  it's none of their damn business what i do in my free time  now if you show up stoned and can't do your job properly  that's one thing  but seriously you're gonna make me pee in a cup just to make sure i haven't smoked a joint in the past 3 weeks  fuck off ,kqr39y
1447,I HATE begging for jobs!,i'm currently a student but my mother is pressuring me into finding a job as well because i have a lot of  free  time  read  time without  scheduled  work  and because she thinks this would leave a gap in my cv  even though i'm studying   well  either way  i could deal with that if i just had a job  but i  hate  having to beg for it  if i could just shotgun-spread applications  it wouldn't be so bad  but for every shitty  low-level entry job  remember  i'm looking for a  student job  not a leading ceo position  i have to fucking sell myself  write customized cover motivational letters  and all for a job that thousands of others are applying for too  so it's always in vain  i'm struggling with anxiety and depression  so my energy budget is limited  and i'm wasting it all on writing letters to  beg  for jobs  in any  sane  system  if you want help from someone  you ask them  but the job market is so utterly broken  you have to ask people on your knees to do work for them  it's so completely insane and yet  i seem to be the only person in my social environment that sees anything wrong with it  like everyone else sees something else than i do  because how else could an intelligent  sane person look at this and be like  of course you should beg humbly to be exploited as a wage slave  that's only fair   i'm sorry for the rant-y wall of text  but this insanity is driving me  well  insane and i don't know what to do anymore  just the thought of soon having to do this nonsense to be allowed to live i'd rather off myself because i'm apparently not allowed to live anyway unless i sacrifice all my energy for a job i don't want to do ,kpqeel
1448,i want to do NOTHING with my life,today i made the startling realization that i don t have to do anything with my life  every time i m asked  where do you see yourself in five years  or  what do you wanna do  i ve always stressed about not having an answer  about not having a career path i want to go down  there s never been any particular thing i wanted  and night after night i stay up and wonder what i m doing with my life  what purpose do i have  and finally i ve found the answer  nothing  conservative upbringing and capitalist society has tried to tell me my entire life that i must be productive  that i must contribute to the global domestic product  or i am a leech on society and don t deserve food  i don t owe anyone anything  i want to do nothing   i wanted to share this realization  to let others know that it s okay to just do fucking nothing  if you don t have longterm goals  can t decide a path for your life  that is o-fuckin-kay  when someone asks you   what do you wanna do with your life  it is perfectly okay and sensible to answer   nothing ,kqrntm

1453,I think I see a way out... thoughts?,this sucks - you know it  i know it  and perhaps many around us do too   we can wait for a top-down change from the government or big businesses or whoever  but i don't think it's likely  the system is working as planned   happiness  does not factor into their bottom line   i think it's going to start at the bottom  houses are expensive for one or two people to buy  so how about 4 people who share it and co-habitate  businesses are hard to work for -- but less so if it's your own project and working for yourself  what about you and the people you live with working together  labor  profits  etc can be shared with people you know on fairer terms than what the current system can bring us   family is tough  i need to go back and ask for help  friends too  who are looking for something better and more sustainable   i dont think anyone's coming to help  it's gonna start with us ,kqmmwv
1454,"I wrote something to try and describe my feelings about being a part of the rat race. I have no idea what more I want to do with it, or what I want it all to mean. But I'd like to hear what you think.", every normal man must be tempted  at times  to spit upon his hands  hoist the black flag  and begin slitting throats   --hl mencken   helen keller once said  not everything that can be counted  counts  and not everything that counts can be counted  this is where we live our lives  in the immeasurable yet inexorably definable states of our being  our emotions live and die in ways that are immensely consequential but entirely immeasurable  as an addict  i ve come to believe that the inside of our heads ought to be treated like a bad neighborhood  never go alone  and never go at night  that having been said  perhaps you won t mind accompanying me   plato says only the dead have seen the end of war  and jesus says blessed are the peacemakers  pahluniak said that it s hard to forget pain  but even harder to remember sweetness  we have no scar to show for happiness  we learn so little from peace  hubbard says if you take life too seriously you ll never get out alive  and elmo says if you re happy and you know it you should clap your hands   they don t say what you should do when someone stops loving you  or if you ve stopped loving them  and they don t say what love is or means  i m beginning to think they don t know     they don t teach you how to mend a broken ego  or nurture an emotional bruise  they teach you how to measure  but they don t teach you the distance between two people in bed when one of them wants to be someplace else  and they definitely don t teach you how to stitch the massive  gaping hole we all carry around day in and day out  pretending we re ok  i suspect much of that has to do with the fact that we are not  in actuality  ok at all  to quote al pacino s character in scent of a woman   there is nothing like the sight of an amputated spirit  there is no prosthetic for that    the purpose of all this isn t to fill in those gaps  i couldn t if i tried  but the simple fact it is that damn near everything that matters defies description    we are  jack s complete lack of surprise  just as much as we re the  all singing  all dancing crap of the world  and we are one  and we are love  and we are spartacus   what we re not  generally speaking  is satisfied   i once heard a common story called  the mayonnaise jar and the cup of coffee  it goes like this     a professor stood before his class  and produced a large mayonnaise jar  he proceeded to fill it with golf balls  he then asked the class if the jar was full   yes  it is  answered the class   so you don t think i can get anything else in this jar  the professor asked  he then produced a small bag of pebbles  he emptied it into the jar  the pebbles rolled around and filled the spaces between the golf balls  he then asked the class if the jar was full  they again answered   yes  then the professor brought out a bag of sand  he poured it into the jar  it filled in all the spaces between the golf balls and the pebbles  the class laughed  he asked them if the jar was full  they weren t sure  but they mostly agreed that it was  then the professor pulled out 2 mugs of coffee  and poured them into the jar    this jar represents your life  the professor said   and the golf balls represent the important things in life  your family  your friends  your passions  your faith  things that  if everything else was gone and only they remained  your life would still be full  the pebbles are the other  slightly less important things  your job  your car  your portfolio  the sand is everything else    if we put the sand into the jar first  we have no room for the golf balls  likewise with the pebbles  our lives are like this  if we fill it with things that have less meaning  we will find we run out of space for the things that truly matter    a student raised their hand and asked  but what about the coffee  the professor smiled and replied   i m glad you asked  it just goes to show that no matter how full your life may seem  there s always room for a cup of coffee with a friend   as i type this  i m sitting in my office  i should be working   should be working  is not an uncommon state to find myself in whilst in my office  why do i do this  it s not that i dislike my employer  hardly  in fact  they re the best employer i ve ever worked for  they re kind  generous  and fair  they take care of and respect their employees in ways many workers crave  i m lucky to be here   and yet this job does not define me even a little  to say that i want more out of life than to manage operations and finance for 40 hours a week is an understatement to say the least  so why do we do this  is capitalism a lie  should we all just become migrant hippies  obviously the answer to many of these questions revolves around our relatively consistent need for food and shelter  but doesn t that then just leave us living our lives in the cracks between the golf balls  are we living at an impasse in culture  one where we re sophisticated enough to reject the cogs of the machine and demand fulfillment  yet chained to our fleshy prisons that demand the fruits of labor   i once asked my brother-in-law  a man whom i admire greatly  how he could stand to work a job that  from my perspective  was the epitome of desk surfing  not that my job is any less mundane  his reply was simple   i have your sister  and i have our daughter  everything i do is a means to provide for them and be happy and comfortable with them  his sincerity and affection brought tears to my eyes  it still does  when i think about it  i tear up like that a lot  mostly when i dwell on things like that  i think that s natural  a lot of people probably do  maybe it s because we re sad that so many things that matter so much only end up existing with any real regularity in our thoughts  but i digress   the lesson from my brother-in-law is simple  we simply must determine what makes us tick  or we will live the lives of quiet desperation that the masses of men are said to lead  but even my wise brother-in-law is spending at least 40 hours a week performing a means to an end  i m simply not convinced we ve discovered the optimal way to thrive as emotionally vibrant people   so how did we get here  why do we do this  well  as i said before  much of it seems to revolve around our pesky dependence on food and shelter  a man s gotta eat  i can t live my best life by starving because i wanted to be an idealist  but that can t be the only way to answer that  there s thousands of monks and ascetics of varying levels who would all argue they re vastly closer to anything resembling nirvana than your average working joe   it would seem to me that your average first-world person  for lack of a better categorization  is living a life of great compromise  we sell our time  the only commodity any of us really has  to the highest bidder  in exchange  we are offered the ability to do more with our leisure time  which really ends up just being a few hours per evening and 2 days per weekend at most  are we all mostly destined to spend the majority of our waking hours doing something we d rather not be doing and that which is not particularly essential to our living ethos ,kq8pq6

1456,"Seriously, why is it so frowned upon to follow your passions as a career?",i can't count how many people have told me that i'm supposed to hate my job  and just see it as a way to make money to use in my time off  before getting into my current career  i was straight up laughed at and told to grow up over and over whenever i said that i wanted to do something that's genuinely enjoyable and makes me want to get up in the mornings  and it's not like the thing in question was some pipe dream tutti fruity idealistic career either   thankfully i ignored all those people and went back to school  spoiler alert  life is better when you don't dread getting up in the morning to get screamed at by a boss who thinks you're their slave  i love what i do now  and it literally feels like i'm getting paid to do my hobby all day  not like i'm having the life squeezed out of me   as an added bonus  i now mainly work for myself  which despite being high pressure has been a hugely freeing experience  even when i'm not though  the jobs i've had have been respectful of my needs as an employee  and very much treated me like a human  not a bottom line - which was a completely new experience for me    i hope anyone reading this and feeling stuck in a shitty job with shitty people and no options can get some encouragement from my experience  you don't have to conform to the path people want you to  it's okay to think outside the box and make decisions that directly benefit you  not someone else  fuck anyone who says you shouldn't be chasing your passions ,kqy8gz

1458,My shitty work story and how I turned the situation around.,so first of all  i'm very happy that i found this sub and want to wish everyone the best for this year  this is gonna be a long rant so buckle up haha    now to get to the story  i'm 22 years old and had a couple jobs as a cook in different restaurants  but i also have ptss from a shitty childhood and have little difficulty learning  adapting in new situations  i always got the feeling bosses took advantage of me because of this  if i'm a good place i can work good enough and handle a kitchen in rush hour on my own without having a struggle    last august i started this new job in a kitchen of a really nice restaurant and it went very well for the first 2 months  my boss started this restaurant 2 years ago and covid has a big impact on it  so a lot of times i got told i'm  expensive   minimum wage  and need to work a little faster  and stressing me out while giving every order out of order  not really a problem until i got less and less hours every month  it went from 15 a week to 2 evenings every month  if i'm lucky i get 80  at this point on my monthly salary   so in november she text me to tell about the last cut in my hours and starts to ask about if i want to work  a couple days from 24 till 27 december  i tell her i wanted to work the 24th but not the rest of the holiday because i got it planned with my family  she gets mad and puts it on me that i have to work on christmas because it's the only good time to make some money for the business and this pandemic   this wouldn't be a problem for me if she didn't screw me over with my hours through a freaking text   so now it's december 23rd and she text me again  now to let my know i don't have to work the 24th because her family dinner got canceled  but she still needs me on one of the christmas days  i got mad and told her i'm really not working on the holidays and how disappointing her way of handling her business is  she eventually started to guilt trip me on this covid shit and how everybody is struggling   what i totally understand  even later that night a colleague comes to my house for a drink and asks me if i really can't come to work  nope  not gonna happen   so now i haven't heard a single thing from my boss since that day  but i know one of my colleagues who is 17 and gets maybe 4  an hour and some 30 year old chick are being replaced on my work hours  note  she probably also gets minimal wage or even more    she totally fucked me over because i didn't come work at her demand   not caring about the fact i live together with my boyfriend and his daughter and i still got bills to pay  didn't even wish us happy holidays or something  and i really did a lot for her  even to the point of writing down less hours and my boyfriend fixing stuff in the restaurant for free    so in the mean time i just started my own online business and resell second hand clothing  already making triple the amount of what i would make with that one evening working for her  it's still not a lot but at least i can handle my own business and don't need to have extra stress and feel depressed about her restaurant  i almost broke because of all this pressure on my shoulders but realized on time this isn't my problem and i did the best i could    for now i'm just waiting for her text asking me to come to work because other colleagues can't and i'm telling her to fuck off and that im quitting  ,kqmgya

1470,What are we working for?,is there any type of work or organization that is not  in general  corrupt  i ve never heard of  or worked for  a company that puts more emphasis on treating its employees well above the bottom line  doctors  including especially  dentists  are happy to prescribe medicine they get a kick back for  or order extra x-rays because they ll make money  teachers  i have worked as a teacher for four years  can be ok  many of them care  as do many people whether they re in a helping profession or not  but the american education system is set up to get students to pass a test- it is quite literally not about educating children  anyway  i m not trying to attack education  not that it doesn t need it  or any specific job but are there any forms of paid  full-time employment that are actually doing good in the world and not meant to crush souls ,kq11qz

1473,I work in a sweatshop,i've made a plan to quit work and look for a real job full time  wait till i have three months wages saved up and quit  the problem is i have a broken back    my employer is a sweatshop in northern indiana making wire-harnesses  once decided was the lowest paid employer in the county  including mcdonalds and wal-mart  i'm a supervisor there  but if you watched me all day  you wouldn't know it  i run all of the production in the cell i  lead  the supervisor title is what i call a weasel promotion  the kind of promotion a weaselly person would give  a title  all responsibilities but no authority    we've been perpetually behind since the guy who started the company retired  the people running it are running it into the ground  and i think it's intentional  they do the dumbest things like take orders that are to go out when we're supposed to be off  they also move stuff around the schedule without updating it so we end up late on orders  my boss was promoted to her position straight from production not because of her skill and experience but because she would be easy to control  this was her first job after a 25 year stint in prison  and within a year she was already manager    we are perpetually behind  the company blames the workers of course  we talk too much so we are not allowed to speak a word to each other on the floor  if you are caught talking  you are written up  since we're behind and it's  our fault  they've taken away things like the christmas bonus  the quarterly raises so now it's 25 cents once a year but you have to be absolutely perfect to get it  and awards for working hard that would be given out during monthly meetings  because of us being behind  i've been doing 12hr a day  7 days a week shifts since the middle of november  regular overtime started in september  10 hours 5 days a week  this is going to be going on till july at the soonest    we used to have a radio  but they took it away after a co-worker asked why the volume changes day to day    if we are caught with our phone on the premises  it's taken away  even if we're using it on break  can't keep phones in our cars because people have had their cars broken into several times    all the work i've been doing has prompted me to demand raises  i want to make as much as the other supervisors  but according to my boss the supervisors don't make as much as i think  i dunno  they are salary and exempt from overtime  in the state of indiana  you have to make more than  681 salary to be exempt from ot  i'm only making  490 a week  my boss said she doesn't even clear  500 a week  either she's lying or the supervisors are being screwed both are likely    they promised me an it position because i am certified  they gave it to the son of the lady who works in hr  zero experience  the server got nuked quickly and he's been doing nothing ever since  doesn't even change the paper in printers  when i brought it up that i was promised the job  they said they never made such a promise or even brought it up to me    amp x200b   i've got more to say  so stay tuned ,kq6itd

1478,This is the saddest day of the year :(,the first work day in the new year is like the moment you get on the treadmill with a commitment to run for an hour   you re in decent shape  but this you know this will be a challenge  the music starts randomly playing in your headphones and it s don t stop believin  by journey   you think   oh this is a great song  i love steve perry  and you sing along     you quickly turn up the pace on the treadmill and begin to sweat   the novelty of the song wears off as you realize that you have heard the line   a smell of wine and cheap perfume  no less than 1000 times   you hit fast forward and love shack by the b-52s starts playing   you quickly kill that one and hit fast forward again   every breath you take by the police starts playing   you realize you know every song and have no choice but to just roll with it because it s too much work to keep adjusting the music and run at the same time   besides  if you try to do keep tapping your phone  your more likely to fall off the treadmill and break your neck than get a good workout  you look down at the treadmill timer and see that you have only been running for 15 seconds   ugh    for those of us fortunate enough to have office jobs  the last two weeks of the year represent the one time where you can take a day off and not get killed for it   even those nutty people that live for tps reports and disrupting the widget space shut it down or  at least have no right to expect a reply to their emails with 2 minutes   well folks  the new year has started   godspeed my friends ,kpwmp3

1487,Professional sports are a part of the problem.,one thing i've been thinking a lot about while watching the nfl especially is the constant talk about  sacrifice  and  hard work  and countless other  manly  and  strong  values that are repeated ad nauseam and the mindset this feeds into   there's very much a strong association with the nfl and the blue-collar working man  but that has been completely done away with since the 70s   the days of nfl players having two jobs because they used to be paid nothing is long-gone  and in as much as these athletes work hard  they're going into practice a handful of times a week  getting paid millions and millions of dollars  breaking covid procedures with literally no consequences  missing games doesn't mean not getting paid for most of them  and having one hard day of actual work   game-time a week   what furthers this is the idea that they  should  be out there sacrificing their bodies for the entertainment of the masses and that somehow this makes them  and by extension the  blue collar worker  tougher than everyone else   as a result  the person putting in 60-80 hours a week or breaking their backs is somehow the better person in society   this plays into the corporate idea that people are there to be cogs and should give everything they have to a company that gives an absolute rat fuck about them   if we're not out there  sacrificing  and not having a strong work-ethic  we're clearly not walking the company line   what we should be doing is taking the approach of professional sports through the idea of only having to work or  practice  for just a few hours a day  and have one day a week to really burn through some of it   you'll get better performance out of people  have less churn  and have people who are excited to come to work because they're not being ham-fisted into a way of existing that quite frankly doesn't suit them     fuck your ping pong tables and pizza parties ,kpswm0

1517,Is marriage and having children a way to keep you trapped in the system?,one of my friends who is in his 30s just had his second child recently  despite him being ecstatic about it  i can't help but to feel sorry for him for not ever being able to live freely probably for his entire life  of course unless he won some big lottery money or run his own business  but none of these are likely to happen in the foreseeable future   he barely have time to sleep looking after the kids   then i started to get suspicious about the whole idea of romance and relationship and having a family   like 90  of the movies and tv shows and books and all the other forms of media is covered with finding love  getting married and having children  like these topics are constantly non-stoppingly shoveled in your face  oh and sex  like everything is sexualised on media nowadays  i kinda start to think it's all looking too much like it's intentionally promoted to you  to have more babies  then i see my friend having his second child  all i see is him working 9-5 forever and still living a financially burdened life cuz of the two kids  so could romance and having children be their strategy to keep you trapped in the system  cuz the only way i see that have the slightest possibility to break free is to stay single  save money n side hustle  then start your own business somehow before you are too old  that's the only way i could see to gain financial freedom so free from 9-5      so in other words  if you wanna become financially free from the 9-5  not having children would be a good way to help achieve this goal   and not producing slave labors for the ruling class as a plus     amp x200b   what's your thoughts on this   sorry about the rambling ,kpylyf

1530,"Students Should Be Paid to get Degrees, Not The Other Way Around",when you think about it  it is absurd we have to pay for college and get into massive debt to get a degree that may or may not have any worth at all   when we go to college  it is the student who does the work  the student is studying and completing homework assignments  working on projects and pulling all nighters to meet their deadlines  yet they are the ones paying for this  seriously that is absurd  students should get paid to do their programs as it is work they are doing with the intention of later getting a job to benefit society    to put it simply  they give up four productive working years to work hard to get some degree that may or may not be worth anything in terms of actually getting a job  not only that  many are forced into paralyzing debt for this privilege to experience the above  this is absolutely insane and shows what a rigged society we live in   the rich should pay students to go get their degrees - after all many of those people with the degrees will then go and make money for these corporations  students should leave with money in their bank account for the work they complete to get their degree  not the other way around ,kozgl6

1533,"Becoming a NEET (Not in educaiton, employment or training) will be my last option if everything else fails",what the title says  frens  how did you guys come to that path in life  or maybe lack thereof  did it scare you at first  was it a difficult descision  how did the people around you react  what is the thing keeping you going  for me  the possible paths i may take are these   1  very odd job  very uncommon  most people may or may not be aware it exists in the first place  requires tons of travelling  so i will get to see the world and do stuff i love with unique diverse people around me  i don't really wanna name it  cause i will need a whole book to explain it or why and how it became one of my possible paths  and how i even discovered it was an option  but i do not know how my family will react if i reveal it to them  it is a perfectly achievable job  a lot of times though not always with good work - life balance  and my past sports backgrounds give me an advantage as to doing it  it is not sex work  but it does require selling your body technically  it may or may not be more physically demanding and or bad for your health as working in mines or in construction  and i guess it may or may not be considered ''back breaking labor''  the reason why i am not explaining it  is because it will either make me look like a poser attention seeker and because i will have to type ten paragraphs to explain myself  but you get the idea  my family will call me insane if i choose to pursue it  and they already give me weird looks when i talk about it or show them stuff on my phone related to it  but my sister says she will support me no matter which path i follow  and that i am a very talented girl and that she is mind blown by the fact that ''i already learnt so much without a coach teacher''  i do not consider myself talented  nor ''natural'' at it as many of the people in this field are stereotyped  i just think i started at a point in time where it was 10000000000000 times easy  so now i come off as i have some type of magical superpower  but i love and forgive my sister  because she has a kind heart and has faith in me  and she is all i have left in the world  2  also a quite odd job  but it is not god-forgotten or forgotten even by the secretary of god like the above one  i have a lot fo creative ideas about it  but i doubt i will find success in the mainstream since creativity and passion these days is sacrificed for the shake of sex appeal  outward appearance and it is pretty much a dead field  in the sense that there is little creative  passionate  joyful work put out there now  it is highly unlikely that i will follow that path for that reason  although in my country a non-mainstream marker in experimental folk stuff is there too  but i have zero clue if that is my style  and also  i am not sure if this is a path i want to follow yet even as a hobby  though i have soooooo much inspiration inside me  3  teacher  it sounds beautiful  in theory  more specifically  primary elementary teacher  giving children knowlegde  forming deep loving relationships with your students  and helping them become happy  functional adults  it sounds really appealing to me  it is the only ''normal'' job i have ever dreamed of  and actually liked  anything else was either very artsy  very athletic  or both  at first i chose teacher as my first option  because  well  i may had had repressed dreams  that may have been there since i was 7  that i was never allowed to pursue all and all because my family tried to protect me from the slightest inconvenience  helicopter parenting has completely ruined my view of life lowkey  and it has also made me afraid to pursue some of my goals that will require me to put effort and fail a lot of times to do them  in theory  it is such a beautiful profession  and it offers so much  both to the teacher and the student  i just do not know if my mental issues will allow me something like that and i mighty simply be drawn to the idea of being a teacher and not the profession it self because of them  so i am not sure if this is my path  4  full time author  highly unlikely  hard to achieve  and while i do love literature and can not live without it  it is a very lonely  escapist profession and i do not trust myself with it because i do not wanna end up like james joyce or lovecraft  i call this one  the ''best worst case scenario'' for the above reasons  i know i probably won't be like j k rowling or steven king  but just in case everything else fails or ain't for me  i like to hope this will be possible  5  glossology  hard to get into  hard to study  time consuming  probably will have to become a professor if i wanna use it somehow  but it seems appealing  and interesting compared to any normal office job  there are just too many languages i wanna learn before i die  and they do not even have a greek or latin alphabet  6  theology religious studies  highly unlikely  might not find a job  again  though same applies to glossology  i ain't passionate about teaching adults  but in my country you can teach middle schoolers general knowledge about world religions  not indoctrination  there is a difference  so there is that  7  part time job   youtube  it gives me the wrong vibes because again  it is a very isolating profession just like writer  and it takes time to build a channel anyway  8  neet  i saved it as my last option  no idea what i will do all day  no idea if i will develop a feeling of aimlessness or not  hopefully this is not an insult to all of you in this subreddit  i respect your choices  but in case everything else fails  and i develop crippling depression from the manlfunctions in my brains reward system trauma   i will be a neet  will all my family hate me  yes  will i loose the few people that love me and want the best for me  yes  will i remind my caregiver of her son who became a drug addict  and eventualy may have killed himself overdosing  yes  will she think she has failed and has no other joy in life  yes  will i eventually end up like her son  maybe  hopefully not  will it fullfill me  no  do i have any optimism for life and for a future  absoloutely not  but  maybe  just maybe  do i have a small hope  yes  yes i do    end of rant  frens ,kowbfy

1566,Does anybody NOT get bored with their free time?,just curious  i work full time  i m 32 so iv been doing it about 15 years now  and like most of you i just abhor the idea of working for the rest of my life   iv often felt guilty over my lack of a work ethic and mainly got though my working life by telling myself i need to man up and change my thought process to appreciate what i have more  but the thing is  i love my free time  i never get bored and if i do get bored i can very easily find something to preoccupy my mind honestly  work has never fulfilled me and it doesnt really keep me occupied or make me feel good  it just feels like an obligation i need to make for 40 hours every week and if i decide i don t want to do this anymore then reality kicks in where you realise you literally don t have a choice   it kind of sucks because most people genuinely seem to enjoy work  or gain something from it  but for me i am much happier when i am in my own free time  and to decide how to spend my time   i never get bored outside of work  but work bores me yet i have to spend 5 days of the week there and only 2 for myself  every god damn week   just seems shit  sorry for the random post,kpasvy
1567,"I got fired two times in the past three years, and I couldn't be prouder.",once i got fired because i worked in a place with 5 people and the owner  the owner paid us for 8h per day and would demand that we remained up to 3 hours after those 8 hours was finished - without any pay  my 5 colleagues hated it but complied  i lasted one week and then i started to grab my things and leave when i was done with my tasks  i worked hard  but he fired after 6months  lecturing me about  sacrifice  and  team effort  the other time i was told i was obliged to go to meetings and dinners with the team because otherwise the boss would have been disappointed  i lived in another city back then  i'm not a fan of gatherings and i wasn't going to drive for more than 3hours to do something that i didn't want to do  i worked hard  but i was fired after 6 months  now i'm a freelancer  i decide for my time and nobody can force me to do anything  people trashed me for not being able to keep those jobs and i realized how many of them  starting from my ex coworkers  are willing to give away their time and their happiness just to keep a minimum wage job  it's very sad  i hope this sub gets bigger and bigger by the time  i wish i met more people that think like you guys ,kpbpju
1568,vent: why is laziness considered criminal?,sorry for the rant but i just get so frustrated sometimes  it really feels like in the us  people think laziness should be punished with death  one of the main arguments i hear against ubi is  oh  well some people just won't work then  first of all  lots of people have non-laziness-related reasons not to work  like new parents  people in school  and disabled people  second of all  why the fuck should i care if someone doesn't want to work  why does that mean they should be punished  like  if you don't want to work  maybe you don't get an enormous mansion or crazy spending habits  but why shouldn't you get to live under a nice roof and eat every day  i don't understand why so many basic human rights are considered to be only for people who work  like i understand where people are coming from when they say   nobody who works full time should be in poverty  like yes  that is a good point  but we can do better  nobody should be in poverty at all     amp x200b   it's also like  there is nobody alive who doesn't do some type of work  it's just that the work they do might not generate material wealth  stay at home parents  for example  do tons of work that they don't get paid for  fuck it  maybe i want to live in a commune and do housework  what is so wrong with that  i know all of this  laziness is a sin  philosophy comes from what can essentially be boiled down to  the puritans ain't no damn fun  but i don't understand why we  in the us  have held onto it for so long  and not only that  spread it to other countries and cultures     amp x200b   i'm imagining that people in this sub feel similarly  but i could be wrong  do you guys ever get overwhelmed with these feelings  how do you deal with it  is it even possible to combat this system ,kp06an

1571,"Fellow antiworkers, what's your opinion about volunteering?",i've been a volunteer countless times  especially when i was younger  marathons  prides  action aid  special olympics and much much more  and at the time it felt really good  but now that i'm a little bit older and i see work with a much more critical eye i'm having second thoughts  for example many of the places i volunteered had a lot of sponsor  others like marathon's had a generous fee from every participant and sponsors  action aid  amnesty international etc take a lot of money from people for their work and have some employees but they are depending on volunteers to do the shity work  the worst was when i was volunteering for an organisation about women and children fellow by accident that eu paid a small  salary  for every volunteer working there which we knew nothing about and we had to ask for it many times to resieve afterwards  is it volunteering a filthy way for organisations not to pay employees  my opinion is really divided right now ,kpjvlk
1572,I haven't had a full time job yet and I'm not fucking exited for one,i don't want to work the rest of my life in a job where i'm overworked underpaid for the effort and skills i put in while some billionaire gets 90  of the rewards from my labor  i don't want my tax money going to some billionaire and not used to help everybody  i don't want to support these people at the top but it's impossible not to because some billionaire always has a monopoly on one of the basic necessities  want to buy something online  atleast in the us you're gonna get sales tax  90  of that sales tax is probably going to get back to billionaires in some way  only a small portion actually gets back to the public  i am in no way feeling supported by the government  their job is only to increase the number in their bank accounts  i am not happy with the idea that  even my own parents  expect that the rest of my life must be all work with small gaps of personal free time  i can't focus on my education because i'm taught to think of what i am worth as a person by how well i work  i can't focus on my education because i constantly think of where that money spent on my education could have gone  and how the majority of it is probably going to some billionaire with a textbook monopoly or a student debt monopoly  the worst part is i'm 17 and the cost of an education is just going to increase once i turn 18  and i'm making that happen quicker by not being able to focus on my education  i'm apparently supposed to be enjoying not having to work at this point of my life but i feel no enjoyment  how is this normal for everyone else  how is this what society is  how is this healthy at all ,kpj9bx
1573,Capitalism and effeciency: What the fuck are we doing.,listing some ways in which capitalism creates inefficiency  and how efficiency when it does happen  never benefits workers    preface  i understand that some of this wasted work has value  competition can lead to good things in some sense  i am merely pointing out inefficiency  not saying another system would do everything better    bullshit jobs  beginning with the most simple and widely known inefficiency in capitalism  there is a large subset of jobs which involve checking boxes  confirming things in other ways  or nothing at all  jobs which essentually involve no labour  but force the laborer to pretend they do something  of course made popular by the book bullshit jobs by david graeber  probably this concept is connected to many of our awakenings to the nonsense of work culture     bullshit sectors  i would expand on the concept of bullshit jobs and add that many whole sectors of work exist without the creation of anything  examples of this are the finance sector  law  government  and marketing  i am not saying these sectors don't do anything  i'm saying they create nothing  they produce nothing  they are essentually management of society  they are band-aids on a wound    competition is wasteful  all competition  where sellers are vying for the money of a limited-demand service or good  actually reduces efficiency  imagine you are selling haircuts  and someone moves in beside you and also sells haircuts   this is basically the case where i live  so many barbers  any time one of you is open for business  but not cutting hair  while the other is cutting hair  is wasted time on the job  similarly  if you spend a year making a video game but a similar video game comes out and there is no longer a market for your game  all the time the studio spent making that game is wasted because of competition rather than cooperation with other studios  in fact if you look at the video game industry you see blatantly how many games have no player base because there are just way more people making games then necessary     low income inefficiency  imagine i need a haircut but i have no money  i don't get a haircut  because of this  the barber doesn't get paid as much  and doesn't buy as much for himself  this cycle in our society encourages not just the poor  but everyone to spend less  meaning demand less in an economic sense  this is why the only way to make money in society  outside of the arts  is to do work that people cannot refuse  such as healthcare  law  and finance  nobody can bargain a low price with a doctor  people can't represent themselves in court  and nobody can give themselves a loan for a house  they have to deal with these people  and so they can charge whatever they want     money makes money  anyone who spends money in our society is losing  so we only do it when we have to or we really want something  any money saved can be multiplied in many ways  especially if you have a lot of it  this means that not just poor people  but everyone is incentivized not to pay for goods and services  which artificially reduces demand for everything  except what can t be avoided  as previously stated  if society was based on demand  rather than money  many things would be done that arent now  i could open a business selling ice cream and anyone who wants ice cream would ask for some  thereby creating more product than our system     conclusion  which is more efficient  a man who cuts down 10 trees in an hour  but only works 4 hours a day  or a man who cuts 6 trees an hour  but works 8 hours a day  the answer is quite obvious  it's the first man  but our society would view this man as being low on work  less productive per day  a part time worker  an under employed person  society would much rather see us all work 8 hours a day  then see us truly improve the efficiency of our system and improve the lives of everyone  the fact is  society is already quite efficient  we make a lot of food and transport it around the world  we could all work 3 or 4 hours a day if we would stop doing jobs that don't need to be done and give enough money to everyone so we can afford to buy things  and create a cycle of demand  rather than incentivizing non spending    there is a postal service union in my area  they fought against making community mailboxes  why  because they represent the letter carriers and this improved efficiency would have led to layoffs  the real question is  why would it lead to layoffs  why would we as a society deliberately make ourselves less efficient because we cannot comprehend the idea of efficiency benefiting the worker instead of the businesses bottom line  in a crown corperation no less  canada  that's truly broken  we live in fear of improved efficiency in our society  we are worried about robots taking jobs  why  because we can't just agree to pay people the same to work less   because of this  wanting efficiency  which we all should  should be the same as wanting reduced work  or higher pay for workers  or both  for that reason being anti-work and being anti-capitalist are fundamentally linked  any leftist should be fighting for increased efficiency and reduced labour as a consequence  if all truckers become unnecessary then great  what freedom we have created  pay them anyway  the laughable idea that we cannot afford to pay people when the reason they're out of work is because we are making things more efficiently then ever  is so absurd  we paid them befor  but now we can't because we are making the same thing without them  it makes no sense     side note  i won't go into it that much but we should also just reduce our production  we need to be sustainable on this planet  this is also a reason for less work    final question  does anyone know people who are talking about this in a similar way  am i missing something here or is the discourse in leftist circles just letting people claim that capitalism is effecient without rebutal ,kp2kwr
1574,I graduate at the end of this year and don't see a way I can ever be happy in life because I wasn't born rich enough to avoid full time wage slavery.,basically what the title says   will be finishing up my master's degree in november which will have been a nice 2 year break from wage slavery  i know i am preaching to the choir  but i don't know how i will ever have happiness in life having to be a full time wage slave for the next 40 years  it is almost impossible to get part time work here unless you want to be in poverty and dealing with customer service jobs  5 days just sucks up your life and leaves you too tired to even enjoy the weekends  i'm already on the highest possible safe dose of anti depressants and it isn't enough   i don't really know what else to say  but it is so soul crushing to know i have no real choice but to do something that makes me desperately unhappy because the world has been set up to force us to participate in wage slavery or end up on the streets  the worst part is when my mother says  that's life  why the fuck did you have me if you knew life was shit  both my parents had cancer in their 50s  my father died from it  so basically my fate is either 40  years of wage slavery and maybe getting to retire or wage slaving until 55 and then dying of cancer    fuck everything  i just want to be able to work part time but it's basically impossible in my country and i have no choice but to revolve my life around a job i don't even want and barely see my family and friends and never have time for my hobbies  i will have to give up my hobby of learning korean  sleep when my body doesn't want to sleep  my natural clock is 2am-10am  and be a miserable rat in the race until i die   kinda wish the pandemic just ended civilisation tbh ,kowpba
1575,They double their efforts and keep slaving away!,the pursuit of an easier life resulted in much hardship  and not for the last time  it happens to us today  how many young college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms  vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are thirty-five  but by the time they reach that age  they have large mortgages  children to school  houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family  and a sense that life is not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays abroad  what are they supposed to do  go back to digging up roots  no  they double their efforts and keep slaving away   -- sapiens a brief history of humankind by yuval noah harari,kos6q3

1579,Point-less,for the longest time  i struggled in looking for a point to my life  the utter meaninglessness of everything was overwhelming and so it felt appropriate to ask this question   what is the point   my life has probably been lived like many of you  i've had a few brief moments of happiness  but the vast amount of this has been just mindless drudgery  i went to college like i was supposed to  worked hard to get the degree like everyone else  and accepted a slave wage job in which i feel perpetually miserable  waking up every day to hammer out 8 hours of boring  mindless work  causing me to feel bitter and frustrated with everything  day in and day out  i live at home with my mom at 29 because i am not interested in paying the extremely high rent fees for shitty one bedroom apartments in my area  i've only amounted to the money i've been able to save up   at the end of the day  nothing is happening  i chase little simple pleasures when i can but feel like most of my time is spent working and depressed and tired  i'm not working towards anything  nothing is really interesting to me  it's just existing  i obviously don't want kids  i don't want marriage  my life isn't heading in any direction other than more of the same  it's not like i'm really doing anything significant in any way or amounting to something bigger   so  we come back to the same old question  what's the point   the closest that i have to an answer  is that there is no point  as humans we ask that question because we are often feeling a sense of pointlessness and boredom with our lives  in other words  we who are looking for a point to life is often because our lives feel pointless to us   but asking for a point is viewing our world though a human perspective which seeks meaning  at the end of the day  i don't offer meaning to this world  i am a disposable person like the many who have lived and died before me  i seek meaning in a meaningless world   so  what is the point of all this   there is no point  it is point-less ,kp0zgj
