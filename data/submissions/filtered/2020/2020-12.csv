0,ITS YOUR FAULT YOUR POOR (/S),     i spy on a lot of pro-trump and conservative subreddits and forums  what i found is sickening   it  seems at one point in time  and i'm not exactly sure when this became  less frequent  one was expected to help their fellow friends and  neighbors   here as you can see in 1951  a huge crowd of people rushed to assist a near drowning victim at coney island    https preview redd it 5ql7bm8pfj761 jpg width 640 amp crop smart amp auto webp amp s 2bcfaa546357b0e558835de0aad9ab525d926014 https preview redd it 5ql7bm8pfj761 jpg width 640 amp crop smart amp auto webp amp s 2bcfaa546357b0e558835de0aad9ab525d926014   but at some point  this went away completely with republicans and trump supporters   currently  and this is a few weeks old  almost  20 million people are at risk of eviction    https www businessinsider com millions-of-americans-are-behind-on-rent-risk-of-eviction-2020-12 https www businessinsider com millions-of-americans-are-behind-on-rent-risk-of-eviction-2020-12   while  anyone with a reasonable amount of common sense can pin this on the  pandemic  the only person being blamed by them  is you   i  cannot wrap my head around the fact that these people are blaming each  other  not having enough savings  working  for lower wages   renting or  buying a home that is too expensive   wtf if  these people were alive during the great depression  they would of  probably blamed people for  keeping their money in the bank   i can't these people seem to only blame themselves  can't possibly be due to the pandemic  the economy  the government  etc   nope   if you are facing eviction  your fault for not saving enough money to  get through it   not being better prepared for this  etc etc etc   these  people have no soul  no heart  no empathy or compassion for anyone  else  a nuclear bomb could hit their city and  it's your fault for not  having a bunker  i might sound sarcastic but i'm being dead serious ,kmpbw0
1,How can I program a YouTube account bot that posts videos for me as a source of passive income?,i am sorry if this is not super related to antiwork but in a sense  i am trying the generate money for the longterm without having to do any work   the plan is this  i code a youtube bot that can automatically posts videos of something which i have not yet decided however the content and videos it makes will all be generated automatically using some cool methods without having to do as little as type the thumbnail name   so my questions are  has anyone made something similar to this and how can i make own youtube bot  that posts videos ,kmlttv

4,My realisation,i don't know if anyone will care about this post but let's go   remember 2016 when it felt like every famous person in the world died   well  one of them got to me   david bowie   i'm not a huge fan but that man was famous my entire life   my sister had a poster of him as i was growing up so i've always been aware of him   anyway  he died at 69   all that fame  money  whatever   nothing helped   his doctors were probably the best you could get and very possibly might have been fans of his     in the uk  where i am  i'm due to retire at 67   68 for people coming up now  and that'll go up no doubt   so you work your whole life and you might get a year or two of retirement   if you get that far   that felt like 100 percent bullshit to me   i can't even complain  i've got an okay job   i work in an office but i get my fair share of stress   pay is alright but i'd still get that feeling every monday morning   stood in front of the office and thinking 'oh man  fuck this place '  i didn't hate it as such  but it just felt like a waste of life   sat at a desk doing shit that ultimately doesn't matter   anyway  i went up to one of the directors at work and said 'you're loaded  what do you do with your money '  he explained that he invests in a self-invested private pension and stocks and shares isa   he told me how  it's not difficult   instead of buying expensive shit like cars and unnecessarily fancy holidays  now i'm saving up for my freedom     i'm going to get out in my 50s   it's not ideal but by then i'll have my house paid off   one thing i changed was not buying tat   i'm a film and games guy but i had a lot of merch and nonsense   i sold everything i wasn't actively using and i stopped buying things i don't need   things like pop vinyls and shit like that   it's all nice and decorative but now i just buy things that i'll actively enjoy   a bigger tv  a ps5  a guitar  decent tablet    shit like that   but i'll often sell things to help balance it   and any money left over goes into investments   and one day i'll be free   i might still work   i might volunteer somewhere   but i won't be an office drone ,kn2dxm

11,I dont get why this subreddit is feminist?,feminists are amongst the worst type of people who job shames others and looks down on people for having an  antiwork  mindset very much like the hardline capitalist that has an old fashioned view on womens rights  it's like there two sides of the same coin  why should we side with one of them when they're both pieces of shit  i feel like the movement would be taken more seriously if it cut them off  they're just a detriment  also shaming others for criticizing poor middle class people who stick up for the rich  i think if you did a venn diagram of these two types of people here it would be closer to a full single circle instead of two  i think we'd be closer to the type of world we would want if it wasnt for these types and as long as nothing is done about them  nothing will ever change ,knxlj4

13,Working the way i have to work in order to just barley scratch by has caused me to lose my humanity.,i wake up and feel nothing but despair  i feel dread and anxiety all day  i wonder why i do this when i cant even pay my bills  my body is already destroyed  and all i can think is that i will probably have to do this until i die    i try to make changes  but i dont have the money to do so i e  college   made a budget sheet  and after everything is paid for i dont have enough t o eat  buy clothing  or do anything for entertainment   i cant afford mental health care even though ive become severely depressed  what kind of system is this  i cant fix my car  im waiting for the utility companies to shut off my water  gas  or electric  everyone tells me to snap out of it and try to find something better   im doing the best i can  but with how deppresed i am now fue to work  i can barley get out of bed  let alone leave my house when its the weekend   there really dosent seem to be any place to turn at this point  ive been considering leaving and moving to a place where i can live freely and work in a community like a commune or something   ive given up on the idea of materialism because i realize that buying expensive stuff will just put me into a deeper financial pit and it wont give my soul sustenance   i think its time to give up on the capitalistic dream  we dont live in a free economy anymore  there is no point to keep plughing away when all your hard work is underpaid and most of it just goes to the government to buy missles and provude aid for other countries   im fucking over it and im done fighting this battle  its tume to accept deafeat and move on  i gave it a good go  i really did  but enough is enough ,kn9swa

16,Does 8-6 work schedule slow down innovation?,i am someone that loves to find ways to innovate ways of making menial tasks easier and faster by using basic stuff like excel or just figuring an easier way to do something  i might stress out my brain more over a half a day to find a solution and save 10-30 hours in the end   the problem i am running into is if i overwork my brain to innovate  i need a little break  but am still stuck at work for the next 4 hours where i have to look productive  so in the end i am essentially overworking my brain and doing more work than the next guy over for no extra pay or anything   i notice this with the guys that work 1 level below me  half of the time they stretch out their work and dont want to help out because they get paid more to sit around so they can stay later at work and can get paid ot ,knbola

32,I just need to get some things off my chest.,i'm not going to use any real names  just in case  so things might seem a bit strange   i need to vent  so imma just vent  a few months ago  i was working backshift  security guard  at hospital a and i get a text from the supervisor at the time  a dumbass  i shall name 'ryan' and he's like  i need you to work the morning shift on the weekend  which is fucking impossible because it'll interfere directly with my sleep schedule  and mess me up for the rest of the week  now i am trying to tell him this  through text  while mum is on the floor  she had fallen  but he goes off on a rant because i won't work the impossible shift  and removes me from hospital a entirely and moves me to hospital b  which is a half hour drive away  hospital a is a 5 minute drive from my house  so fast forward a few weeks and this idiot supervisor implements a new 'sign in' system which means you need to call a phone number and let them know you started working in order for your hours to count toward your paycheck if you don't you are basically working for free  now  i got to hospital b  at 3 00 pm  which was when i was supposed to be there  realized i didn't have my phone on me had to race home  got my phone at 3 30 called ryan  who was still supervisor at this point  told him to call the guard i was to relieve and explain i forgot my phone   at the time he said  it's all good  shit happens   i got there for 4  an hour late   he calls me the next day why were you so late for that shift   because i forgot my phone i called you and explained dickhead  well you should have worked without it   then how was i supposed to sign in and get paid   use the hospital phone   i don't know the number  it's in my contacts  which is on my phone  basically  rob was upset i was an hour late  and wanted me to have worked for free    this wouldn't be a problem if someone didn't put a half hour commute on my shift either way   what do you mean   i've forgotten my phone when i was working at hospital a  which is a 5 minute drive from my house   you wanna know how late i was  15 minutes tops   well you don't decide where you work  i got guys in who live in  town a  working in  town b  and guys living in  town b  working in  town a   i wanted to say  sounds like an idiot is doing the schedule  but  let's fast forward a bit   i get an email  apparently ryan stepped down   i hear through the grapevine he got alot of complaints  there's 2 new guys who took over for him adam  and greg adam wanted me to work on christmas day 8am until 6pm i show up at the senior home for 8 am no one is there to let me in i wait out in the cold for 20 minutes finally someone lets me in just in time for adam to call and say  actually it's 9 until 7  i agreed to stay until 6  because on christmas day we have a super at my sisters and you know when that usually ends  around 7 or 7 30 i agreed to stay until 6 because i could leave the senior's home   and make it in time to have supper at my sisters   she only lives a 5 minute drive away  now he is saying  sike  miss out on the entirety of christmas  i call him and have it out with him  he agrees to have someone relieve me at 4  so i was there for 8 hours  only getting paid for 7  and i spent those 7 hours  on christmas day shoving around a senile old man in a wheelchair  because the instant his wheelchair stops moving he starts having a temper tantrum   i am not a fit man  i'm about 400 pounds  and this dude is about 250 who the fuck knows how heavy the chair is i was exhausted by the time 4 o'clock rolled around  i was about dead  today  i get a text   january 1st and 2nd  senior's complex  with same resident  9 am to 7 pm  7 hours nearly killed me  now i got 20  but it get's even more fucked up cause i called adam and tried to explain that shoving him around for 7 hours nearly killed me  you wanna know what i gleamed form that conversation  you wanna know what i learned   ryan told me you should have this job  adam is getting his orders from ryan  ryan is still the supervisor  there is one aspect of this though  i really need to get off my chest something that pisses me off like you wouldn't believe  anytime i try to talk to my mum about it  she's all  well be glad you have a job  i'm just so tired of people acting like a job is the goal  like  people act as if we exist to support a job  and not the other way around  a job is supposed to be a necessary evil  something that is a pain in the ass  but you do to support the things you enjoy doing  a job isn't supposed to be your singular purpose how fucked is it that getting pusnished from work is having your hours reduced and a reward is to get to work more this all could be so much more bareable if people just fucking understood that  but no it's like everyone in my life is all  hey  life is work  ya gotta work until your dead  while they themselves do not have a job this job literally cannot sustain me  yet i'm supposed to lay down my life for my corporate masters i'm just so fucking tired of capitalism's bullshit ,kmwzgk

42,I don't get it,i graduated in mid-2018 and got my first job at sears a month later  i worked at sears for 13 months until they closed  after that  i got a seasonal position with staples  a month or two after my term there expired  the pandemic started and everything turned to shit   in november i got another seasonal position with burlington that ends in january    recently i got an interview with staples  this was fairly exciting as i actually liked working at staples    sears and burlington were are depressing places to work and the general atmosphere and work environment of my local staples is nice  since the start of the pandemic  i applied to staples multiple times and was rejected every time without an interview so finally scoring an interview was nice   the hiring manager also remembered me  although i didn't remember her  regardless  the interview was quick and easy     amp x200b   i was rejected   i don't get it  i have 18 months' worth of retail experience and i literally worked for you guys before  i need no training  i'm familiar with the store already  is that not enough  i'm 20 years old  how much work experience do you want me to have at this age  for such an easy job that pays minimum wage    is it the self-explanatory employment gap i have between january to november of this year    or perhaps i didn't start working early enough for you people    i'm so fucking pissed off   i desperately need a job and the one place i'd be happy working at keeps rejecting me even though i meet all of their qualifications ,knfwxb

48,My Realization of Hard Work =/= Success,this memory smacked me in the face over the holiday break   my mom and dad reinforced  if you work hard  you will be rewarded  in every aspect of my young life  my dad is an engineer that shot up the ranks  and now he is in the top leadership of his company  but those days are long past   i went to college to be a teacher  then went to culinary school  i graduated and worked 60-72 hour weeks for 14 years  the only time i ever missed work was the death of my beloved grandmother  and that was only two days  i put work first and broke relationships because  i just have to work hard now and things will naturally come to me  throughout this entire time  i never made more than  36k per year  before taxes  despite working for some of the most successful  award-winning chefs in the country   my best friend and i were able to hangout one night  which was extremely rare for me  he told me he was receiving a promotion and raise at his bank job  he also told me how hard he worked to get there  something inside me broke or snapped at that sentence  i started crying and my voice raised and said  why  you don t work as hard as i do  you haven t sacrificed like i have  my fianc  left me because i put work above her  you don t deserve this  i do   the conversation went on and i didn t get any better  the next day i woke up and was so ashamed of my response to great news from someone i love more than i can say  i made the decision to get an easy job and do the minimum to keep it   a few months later  i started work as a restaurant consultant  i  work  25 hours a week  have great benefits  a month of pto  nearly 3 times the average salary i made before  and i don t work hard   this fucking system sucks and most certainly does not reward hard work  we should all just stop  a general strike  until everyone is treated as they should be ,knr74b

50,Realistically what should I do if I get fired? Because I think I could be making this a reality soon for myself.,i work a soulless but easy job  pays well for the little skill needed  but it's 6am start time and 30 minute drive are so hard for me to manage with  i've been late so many times  or took days off often using sick leave  the reason for this is because of my unexplained malaise and fatigue  fatigue that has slowly been getting worse and worse and i still haven't found what's causing it yet  my life is slowly falling apart and i've gotten my first write up for not communicating with my boss that i was going to be late  i've been late 3 times since that write up due to not being able to get out of bed in the morning the fatigue is that bad and everyone says i'm lazy  i'm 28 male and shouldn't feel like this  but each time i was late i communicated it so i think things are  ehh  ok for now   fuck  guys  even when i'm not at work i sit at home miserable in malaise and fatigue  touch starved  lonely  depressed  this is probably the wrong subreddit but there has to be a medical reason that a doctor hasn't found or has over looked  i can't keep living like this  i don't want to kill myself  but i mean if it gets bad enough ,knvpf4

52,"It's not like I want to get a grueling 9-5 job, but I kinda need one of those so I can have insurance and pay off my student loans(US). Even that is hard as fuck",it seems as if the current economic system in the us is going through a slow implosion  i am a recent college graduate and having the hardest fucking time finding a job despite a semi-good major  bs in data science  and some internship experience  even with my credentials  everything seems like a lottery  i would honestly just work in retail  but i'm about 10k in the hole with student loans      amp x200b   i wish i knew what the employment market was like pre-covid  but i have a feeling that the virus just amplified some already existing issues with the economy   wealth inequality  for example  has been running rampant rendering some people homeless or in poverty and giving billions to a few  jobs are getting out-sourced because it's so much cheaper for the employer and the people who would have retired 10-20 years ago  are working until they're dead  i truly do not see how much longer this current system can last if these issues are left unaddressed  that's not to mention the fact that i only mentioned a few that were at the forefront of my mind    amp x200b   seeing as how my government did everything humanly possible to keep the stock market afloat and save the economy from sinking lower than it did  i feel like we'll all be mindless drones until the end of time whether we like it or not ,knlbm7
53,How do you want to earn money?,sure it'd be nice to never  work  again and just receive money for being us but it's not super realistic because just existing doesn't really provide value to anyone else   i'm against trading time for money because at the end of the day we're all just expenses on someone's bottom line and i hate that   the only way i can see us making money without having to work super hard like a 9-5 is by doing something online that leverages media in some way  shape  or form   that's why i like lead generation so much personally  i don't personally work much and instead of leveraging human capital i'm leveraging google and their algorithms   idk  what do you guys think  i'm all ears ,knjx84
54,"I had an interview today for a job I didn't want, and it didn't even go well.",well  the  end  of the interview didn't go well  i should say    amp x200b   tl dr  the job search and interview process is still a crock of shit  you've seen this same post ten thousand times before  i just have to get this out    amp x200b   earlier this year  just like many others  i was laid off due to covid  when i returned to work  there was a discrepancy with my pay  and when i asked for assistance with it from my superiors  i was very swiftly denied  after losing ten years to that place with hardly any progress to show for it  and after tolerating all sorts of other shitty things  that was the final push for me  so i left  since then  i've been on the hunt for something less soul sucky    amp x200b   given the state of things though  not many places  at least in my neck of the woods  are hiring  even then  i don't have a degree  and my experience is somewhat limited since i had been working at the same place for ten years  and in the same field  automotive  for most of my working life  so i find myself applying for all kinds of entry-level jobs  just so i can try to have something in the meantime  still though  trying to find something that won't make me feel like garbage at the end of every day    amp x200b   the interview today was for a teller position with a credit union  which i will obviously refrain from naming  it was a panel interview via zoom  and there were three people interviewing me  the area vice president and two hiring managers  nobody of which was from the branch i was applying to  which i found strange  it was pretty typical  i was asked the same question seven different ways  i had to provide examples of conflict resolution and where i  took initiative  in my previous jobs  i had to give three different words for myself  and name three different qualities that i'd like in a supervisor  typical  easy questions to field  i didn't act out of line    amp x200b   as the interview came to a close  when i was given the opportunity to ask some questions  i had a couple lined up  like i said  i was looking for something that wouldn't make me miserable  so i wanted to avoid certain things  a lot of my answers to their questions reflected that i wanted to be working someplace that would prove more supportive and understanding than my previous job  i don't think that's a terrible thing to ask for    amp x200b   my questions weren't out of line  they weren't rude  and they were very enlightening in spite of the interview  i'll give a bit of a reconstruction    amp x200b    -what does upward mobility look like with  company  and is there any sort of timeline for when someone at entry-level could start expecting to be considered for promotion   i was told that typically people get the hang of things after a year  but sometimes people are moved around earlier  so it was a pretty generic answer    -where have past employees or candidates fallen short   the  area vp  said  i don't know how to answer that  this is where i started to know for sure that this wasn't going well  i thought it was a pretty straightforward question  and this prompted me to look down at my notepad  i had been taking notes the whole interview  and went   uhhhhhhhh  and reiterated   have any of the three of you ever hired or interviewed someone and realized they were missing a specific quality you were looking for  because i want to be sure that i could meet that need  the vp chimed in again and said  i don't know how to answer that  so i said  okay  i can move on to the next question    -what sort of support structure exists within  company  what comes after direct management  and how easy is it to find the support that you might need   this question was  again  because i was looking for work in a place that would hear concerns and work with employees  i was told that each branch has a manager and assistant manager  and beyond that there are specific departments that cater to specific job roles  so this led to my final question  which i offered with a disclaimer    -i understand that a lot of people don't like answering this question  and if that is the case here  please feel free to refrain  based on this interview  is there any reason that any of the three of you wouldn't hire me   the vp spoke up  and i had started writing down her response but was jolted to a stop once she started talking   based on what you've been saying  you seem too concerned with hopping over management to get what you need  and that makes it seem like you wouldn't have any trust in them  i was stunned  and in an attempt to clarify  i said  i'm sorry that i've given you that impression  like i've stated  i'm coming from a job where there was literally no support system  so i'm just trying to get a feel for what  company  has to offer  she didn't respond  she didn't offer anything else  she didn't say  oh  i understand now  she just smiled and nodded at me    amp x200b   at this point  i'm not mad that i'm likely not going to get the job  i didn't  want  the job  if they call me to offer it to me  i'm going to reject it based on the interview  what has me so goddamn angry is that i've just been reminded of all of the bullshit that still exists in the workforce  and how even in the midst of a pandemic  nothing has changed    amp x200b   that's all  thanks for listening ,knkxnv
55,Matt D'Avella and minimalism,i've been watching some videos by this youtuber the last few days    i think what he's trying to sell as minimalism can be summarised as having a life as empty and  distraction free  as possible  so you can maximize your working hours and productivity    i don't think he is doing it on purpose  maybe he is just a victim that has internalised the hustle culture we are born in    what do you think ,knmu4e

77,Hopefully this helps you if you need to see this (movie and book recommendation),this last week i watched  soul  on disney  and read  dark horse  by todd rose and ogi ogas and the combination had a huge impact on how i plan on spending this next year    not to spoil the movie but it s unlike the typical afterlife mentor angel guide movie  the main characters never find out what  their purpose  is  in fact  the big message of the movie is that what you end up  doing with your life  really isn t that important  but rather the relationships you make and the experiences you have along the way are what matter most  one of the film s writer producers gave an interview and his father passed away in the middle of making this movie and he said it ended up changing his entire perspective and what he wanted to say with this movie since sitting and speaking with his father he realized the things he looked back on weren t work or career related at all  and he even said he wants the culture at pixar to change since so much of animation and what they did at the company involves long hours  little sleep  and little downtime to spend with your family while working at one of the biggest names in  family  entertainment    the book is a bit different - it focuses not on finding a  good  career but instead on finding the best career fit for each individual  lurking on this sub it kinda felt like maybe some of the feelings people have with their jobs or careers wasn t that they hated everything about everything but that they were doing something that was soul-crushing and had to put up with a lot of bullshit all at the same time    the book goes into how the problem with corporate culture is that so much of it has been standardized thanks to the industrial revolution  the push for increased efficiency during the early 20th century  think henry ford s assembly line  and the increase of productivity that the digital age ushered in  now everything is standardized  including education  and this standardization is coupled to a cultural promise that if you eventually master whatever area of interest you choose to go into you will eventually become magically fulfilled - and you do this by being like everyone else  only better    this  of course  isn t true and many quickly learn that standardization leaves literally no room for fulfillment and the cultural promise is more or less a lie  so  as an alternative to the standard career path of education then corporate ladder climbing the authors advise instead to look at what job or career would make you fulfilled  to do this they say to find out what are your  micro-motives  - what drives you  the things you enjoy doing - and to be as specific as possible    an example of not knowing your  micro-motives  they give is if you just say you like working with animals  this would be too broad  they say  as many would traditionally suggest becoming a veterinarian  but anyone that actually is a vet knows that you primarily are still working with people  the pet owners  and not animals  an real-life example of knowing your  micro-motives  they give is a micro-biologist who loves classifying types of mycelium  fungus  who now works full time helping other researchers biologists classify and find mycelium for whatever they need  the micro-biologist not only liked classifying and organizing things but also became fascinated with fungi - he realized that by putting his two big interests together he could do something that he really enjoyed every single day  this echoes the advice that mark cuban once gave which was  and i m paraphrasing   find something you already do for free and find a way to get paid for it   i tried the exercise they recommend in the book and took a few days to record the emotional responses and judgements i had in my head about everything going on around me and realized that i didn t really like  helping people  as i had told myself for years  but that instead i actually liked  solving problems  which is why i likely never enjoyed any of my customer service jobs - that and being yelled at by a grown man because i couldn t magically fix the camera on his laptop while on the other side of the country the night before he had a big zoom meeting    maybe you ll enjoy the book and movie or maybe you won t  maybe you really do just want to live off the grid and become a mountain-person  this is just what i took away from both  but after trying the traditional  safe  route of getting an expensive education and trying to shoehorn myself into traditional corporate culture i decided to try something different and finally bet on myself this next year and see where it takes me ,kmexlf

87,Scheduled Holiday Events,today i realised something  and it's bugging me   callendared holidays  christmas  new year's public holidays - wouldn't it be better to ditch this concept    so  i know a fair bit about cognitive biases  i could probably publish a sixth paper on why dungeons and dragons using a single die for most rolls is badly thought out psychology  and i'm a little annoyed at myself this thought never matured until today  but  concentrating enough people's days off to be visible  creates a notable shift in how much time away from work they think they need  because 'everybody is home for christmas' the days off for the period are over represented in most people's consciousness  even people that actually work those holidays  it creates the false impression you have enjoyed more time off  or that your time off was of higher quality that is the truth    once that sentiment is spread to near ubiquity  it erodes some of the negotiating power of all workers  both by adding complacency and making them willing to settle for less  and making employers bolder and willing to demand more   i do wonder if the culture of scheduled holidays could be wiped away  how many days per year of leave on our own schedules might become the norm for each day of 'everyone' being visibly free at once we excise ,kn5jvj

121,Serious question: What do you guys propose as the alternative to work?,i am constantly seeing posts from this sub criticizing work  yet i never see any solutions or recommendations   i agree that the culture these days encourages over-working  and employers certainly aren't putting an emphasis on home life over work life  people are working themselves to death and not enjoying their life to the fullest   but we definitely aren't at a point in our society where things are automated enough such that any significant percentage of the population can simply stop working  if people stopped working right now  society would grind to a halt and the amenities that you and i enjoy wouldn't be available   how would we grow  amp  harvest our crops  who would design new modes of transportation or architect new buildings  how would the government function  who would teach our children  who would develop the covid-19 vaccine   i'll admit i'm biased  i really enjoy working  it gives me purpose  it challenges me  i enjoy the feeling of accomplishing something meaningful    so back to my original question  if we all did away with work--as it seems you all want--then what   i know this will probably be downvoted to hell for disagreeing with you guys  but i had to ask ,knmfpc

125,Rant because I’m sick of working on holidays,sorry for the rant  just feeling really tired  stressed and hopeless   i m tired of having to build my life around my work schedule  i have to be up at 3am tomorrow to be at my job at 4 30am  commute is like an hour  gotta love devoting even that time to work without pay  so if i want 6 hours of sleep i have to be in bed at 9pm every night  and then i sit there unable to fall asleep because of the anxiety of having to wake up the next morning and because it s so early to be sleeping and suddenly it s 2am  i haven t slept and now i have to be up in an hour  and this just repeats every day   it s new year s eve and everyone around me who works the regular 9-5 has the weekend and holidays off  but because i work one of those jobs that s open 7 days a week  i have to be at work tomorrow which means i m losing out on both the enjoyment of tonight and of tomorrow    i feel like i m wasting my life away  i have a bachelors degree yet i m working this job for  10 hr  and we aren t even allowed to sit down at work  we have to stand the entire shift  i just can t believe this is what my life has been reduced to  just a cog in a wheel  giving up my prime years of health just to be a wage slave and work on a holiday so the company owner can have more positives on his balance sheet    holidays used to be fun for me when i was a kid  it was a time off  with family  to relax and eat good food and watch movies and play board games  well i ve worked christmas eve and day every year for the past 6 years and now i just dread the holidays  it s not even like on a holiday work is slower  they turn out to be some of the busiest days of the year and people are cranky and rude and don t appreciate that you re giving up your time with your family to be here so they can have their fuckin starbucks or hamburger or whatever the case may be   i m so exhausted from my life that i just want to cry  ,ko40t3

140,My retail employer covered up covid case of employee in our store,today i found out from a coworker that he had covid-19 about 3 months ago  i work in a store run by a large corporation  but the store is small and has about 15 employees  so it is a somewhat intimate setting  we are in close proximity with each other throughout the day  my coworker told the assistant manager running the store that day that he was sick and was getting a covid test  they thought he was lying and told him to come in anyway  he worked for 4 hours that day  when his test ended up coming back positive that day  he called the district manager  the district manager had him sent home  there was a rumor floating around at the time that he might have had it  but there was never any action taken by management to inform everyone that he in fact had covid  there was never any action taken to clean the store or anything  business carried on as usual and the store stayed open  and during this time  many employees were not wearing masks and there was no enforcement of mask wearing from management in the back room   i cannot trust that i will be informed if any of my coworkers ever test positive for covid at this point ,klzo2v

149,I have drastically reduced the amount of time and effort I spend at work and can't explain how good it has been for my mental health and family,i am a sysadmin at a large organization  back in march when covid first kicked off  while the majority of the company tele worked  i was grinding long hours  12-16 hour days  at the office to make sure everything stayed afloat by ensuring all personnel could tele work  and that the network stayed healthy  you know  just everyday thankless sysadmin shit   i was the definition of a workaholic  i was spending significantly more time at work than home with my family because i wanted to give off a good impression  what did this  actually  do  the only thing it did was create the impression for users and management that i was  available  24 7 and that it was okay to call me as late as 1 am because a user couldn't log into their vpn because they're sick in the brain workaholics and are working at 1 am   this burned me out really hard and upper management treated me like the token subhuman it sysadmin guy  and so for the past several months i have been putting in the absolute minimum amount of time and effort at work possible   - i will go in and as long as the network is healthy and no users need help or have tickets  i will just get up and leave for the day and go hang out with my family at home   - i ignore all calls texts on my off time that aren't alerts i have setup for the network   - i take extended lunch breaks   - i don't show up to or acknowledge 95  of  meetings   - i show up late nearly everyday  sometimes as much as 15-20 minutes   i for sure thought that doing this as long as i have been would get me written up or even fired  but i just received my annual rating and i was rated as the top performing employee  lmao  so with that said  i am just going to keep doing it   anyway  that's it  i just wanted to share because i am sure a lot of other people have been getting treated like garbage at work during all of this covid madness  i realize that not everyone has a job in which they can do or even attempt to do what i have been doing for the past several months  and i wouldn't even say i am  antiwork  but the past year has really put life in general into perspective for me ,km2uhy
150,Things I've learned at work,so i've been working for a couple of years now  here's some highlights     extra effort   wasted effort  unless a pat on the back is important to you  if you work harder than you're supposed to your only reward is more work and higher expectations  you'll never get a proper raise for it and you will be under higher pressure all the time    if you develop tools  such as scripts  to make your work easier  keep them to yourself  don't share them with your colleagues and enjoy the extra time you get from it  i did and i was actually reprimanded for developing it instead of doing more more more productivity    negative things will get noticed  positive things will not  the extra ot you put in to make that deadline will be forgotten but that one mistake you made a year ago could haunt you until you quit    also  putting in ot will barely be noticed  it's rather expected  however leaving too early will get noticed  if you have  flexible hours  it will flex in one direction only    if you have a yearly performance based raise  they will invent excuses to lower your evaluation and thus lower your raise  the extra effort you put in suddenly never happened but that one mistake you made will cost you your raise    your company likely makes enough money to pay you more  they choose not to  why would you then choose to put in extra effort  compare profit numbers to number of employees and you'll see    ass kissing  gt gt gt gt  productivity  you can be a total lazy bum and make constant mistakes  if the managers like you you'll get away with it     always have an excuse to not be more productive  slow network  unclear planning  anything  have a backup    document everything you do  such as what time you start leave  your activities per day but keep them hidden from your managers  don't give them a single second more than what your contract states  they don't deserve it    loyalty is a trap  especially larger companies have zero loyalty towards employees  if you don't generate enough profit according to their spreadsheet  you're out     if you flex to fix someone else's crappy planning  they won't learn a thing  next time there's a bad planning they'll expect you to pull them out of the fire  don't do it  not even once  make sure they learn their boundaries    always be on the lookout for positions that pay better  they exist    don't screw over your colleagues  they're in the same boat as you   the most important thing     never sacrifice your health for your job  mental or physical ,kkgw66

I wish I was still on unemployment,i work at a call center and the pay is trash  the standard pay is 10-something  but will only pay you two dollars more on  incentives  for clocking at least 32 hours a week  this week im working 38  all my life i have loathed doing things i don t want to do  things that i  had  to do  i dropped out of college 5 years ago  and have been working different jobs ever since  ive been writing a novel since then as well  but due to adhd  depression  and the need to work just to stay afloat has made it a real drag    i feel like my only worth in this world is my ability to produce revenue for richer people  i now take calls for an unemployment debit card program  its an absolute dumpster fire  people in the thousands being audited and locked from their funds  a finicky security system that will block so many necessary transactions  and a sheer lack of tools on my part to actually help them with their problems  i ve had people on the phone begging me to release their funds  something often out of my power  while the people over at the sirius xm section of the center ring bells and cheer every time they make a god damn sale  it feels very  dystopian    ive never worked this much  its not as much as some other people grind  but i hate it all the same  its ironic that i was driven off unemployment in august  believing that the benefits were going away  only to learn shortly after that they were being extended  now i take calls from the unemployed  sometimes i can help them  and i guess that feels good when i do  but ive berated and threatened over the phone too many tines for my taste    i sometimes think about minimizing everything in my life and living out of an rv or something  but no matter what you have to pay your dues  even for just  existing  why do i have to pay to live ,klv1lt

215,Have you ever had a job you liked?,i worked at the arcade counter at seaworld for about a year and a half and it was my favorite job i've ever held  the pay was modest  9 an hour  and probably not enough to live off of  but i lived with my mom at the time so it wasn't too big a deal     our duties were simple  keep the token machines full  keep games stocked with tickets  clear any ticket token jams in the games  keep the desk stocked with prizes and candy  which i would indulge on occasion  and keep the place looking nice  when it was slow  i had plenty of time to read while waiting for customers to come  pretty sure i went through a few books on that job actually    coworkers were cool  boss was awesome  biggest downside is that it was seasonal  shut down in january and february  and there weren't always enough hours to go around between the 5-6 of us with usually 2 on duty at a time  but that job never tainted my outlook on life or made me consider suicide like my current call center job does  despite the current job offering better pay  14 an hour  and benefits    i guess the reason i liked the arcade job more is because i was  under much less scrutiny and didn't have any bullshit metrics to meet  i always knew what was expected of me and it wasn't constantly changing ,kkiqsc

283,Got written up...after being employed for three months,i m working as quality control in a lab for the company i got hired at in september  one of the things i have to do is to monitor a production line and every 20 minutes or so grab a sample and run some tests on it  one of those tests being checking for expiration codes  there are also people working on that same line further down who monitor the progression of the line  this will be important later   last week  i was working and felt i was doing well for a relatively new-hire  the supervisor had said to me that she was impressed that i was picking up on the job so quickly  i was running tests  imputing data to the paperwork and excel spreadsheet  and keeping things moving smoothly  or so i thought    on my next shift the following day  the supervisor comes to me and says that there were 32 pallets of product with no expiration codes whatsoever on them  i told her that as i had been doing my checks  the codes were clear and legible  she said that there were absolutely no codes from 4 48 am until after 7 00 am when the next shift took over  i got sent the write-up paperwork and was told today  12 23 20  to fill it out and submit that i had seen it  read it  and accepted it    after having done so  i came onto my shift tonight  i told a coworker  who has been training me for the last two months  about it and she was really skeptical about it  we wrote down all the pallet info and went to the warehouse to find these 32 pallets to try and see what was really happening  they weren t with the rest of the pallets from that night  my trainer is sure that the parent company to the one we re working for wouldn t be okay with wasting 32 pallets worth of product and i agree  we also couldn t figure out where they would have put them in any case  we were able to find a pallet and a half sitting in a random spot in the warehouse from that night  all of the cases had legible  clear codes from around 5 00 am  10-15 minutes later than the alleged time that the codes disappeared   i can t help but wonder what really happened  i wanted to be shown proof  but the supervisor didn t have any  so i got written up  with no verbal warning  about something that i have minimal training on  not only that  but the people down the line from me didn t report anything or stop the line at all to fix the issue they would have been able to easily see   all of this is aggravating beyond belief  as i feel that were there really an issue that needed to be fixed  one of us would have caught it and said something about it  my biggest complaint is about the write-up  if there was indeed a problem  why wasn t i shown evidence of it  why wouldn t they want to rub my nose into the proverbial carpet to prevent this kind of thing from happening again  i certainly would love some proof  but as i m brand new  i have no political weight in the company to throw around yet ,kj9w01

321,C-PTSD making it hard to even want to try,so i've been lurking the subreddit for a bit and feel this is an ok place for this  about a year ago i had a major breakdown  due to a mixture of childhood trauma i hadn't dealt with and workplace anxiety trauma  i used to be a super social butterfly and confident  now i'm a potato  i am in therapy etc  and was approved for 2 years of long term disability    i have 1 more year to figure out what to do and i honestly have zero clue what the hell i want from life  i am estranged from my crazy family and married to an amazing man    part of me wants to have a low effort job because i honestly dont think my brain could handle much more    part of me wants to try and find somthing i enjoy and hopefully get us to a point where on or both of us work from home    and a third part of me wants to just give up and live off disability   make artwork  take care of the house etc  im honestly very worried i'd not qualify anyway though and i would have a hard time with the stigma   i'm not a  lazy  person  i just have legitimate anxiety attacks in public now and i can't just call off when i'm having a bad time nor can i have a panic attack while at work twice or 3 times a week    used to work for a developmental disability center for the state- which scarred me out of what i'd wanted to do since i can remember  be a therapist    i'm sorry if this made no sense  im just trying to maybe get some advice or know im not the only one  i have been working on myself for a year now  its been weird and hard because i just dont feel like myself anymore    please go easy on me  gt lt ,kjdgrg
322,Frustrations,i sadly don t believe i have the option to quit work as much as i would want to pursue my art full time  i have medications that i require to live and i m still hesitant to part ways with a roof over my head   i had to work today  went in for 4 dumb hours where i pretended to be busy since this job doesn t actually have enough of anything to do  it s garbage and it s not hard to see how much of this job could be automated  if things were set up right i could show up work half the time and get twice the work done if they just dodd this the right way  sadly we all know that even if that were the case they sure as shit wouldn t pay me as much    i came home to my lovely girlfriend who kinda lives how i dream to   i unintentionally enabled her to not work at all while she is home whilst i work full time to pay both our bills  i know this paints a bad picture of her but we are working through her mental struggles and ideally neither of us should have to work full time to make our financials work  i also could have an opportunity to pursue school in hopes of working less  i love my art and wish i could just do that  live in the middle of nowhere with a garden and maybe some chickens  working via my art only just enough to pay for things like internet video games etc   i hate that minimalist lifestyles are the most expensive  i have all this energy to make something and enough spite to fight my way to a nicer life but i just don t know how  my arts isn t appealing and going to school for it leaves me in debt destined to work to pay it off  i hate that these diseases i require medication for in order to  live ropes me into the hellish  lifestyle  work enforces   i m still so young and i don t want this to be my fate  what path do i follow towards my dream cabin in the woods  why is it so hard ,kjucsv
323,My coworker just got chewed out for SITTING DOWN.,yep  you read that right    i work in a warehouse and we spend most of our days inventorying sorting through pieces of tech  my team got assigned to this massive gaylord box full of cables that we needed to sort through  so we all stood around the box and got to work    one of my coworkers decided to sit down while sorting through the cables since there was a chair near him  he wasn t working slower than us at all- we were all going at pretty much the exact same pace and he was working just as fast sitting as he was standing up    our boss s wife saw him sitting on the security cameras and decided to  have a word with him  very loudly  in front of all of us    you got that right  my coworker got berated in front of everybody just for  sitting down  even though it made no difference in his work output    by the way  did i mention warehouse employees at my company never come into contact with customers  so it s not like they cared about keeping up a  hardworking  appearance  they just honest to god did not want my coworker to be more comfortable while he worked    fuckkkkk this place,kis12z

343,"I did nothing, and it was everything I thought it could be.",  so  a few years back i was working yet another temp job  who knew temping could be a career choice      my first day  the supervisor told me to sit with another employee because she didn't have time to train me  and my desk wasn't ready  same thing the next day  third day  my desk was ready  so they showed me how to log into the computer  check email and such   still no training  the other person i was sitting with was busy  so he said to just sit at my desk until the supervisor was ready to train me  i finished the first week  no training  supervisor signed my timecard and i'm thinking  easy week      next week  i check in on monday  and the supervisor says wait at my desk and she'll come get me when she has time to train me  so i sit  thursday morning  same thing as monday  go wait at your desk  ok  she signs my timecard on friday  i'm thinking  another easy week   by this time  i am surfing the internet all day reading up on my new video game  world of warcraft  more easy money      third week  monday  same thing  supervisor says i don't need to keep bugging her about training  she'll come get me when she has time to train me  i figure  no problem  i'll go sit in my cube at the dead end of a row so hidden that no one comes by my desk  i have a window with a view to seattle's harbor  i can see the boats coming in and out all day  so i got that going for me at least  not too shabby  and i wait  and wait  and wait   every week she signs my time card  and i surf the internet  lots of warcraft sites and make notes to improve my wow game      after  nine months  a consultant comes by my desk  literally the first person to come by my desk since i started  he says he has to have a chat with me about my internet usage  i found out that the consultants had come through to make things more efficient  where have i seen this before  i knew i had done nothing but surf the web for 9 months  and thought well  it was a good run  had to close out sometime  but the consultant and i shared a common interest in world of warcraft  so he cut me a break and said he'd wipe my history out of his report before he sent it in  just so long as i wasn't surfing gaming sites after the next monday  i'd be in the clear  i thanked him and even powerleveled him in wow after he jumped over to my server      so the next week  i start bringing in audio books  i come in  log into my computer  listen to audiobooks from the library for 8 hours waiting for my supervisor to train me  every week  she signs my timecard  every week i wait for 40 hours  not really wondering anymore if she is going to teach me what to do      a year and 3 months go by  they call everyone in to say that our company had been bought out by a larger delivery service  and they will be shutting down the branch  it will take about 6 months to get things sorted out  i continue to do my same thing of showing up every day  listening to audiobooks from the library and wondering when i will get the axe  5 months go by  and my supervisor is laid off       her supervisor says to just keep doing what we're doing and bring our time cards to him to sign until they tell us to leave  this goes on for another month until he tells me that this will be the last week  i look sad  but he says not to worry  he'll give me a good recommendation  i brighten up and that's pretty much that    i spent a year and six months at that assignment  and i did  literally nothing  the entire time     i did nothing  and it was everything i thought it could be  was never more apt     the next best part was the next monday i got a call from my temp service  and the same company  under new management now  had another assignment for me   they needed someone who could work without supervision on a project that would take a year to a year and a half  maybe more to finish  i would be boxing up 30  years of employee records from the bought out company to send to be scanned        it took me about a month to clear out the hr file cabinets in the same building i had been  working  in  when they sent me to the warehouse where the rest of the records were stored  i saw what they meant by the  it would take over a year  --- massive rows of racks 12 feet high  i was tasked with doing it all  solo   i had complete discretion to figure out how to get it done  i wanted to find out how much work was actually here  i spent the day just counting boxes      then i did the math and figured out that all i needed to do was box up  actually just seal up and prepare to be shipped  3 boxes an hour  then it would take me about 15 months to clear the whole warehouse  and i would still be 3 months ahead of schedule  the first day of actual work  i finished an entire 8 hour days' worth of work in less than half an hour      so the next day  i brought in my laptop  connected into the wifi of the starbucks next door and played world of warcraft for 7 hours  each day  i would bust out my work in a half hour and the rest of the day was mine  i would take a few minutes every so often to move some boxes out to the dock space they set aside for me and then it was time to level characters and have fun in wow      another year and 5 months went by as the warehouse slowly cleared  no one was signing my timecards  i just sent them in  i was told when someone was coming by  so i saved all my activity for those times  no one ever came in other than prearranged scheduled visits  it was glorious  almost 3 years of paychecks  stellar references from the employer and i did absolutely nothing  and almost nothing and just collected my steady paycheck   good times ,kih33o

366,Employer conundrum / a rant,tl dr  my employer made an accounting error  is trying to make amends and  allegedly  avoid potential legal issue   i can likely ask for what i want  but what i want is a way out of this shit  not a new package  the fuck do i do now    without going into obscene detail  i worked in a professional office setting  and left the company country to pursue something completely different  after a few years  shit happened and i needed to come back home  and also chose to go back to my employer  i worked out a unique deal with my employer which gave me tremendous freedom of schedule time hours worked  no benefits  to which i agreed  but complete with your typical profit-driven  dehumanizing attitude about work  the work itself is very tedious  and frankly  boring   over the years since returning  so has the malaise about the job itself  not sure if it s the actual work  the toxic environment  or my own existential crisis that life is more than 40 hours a week of making profit for others    in these years since returning  to put it plainly  my employer fucked up  they are legally required to provide certain benefits  even if part-time  which i technically was due to previously mentioned situation  and they didn t  i brought it up  they  fixed it  but it still wasn t correct  brought it to them again  finally fixed it    since that experience  though  some other bullshit has happened regarding benefits  i reached a tipping point last week where more negligence was shown by my employer  and i had to get loud     i exploded on them  as professionally as possible  while still conveying my message  and pretty much said   i have been patient and gracious with your misgivings  and then you have the audacity to say that your errors happened because i m the only employee with this situation  as though that excuses their violation of law    so  we are in talks  they are  trying to make things right  i have an opportunity to probably name my package at this point  as they  likely  fear litigation  even though that s not really something i want would do    my heart knows i want need to leave  my finances  student loan debt  45k  mortgage  109k  tell me otherwise  and  even if i did leave  i have no real goals inspirations dreams to pursue    i don t even have a question to ask at the end of this i just feel confused  conflicted  scared  and depressed  and i know a lot of others here do  too  i m not lazy  i m not anti-labor  i m anti-fucking people over  wringing them out of their energy  time  mental health  and their lives  just to turn a profit  but i also don t see a way out ,kincsw

369,So what’s your plan?,i doubt that any real change to the system is going to come for many years  if ever  so in my more optimistic moments i try to think about my plan for getting out of the 40 hour work week system  i d love to hear your plans  too  so far the possibilities in my mind are   - work at my current job for 5 more years or so  while continuing to live in my tiny  rent controlled apartment - then switch to working part-time and living partially off of my savings  would probably have to stay in my tiny apartment or move to another more affordable city for this to work  though  and live very frugally but i pretty much do that anyway    - again  work for a few more years  then mayyybe go back to school so i can eventually get a job i might actually care about  i m thinking about something in the social work area  but who knows  i ve heard the burnout in those areas is huge so it might be as bad as   worse than the meaningless corporate jobs i ve had   - either way i ll continue to work on writing  amp  recording music which is the only thing i really love to do  and i guess there is an off chance there that i ll become financially successful doing that someday  but it s a small chance and i never want to actively try to monetize this one thing that i care about for fear of taking the joy out of it  i could make many other posts purely about how cruel the system is for people who make art of any kind  and how i think the reality is less  oh it s so sad that so many artists are mentally tortured individuals who end up killing themselves  and more  our society makes life incredibly punishing for artists and they often see no other way out  but alas    what about you guys ,kj0cmq

387,Our two main issues 101,i was thinking of this since some times  i share with you my thoughts of our two main issues and a way to resolve it   i'll try to make it short and clear  but if you don't want to read   tl dr  our miserable lives are caused by wage labor and property system  why lot of us need a job  to pay rent  without rent  i'm not sure we'll spend 7  hours day in a  bullshit job    introduction   life is a struggle  in our modern life  we are most of the time in a hurry  always having something to do  less time for ourselves and other and it's not rare to feel alone   tons of people are stressed  on burnout  sad and sometimes want to end their life to end the struggle   lot of them think issues and struggle of their lives are caused by immigrants  religion  unions  employees  employers  etc   we have indeed social and political issues  but some are bigger than other  and paradoxically  it seems that the bigger they are  the lesser we see them   a question can be now asked  what are our main issues    we have two main issues  wage labor and property     concerning wage labor  why are we working   first of all  we need to define what is a job  a job is a kind of work  but a work isn't necessary a job    when you go shopping  do the cashier yourself to pay your groceries  cook a meal in your apartment  you  work  when you raise your child  you  work  when you make a youtube video  learn a new language  draw something you like  read a book to increase your knowledge  etc  you are still  working   the work don't need to be paid or be a job  and can be done with total freedom    job  is a specific kind of work when you accept to submit yourself to another person and give it your life hours in exchange of a salary  we can say it's a contract between a slave and a master  it's an human exploitation by another human being   most of us have to be employed because we have no capital  and sometimes we have debts   people can tell you  it's not slavery  you're free to accept and contract  in fact   you have a choice between starving or selling yourself to a tyranny https m youtube com watch v ir1jzexz9t0     jobs  haven't a good pay  we are slaves from others  selling our time to other so they can achieve their dreams  so  why are we still needy to having a job   because we need to pay for food and for rent    salaries are low  so sometimes  in worst cases  you don't have enough and need to have loans  generating more slavery in the system    concerning property system  why do we need to pay rent   well  you can say  because people have some properties and i don't  but why you don't have one and other have  why can't you just take some space of a land and build your house   because in this case  you're no longer needy and don't have to spend 7  hours a day to pay a rent  of course  you'll have to pay other bills of you want some services  gas  electricity  water  etc  but working few hours can be enough   yes   working  because without a damocles sword  you are free to do what you want  you can work on something you like  spend hours you want and having enough money to pay what you want   so  property system lead us to live in other property apartment or house  pay a rent for it  need a job to pay the rent  so being slaves    what we can do  in my opinion  for now  the best things to do is to read and to learn  understand why we are in this situation  and think about plans to change the system    property system is the main trouble  but it'll be hard to change it    in fact  our generation isn't the first one having trouble with this  labor  system  mens and women are fighting for centuries   here a 101 reading   orestes brownson   the laboring classes    1840    gt  wages is a cunning device of the devil for the benefit of tender consciences who would retain all the advantages of the slave system without the expense  trouble and odium of being slaveholders   they must be no class of our fellow men doomed to toil through life as mere workmen at wages  if wages are tolerated it must be  in the case of the individual operative  only under such conditions that  by the time he is of a proper age to settle in life  he shall have accumulated enough to be an independant laborer on his own capital  on his own farm or in his own shop   extract from the  journal of united labor  the official organ of the order of the knights of labor  1885    gt the alarming development and aggressiveness of great capitalists and corporations  unless checked  will inevitably lead to the pauperization and hopeless degradation of the toiling masses it is imperative  if we desire to enjoy the full blessings of life  that a check be placed upon unjust accumulation  and the power for evil of aggregated wealth this much-desired object can be accomplished only by the united efforts of those who obey the divine injunction   in the sweat of they face shalt thou eat bread therefore we have formed the order of knights of labor  for the purpose of organizing and directing the power of the industrial masses  not as a political party  for it is more - in it are crystallized sentiments and measures for

394,"The best and worst supervisor I ever had (or, why I am anti-work)",years ago  i had a great supervisor  i'll call her janine  she made sure our workloads were manageable and we grew their skills  she shielded us from company politics  as long as you got your work done  she didn't care what you did  whether you came in late  etc  she wasn't just a team manager  she understood the actual work too  and she was very smart and talented  i really liked her as a person  she was the best supervisor i ever had   fast forward a few years  we had both left that company  i wasn't too happy with my new work situation  we happened to catch up and janine said  there's an opening at my company  why don't you come work with me again  so i did with great excitement   i was tasked with working on a complex project that was behind schedule and a bit of a disaster  two weeks in  janine asked whether i had completed a list of items  i hadn't   that's not acceptable  she said  i was taken aback and thought  crap  i'm totally dropping the ball here  i worked harder  every meeting  she made it very clear that i wasn't making enough progress  at one point i said  can we be honest for a minute  there's a ton of stuff to fix and finish  and you know our team can't move any faster  she said   these are the deadlines  get it done  i still remember the cold look on her face when she said that to me   it got so stressful i started keeping a bottle of antacid on my desk and would pop them every few minutes  i talked to hr and the first thing they said was  let's talk about what you're doing wrong   they actually said that  turns out janine had made a lot of promises and was under intense pressure from the head of the company to launch the project by a certain date  she knew there was no way it would happen  so she was throwing me and a few other people under the bus   people on the team quit  i gave notice soon after  janine herself left shortly after that   months later  i ran into her on the street  i was stunned when she seemed happy to see me and gave me a hug  we made small talk and somehow avoided talking about our last work experience together  she didn't look healthy  later  i heard from mutual friends that she was on meds and hadn't been doing well  she was in complete denial that she had treated us so badly  she wasn't working regularly  i'd been extremely angry  but after seeing her  i felt deeply sorry for her instead   the best and worst supervisor i ever had were the same person  the system of wage slavery will turn anyone into a monster  nowadays i'm glad when i get along with my supervisors  but i never  ever trust them  because i know it just takes the right combination of hierarchy  pressure  and desperation for them to do a 180 and screw people over  and that combination is  sadly  all too common ,kjll0m
395,How to not want to die every second?,sorry if this doesn t belong here and if this is triggering but i don t know where else to vent about this  i feel alone in my values and how absolutely drained i am from having to work to live  i feel like maybe a handful of my friends understands how i feel but they are also incredibly bogged down and hopeless and i don t like to put negativity on them and constantly complain  how the hell does anyone keep going when all of this is pointless and we are just cogs to this capitalistic dystopia  i don t see the point  i can barely spend time on the things that i m passionate about and when i do it feels like i have to force it rather than just laying down and sleeping forever  i don t know how to function in this society and at any job i do  the time i can spend working at a job becomes less and less each time  i keep quitting and thinking i ll find something i enjoy but i really just don t want to work  but that s not even a possibility so i end up back at the same point which is what the fuck is the point of any of this and how do i prevail while feeling hopeless and bitter about this society every single moment of my existence  please don t bash me or tell me to suck it up because that s not helpful at all,kiwd7p

397,I stopped working early!,hi   i only recently discovered this subreddit  and i find myself wanting to speak up and say i did it   almost six years ago i took  early retirement  from my stressful career  and only one person totally supported my decision  fortunately that person was just starting a career and genuinely wanted to help me fulfill my dream of not having to work full time ever again   i couldn t have made it on my tiny income without help  and i know how lucky i am    i was originally raised to believe that i would be a housewife and mother unless i became a nurse or a teacher  by the time i hit college age  the expectations had changed dramatically and i was led to believe the most important thing i could become was self-supporting  after working for a while  i went back to graduate school and pursued  a real career   when i stopped working  i had been with last my employer for 25 years  others older than i had been there longer and planned to work til 67  they thought i was nuts to cut out without adequate income    making it without enough money has been hard at times  not gonna lie  but what s been much harder is undoing the link between my self-esteem and that lack of money and identity  i don t know if i will ever completely overcome my bouts of shame     i am capable of working  but i choose not to  is truly radical in american culture  and me  i ve always been a bit of a people pleaser  deciding i would rather pursue learning and doing things that i love but don t make me money has been both the best and in some ways the hardest thing i ve done  but i love my new introverted artist life of reading and studying  crafting and singing exploring the territory in my head i was too busy for in the past ,kho74j

402,I'm starting to think some of us here have ADHD.,look  i'm not defending the shitty work conditions that people struggle with or trying to blame that on mental illness  so please do not take this the wrong way   however i was recently diagnosed with adhd as an adult in his late 20's  i was diagnosed with it as a kid  but i was given one pill of the highest possible dosage of ritalin  it made me hyper  duh  and  that was that  as a result  i neglected my mental health for  years    for many years  i kept asking myself   why don't i have any time to do anything  i only worked part time  i have a couple hobbies but nothing time consuming  no children to raise  no college to study for  why are dishes piling up  why is the laundry not done    i look around and think  how the  fuck  are people working 40 hours a week  going to college  getting up early to jog  and raising kids on top of it  when i can't even work 20 hours a week without feeling like every second of my time is occupied with something   are these people secretly robots  did they discover a trick to never sleeping  can they pause time and just get a bunch of shit done without me knowing    the answer to that  adhd    i spent sooo much time doing fuck all and not even realizing it    it's literally like this  ya  i need to get up and do the dis-oh wow  this wikipedia article on maritime disasters of the 1700's is pretty awesome  i better check it ou- holy shit a new ask reddit thread with 3900 comments  better read them all   dishes  ya still not done    you have no concept of time when you have adhd  i can spend 6 hours on reddit and it feels like 6 minutes have passed  as a result  i usually run out of time to get anything else done   it also makes it very hard to get the things that need to get done and easier to just procrastinate  people with adhd crave dopamine  you get it by watching youtube videos  not scrubbing dishes    i've been taking ritalin for a week now and on the very first day  i did probably two weeks worth of chores  holy shit  i accomplished things    now i have all this extra free time that my brain did not even know existed  my 6 hours of shifts at work don't feel like they take a week to go by    again  work sucks  i know    but getting my mental health in check has made is somewhat tolerable  i don't wake up literally dreading going into work  feeling like i'm driving to my own execution  hoping an 18 wheeler pops a tire and drifts into my lane and runs me over    so i'm posting this in hopes other people can get the help they need  i obviously can't tell you if you have it  but if you sound like me  you may want to bring it up with your doctor    it's a night and day difference and i truly regret not doing something about it sooner ,khaf59

406,"As a member of the Left, the Left is pathetic.

407,I feel like my idea is impossible to reach...,i've been thinking of all kinds of ways to try to escape work  or to find a way to both make money and enjoy it at the very least  i don't have a lot of skills since i'm young and haven't had that many jobs  my job that i thought would be a dream come true and a career maker makes my back ache  exhausts me  and has tasks i don't really want to do at all  yes i'm lazy  i know  the business is literally the kindest  small business ever so it's not about capitalism taking advantage of me  i just hate the role of being a worker  i guess  anyway  i'm not a skilled writer or artist and i don't have knowledge everyone is begging to know  so i feel like blogging or making something to create passive income is impossible for me  investing makes sense  however you still have to play the game to get money for investing  that doesn't feel like it solves the problem  or at least quickly enough for someone as impatient as me   i've recently thought about a concept of getting an apartment building where none of the tenants pay me  and i don't pay the tenants  instead everyone who lives in the apartment building would work cooperatively together to maintain their homes  whether it be cleaning  making meals  gardening food  maintaining electrical and plumbing  and finding ways to earn income for the apartment's costs  i kind of want to live in this place in my mind myself  each person would only work one 8 hour day a week to do chores for the apartment  i thought it would be a great way to show the world that people can thrive without fulltime work  or even maybe without part time  maybe be able to create a change in the world  but i'm broke  and i'm learning buildings can cost anywhere between  270 000 to  10 000 000  the cheaper buildings obviously only hold a small amount of people and i'd be way happier having each tenant have the support of a larger community instead of putting a ton of responsibilities on a few people  it feels so out of reach and pointless  i don't even know if i'd ever see the price of some of these places in my account for my whole life  i don't even know if a group of people can pay the costs of a whole apartment without having to work  maybe we're trapped ,kgzked

410,AITA? Thoughts on Leftist Anti-Work types in my network asking for money,i don t know  this might be unpopular   although i started seeing this long before covid  i have continued to see a large volume of leftist anti-work types in my social network taking to twitter and instagram to repeatedly ask for large volumes of money  think 4 figures  almost monthly  often times with some flimsy explanation for why they have 2 days or something to come up with an outrageous amount of money    to be clear  i m not talking about the person who needs a few hundred for their rent and takes to twitter offering landscaping  art  pet care  car service  etc but people who repeatedly ask for 4 figure  donations  every other month with no offer of reciprocity   i m a leftist anti-work type  and i have a high degree of empathy for working class people  there is something fundamentally wrong with capitalism  but we all understand that here   i have lived off of poverty wages in the past- line cook jobs  retail  manual labor  etc- and it isn t fair  or sustainable   at the same time  i can t help but be frustrated by some of these people i see in my circle repeatedly relying on gofundme pages or just throwing up a twitter post with their cashapp  looking for amounts like  500   1000   1500 to pay expenses they can foresee- not catastrophic medical expenses- but things like their rent or utilities     for context  i live in a highly developed city with over a million people and relatively low covid rates- our job market has not been absolutely decimated  and the average wage for even retail and restaurant jobs are basically sufficient to cover basic costs of living for individual adults if you re strategic about it   as more and more places stabilize operationally  basically every place has a  now hiring  sign  not to mention we have a huge gig economy  i m talking about survival here  not ideal situations   for additional context  a lot of these people are activist types- not quite organizers- but they spend a lot of time protesting  and some time volunteering  some work part-time  others do random jobs here and there  others are refusing to work amidst covid  i think the activism and volunteering is awesome  but at the same time  when i see anti-work people  repeatedly  relying on their network of sympathetic leftists to cover expenses they know they have- like food and rent- all the while not taking a step back and maybe strategizing how they re going to provide for themselves within or in spite of the capitalist paradigm  it pisses me off for three reasons   1  it s bad optics   obviously some people in their social network are not going to be leftist anarchist anti-work types  and people already have a hard enough time understanding what we mean when we speak of  abolishing work   to have your brand be anti-work leftism  and simultaneously be critically unable to provide for yourself in a public way  it totally feeds into the stereotype society constructs of people with our ideology  2  when you re constantly looking for  donations  you re effectively saying  work is bullshit  and i don t want to do it  but i ll benefit off of the labor of other people  and to me  that s bullshit  and not in accordance with leftist principals  mutualism only functions when everyone is acting in good faith and is striving to provide as much value as they take  that s where the  mutual  part comes in  if you re anti-work and that leads you to rejecting the wage labor paradigm  that s great  but you aren t rejecting the wage labor paradigm by refusing to provide for yourself and then appealing to the sympathies of leftists who do sell their labor so you can pay your rent while living the leftist fantasy that our society just can t support   you re quite literally benefiting off of the labor of other people  and to me that s sort of cringe leftism  3  i generally hate the argument like  i saw a guy paying for groceries with food stamps and he took out a brand new iphone  but i ve known some of these leftists for years  and i ve seen them drink  smoke  and snort up thousands of dollars right in front of my eyes  cover themselves with expensive tattoos  i m heavily tattooed as well  so i m not criticizing actually being tattooed  but spending  300 on a tattoo when you don t have 3 months living expenses saved up is just irresponsible let s be honest  and buy trendy clothes from online boutiques   i get that we re humans and we naturally want some luxuries  but at some point we have to be realistic about the role that our personal choices play in exacerbating our financial problems   nobody can plan for a pandemic  but if we're being honest  many of these people ostensibly allowed themselves to be one missed paycheck away from destitution not because they have some outrageous financial obligation like children or a chronic illness  but because pre-covid they were running up  20 bar tabs 4-5 nights week  renting trendy apartments in areas of town they could barely afford to live in when there are cheaper neighborhoods  and keeping a half pack a day habit  and that really makes it hard for me to be sympathetic sometimes  i m not trying to pat myself on the back  but when i was working for terrible wages  i learned how to safely salvage food and supplies from dumpsters  sharing what i couldn't use with friends  wore thrift store clothing until they fell apart  and took every opportunity i could to make an extra buck and stow it away because i appreciated that the world doesn t accommodate this ideology  and it s not right to rely on the charity of other people who are out there struggling too when you are a single  able bodied  childless person in an area with relatively stable economic opportunities  and you are capable of keeping a roof over your head and food on your table   of course the system should be different  but it isn t yet  and i just don t have a ton of sympathy for some of these people   anybody else feel similarly  or am i just the asshole here ,kgo8jd

413,Help with resignation letter needed!,good morning all   i'll be deleting this after a while for obvious reasons but i've been sitting in this for a while and need some outside views   i've had issues with my boss for a while  when i came back from maternity leave  her daughter wanted my job and they proceeded to bully me 2 years ago    daughter left  boss went on sick  came back and then the pandemic hit and my boss went off shielding for 5 months  i believe she would have gotten me out earlier had she not been away for so long and each time she did i was the back bone of the office despite earning a fraction of what my colleagues earn  most experienced   my boss found out she was being moved recently to another location and really upped her game  putting me down  lying about my work  overworking me and then calling me for meetings if i dropped the ball at all   finally i had enough and took time off sick due to the stress only to find out the most recent meeting was the start of an investigation wherein the next step is disciplinary and probable sacking  i have no prior issues on file  just the fact that head office have taken this seriously has taken away any shred of love i had for the job  especially as they knew about the awful things they put me through when i came back from mat leave and also  the deputy who told me she supported me and that this was bullying and sabotage has backed off and isn't supporting me although now my boss has left  she has taken her position  if i go back  i'll be the backbone of the office again and i feel used and bullied  i also can't face pulling the place through another pandemic as we had an outbreak last time  healthcare    i have a meeting tomorrow  but i'm not going  i'm not going to 'defend' myself or explain myself  i don't want to   so i need to send probably my resignation via email  if i don't attend  a decision may be made in my absence and frankly they can have at it  i'm going to stay at home and take care of my child and be happy   but i don't know whether to let them make their decision and just tell them i'm not attending or to resign  and if i resign  i don't know whether to address the points in the investigation and that i think it's disgusting that this is way they treat they're 'essential' workers who worked through the first wave of the pandemic  while they're all hiding at home only to come out when it's safe and bully people  that the foundation of the companies values are being mocked with their very actions and inaction against a proven bully  or just to say  'i resign and won't be attending the meeting' after which i would like to go no contact    thanks for reading ,kgs2uu

431,(rant) work culture in japan and corporatism,hello  this is my first time posting on this sub so forgive me if i miss any rules etc   i just really needed to let out some anger on the capitalist systems abusing and exploiting people but dont really have anyone to rant to    amp x200b   i had to leave my old job because of covid and havent had to work for a few months  i felt so free but at the same time nervous and anxious about when i had to start working again and going back to those days   unlike other countries  9-6 or 8-5 is the norm here and even that is not enough for the japanese companies  they expect employees to be willing to work overtime for them  it's like the bare minimum requirement  i heard it's been getting better compared to before but i doubt it'll get any better by the time i die at this rate of improvement   i don't mind working if it's necessary for society to function but to the point that we live and breath work  there's barely any time left to do anything when you're home when you include the time it takes to get there  time to shower  cook and eat etc  then during the weekends you barely have enough time to rest your mind and do all the housework  groceries etc  there's not enough time to do things that i want to do  not to mention the anxiety and just stress from having to deal with people  co-workers  customers  bosses idk  all the time and constantly under the pressure and expectation to perform pointless tasks  why do we have so little control over our lives    amp x200b   the worst part and what brought me to the boiling point today are the taxes  we have a bunch of different types of taxes and it's confusing for normal people like me  most of the people here if you are employed full-time   - seishain  the company takes care of the taxes for you  deducted from your pay  so people don't really pay attention to it  i paid attention to it but it wasn't as bad when i was working  total of about  500-600 every month deducted  so since i quitted my job  i did research on the tax and stuff i had to do after i quit to deal with the taxes  visiting the town hall and doing a bunch of paperwork   you can get tax reduced for a few months if u lose your job to covid   and thought i was prepared to deal with the tax problems after i quit   to help clarify things i've compared the amount of tax i had to pay while i was a full-time employee vs now that i'm out of work   full-time employee   pension tax  150  health insurance tax  150  resident tax  120  income tax  150    amp x200b   and here's how much i'm expected to pay as an unemployed  pension tax 350  health insurance tax 350  resident tax   i had no idea how much resident tax was until today when an enveloped arrived in my mailbox  the bill wrote  650  my heart sunk the moment i saw that  and this does not include consumer tax that has been increasing every now and then   my pension tax and health tax will be temporarily reduced as covid relief  but what about workers who did not leave their work due to covid  how are they supposed to live   how does it make sense that someone who is working full-time making decent money pay 3-4x less tax than someone who just lost their job  and the worst part is apparently the rich are paying even less  i honestly considered taking my life after seeing that bill how am i supposed to live while being forced to puke out  1400  every month with 0 income  i thought i had more time with the money i saved up over the 4 years i worked but this is just retarded  fuck this capitalist bullshit and corporate crap    amp x200b   here's a video i found explaining some stupid tax stuff in japan   https www youtube com watch v rnylo5jdojm https www youtube com watch v rnylo5jdojm   i've also watched an hour plus documentary about how the national bank of japan and ministry of finance fucked up the economy during the last bubble and even now they are not willing to help fix it and make live better for everyone despite printing money out of thin air  have you heard of the go to travel campaign in japan where the goverment is paying people to travel  yeah they rather spend that money to help their corporate buddies in the travel business than help out homeless people and salaryman slaving their lives away 20 hours a day 7 days a week   amp x200b   i'm so sick of this country and this world,ki2prt

global level  can most people understand nuclear physics or string theory  probably not  but our intellectual jealously can make us feel insignificant and useless  the effect of it is strengthened when you go from people of average intelligence to people with learning disabilities or levels of intellectual disabilities that allow them to co-exist with society but possibly through help of an aide or guardian  if we rewind to a simpler time  before the industrial revolution  or the period of enlightenment to when most people harvested grains  raised livestock  etc  those with learning disabilities would have had a much easier life  they would not have needed to know as much information as required to exist in today s society  the internet serves as both a blessing and a curse  we now have access to almost all of humanity s knowledge  and can even walk around with it in our pocket  however  that does that show us  we can go onto youtube and see people who can do anything better than us  it does not make us feel important  or as if we have a purpose in life  you can work years becoming an expert violinist  and then find someone five years old who can play it better than you  as the population of earth expands  this only worsens  talent is becoming worthless because more and more people can now do something  something that maybe 50 years ago  only one person could do well  how do you top that  you cannot  so what do we do  life cannot stop  you cannot go around telling people  ok  that s it  no more advancing  how do you deal with the people left in evolution s dust  every human life has value and should feel important  but how can they feel accepted  we are a motivated species  we are motivated to do  something  but you can ask yourself  why bother doing it  what are we all doing here anyway  you can only accomplish so much in life  you probably will not even get recognized for it  but is that the point of life  to have your name engraved on a trophy  to be acknowledged  life has a start and an end  so what are you supposed to have done by the end  are you supposed to have things done  people say   i regret not  but what point does it matter if you are dead  about 150 000 people die every day  did you know any of them  will anyone remember their name 100 years from now  what did they accomplish  life places a heavy expectation on us to do something  we have to do at least a few things  we have to work  we need money in order to live  we cannot do nothing  we will die of starvation or be homeless if we just sit absolutely still  we do however feel the need to survive  otherwise we would feel no fear  we would simply kill ourselves if we felt life was pointless  some people actually do this  but most people generally are happy and live a long life  so we can at least do the absolute minimum  go to work  brush our teeth  feed ourselves  put on clothes  listen to music or do something that puts our mind at ease  the other side of this would be being famous  a world leader or a renowned inventor  but even doing the most basic things are more complex now than ever  we need somewhere to live  and that generally requires money  we cannot just put up a hut somewhere and claim that spot as our own  whoever owns that area of land would have you arrested for trespassing  we have to buy food because the food we eat does not grow in the wild anymore  it is cultivated  we cannot make a spear and hunt wild animals  that requires a license  this is only scratching the surface of all the requirements it takes to be even the most basic person in today s world  it is no wonder why people have so many issues with mental health  life is no longer simple  society itself demands from us and our goal in life is to fill that demand  we cannot even rest anymore without feeling guilty  those dishes need washed  the trash needs taken out  that new season of your favorite tv show needs watched  you need to buy more food  you need to scroll through your feed  the list goes on and on  how did we get this way  complexity should be making life easier  we have all sorts of machines and technology and gadgetry at our disposal  yet it now takes more time to exist than it did 300 years ago  there is now more entertainment than ever before and consuming it takes time  we cannot even decide which tv show to watch or podcast to listen to because there are thousands and thousands of them now  it would take your entire lifetime to even consume a tiny fraction of all media content  deciding which career you wish to pursue can even be a daunting task because who knows if it will be replaced by ai 10 years from now  even applying for a job can be difficult because there are 100 more people that want your job  you new refrigerator can connect to wi-fi  heck  even your car now can  the people who graduated automotive or refrigeration school 10 years ago would not even know how to fix those complex problems  it would require an electronics engineer  so now there are automotive electronics engineers and refrigeration electronics engineers  but what if we took all this way  suddenly there would be mass unemployment  now life is less about doing something and more about making money  does the need to fill jobs stem innovation  or does innovation find a need to create more and more suddenly useful jobs  jobs that did not even exist 10 or 20 years ago  you are probably reading this now sitting behind a computer or lying in bed staring at a tiny screen  you would not have been able to do this 50 years ago  does it make you happy or feel like you are fulfilling some type of need  why do we feel the need to do any of this  are we detaching ourselves from life  do we in this very minute feel less needed to do something  how much more time do we have left to do it  the need to something is chipping away at our time to live  let us go back to the year 1500  humans did not browse facebook or post a tweet on twitter  they did not watch tv or talk to people on the phone  few people could even read or write  they worked hard yes  they hunted animals and raised crops  but at the end of the hard day they had much more free time  they felt no need to become famous or become much of anything  why did we suddenly feel such a great need to do this  it is killing us  it stresses us out  makes us depressed and racks us with anxiety and fear that we might not accomplish anything of note before death  we have to keep up with everyone  society tells us so  we are brainwashed into believing we cannot be happy without spending money  people look at you weird if you walk around in torn or stained clothing  they might even think less of you  we are becoming biologically programmed to look down upon others  we look down upon other races  people with less money  people who are ugly or have some kind of physical or mental abnormality  we do this thanks to complexity  if we cannot stand on the backs of other people  we cannot feel like we are getting ahead  so it rewards us mentally to believe we are doing better than other people  but at the same time  it destroys our wellbeing because we still feel like we are still very much behind  but this cannot go on forever because we are still advancing  and we will reach a point where the majority of the things we need to do in life can be put on autopilot  so much of our life will become automated and then what happens  do we commit genocide against the people who aren t smart enough to be on the bleeding edge of technology  does society and civilization as we know it collapse  do we just pay everyone to not work anymore  at that point  if money comes from labor and labor is reduced exponentially  how are we going to obtain money  we cannot just keep doing more and more things  we will run out of time and then probably develop a way to fool the human body into thinking it slept 8 hours every night  or humans could possibly merge with machine  or we could find ways to live much longer than we do now by slowing down aging and eradicating disease  however that does not solve anything  it just gives us more time to consume and to do more work if work still even exists  it would completely eliminate the feeling of needing to be alive  we are put here not to consume media or work  we are put here to enjoy  enjoy time with our friends  our family and our romantic partners  how often do you hear people say   i wish we had more time to do things  or  is it just me  or is time going faster  no  it s not  your time spent enjoying is being stripped away by the second every day  by the minute ever year  and by the hour every decade  life grows more complex and you cannot have complexity without time ,kgcbdi

BEND OVER !!,after being laid off 10 months ago because of covid   i finally got a new job   this means i have to throw away 12 hours of my personal hours just to follow rube goldberg clearance form protocols    i have been working on returning background forms since 10am today  so nearly a 12 hour day   i had to go over to a friends house across town to use their scanner and printer   not all of us can afford a scanner  printer  and a legal license for adobe acrobat professional   the scanner wouldn't scan multiple pages to one document and it would only scan to images  jpg  not  pdf   so i had to   1  print out each page  2  sign and date and fill out the forms with a pen  3  scan each of the 8 pages into individual  jpg image files  4  reassemble the images into their respective documents in word  insert  gt  image  gt etc   5  then have word save them as  pdf 6  then had to zip them  7  then encrypt the zip file with a password  8  send the zip file as an attachment with a special naming convention  9  then send a separate email pointing to the zip file email i just sent with the password for the zip file     i swear hr of most businesses don't know how to use the tools of the trade   in this era of covid telework  you would think that people would implement full use of  pfx files  personal information exchange  files for certified signatures and digital signing   i believe the majority of  hr professionals  do not know an adobe acrobat pdf  portable document format  file from a piece of toilet paper   and god forbid they got proper training in the use adobe acrobat to make legally acceptable and fillable forms    so its on the backs of labor and the broke to come up with access to a printer and scanner and an adobe acrobat professional license     this is fucking ridiculous   i don't see how anyone can start a job much less deal with the incompetence of the people who are currently employed and holding the keys to you not being a homeless person   seriously   if this doesn't work  i don't want or will not accept this job   i've done too much already    the way i see it  they owe me fucking 12 hours of pay or leave already    this job already smells of me  doing everything the right way by the book and getting raped and fucked over for it   fuck america    fuck  business  let it all fail   capitalism can suck a cheetah's dick ,kfzfzh

587,[RANT] I've come to some realisations about my relationship with work and that traditional jobs just don't work for me. I think the world of sex work is going to be a much more liberating and less degrading place.,i'm sorry for the very long post  i've just got lots of feelings and need to put them out into a group of people who see things somewhat similarly to me  this is also kind of a work biography going through each of my jobs and how they ruined my faith in work   sex work has always been the kind of thing i've joked about doing but something that i'd never actually considered doing as a means to actually earn an income  over the last few weeks though i've actually been thinking about doing it as a living  more specifically escorting   i've grown up in a fairly middle class household  always having secure housing  parents having work  never needing to worry especially about money as a kid  i even ended up going to a grammar school  not through heavy tutoring or anything  i just showed up and got lucky on the test  i was always seen as a gifted boy  then things began to not work out as well  i could never concentrate at school  i didn't do homework or anything like that  for gcses i did great  got plenty of a s  but i got kicked out of school after my as results weren't good enough  i just couldn't work in a classroom environment  i couldn't pay attention  i couldn't absorb information and i couldn't write large amounts  something was just not right   i then enrolled in a college to do an it course  it was a btec or something like that  as i'd grown interested in computers and hardware in my time at home  i spent 4 months in that course then came to a realisation  i already knew all of the shit they were teaching  i then looked through the curriculum  i knew all that too  apart from programming but that was never my thing  so i just left the course  i'm not spending 2 years on a course that will teach me nothing of any use    i ended up just applying to jobs and apprenticeships  i ended up getting one with a little isp doing tech support for customers  i actually enjoyed it for the first couple of months  then it went downhill  i on many occasions was the only person with technical knowledge in work at that time  having literally 2 months experience and being the sole tech person for 6 000 customers is not a fun time  i couldn't keep up with ticket writing or form filling  i couldn't pay attention enough  i'd forget customer names  but most of all  i was just so exhausted  i got let go after 4 months for turning up late after working 2 hours unpaid overtime the day before   i began to think something was wrong with me   at this point it was late november  so i decided to get a christmas job in a sainsbury's  there was basically no interview process or training  i sat in a room and watched a video for 3 hours  most of which was about things completely irrelevant to me  then i was told to shadow someone for a few hours  they showed me how the till worked and that was it  next day i was on the till  it was the most stressful job i've ever done  on my third day i had a panic attack on the till because there was a huge queue  i'd given someone the wrong change  i couldn't open the till until i'd finished with the next customer because stupid design  my line manager wasn't responding  the christmas songs were blaring and the  please prepare to push the trolly off the end of the conveyer  announcement had been going on for 3 hours  i had a panic attack on the till   i turned up the next day to resign  i had physical symptoms from that day for nearly an entire year   i knew something was wrong  i spent ages online looking through things to see what was wrong with me  i found it  autism  it fit perfectly  it explained everything and after a year long process i got a diagnosis  high-functioning asd  that was it  there was no support  no therapy  no help  just a piece of paper and an information booklet which was just an nhs website printout    during this time period i found another job  working in a little computer repair shop  this was a job i genuinely enjoyed  at least for a while  it started with me just going there for a few saturdays to see if they liked me and to learn some stuff  after a couple of months i got offered a contract  i worked part time and enjoyed it  problem solving and all that stuff has always been enjoyable  it was still exhausting though  lots of killing time while trying to look busy and all that stupid shit    tw  ableist slurs  suicide   then one day  the owner didn't come in  after i had said goodbye to him on saturday  he went home and hung himself  i still don't know why or if i could have helped in any way  but he was a genuinely lovely guy  then the old owner took back over  the entire atmosphere changed  imagine a ukip voter and del boy were one person  that was him  one day i took a call from the advocate for an autistic guy  asking if there was any chance of doing some work experience or volunteering at the shop  so i asked the boss  who said  tell them i don't want none of those window-lickers in here  that just hurt me so much  that was literally how i came to work there  just my uncle instead of an advocate  if he knew i was autistic like the old boss did  or the other member of staff did he would treat me exactly the same  shortly after my contract ended  wasn't renewed and i left    the next and longest job i've had was working at a council as a systems engineer apprentice  i have no idea why i still needed to be employed as an apprentice with over a year's experience doing this but that's besides the point  the pay was not that bad  i got paid the over 25s minimum wage  which was definitely an upgrade  although still not really enough to move out  the work was so empty it was crazy  i'd spend entire days sitting at my desk doing absolutely nothing  but still having to pretend to be useful and active  most of my job was filling out forms  forwarding customer emails to suppliers  vice versa and deleting and undeleting social care records  on top of this  my apprenticeship was in software development  something i didn't do  and no-one on the payroll did  all software development and engineering was handled by external companies  so i couldn't do any paperwork on my apprenticeship  this was the point where my anxiety reached its peak  i'd spend 3 hours a day in the toilet at work trying to keep myself calm  the rest of the day i'd sit at my desk reading confidentiality social care records to give me something to do so i didn't go absolutely crazy  i broke laws on council property and invaded the privacy of vulnerable people so i didn't go mad   i eventually got some therapy  cbt  which i had applied for before even starting work there  it didn't work for me  which is quite common among autists  so they thought of something which could help  they told me to do something i would never do in a million years  i went to a furry meet in the middle of london with hundreds of complete strangers  i'd never had any friends  no-one really liked me  but in that massive group of people i met some who actually cared about me and that has been the thing that has most changed my life for the better  however  there was still work  work that exhausted me  meant 10 hour days  not having the energy to do anything on weekends  that was the issue that was holding down everything  my pointless job where i did nothing for 8 hours stressed out of my mind then drove an hour home so tired i regularly fell asleep at the wheel    i kept up that job for a year  until i had a complete breakdown when i had a realisation  i was transgender  the day of that  i drove into work  and then just cried in the car for 3 hours  one hour of which was on call to one of my new friends  then i booked a doctor's appointment and drove home  still crying  i spent 4 months on paid sick leave  until it ran out  then i resigned  the shock of that and the stress of work caused a heavy and suicidal depression   the depression lasted about a year  i blew through all of the money i'd saved  my parents bailed me out of  1k of credit card debt  but for that time  despite my depression  i had a really good time  i was free  i didn't have to spend the entire week in a shitty office  i could see people  i wasn't locked down to staying at home the entire time  i could spend a day or 3 round a friend's house  it was wonderful  the worst shit my chemically imbalanced brain could throw at me couldn't come close to a desk job   my favourite times during all of that was being intimate with people  it wasn't even the sex or the sensations or anything like that  it was just being wanted  having someone find me  attractive and get off and have a good time because of me  is just amazing  there were even times i was with someone who i wasn't even really attracted to or who they were wasn't appealing  but i would still suck them off or have them fuck me because making someone feel that good is beautiful   then the lockdown hit  everything stopped  i've seen a friend maybe 5 times since february and that's my ace best friend  love him  there are two good things to have come out of lockdown for me  the first was the extra  20 per week in uc  that's allowed me to start hrt privately and results are beginning to show though very nicely  8 months in now and i'm so much happier in my own skin  secondly  time to think  think about what i want to do and where i want to be  i've had an idea for a long time about doing a computer repair business  fixing pcs for old people either in their home or at my home  i'd actually been doing this for a bit before the pandemic  i could never find much work in it though  making under  100 most months and i can't see it getting much better  even if i did get more work  i would end up spending so much time doing stuff it would just be far too much work for me  i'd get exhausted again   i then just one day randomly entertained to idea of becoming an escort  and i figured out it would actually suit me very well  i'm pretty attractive  i always have been tall and lean with very clear skin  i'm perfectly okay with weird and wonderful kinks  i've done abdl and all sorts of other strange crap with people  i like to please  3  i'm a trans woman  that gives me somewhat of a niche  also having a niche as opposed to being denied jobs would be a fucking god send  what i've been doing is literally going round strangers houses when they call me  just with a bag of screwdrivers not a bag of condoms and sex toys  i love to make people feel good and get people off  i love people finding me attractive  i would get to control when i work and with who  i wouldn't have to work extremely long monotonous hours   i know there are downsides  mainly around safety  but that is just far too many benefits to give up  i just want to be able to live in a house or flat without working stupid hours and having someone else own me and be stressed out at a desk all day   being me  an autistic trans woman with adhd  literally fucking people for money seems so much less exploitative  less demeaning  more fulfilling  and more freeing than any other job i have ever had

698,The end of dreams.,wrote a piece of prose  not quite poetry   a collection of thoughts    anyhow i figured the humans here would understand      and that's what adulthood is     you can do anything you want to  they tell their six year old   but now he s 30 and crying alone at night   cause he s on ei and running out of weeks   exhausted physically   exhausted mentally   praying for apocalypse--at least then he could do something   something with finality  instead of this slow-moving-hell      shoot  or be shot   run from the zombies  amp  aliens or be bitten  captured  or killed   yes or no  off or on  dead or alive   he can deal with those   it s the in-between that s hell   where you re expected to carry on like everything is fine  despite a lack of resources that everyone denies and no one in control chooses to remedy      his parents said he could do whatever he wanted when he grew up   no one told him how hard it would be  to do what he wanted      they tell you that one day you ll be able to follow your dreams   then you get older   and they tell you after enough stepping stone jobs you ll be able to afford to go to school to learn to do what you want for a job   but then you ll need to pay off debt   and go back to school in 5 years when your field dries up   if you can afford to go back      your whole life revolving around that four word question   what do you do   to validate your existence  to pay for your housing and food  to earn your place in a world you had no choice in joining      right now you don t know what you want to do   you just know you don t dream of labour   you dream of meadows and forests   of the woods and lakes and free dental care      it s a pipe dream  they tell you      they don t tell you crises can happen at any time   they don t tell you paycheques don t keep up with inflation   they don t tell you that you need savings to be able to safely make changes in your life   so you can leave that job you hate and try something else   they leave out that to save money  you need to make enough money to cover all your expenses safely  first      they don t tell you that getting a degree in english doesn t make you instantly a writer who gets paid enough to survive--- but that sports stars and movie stars will always earn millions      they don t tell you that movie productions and sports get cancelled in a global crisis   but the 28 year old dude working at walmart is expected to keep working   that oil companies get billion dollar bail outs and the 16 year old working at dollarama is expected to get by on  14 25 an hour during a pandemic      they re so essential  so desperate  we can just exploit them   there will always be people willing to put up with abuse to earn a roof over their head  so we don t need to pay them   but no one says that      they don t tell you that from the dawn of civilization  suffering has always been here   and despite ebbing and flowing in amount  type  and quality  it s never gone away      they just keep telling you that if you try hard enough you ll succeed      they don t tell you that you ll have to break yourself mentally and physically just to get there   how much self-brainwashing is needed to  go to work  every day   they don t tell you by the time you arrive at  success   if you arrive   you re so tired and burnt you don t even care   you just want to sleep      they tell their kids to dream  but adults who dare to vocalize their dreams   they tell to sit down   and shut up  and  just do your job  it was worse when i was younger      what happened to dreaming   and when did it become an unreasonable goal to want to actually enjoy your life  sometime before age 45      if life is all hard and terrible  why create children   and if it has joy  and the children   or the adults   say they re suffering  why do you cycle back to talking about how it s still not as bad as it used to be   how does that help them at all   don t you realize that people don t make up pain for fun   that we would rather be enjoying existing  than complaining      they tell you success  joy  it s possible      but when you try so hard to make it happen  and it still isn t working   when you can t force yourself to turn off your brain or heart to pay for the roof over your head   they blame you   they call you lazy   or liberal   or socialist   or soft   because  hard   tough  good people don t need free healthcare or a quality life  they just shut up and do what s asked because   or whatever other word they turn into a slur to blame you for not being able to cope in an abusive system that depends on division  and depends on people being desperate and tolerating suffering      they make it your fault for thinking differently  like you re the bad guy  the odd  unhealthy one      but they told you to dream   and somehow despite everything you never stopped      when you were six  you dreamed of flying   being a superhero   of discovering cool inventions      now at thirty  you dream of a monday you don t cry on your way to work   a day where you won t need to apply for more jobs   a morning where you don t wake up upset to still be alive   an afternoon where you don t wonder if you ll run out of money before the 30th   a grocery store trip where you don t have to calculate the taxes perfectly before you even leave your house      see  you still dream      the difference is  now you know dreams only come true when you re asleep      and that s what adulthood is   ,ke70wr

726,I really cannot fathom this 'hardship olympics' mindset some people have,a while back there were some articles circulating about the atrocious working conditions faced by amazon workers on the packing floor  ridiculous working hours  unsafe conditions  workers collapsing  really terrible stuff   but then  as with so many other articles  there were the various brainlet voices chiming their stupid insights on the matter   'i worked twenty times harder when i was their age '  'boohoo i can work three jobs at the same time '  'just quit lmao '  i absolutely cannot wrap my head around this insane boomerific mindset  why the fuck do people like this need to try and turn 'shitty working conditions' into some kind of stupid competition  is it just some sort of egotistical backpatting  for some fictitious hardship that they never endured   nobody wants to hear it  nobody needs some self-congratulatory bullshit from someone who bought a three bedroom house for twenty bucks and a bag of onions before the market cratered  and assuming there's even any validity to their horseshit  there isn't  something being easy for an individual doesn't mean everyone can do the same   and for the 'just quit' crowd  i think it's safe to assume nobody gets into such a dreadful line of work by  choice  nobody goes through college thinking 'wow i can't wait to graduate and suffer modern serfdom in a factory ' i'm sure many of the people stuck there would quit if they could ,kdmh83

755,Your Mental Health or Access to Health Insurance - Pick Your Own Adventure,the current organization of labor mandates that people be indentured by their mere material needs for existence  of which for the majority  can only be filled by the wages levied by capital owners  that notion in itself is tantamount to an unspoken hostage-like situation  this context is made all the more egregious being that wages remain largely stagnant  or in some cases decrease in accord to reoccurring downturns in the economic cycle  this puts working people in situations where they must frugally prioritize their needs  being forced to forfeit otherwise vital components of their well-being  it is sickening to me how many people must rely upon their jobs for access to healthcare  or to be specific  access to services that mitigate the debt accrued by being treated here in the u s    not only does the very basis of this system incur suffering  that suffering is utilized to generate profits - an endless game of creating instability and selling inadequate solutions of which only serve to indebt those they're made to  help  this has been on my mind a lot recently as my mother has been going through a lot of unneeded turmoil at her workplace  thanks to trumpers who refuse to take the pandemic seriously  but feels she cannot leave as her job provides our entire family with a health care plan  just the idea of anyone having to consider this trade off makes me so fucking angry    i'll be 26 in two years  its only a matter of time until i feel her struggle  or become massively indebted if i have health issues and cannot afford a plan    if those in power want to ride this capitalism thing to its bitter end  they do realize they need workers to stay alive for that - right ,kean89

763,"""Assistance"" programs can, and often are, designed to protect capitalism, not people.",a lot of people  understandably  post from the perspective of either someone in the work force for a while or someone just entering it  i would like to offer my perspective on the assistance programs that are supposed to help people  as i've been on disability for about ten years at this point   in a country with what most would assume to be a robust and comprehensive social safety net  canada      they often sound great in theory  poor or disabled or just having trouble finding a job  get free money monthly from the guvment  sounds awesome right  the people on them are typically looked at with either jealousy for not having to work  or more commonly  extreme disdain  for  you guessed it  'being a lazy leech'      well it would be great system  if helping poor and disabled people was their actual goal  but i'd call any help they give a happy accident of their true goal      in reality that stereotype of the 'lazy leech' is often what assistance programs are built on  they are designed to  preserve the workforce  and to encourage work  regardless of how abusive  exploitative  destructive  or even deadly it is       how do they do that  by building the entire assistance system around helping as few people as possible  as little as possible  by being so difficult to both apply for and survive on that even the worst workplace starts to look like an improvement  that is their goal  to force people in need to work  as many as they possibly can    from the moment you begin the application process for those sort of programs you are treated automatically like you are trying to scam your way through at every possible point  for a whole 12k a year  if you are trying to apply for disability in addition to basic assistance  they can deny you for virtually any reason they want  and they will in the hopes that you simply give up and don't appeal their decision  the only caseworker i've ever met that seemed to genuinely see how fucked up the system is was a trainee who told me to always appeal if denied because he had seen people with brain tumors be denied disability    those that don't  can't  or won't work are simply made to survive on what little assistance they get as best they can  for as long as they can  i have been at  significantly  greater risk of homelessness  after  going onto assistance  because they will literally cut off your entire income with no notice for any reason they want  they actively 'suspend' your entire income as a way to control you  the first month that i moved into an apartment  the property management had made a mistake on the copy of the lease i gave to assistance  assistance suspended my income until the mistake was fixed  the property management took the entire month to fix their mistake  yet still complained i hadn't paid rent even after i explained i couldn't until they fixed their mistake  instead of my first month on my own being an exciting celebration of my independence  it was a month of extreme stress and hunger as i tried to stretch my fifty dollars over four weeks  guess who actually showed me some kindness that month       the bank  seriously  when i finally got my income for the month the teller had told me that it was their policy to put a week long hold on the money so i explained my situation and begged her to release what i needed for rent  i almost cried when she not only agreed to do it but asked me how much i needed for food until the hold ended and i could access the rest of the money       i would actually be homeless multiple times over if not for other people stepping in to help where assistance refuses   you can get assistance to help with a security deposit  once  they expect you to use that deposit for every apartment you ever apply for forever  but you don't get your security deposit back until after you move out  and you can't move into some place new with out a security deposit  so if you ever have to move at all after the first time  you're fucked  and even if you could access the security deposit before moving  every time a landlord or property management takes a chunk of it  you end up with the less for your next apartment and they pretty much always take a chunk  i've lived in four different apartments over the last ten years only because i was able to get help outside of assistance for the security deposit  with out that help  i would be have been homeless two years into getting on assistance      so what if you get approved  then you get enough to get by right  nope  when i first got on disability ten years ago  i got just barely below 1k a month  ten years later  i get just barely over 1k  after my rent and bills i have maybe 30  left  over half goes to rent  and i live in one of the cheapest big cities in the country  in the cheapest apartment i could find  the kind with drafty windows that drip water into the apartment when it rains  leaky pipes  mold  infestations and property management that chooses the cheapest solution to all of those problems  if they ever even fix them at all  i could probably find even cheaper and even worse if i went with a full blown slum lord managed building  i suspect that's my next stop when my rent gets too high yet again       for the program where i live it is official policy for caseworkers to never mention any available aid for anything unless directly questioned about it  in practice that means i spent years paying for my medications out of pocket before i learned that i could get help paying for them  but did they tell me how when i asked  nope  they literally sent me in a circle  the person they told me to call only told me to call the person who told me to call them in the first place  and it kept going until i gave up  turns out literally all i had to do was give my case number to the pharmacists  i found out by asking the pharmacy after getting no useful info from caseworkers for months      they are so actively against actually helping people financially in any meaningful way that they will sacrifice their own goal of getting people to work  my disability is due to multiple chronic and extreme mental health issues  long super depressing story very short  garbage genetics  garbage birth mother extreme neglect regular childhood physical  emotional  and sexual abuse  have all left me mega fucked in the head to the point of being genuinely dangerous to those around me during my worst episodes  the last six months i've gone with out an episode is actually a record that i'm extremely proud of  when i tried to get a referral for a psychiatrist from my doctor  i was told he hadn't been able to get one for a patient in five years  when i asked assistance for help for paying for therapy with a non-psychiatrist  aka not covered by government healthcare  which i would need if i was ever going to be able manage my illness well enough to work  they said no  because psychiatrists are already covered by the government  so i can't  see a psychiatrist  and i can't afford to see a non-psychiatrist  and i can't work with out therapy  and i can't get assistance to help pay for therapy  and i can't get a job to pay for therapy because i need therapy to get and hold a job      tl dr  universal basic income needs to happen and it needs to be livable  punishing assistance programs that prioritize work and cost over actually helping people can be extremely damaging in their own right  likely end up costing even more due to constant appeals plus the health issues that come from the extreme stress and poverty they trap people in  and can even be so cost obsessed they become completely ineffective at literally their one and only actual goal of getting people to work ,ke0q5r
764,Problems of a modern life,as usual  i was spending a lot of time reading about living off-grid and i came across an idea  that was said by an off-grid living person that i saw on youtube      he said that he didn't like living a normal life since you do the same monotonic job for 8-10 hours a day and you get paid for it and then get everything else      it got me thinking - could it be that our jobs are so miserable mostly because we're not wired to just sit down and do something for that many hours without a break  it's not only that we work our lives away  but it's about the work we do too  say you wanted to get food - back in the day you had to go pick berries or hunt  or engage in some craft where you could trade products of the craft to groceries  you had to have farm animals or a garden  for warmth you had to chop logs etc       that's a lot of work  but the work is spread out in different sections and intervals and is also seasonal  also  you used to do it for yourself  mostly  so no one was judging you for the most part  and there were no psychological abuse      just wanted to share these thoughts and maybe hear some other people weigh in ,kdxtow

But now I'm a miserable tired wage slave who suffers suicidal ideations because she can't take 50 more years of this.",i got to experience a privileged life in college because i had a scholarship that covered my fees and my living expenses  anything i earned at my part time student jobs was mine to keep and have fun with  and my scholarship didn't precent me from receiving a student allowance from the government     i was incredibly lucky during my studies to get various scholarships to study abroad as a student - one summer i went to mexico  another year i went to germany but got to travel around europe with money saved from my part time job  and i also got to go to korea the last year  i did a semester in england as an undergrad and a semester in canada during my master's  i always had something to look forward too and my summer break was always great - i got a few weeks to relax  went somewhere for a few weeks  and the courses were always pretty chill  came home and had a week to sleep and then school started again   i loved it  i mean  university was always hard around exam time and when i had papers due  but it was only very temporary  and i was at least learning things that were genuinely interesting to me and hard work meant i got the reward of higher grades  not someone else    i'm now 2 years into wage slaving and am already nostalgic for a life i will never get to have back  my job is decently paying  but it gets eaten up pretty quickly by living expenses  i'm no longer learning interesting things - i'm basically a robot doing the same thing over and over and over again  i get paid the same whether i am super efficient or not  and while australia's 4 weeks of annual leave would be a dream for americans  it doesn't feel like much things like visiting family for a long weekend adds up and when you are used to getting to travel for 2 months of the year  i also resent having to  fight  for the time i want off  it's a lot more expensive to travel now i am paying my expenses  and i know i should be grateful for the chances i had in university  but i miss it a lot  i hate that taking a week off to just sleep and chill means a week less for family or a holiday  i miss how as a student  i always had chances to just chill out    i used to be able to sleep on the schedule that worked for me  2 30am-10 30am  i used to be able to take a nap if i had a shit night sleep because i wasn't being held hostage in an office for 9 hours a day by the time you add in lunch break  i didn't have to spend 40 hours doing my university work every week if it didn't take me that long  if i was smart and knocked it out in 15 hours  i got to  log off  for the rest of the week  not sit there anyway trying to look busy so i don't get given more work to do without getting any kind of payrise  i wasn't too tired to visit my friends on the weekend  i skinnier because i had time to work out   now  i'm always tired  i'm always cranky  i never want to do anything because i'm so exhausted and burned out  i have to try and force my body sleep from 10 30pm-6 30am  but even if i take supplements  my body refuses to shit out and use any melatonin until 2am  i'm constantly forced to operate on 4 hours sleep and then sleep all weekend to compensate  and then i feel sad my weekend was wasted  i have piled on weight because i don't have time to work out anymore and look for easy meals   i hate this so much that i have suicidal ideations where i keep thinking about how i'd honestly just rather die than live the next 40-50 years of my life as a wage slave  if this is  that's what life is  as the boomers always say i don't want it  i'm fucking miserable and don't want it  i miss my old life every single day  but i can't express this to anyone without being told to  grow up ,kdlsrt

778,It's driving me insane,it's all a rant  a very much privileged rant  from a white collar french worker  very far from the worst situation you can be in   i'm working as an it consultant  my client currently being a huge french company group   i was enjoying my covid vacations at home  enjoying the fact that my employer failed to find me a client before the pandemics hit and that the french law still protects jobs and i couldn't be laid off without a serious reason  when reality finally called back    one of my manager who has been with this client for 3 years called me  telling me he was at his wit's end  that if he did not get help soon he'd have to get a sick note from the doctor and stop working  again we're in france  he's genuinely depressed anxious and the doctor's note will get him off work but still partially paid and employed  he knew the client wasn't a good fit for me  2-4h commute one way  but still asked me if i would consider coming   being the dumbfuck i am  considering a few wfh days a week  i would come and help him out   boy do i regret that decision everyday since   the mission client is an absolute mess  he's only willing to budget 1 5 full time equivalent  no more  despite clearly having work for some 4  people easily   me being super junior in this job  was doing project management  now doing technical architecture  my colleague took it slow on me so i could learn  it looked promising    for a whole 2 weeks     after those 2 weeks  all hell broke loose  i was told i needed to  gain speed  as in starting to generate momentum to take more and more projects   multi million   projects  2k  users involved projects  i almost instantly felt overwhelmed  especially seeing my colleague work ridiculours hours  working nights and weekends  i wanted both to protect myself and leave a first written mark so i sent an email to my direct manager telling him that i couldn't see any future with this client  that the conditions were far from optimal to learn and despite the chance i got to see a bunch of shit i couldn't somewhere else it was affecting my health  being clinically anxious depressed  i've stopped properly eating and sleeping for a while now    now we're 3 month after i started and boy  has shit turned worse    friday before last i was phoned by the client responsible for reconducting our contract  he asked me what i thought about the performance of my senior  if i thought he could be replaced  if i thought he was at the end of his career here   mind you it's the client asking me  a green junior  about the performance of my direct colleague  very very inapropriate  i'm in awe listening to him  understanding that they're looking for reasons to remove the dude who is holding the mission on his shoulders for the pettiest reasons  like him not being in the best of moods   so i told him that it was probably the worst idea i heard in a long long time   they removed him anywayn never asking one why his mood was this bad   i haven't heard him so relieved and happy since i've arrived there   and here comes the super privileges  i know i'm fortunate to have the problems i am about to describe  i want to leave this mission client asap  as in yesterday if it was possible   trouble is the client is extremly happy with my performance  if you were to believe my manager they're singing anthems in my name  and therefore i have a world of trouble to get out of this situation    i called my boss today to ask for an  amicable agreement  to end our work relationship  what this kind of agreement would lead to is my employer would have to pay me the equivalent of  lay off benefits   1 4 of monthly salary per year worked there  or about 1k  in my case  fairly low  but more importantly i could sign up for unemployement benefits allowing me to take my time to find a new job  if i were to just straight up quit  i'd be left with no forms of income whatsoever and my saving aren't they healthiest they've ever been to say the least    and i got the answer i expected  why would we agree to let you go  and pay you for it  if the client is happy   and no matter how much i explained that the client happiness came at the cost of daily struggles and pain for me it made no difference   why do i feel it's relevant here is because to me it yells  you're still profitable  why would we let you go comfortably  we're going to make life a living hell for you until you got no choice but to quit   it's got me super depressed tonight   having set the whole thing in motion  i need to see it through now  i guess i just hoped that they'd say yes and that both me and them would move on   i was wrong,kd1utm

804,YOU ARE A SLAVE,every day our lives get a little worse and we do nothing  our freedom and life is slowly being chipped away as to not cause notice to most people  akin to a frog slowly being boiled in a pot   we got rid of slavery 155 years ago  but ask yourself  are we still free today   we can work or we can starve  the greener grass on the other side is slowly withering and dying  more and more jobs are turning into absolute bullshit   no real pay  no real benefits  and an endless line of people ready to apply for your spot  ready to take a bite out of a corporate shit sandwich    they realize we are week  and we will continue to suffer until we rise up  they know our weakness and exploit it    you aren't lazy  or a complainer  you are exploited  you as a person is losing its identity  your creativity and expression of your very soul is slowly being vacuumed out of you  until you become a husk  a number  a cog in a machine   the slave was not free  he was bought and sold  you are being bought and sold as well  your life has a price on it  and its being paid for by the hour   slaves had owners  you have an owner  you make him rich in exchange for work  the only difference is the owner provided food and housing  yet you pay for those yourself    the slave could not leave  neither can you  everyone could walk out of walmart at the same time  or the amazon warehouse or some other large corporation farming you for your labor    but they don't  because if they leave  they are whipped  they are whipped with their need to pay rent or their mortgage  their food  their electricity   you can tell yourself you are  free  but you are not  the shackles that bind you are invisible  but you can still feel them   it's the dread when your alarm goes off  the feeling of despair when your rent is due and you have to scrape up what few pennies you have left to pay it  the hopelessness of knowing that nothing will change and you as well as everyone else has to accept it   if you still truly think you are free  then stop going to work  stop paying your bills    you are given a very simple illusion of freedom  a small ladder which you can climb   but you still cannot climb high enough to see over your owners wall  to see the wealth they have accumulated  the wealth your misery and toil provided for them  wealth that would take you thousands of years to earn    you will never be your owner  you will never replace your owner  the illusion is just another whip  designed to keep you going  to trick you into thinking that someday if you work really hard you can be another owner  how very foolish of you to think that   you are not a person or a human to them  you are a slave  a number  you are given  benefits  that only benefit them  they give you a few sick days a year so you don't make the other slaves sick  it's cheaper to do this rather than pay another slave to take your place    they don't even give you a pension anymore  the human life expectancy has grown  so they figure you can work for them much longer  up until your death    if you are lucky maybe you will get a piss warm slice of pizza on one friday out of a year  they want you to feel loved you know  so you don't quit and become someone else's slave    but at the end of the day  your still a slave  it will only get worse  they don't care  they would gun each and every single one of you down if it added a million dollars to their bank account ,kbj6vp

888,"Money doesn't have value and you should seek happiness, love, fun and wisdom instead.",i don't care what anyone says  if you actually believe money has value and is worth doing anything for you are stupid  it's just pieces of paper and or digital representations of paper  you can kick and scream all you want but this fact will never change  your currency has no real value  you're spending the one life you get here on earth doing tricks for pieces of paper  and if i was in the same position  i would argue against this fact too  if you willfully do things in exchange for paper at threat of death then you are unintelligent     money is the alienated essence of man's work and existence  this essence dominates him and he worships it  - karl marx  i understand that most people have no choice  so to be clear  if you understand that money doesn't actually have real value and you're being forced to do things daily against your will then i am not talking about you  i'm talking about people who actually defend this system as being even close to as good as we can do together as a species  if you actually defend this system and think it's a good idea you are delusional  and you will have to face that fact at some point in your life  this is why so many old people will tell you that they wished they spent more time with their loved ones and less time working  once it's all said and done  and your life is coming to an end  all that time you spent working starts to seem pretty fucking stupid     you are what you do  if you do boring  stupid monotonous work  chances are you'll end up boring  stupid and monotonous  work is a much better explanation for the creeping cretinization all around us than even such significant moronizing mechanisms as television and education  - bob black  the abolition of work  if you can opt out of this outdated rat race you 1000  should  there is so much more to life than waking up everyday to do things against your will  if you're happy working  good for you  i think you should be allowed too  but i and many others are not happy  so just like i stated that i believe you should be allowed to work  i ask the same courtesy to be extended to me and those like me who choose a different path  telling us we can  go live in a forest  just proves how disgusting your system really is  it's your way  or death  well guess what  fuck that  i would rather die than take part in a system that is so eager to let me  i will not ever be doing anything against my will while i have a heartbeat  and i implore others to do the same     it is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society  - jiddu krishnamurti  if you value your life  your family and your species then you should not take part in this system  instead  be yourself  be happy  be loving  be smart and self sacrifice for what is right  this system isn't going to change by us taking part in it  the transition from this system to the next isn't going to be fun or pretty for those who want change  it's going to suck  however it's going to suck a lot more for future generations if we allow this archaic economic system and way of life to continue into the future  it's only going to become more outdated as time goes on  not less  don't let them rape the future of humanity with their selfish conservative values and stupidity  i know it's cliche  but now is the time to fight every outdated system of the past  people are listening now  they're waking up  and they rightfully want freedom so they can actually enjoy their lives       the goal of the future is full unemployment  so we can play  that's why we have to destroy the present politico-economic system  - arthur c  clarke  lead by example  show them that many of us really no longer agree that a lifetime of forced servitude is  success  i think servitude should be avoided at all costs as it is giving into authority and it's why stupidity reigns supreme  most people don't think they have a choice other than to live in a way that they know is wrong  and this needs to change  we need to fight for our collective freedom  we need to fight for the future  show the younger generations that even some adults are smart enough to recognize that the lifestyle forced upon us by the collective whole of humanity isn't something any of us would actually choose if we weren't being threatened by starvation and forced to live in such relentlessly boring ways against our wills  show them that deep down  we really want freedom as much as they do  show them that some of us are going to do whatever it takes to be ourselves  despite what others think or say     to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment  - ralph waldo emerson  don't let dumb fuck conservatives   liberals bully us into doing things their way any longer  stop letting them shape the world around us  show them that we have a voice and we're going to be using it until we make the world a place that is safe and fair for everyone  stop letting them starve humans to death in a post scarcity society for no reason other than to protect their system and way of life  our species is too important to let them have their way  their way is ruining the lives of countless humans and making the majority of us very unhappy and unhealthy     we are all responsible for our dream of storming the heavens  we cannot turn ourselves into dwarves now  after having dreamed  elbow to elbow  each feeling the others' heartbeats  of attacking and overthrowing the gods  this is the dream that makes power afraid  - alfredo m  bonanno  they're forcing everyone to  take life seriously  just to feel like they're accomplishing more than they really are in life  if work was just voluntary  as it should be  then a big chunk of  life lessons  they think everyone needs go out the window real quick  this is why so many people react to anti-work views with  i don't know what i'd do without work  or  everyone has to contribute something  they don't know who they are outside of pretending life is serious business that needs their constant attention through working  they actually believe that everyone needs to work or else the world would cease to exist  and they include themselves in this view which in turn makes them delusional about their role in reality  if work isn't something that  everyone has to do  then they'd be forced to actually question their own lifestyles     many things can be done  playfully  yet most of the things we do  we do very  seriously  wearing the death mask we have borrowed from capital  - alfredo m  bonanno  fuck their system completely  fuck money  fuck work  fuck politics  fuck police  fuck judges  fuck bankers  fuck landlords  fuck bosses  fuck all authority  their system doesn't work  and even they know it now  but are still choosing to defend it because fascists accept that they are the bad guys  but they don't care  they're willing to hurt others if it means getting their way  we need to do to capitalism and the conservative lifestyle exactly what it does to humanity  leave it behind     we have deluded ourselves into believing the myth that capitalism grew and prospered out of the protestant ethic of hard work and sacrifice  the fact is that capitalism was built on the exploitation and suffering of black slaves and continues to thrive on the exploitation of the poor -

913,Felt like sharing here....,quit my job around september end   took a full break the immediate month   unexpected family drama and politics aside  kinda started applying for jobs in the 2nd month and been applying to a lot of places  since the past week   i've applied to a considerable amount of places via indeed and glassdoor and yet  i've gotten no response from any of them   when i apply directly on the company's official website though  i did get some responses like them giving me some tasks  however  i did not get any follow-ups after that   only once did i got a chance to be interviewed and they didn't get back to me  presumably because they felt my salary expectations were a bit much than what they were willing to give   however  via job portals so far i've received zero call-backs  after applying  it wasn't this bad last year around the same time  when i was applying to about 4-5 places via indeed  i was guaranteed to receive a call from atleast one of them  and i was a fresher with no work xp whatsoever  back then   it's so demotivating   i'm pretty sure at this rate  i'll never get a job through this  even if i do get a call-back  they'll ask for my portfolio  and honestly i don't have much to show  as a graphic designer with 10 months of xp   sure  i did a projectwork back when i did that course a year back  and i did a considerable amount of work in my previous place of employment - around 90  of the work i've done so far  was when i served there   unfortunately  they made it clear that i can't upload those designs on my portfolio as it belongs to the company  which is understandable  i guess  and they told me they'll give me a good referral instead   sure  i need to post my own personal works onto my portfolio but  i'm so demoralised and demotivated to do start working on them   i get intimidated by others designers  who are way more talented and skilled than i ever could imagine myself to be   i honestly get an existential dread out of this  asking myself as to what's the point of even trying   i have almost zero friends thus  i don't have a good network either  i feel  this is crippling me career-wise  as if i had a good network social circle  i won't be struggling this much   i get locked out of the loop  as a result  regarding opportunities  due to not knowing a considerable amount of people  if not the right people necessarily   this can't keep going like this all this effort and for what  a disappointing pay and work-culture would likely be awaiting me   i just feel this whole struggle and pursuit is simply not worth it  maybe  i'm not meant for the corporate world   i feel  i might be much better off by doing something that i have an interest in  if only i could pick up some momentum  that is ,k9h5zs

919,The Malaise of the Soul at Work,i wrote a paper recently on neoliberalism in education and found an article i thought you all would appreciate  here is the link  if you can't access  i can message you the pdf  https link springer com article 10 1007 2fs11217-019-09653-4  below are some of my favorite parts    the italian political thinker franco  bifo  berardi tells us that the current transformation of every domain of social life into economy has led to  the subjugation of the soul to work processes  according to berardi  our current subjection under  semiocapitalism  involves much more than our being rendered into producers of knowledge and consumers of symbols  what is at stake today is a form of cognitive-affective  work  which  in employing our intellectual capacity  curiosity and desire for learning  makes us believe that  indeed  we can discover our freedom and our true sense of self through doing our job  implicitly referring to the prevalence of  high tech workers  and the  creative class  in our economy  berardi assess that today   workers tend to consider labour as the most essential part in their lives  consequently  he goes on   no desire  no vitality seems to exist anymore outside of the economic enterprise  the soul  that which berardi refers to as  the best part of us which aspires towards creativity  sensuality  delight and communication risks being usurped by the incessant compulsion to define ourselves more and more through our functional relations    moreover  what berardi s notion of the soul helps us focus on is the prevailing politics of our time  how it is that semiocapitalism works to exploit  sway  exhaust and mine the soul for its current expansion  semiocapitalism  understood as the contemporary fusion of media and capitalism  in which informational commodities are received  produced and recombined  relies ever more so on our minds  communication  curiosity and creativity  employing our cognitive-affective labour  or our desire for learning and self-expression  in this way  berardi gives us an analysis of semiocapitalism s relentless outward and inward expansion of the economic domain  this is an expansion that does not simply stretch outward  rendering and exploiting nature and the world around us as a resource  but also reaches inward usurping  mining and reaping our interiority  our  soul  drawing out our passions  desires and creative impulses as a resource itself to be exploited    berardi s attention to the soul and what currently ails it signals a shift from industrial capitalism s exploitation and alienation of bodies to a more contemporary form of capitalism s exploitation and alienation of bodies and  souls  whereas fordist models reduced worker s bodies to tools during their working hours  post-fordist exploitation  moreover mines our interiority so that workers intimately identify with their jobs  today our mental space and feelings are preoccupied with our work all the time and we no longer seem to be able to register the former sense of alienation to work  in this way  semiocapitalism maligns the most valued and significant sense of our subjectivity our soul as we have become defined and managed by our work and work defined values  in the soul at work  berardi undertakes a genealogy of alienation tracing how the industrial worker s antagonism towards work evidenced in the worker s refusal  in his or her saying no to conflating life and work  and in his or her sabotaging and general antipathy towards alienating labour has given way to our peculiar contemporary situation  drawing on italian workerism  berardi shows how  previously  the industrial worker s ability to register his or her alienation opens other possibilities for imagining and safeguarding human togetherness and human self-actualization outside of the valorization of work and capital  he writes  'it is precisely thanks to the radical inhumanity of the workers  existence that a human collectivity can be founded  a community no longer dependent on capital  it is indeed the estrangement of the workers from their labor  the feeling of alienation and its refusal  that are the bases for a human collectivity autonomous from capital ' with this background in place  berardi turns to consider the contemporary psychosocial transformation of the contemporary workers  stance toward their labour  the refusal to reduce life to work  under the conditions of classical industrial labour  has given way to an enthusiastic embracing of and over-identification with doing one s job  today  according to berardi  we value work so much so that it  has become the central locus of psychic and emotional investment  effectively channeling our desire for creativity and sociality towards the enterprise of realizing ourselves through our employment    the  creative class  thus born from this channeling of desire is made up of those who cease to see their labour as a necessary drain on their way of life  as something that they must do  rather  they learn to see their jobs affectionately and intimately as the primary activity for shaping their self-image  and for fully expressing their creative impulses and validating their idiosyncrasies  motivated by the want of  abundant high-quality experiences  an openness to diversity of all kinds  and above all else the opportunity to validate their identities as creative people  the creative class no longer contests extending their working day  they no longer say no to work encroaching on their lives  instead  they spontaneously choose to increase their hours  informally scheduling more work through digital tasks and even pursuing extra accreditation  courses and workshops during their leisure time so that they can become  better  at their jobs footnote 21 the logic seems to propose that the longer they work  and the better they learn to labour  the more chances they have to express themselves  realize their potential  and become self-actualized and fulfilled  today we thus see the complete conflation between labouring and learning to become an authentic person  this is something that florida himself assumes when he intones the desires of the creative class as saying   we want the ability to learn and grow  shape the content of our work  control our schedules and express our identities through work    berardi himself would see this as expressing the post-industrial turn in which   capital renews its psychic  ideological and economic energy  specifically thanks to the absorption of creativity  desire  and individualistic  libertarian drives for self-realization  footnote 23 for berardi  the discourse of the  creative class  seems particularly fitting to the type of cognitive-affective labour required in late-stage capitalism  today we are compelled to hold jobs that cannibalize our lives all day long  as the informal nature of our schedules eludes our control and exposes us to the 24 7 flow of online demands  of the infosphere  consequently  we find ourselves constantly learning and adapting to new gadgets and software required for work  collapsing work with managing our social media profiles  always seemingly in need of updating our work-personal mobile devices  always feeling the need to respond to the latest solicitations  or consistently feeling obliged to express our likes and dislikes lest our public-work profile becomes discounted  outdated or on the  wrong side  of a trending  shitstorm  in blurring the line that distinguishes between work and life we come to feel that we have no time orplace away from work  or any possibility of a kind of learning other than what will afford me an advantage in my work  such work  today  affectively  creatively and thoroughly binds us to our jobs  so much so that our self-validation  creative expression and enjoyment is only found therein  unlike workers in the fordist era of capitalism  whose time after work was theirs  more or less  now  there is no space  time or other ways of thinking that would allow us to register the feelings of dissatisfaction in our needing to labour    in discussing what he terms the  cognitariat  those flexible labourers performing cognitive piecemeal work under semiocapitalism  berardi offers us a corrective to the euphemistic term  creative class  he importantly points out that   what is involved in the cognitive labor process  what is currently being exploited in the creative economy  is indeed what belongs more essentially to human beings   communication  the creation of mental states  of feelings and imaginations  footnote 24 at stake for berardi is the question of what is happening to our own most sense of being human under the imperatives of semiocapitalism  the  cognitariat  or the so called  creative class  employed by semiocaptialism is constantly cajoled to keep learning  to express themselves  to communicate  to create  to self-actualize  to see themselves reflected in their jobs  to co-operate and even to take pleasure in their function  in short  they are asked to give their bodies and souls wholly over to their work  whereas this might appear as an improvement and even an enriching non-alienating experience of work  as florida wants us to believe  in reality it spells an all-out assault and impoverishment of the soul  since all learning  creativity  pleasure  communication and cooperation is already predetermined  calculated and valorized within the logic of economy and utility  accordingly  as our intellectual and affective expression becomes driven more and more primarily by economic interests  calculation and necessity  it cannot but lose the character of gratuitousness  pleasurableness  and erotic contact that arises when it is freely and spontaneously given    the worldly pleasures of conviviality  friendship  conversation and eros the pleasure of freely spending time with and giving time to others that would nourish and animate us towards the collective dimension of our existence  now seem trivial  perhaps even embarrassing  when undertaken for their own sake outside of the compulsion to  network  this is especially so when compared to the pressing priorities of my needing to present myself as functional  competitive and self-fulfilled through my constantly performing  and through accumulating  likes  for the sake of managing my profile  to be sure  such a virtual profile is one that we are compelled to constantly update in order to be counted as relevant and desirable  in order to secure and even maintain a job  our ceaseless worrying and working to maintain our social media profiles belong to a time in which  as byung-chul han notes   everything is rendered countable so that it can be transformed into the language of performance and efficiency   for  whatever resists being counted ceases to be  semiocapitalism thus solicits an accounting of one s creativity and self-actualization in a hyper- individualized  pathologically competitive environment that makes one feel that one has never accomplished enough  and that one is in need of proving oneself over and over again  lest one s profile  membership  worth and survival are put in question or become discounted  as berardi writes   survival is no longer based on reaching a position of sufficient preparation and abilities  but it is constantly questioned   today people live out their parts in the  creative class  with the sinking feeling that if they do not keep up if they do not keep learning  updating their credentials and adapting to the new economy to show how they count one can be eliminated in a few days or a few months  amidst conditions in which one s survival is constantly in question or always in need of tweaking  we become attuned to living in a panic stricken and sickening hyperactive state in which we cannot afford to take pleasure and give compassion in collective life  as solidarity and a sense of being able to linger with each other withers away  the soul is no longer just mined for its resources  but begins to work on colonizing itself  the soul forecloses its desire for flight and short-circuits the sensibility animating the body toward what could allow it to appeal to and address others through a world that is more than economy  networking  labour and survival  when the soul is assailed and cajoled by the obscene demand to be creative  fulfilled and self-actualized so that it can survive and justify itself against others  the soul is poisoned and inevitably falls from flight into all sorts of pathologies alas  a malaise of the soul overtakes our time ,ka2gz9

932,Boss gets angry about what I'm doing AFTER I leave the company,i gave 8 weeks' notice at my job 6 weeks ago  before that  i'd given them verbal notice that i was going to leave to start my own business but that i'd help them get through the holidays   i only told them that far out because my boss saw my profile on indeed and cornered me about it  he's done this to several employees in the past few months  and some were fired on the spot  luckily  i wasn't fired then   yesterday  my boss barged into my office while i was trying up loose ends   boss   we're going to need you part-time in january  we haven't found a replacement so you'll probably need to train them then   me   as i wrote in my notice  i'm happy to help part-time in january  but only virtually  the new hire can call me if they have questions  and i'll be unavailable until january 9th  i'm visiting family   boss   the ninth  that's a huge chunk of time   me   i know  i'm excited   boss   well  that's going to be really inconvenient for us  we'll talk more later    cue him storming out of my office   so yeah  my boss got upset about how long of a vacation i'm taking after i no longer work for him  these employers have pulled some stunts in the past  but they continue to surprise me  safe to say  they'll get radio silence from me if they try to reach out before i'm back in town ,k9i8ai
933,Reduced Work Week,hello  i ve been a lurker on this sub for about a year now  and while i feel similarly to many of you who post  i m trying to figure out what can be done to impact change  i actually don t hate my job  or mind working in general  i just think work outbalances the rest of life and is generally just too long  too much time  with the growth of ai and technology it feels like we are seriously missing out or not prioritizing the relieving effects this could have on our way of life as humans    so what actions can be made  no work is a bit too utopian for reality in my opinion  but are there resources supporting reduced work weeks  is there a movement to support    in this last election cycle i was a big yang supporter  mostly because i believe that he thinks outside of the box with ideas like ubi  which seem like a pathway to reduced work weeks  but clearly that is still considered too radical to be palatable for the voting population  as surprising as that is to me personally  it seems to me that people like him are at the cusp of starting a larger movement  so i m interested to learn more about who is trying to make this idea reality  and what organizations support this   any leads ,ka8jqn
934,I had to learn how to think of work strictly as a way to get by and not an extension of myself and my worth as a person... and I'm still learning.,i've spent most of my teenagehood working part-time  trying to prove to myself and to others that i was smart  capable and sociable in a work setting  i wanted to grind my way up the corporate ladder and eventually get my own freelance business teaching english to second language learners  i got a university degree  got my own apartment  got a full-time job for the first time and   had a depression  i started spiraling  bad  i realized i hated every job i ever had and i began to hate people because of how mistreated i've been in every workplace  i also realized i was way too optimistic about myself and my own abilities and that i could never get where i wanted to be  i have really bad anxiety and it's only gotten worse once i got out of college  i don't care about  most of  my coworkers  some are good eggs  and i'm absolutely okay with that  i did teach english right before the pandemic hit and it was the most fulfilling and rewarding job i've ever had  but my anxiety absolutely ruined it for me  i know i'm never going to be able to move past it  so forget the idea that i could ever have my own business    so  what now   well  i've been a data-entry specialist since may 2019  i don't care anymore  i have enough money to sustain myself and let's just say that i'm not a good consumer  so my money is good  fortunately  food is my biggest expense and i don't eat much  i play video games in the evening  i play the guitar whenever i can  i'm just a human being and i've got nothing to prove to anybody  i'm done comparing myself  i'm done aiming higher  career-wise  i'm smart  i'm unique  i'm good enough    it shouldn't be this hard to get to this point  but it is  i'm still not where i want to be and there are a lot of things i'm not satisfied with  but i hope i get to be in a more comfortable position someday  working as little as possible  that's my only goal ,k9u4tb

938,People should not work if they don’t want to.,people don t want to work  so as a society we decide to not continue any literal unnecessary jobs  services  products  for certain things to be made   you want this meaningless nonessential thing to exist  you work for it do it   so the enthusiasts of these services products will pick up the work  also  the innovators will work on them and still make them accessible to others in ways that don t require those people to work on it to receive it  this would be the case for both essential and non essentials things   likewise  education and instruction   supplies are given to everyone to get things we want in our lives achieved  this easy-access making of the things we want in our lives makes having what we want completely accessible for everyone   lastly  with these things in place people will not have to work if they do not want to ,kahxzb
939,I have a Christmas retail job and the way my manager acts like it is the only thing happening in my life is fucking ridiculous.,pretty self explanatory  but i'm a grad student and picked up a job as a christmas temp in a store over the university vacation period here in melbourne now that shops are open back up after lockdown   i'm working about 12 hours a week  basically the shitty 10 30am-2 30pm lunch cover shifts that basically eat up an entire day  but whatever  i get  100 for each one and am only a 10 minute walk from the shopping centre the store is in    but the manager is starting to piss me off with the way she expects to have total control over my scheduled  she tried to call me in today and i politely wrote back informing her that i could not work the shift as i had an appointment in the afternoon  she called me back and passively aggressively asked me if it was in the unavailability book  i calmly informed her that she gave me a roster and i then scheduled some necessary appointments around that roster  she had a long pause  that one people give when they realise a fair point was just made  and then acted like she was doing me a huge favour by taking me off the shift but then again  but for future reference  rosters are always subject to change  ok  if you need to change the rosters  that is one thing  but that is also dependent on  my  availability    i also have the roster for the next two weeks  and she expects me to be  on call  multiple days over the next two weeks  meaning that  i'm expected to block out my days  keep my phone on me and drop everything and race into the store if they are busy and she needs me    fuck  off   if you want me to black out my schedule for you  you are going to need to pay me for that    i have better things to do with my life than sit at home waiting on you  i'll go in for the money if i am genuinely not doing something  but one of the days she has me  on call  for  i want to do something  and i'm going to put my phone on  do not disturb  and ignore them because i'm fucking sick of it  i'm not spending my  weekend  at home to be at your beck and call    i don't even know if i will survive the next 2 weeks because she keeps making us do shit with little concern for our comfort  like forcing us to wear embarrassing tacky christmas headbands even though headbands give me a massive migraine  12 year old me  wanted  to have a blair waldorf phase in 2008 but didn't get to because i can't do headbands  and standing up on a step and doing  shout outs  by memorising a script of lame jokes to talk about the special offers in store  she gets mad at me because my anxiety means i'm terrible at it  but she refuses to do it herself     honestly  i am living with my parents and my student payment has been higher because of the covid supplement  i don't really need the job  i just wanted the extra money because i just wanted to get some extra savings because i want to do some travelling after the world opens back up after the pandemic and to just have on hand for a rainy day  if she pushes my buttons too hard over the next couple of weeks i'll honestly just walk out mid shift    i just wanted to vent to people who will understand rather than thinking it is the norm and ok for a job to think it is entitled to get mad at you for daring to schedule things in your down time  getting headaches from wearing fucking reindeer ears  and wanting to own your weekend without any promise or guarantee of pay ,kb1zti

944,Thoughts on forced socialization at work?,as if work weren t already dreadful enough  my job wants me to take the precious few hours i have after work to attend a dumb fucking holiday party over zoom  attendance is required    first of all  shouldn t we be paid for that  second of all  what if i don t care to spend any more time with my coworkers who i have nothing in common with  i hate this shit  on top of everything  we re doing secret santa so i have to spend  25-30 of my hard earned money to buy a coworker i don t know something they ll probably never use    before this  we had a required trivia night  and before that  a virtual happy hour  i literally lied that my grandma died to get out of trivia night  give me a fucking break and fuck you to my employer who already takes enough of my time  doesn t pay me enough  and now wants more of my time  such bullshit  also  i ve never met my coworkers  as i was hired during the lockdown  and i have to contribute to getting them gifts when one of them has a birthday or gets pregnant with a baby  where does it end   does anyone else hate forced socialization  what are your experiences with it  have you gotten out of it  and if so  how ,k9oa49
945,I'm about done with school.

946,One boss gave me a suspension. Other boss thought it was bullshit so she put the suspension on the same day I had already requested off. I'm laughing away the annoyance.,tl dr i work in daycare  we are expected to wear masks all day long  except for mealtimes which imo is enough exposure that we shouldn't have to wear one at all but whatever  a few days ago i had to pull mine down to yell at a child across the room who was physically harming another child and couldn't hear me with the mask on  i was also walking towards them but needed them to stop immediately  i put my mask back on as soon as they heard me but one of my bosses  caught me  and insisted on writing me up  when explaining the situation to my other boss  she basically rolled her eyes because she realizes i'm being picked on      suspending me on a day i already won't be working is such an extreme  fuck you  to the other boss and it's hilarious  but i'm so annoying that she is so afraid of actually standing up to the other one  no one likes her  we call her  nit-picky   her name is nicky  and she only follows rules she wants to follow  we have all caught her doing things she shouldn't be   the thing is  we barely have enough staff to fill all of our rooms and we definitely don't have people to cover when someone doesn't come in  my next  punishment  is a 3 day suspension and i would love to see her scramble to find someone to cover my shift over something is damn dumb as pulling my mask down  for a legitimate reason ,k9qhws

953,Curious how people here balance anti-work sentiment with the realities that the natural world requires fending for oneself?,i am of the mindset that the current mode of work is inadequate  deceitful  and not fulfilling    but i compare it to the alternative which is to not eat  not have shelter  not have water  not have access to things that genuinely give me joy  eg seeing natural wonders  pushing my body to achieve difficult physical goals  to take this to its hyperbolic end-state  back in the hunter   gatherer days and even multi-cellular organism  you still had to  work  to not keel over and die    so you always have to  work    so where does anti-work movement start and stop  is it just not liking the current mode of work and how people get taken advantage of in current work  lt gt  employer framework  or is the goal to not have to  work  at all and the believe is we ve reached a state in reality where work doesn t have to occur anymore   curious everybody else s mindset and thoughts ,k9mff6

970,Forgive my rant,a guy at work on a different crew went to a party and got covid  now he is out of work temporarily  as he should be  but i have to cover his shift  i was not given 24 hours notice for mandatory overtime  i have a medical appointment and will be written up if i don t come in  i told my supervisor i normally would come in but can t sue to my appointment  he said    medical appointments don t excuse scheduled days  the bullshit thing is it goes by seniority with mandatory overtime  on nights  i have more seniority than most people  however  i ve temporarily been moved to days and am at the bottom while here    nc being a  right to work  state  there is nothing i can do  it s bullshit  man ,kaqanx
971,Anti-work and capitalism?,long-time lurker on another account  this account will probably be a throwaway  but i had an argument with my grandmother that left me really confused    i guess i'm not really  anti-work  but i'm definitely  anti-the-way-things-are-structured-right-now  it frustrates me that i don't have the time or energy to do art or learn new skills  i don't mind working  but not for 8 hours a day  5 days a week   all i said to her was it's unfair that we have to work half our lives away just to survive and that wages should increase and hours should decrease since we're more productive now than we were decades ago  and apparently that makes me an entitled communist   but  the labor reforms that led to the 40 hour workweek didn't turn the usa communist  so why would another reform do so  it makes no sense to me   i'm not saying capitalism is perfect  very far from it  but i don't understand the thinking that we have to change our entire economic system for labor reform to happen  is there any truth or logic to this or is she off the wall ,kaw8qc

973,Jobs that suck less.,can we collectively come up with a working list of tolerable job ideas   we all agree that work is bullshit but since most of us haven't found away to avoid suffering through it anyway  why not contribute to a resource that might help things suck a little less     i'd like to see a list of jobs or positions that pay reasonably well for the effort required  demand a  maximum  of 40 hours week  have a positive work environment  and don't impart a lot of stress you have to take home with you   i think we can agree that the perfect job is no job  but can we help each other out by sharing what we know about jobs that might give you back more of your life and compensate you with a reasonable living wage ,k9ngyr

976,"Just started working full-time this year, already dreading the rest of my life at 23",sorry if this post ends up being super long  i've been doing too much thinking these past few months   i have hated being a part of this system that we humans have created since i was a kid  at school  i would always think  what am i  really  doing here  of course every kid dislikes school to some extent  but i absolutely cherished whenever there was a snow day  i would count down the days until summer or winter break  etc  in high school it got worse  literally the only thing getting me through the years were the days off- again snow days  breaks  and the like  every day my mind was filled with thoughts like  how can anybody go to school 7  hours a day for 5 days a week and enjoy it   i can be at home right now doing things that i actually enjoy  whenever i heard the question  what do you want to be when you grow up  i was always changing my answer  i would decide a career path  research it  then think  i can't see myself doing this 8 hours or more a day  5 days a week for the rest of my life  i would also think  once i get to college things will be better and i'll have more freedom  ultimately i decided i really enjoy spending time with children  so i went to college to be a teacher  after my first semester i thought  i can't see myself doing this everyday  yada yada  same thing  so i changed my major to psychology so that there was a broader range of options for me and i could figure it out later  again  the only thing getting me through college  while it was better than high school  were the breaks  also i would think to myself  i cannot wait to be done and have a full-time job so that i can finally provide for myself and i will have more freedom  lol  so i graduated college in may with my psychology degree  i was so nervous everyday that i was not going to able to find a job  with being in the middle of a pandemic   luckily  at the end of july i was hired full-time by a company that normally works in an office  but right now is fully remote until at least march  i started my training in august and that is when all of the thoughts  the realizations  the absolute  dread  started  the company is actually good  the work is easy once you get used to it  but i just absolutely  hate  working  how did i not see this coming  i've always known that i've hated giving up my time to this  system  so why did i think that getting a full-time job would magically make me okay with it  i don't think i can quite put into words how hard it hit me that  this is it  but i'm sure people in this sub will understand  i have cried almost everyday since august  after work  i would spend the rest of the day just looking up other options so i could quit  i  fucking  hate capitalism with every fiber of my being  5 days a week 8 hours a day is bullshit  especially dealing with places that only treat you like a number  personally  i think 4 days a week  5 hours a day  with no change in pay  should be the standard for everybody  nobody likes working  so why the fuck did we let it go on for this long   don't even get me started on people who brag that they break their backs working 60  hours a week  i never understood them  before this job  even though i was nervous about finding a job and stressed because of the pandemic  i was genuinely enjoying life and relaxing  i woke up when i wanted  i need about 10 hours of sleep to feel refreshed  i didn't even feel the need to nap at all during this time  i played animal crossing  read  wrote  did whatever i wanted whenever i wanted  that is all i want out of this life  but even that is too much to ask for   i forgot to mention that through college i had a part-time job at a grocery store  even though i also hated going there  it wasn't too bad because it was only 20 hours a week  and halfway through the shifts the store would be dead so you could just sit around or work on homework  which was nice  i couldn't wait to get out of there and find something better  but now i find myself longing to go back  this time last year i never would have said that in one million years   also  i have pretty bad social anxiety and the pandemic has made it much worse  in the past  going to work would kind of prepare my anxiety for work for the day  and coming home felt so refreshing because it was my safe space and i didn't experience social anxiety here  now that i'm working at home  it kind of messed up that process that worked so well for me and i get anxious even if i step away from my work  and after work it takes a long time to actually wind down  much longer than it took when i would physically drive home from work   there are more things i can talk about here  but this post is probably already too long  i just feel trapped  i really just want to quit because technically i don't  need  the money right now as i still live with my parents  but student loans will kick in before i know it and my boyfriend and i want to move in together soon and this job would help speed the process up  i started a website to start blogging and i'm learning how to monetize it  but it can take years and years to make a sustainable living off of it  if it even takes off   sigh    i just want my time back ,ka309q

978,"Many posts here about the workplace ""not caring about you""",many posts on here have this epiphany that your workplace  doesn't care about you   i'm not sure where we've learned that they are supposed to care about you   in my 40  years of existence  one thing i've learned is that no one really cares about you  except maybe  if you're lucky  your family members and one or several close friends  that's it   your workplace literally does not care if you died right now unless they were involved and their insurance had to pay out for it  they do not care   humans are animals  our central concern is survival  it is to compete  that is the truth  your neighbour will not hesitate to eliminate you if you came between them and survival   in modern society  involvement in social issues has become central to revenue generation   having concern for our fellow man woman  has become integral in every corporate marketing plan  that's it  if you don't believe that  you are being sold    they don't care about you  they just want to make more money   i'm not sure why this is shocking to some  but it shouldn't be ,k9bxhg
979,What am I doing wrong?,hi all  this is a bit of a rant so if you don t wanna stick around  i understand  but i hope you have a great day     so ever since i ve had two jobs i knew working wasn t for me but i feel like i ve been in a work environment well enough  my first job was at a movie theater and i told myself that it s okay if i didn t become friends with my coworkers  but at least be friendly enough  i tried so hard to be positive yet my coworkers gossiped  kept to their own cliques  didn t add me to any group chats or didn t even give me phone numbers until maybe 6 months or more after working there  i even was cornered and cussed out by a coworker in front of my friends  it being slipped under the rug  the job made me question my self worth so i was happy to quit when the pandemic came around  but now i was stuck without a job  so about a month ago i got a job as a cocktail waitress  it s been better  better pay  plus tips    easier job  nice customers until one of our bartenders has started to snap at me about rolling my eyes or walking away when i m talking to her  she s been a total queen bee  bossing me around and yelling at me like i m one of her kids  it s been small stuff like this until today when my boss pulled me aside and listed off these crazy things that has  happened  like that i had a confrontation with a girl in the cage  vault  tried to process my tips first instead of the casinos money  no one knows the true story  everyone i ve asked has heard different stories  that i ve been lazy  charging people for sodas and tea  which we ruled out so that parts fine  that im not multitasking because on rare occasions i don t take every drink on my tray at once because i m clumsy and have spilt drinks cause i ve had too many on my tray  but in short  the jobs i ve had have made me feel like i m being told i m a different person  like i m being told i did horrible things but i know aren t true at all  i m shy  introverted  never insulted someone to their face  i ve never fought punched slapped  you name it  i ve never done it  i hate confrontation  on top of it all i have depression and suicidal thoughts  so having all this stuff happen again  it makes me wonder if i ll ever even be in a work environment that doesn t make me question everything about myself  when i don t do things  i get yelled at and judged  if i do do things  i get yelled at and judged  it makes me feel like there s something wrong with me what would you guys do   and thanks for listening i really appreciate it  ,ka9plp

984,Worker’s Paradox... We Gotta Tear It All Down,humans evolved contributing what they could and having a place to live  with food to eat  in a space with close ones  oh  and not working nearly as much as we do now  lots of good reads on this  we work more than our tribal ancestors did  it s literally a part of our nature  since it is what we evolved to do    well  i think i partially figured out why this feels so close and yet so far   because of where things are at now  we can t help but   a  care about the suffering and reduced freedoms we see caused by greedy governments and corporations  despite us not being directly responsible for it and having no immediate power to fix it while   b  working at least 40  hours a week at a job just to have shelter  no even nice shelter  just bare minimum shelter  food  and some amount of quality of life   so you tell me how we are supposed to be relaxed while stressed because of the state of the world  and have a quality of life while being forced to do something that prohibits that  like working crappy jobs for 40  hours a week   humans are not supposed to be in a constant state of worry for how bad things are  if someone was sick or injured  we could directly help  we needed a break to ourselves  we had access to land  somewhere we could go without having to exchange all the hours in our day just to pay to be there    tell me how we are not trapped  how are we free while being forced to give all our time to a company  how can you relax and  grind while turning a blind eye to the suffering around you  if you aren t anti-capitalist  you are pro suffering    but most people reading this already know all this  so what are we going to do about it  how are we going to go from being really good at recognizing issues  to changing our problems    when lockdowns are over with  we have got to start linking up and getting community organizations started  and we have to be proud to be leftist  socialist  antiwork  and not be afraid to say that when asked  we are never going to change anything if we don t spread our message to people who aren t already a part of the massively left  myself included  community on reddit    before anyone says it  i work at least 40 hours a week  assuming i don t do overtime  which i do    i know we can t stand to see the injustices we see  i know i am fed up with watching right-wing authoritarianism rise all over the globe  we have got to not be afraid to wear who we are as a badge of honor  the same way propagandists wear  work hard  and  don t take hands outs  it s lazy  as badges of honor    who is with me ,ka5e6b

988,For those of you who think self-employment is a dream...,it's really not   being self employed does have its benefits  but it has major drawbacks too    1 is you are 100  responsible for your own paycheck   you can't be lazy or put in minimal effort because if you do  you sink    2 is much higher taxes   including taxes and expenses  i make about 40  of my gross revenue in profit   so out of every  100 i make  i only get to keep  40 of it    3 is discipline   sure  nobody is calling you if you don't show up to work  but it's so easy to get off track   you can't relax for an instant    4 is customers   if you can find a job that isn't customer-facing  then consider yourself lucky   you think you need a thick skin to deal with dickwads in retail   imagine if those dickwads were literally trying to take the money out of your wallet   it becomes a lot more personal when they're devaluing your work and time and not just being dicks about the situation     here's an example   i do freelance computer work on the side   a guy came in to have me upgrade his graphics card   the card was  429 99   i bought the card and charged him  459 99 and  29 to install it - so  60 over what the card costs on amazon   the dude flips out when he gets home and realizes he could have gotten it for  429 99 and demands that i price match   like  dude   429 99 is my cost   so i should just sell something to you at my cost and install it for free   how about you go to work tomorrow and work for free   does that sound good to you   it's true that i made  60 for about 30 minutes of actual work  but after taxes and expenses it's more like  25   okay  so  50 hour  right   hold it right there  buster   i don't have a guaranteed job with a guaranteed 8 hours of work a day   i get 2-3 clients a day   i'm a small business working from home   i barely make  15 hour when you divide what i make in a day by 8 hours   if you think i should make less than mcdonalds worker for a skilled trade  then fuck you   i'm not amazon   i can't afford to make  0 25 profit on a  400  part   and amazon's not installing it for you   do you like paying  400- 700 month for shitty health insurance with a  13 000 deductible where the only place that will take it is downtown where if i go to the doctor i risk getting shot   then become self employed   i went to the hospital for an mri and with insurance it was like  6 000   they didn't even do anything   how is it that they can charge  6 000 for pushing a button  but i'm demonized for making  15 hour   don't get me wrong  i've got good clients   old people who will pay me just to sit there and help them use the computer  some rich people who give me tips and say i should charge more  etc  but the bad clients are really freaking bad   this all lands on you   they can write a bad google review and cost you tens of thousands of dollars in revenue over the next 5 years  in lost business  because they don't feel like you're worth  15 hour   small businesses are not your enemy   most small businesses have 1 employee - the owner - just a regular guy trying to make it when big companies like amazon are selling stuff for  0 25 above cost to squeeze everyone else out   as much as i hate working for someone  i'm thinking about going back  to a non-customer facing position  mind you   shouldering all the burden is really difficult and you're shit on constantly by people who think you don't deserve to earn a living wage   sound familiar   yeah  it's just like a job   there's no ethical way to escape this bullshit   the 1  have found the only way to escape this nightmare - by acquiring income-producing assets and enslaving others with their wealth   i can't do it  guys   i can't hire some guy and pay him shit wages  but i can't afford to pay anything else  honestly i can't even afford to pay myself a non-shit wage   the other option is i can start ripping customers off to get more money  but i can't do that either   this world is literally set up so the only way you can get ahead is to fuck people over   it's so messed up ,kacvk2

1001,Take Power,i really don t know where else to post this  i know the main philosophy of this subreddit is to abolish work and to do as much work related  theft   take back what s ours  but we still are in a system that requires us to work  so as a way of trying to make our lives less miserable in the meantime  again  i am behind a lot of the main ideas posted in the ideology of this subreddit  can we post examples of us directly trying to do something about our work place s culture  i feel like it will encourage others to stand up against their managers as well    a brief small victory today was that i confronted my manager about making sure he is on  workers sides  as many managers value the company s success over the workers that keep it in business  the response i got wasn t much  but i think we need to normalize asking managers if they are on our side or not    the fact discussing wages is usually taboo  talking about unionizing is immoral  and just generally speaking about how bad work culture is  is considered wrong can t stand ,kay3w5
1002,Interviewer hiding in his car,i went for an interview at my current job to get a better position  i arrived on time  and then waited an hour  the interview was meant to be with my manager  i asked my colleagues where he was and they said they didn't know  i said alright  i guess i am going to head home then  i leave the store and i see him sat in his car and in my peripherals i see him get out the car as soon as i leave  that's an hour of my life wasted  he messaged me on fb saying  sorry we will reschedule your interview   i go in later that day to start my shift  he doesn't say anything about it  i am so fed up of being treated like sh t at work  but i need to stick it out for the sake of my c v     i don't know how managers can get away with stuff like this  how long would i of been sat there waiting for him if i didn't leave after the hour mark ,kaclme

1005,Anyone else getting screwed by their company this holiday season?,just been informed that my company will not be giving out their holiday bonuses as they've done for decades due to covid  what's funny is the multi billion dollar company has received an insane amount of money for covid relief  of course  this doesn't affect the salary workers but the ones who do the manual labor  the ones who control production  just curious if any other companies have decided to neglect the true working class ,kagm0g

1008,Coding won't free you from capitalist slavery,no point in listing my experience in the field since you have no means to verify my claims  i can be a rockstar dev today and a cute anime girl tomorrow without you knowing  this is the internet  but i can give you some objective  easily verifiable facts about why coding  learn2code bro  despite claimed by many to be the antidote against capitalism  make big money  retire early kind of fairy tale  is not what it seems to be  and why it's actually a bad choice   the field is now saturated  there has been rumours this might happen in the distant future  the future is now  the wages for junior programmers are often comparable to fastfood or warehouse workers  the mental fatique and long hours makes it actually worse proposition overall  the way human brain works  it cannot stop thinking about that problem you were unable to solve while on clock  look at  indeed com https indeed com  and other places that are littered with grotesquely low paying dev jobs pilling on each other   dev career is a very short one  not only because of severe mental fatique the job entails  brain constantly works on overdrive  projects are terribly planned  long hours  crunch times  but also due to the fact the older you are the more likely you are getting replaced by a fresh graduate  the thing is  apple and google employ only a miniscule amount of devs worldwide  most software written today is just rehash of old stuff and reinventing wheel  it's a mundane work with no creativity or high mental acuity required  senior devs can just as easily be replaced with young graduates for fraction of cost  and that's what's happening   do not fall into  older devs move into managerial roles  trap  there is barely any room there in the first place  and being a good dev says absolutely nothing about one's predisposition's to become a manager   very low entry barrier  experience means almost nothing as most devs are expected to learn specific language or framework to solve a specific problem and then move onto the next thing  most devs will never posses any industry secret or anything really that would make them irreplaceable  you may luck out by digging yourself a deep legacy ditch or build a vast amount of undocumented project know-how but that's only possible with terrible project management and with luck   software engineering development is a dead end career no matter how hard the capitalist spin it  the golden age is over  dev wages will only get depressed further on ,kame5i

1011,Can I get a 101 on how does abolishment of work make labour not suck? How can socialistic doctrines make it true? Eg. what would make my job in mutualist or communist economy not suck?,i'm no stranger to anarchism but it's hard for me to imagine not hating work  i just wanna work as little as possible and maybe a bit more if i feel the need for luxury  but in the end i'm still likely to learn a trade and do it for someone else in exchange for something else  either money or just access to all of social production  that means i'll be forced either by market's supply  amp  demand to do x amount of labour or maybe communes collectives accessible to me will insist on longer workdays   of course some minimal amount of work has to be done to keep society going but i guess it's not that much in 21st century  i'm just not sure it would be more pleasurable or if society would require only that minimum   i hope this makes sense  i'm not sure i'm making sense to myself right now  ,katk9i
1012,The stress is slowly killing us,i read somewhere yeah i know it sounds suspicious but wait till the end  that the average high school students stress is as unhealthy as smoking a pack a day and i read somewhere else that the average adult has more stress than a high schooler pretty obvious considering the way workers are treated but let me continue if the average high school student is essentially smoking a pack a day then the average adult is smoking probably at least a pack and a half and we all know that smoking causes several cancers but stress leads to high blood pressure not cancer but high blood pressure can cause blood clots which can be deadly it can also cause heart attacks and strokes which in conclusion means that we would live longer and better on average if antiwork policies were put in place i know this is a block of text with no punctuation but please consider that i m one of those extreme adhd people who has no attention span and will obsess over a single topic and learn all about it only to give it up two days later,kajdjd

1014,YSK about the historic Paycheck Protection Plan (PPP) Loans scheme implemented by the US Government,this subreddit is mostly memes i know  but i feel like there's not enough outrage around the  ppp loan program https en wikipedia org wiki paycheck protection program   the us government printed 2 3 of a trillion dollars to subsidize the payrolls of private companies   let the magnitude of what i just said sink in   they paid for-profit businesses to employ people      rather than directly transfer that money to people struggling  rather than create the jobs themselves and employ people like we did in the wake of the great depression  they transferred it directly to the business class when wealth inequality is at the highest it has been in over a century     these loans were available to any business with less than 500 employees with a few exceptions for businesses with even more employees than that   as long as the business had payroll to offset the loan  then it will be 100  forgiven in almost all cases     there was no need assessment in either the loan application or its forgiveness other than having the requisite payroll     in other words  the government literally wrote paychecks to the tune of  669 billion for private business   they paid the masters to keep us working and coming to the office during a fucking global pandemic     many companies will pull obscene profits this year as a result while we all remain struggling with our stagnant wages which will absolutely not go up  because covid  and on the verge of unemployment once these loans run out and we are of no use to the employer as a source of subsidy      there's not nearly enough outrage over the bullshit   it seems we've just come to accept our place and we'll take anything ,kaq4nn
1015,Hi guys. I just found this subreddit. I have a few questions,what is this sub for  letting of some steam about work related issues  or is this a place that really tries to help people live without having to work  what are the ideas on that  just for clarification i dislike the idea of kapitalism and would be a much bigger fan of some kind of communist society in the future,kaioo7
1016,Join the Dark Side?,i can't take this slow  methodical  bi-weekly ration that we call a paycheck anymore  it's driving me absolutely insane  it feels like some sick form of water torture  drip  drip  drip  every other friday into the infinite void  its rhythmic nature hypnotizes and tranquilizes me  like how the lines painted in the middle of a highway can put a truck driver in a trance  there you go  slave  there's another tiny ration  now go and spend it all quickly so that you have no choice but to come back and serve us    there is no point to any of this  i spend my days selling useless  toxic shit to people for poverty wages  not only does my job not benefit or advance humanity in any way  it completely destroys the environment and accelerates us towards catastrophe   some people are benefitting and profiting from all of this  very few people  i have tried to alert my co-workers to these things  but to no avail  they defend their capitalism vehemently and with fervor  class consciousness is lost on them  i am at the end of trying  they do not care or are even aware of the 1  juicing them for all they're worth  they do not care about the egregious  disgusting amounts of wealth inequality blatantly happening right in front of their faces  they do not care about their surplus value being outright stolen from them  they are more concerned with the beggar stealing a candy bar  that is true theft to them  not oligarchs taking everything from us in the open  they sweat and shake with anger when you force them to question their reality with words and logic  their eyes are closed  and they do not wish to open them  embarrassed  but only temporarily  one day they too will be rich   i don't know what the future holds for me  but i know that i cannot be a slave anymore  i cannot exist on other people's terms anymore  i must free myself from this existential nightmare    i am considering trying to just become a fucking capitalist myself  my rationale is that i have observed  first hand  many times  that most people want to be exploited  they not only want to be exploited  they are proud of being exploited and ask for more  they wear their wage slavery like a badge of honor  with many attempts and failures at trying to alert people to the absurdity of this  i have deduced that i most likely wouldn't even need to feel bad or guilty about exploiting people that willingly want to be exploited  are chains immoral if someone places them on themselves   i know that the chances of me even succeeding as a startup  especially b amp m  are extremely slim  especially during covid  i also know that i'd probably have to live in a car or something and eat nothing but rice and beans for years while saving money to invest in a company  i have no capital and make  10 an hour  it would take a really  really long time to even get to a starting point    my options seem to be just keep doing what i'm doing  vote and wait for revolution  lmfao good luck  disappear into the woods join a hippie commune  or try to join the capitalist class since i can't fucking beat them  i really don't want to do that and would highly prefer a complete overhaul of the economic system  but i don't think that is going to happen in my lifetime and i have legitimately entered into an existential crisis that seems to be pointing towards make or break time for me ,ka53cq

1019,I feel like I need to vent. I am so...so....sick of everything.,i work about 50 hours a week including 20 or so hours selling on ebay and 30 hours a week at my regular job   the company i work for is pretty much punishing me and not allowing me to change my schedule    i just cannot work so much anymore  my wife works full time as well and nothing gets done around the house  i have no time to even have a hobby  work out  anything   i am not even 30 and my hair is starting to turn grey    apparently my company has a policy that you cannot change your schedule unless you are meeting your  metrics  which are a nice set of numbers that keep the carrot of homelessness and starvation in front of you at all times   this is the most bullshit thing i've heard of  how the fuck does how well i do my job  supposed to have any correlation to how many less hours i want to work   i would actually do better at my job if i worked less hours  i have never  ever been able to sleep correctly  some nights i can sleep 5 hours and i am fine  other nights i need to sleep 8-10 and feel absolutely exhausted the next day  i also cannot function as a morning person   because of this  sometimes i go to work on 3-4 hours of sleep and half-ass do my job because i cannot mentally perform any better  i've almost drifted off at the wheel before    work does not give a shit  even though i am  part time  i have to work a minimum of four days per week  this is done on purpose so you cannot have a second job   there really isn't any job in the area that pays as well without a degree  unless of course i want to get into something like a trade  but i'm not going to risk running tools or machinery on 3 hours of sleep   i've tried to turn my self employment into a full time gig but there is just no competition any more  it's also a pain in the ass when you have to do all the finances and taxes yourself    self-employment also has too many peaks and valleys of income and i got a part time job to fill any gaps  trust me  i've been doing this about 10 years and cannot make anymore money no matter how hard i've tried    i also would have to start paying back my student loans and pay for health insurance out of pocket  which means i'd need to make an extra  1 000 per month just to pay an extra  800 per month  how ridiculous is this  it's a trap called the poverty trap  designed to keep people poor    due to the pandemic  it's hard to get another job right now  and a lot of them pay only half of what mine does    so i pretty much have to stockholm syndrome myself and take a giant pill called bullshit every single morning i wake up    employers don't like people like me  if you have mental issues  no  not depression  or health issues  you are pretty much worthless to them    employers don't like people who can think for themselves and stand up  they want cogs who can't see past the smoke that is coming from a burning pile of bullshit   they want people who can just bend over and accept it  this is why a lot of people smoke week  drink or take xanax  because they need to space themselves out from how shitty the reality of the situation is     i have no idea what to do  i can quit my current job but then my family sees me a as a failure  i then might have to go a week eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches until i earn another decent lump of money being self employed  or i can quit being self employed  and then i'd need to work full time  which would be next to impossible given my health issues ,katzhx
1020,Feeling guilty calling in sick when I'm actually sick - afraid I'm going to get fired,woke up last night and puked  haven't been able to sleep since then  if i would go in to work i would be running on about 3 5 hours of sleep    i'm not dying but i really just don't feel like i can do it   is it wrong to feel like i can't do it even though i'm not that sick    i was out for quarantine for two weeks because i came in contact with someone with covid and  while that wasn't my fault i feel like they're going to judge me for that  like i was already out four 2 weeks last month and now i already need another day off  are they judging me  i work in a school and we're full remote learning right now  i have so much anxiety   i'm afraid they're going to fire me for calling in sick  is this excessive absence ,kb1gfk
1021,Toxic Positivity in the Workplace, i know we have too much work customers are jerks you're slaving away to hit deadlines  and that's tough  but try to think of it as a challenge to stay positive  if you can't change the situation  change your attitude   gross  how about you just fix the workplace and then we won't have to pretend to be positive about horrible conditions  pay  hours and stress    workplaces seem to be encouraging doublethink  i find this kind of approach borderline offensive ,kaedj4

1025,Top 21 Best Comfortable Computer Chairs For Long Hours in 2021,choosing to work long hours is a mixed bag  sometimes  it s not up to you  but your boss  working hard can contribute to your success  you gain skills and experience fast  and you develop your grit  working hard can also feel very rewarding if you value and enjoy your work  on the flip side  you can also burn out  harm your relationships  and make poor decisions in your work because you re not giving yourself a chance to step back and see the big picture  prioritizing work often means de-prioritizing other areas  including health  many people still look at long hour hours on the job as proof of their work ethic  some historians trace the work ethic to the protestant reformation in the 1500s  when working hard was thought to align with the values of their faith     long work hours  an advice for your long day at a desk  14 000 hours  if you have a full-time desk job  that s the minimum amount of time you ll spend sitting over the next 10 years  add the nights you have to work late  the weekends you re called into the office  and those unexpected occasions you end up scarfing down lunch in front of your computer  and the hour count only goes up from there  americans who work full time log an average of 47 hours a week  according to a 2014 gallup poll  and some  of course  put in many more hours  while americans like to pride themselves on being the hardest workers around  it s not necessarily true  according to global statistics from the organization for economic cooperation and development  its 2014 report found that overall  mexicans average 43 hours a week  compared with u s  workers  34 2 hours  but in recent years  researchers have found that working long hours is linked with a variety of health issues  among the ailments linked with long work  hours are a stroke  heart disease  mental health problems  diabetes  and abnormal heart rhythms  experts don t agree on whether all workaholics or workers who put in long hours are cut from the same cloth  the debate  is it the long work hours or the mentality of the workers that affect health  some say those who work long hours by choice because they are  engaged  in work but not compulsive may escape the health consequences  and some people  of course  must work long hours just to make ends meet     an office chair might save your life  if you spend a lot of time at your desk  you know first-hand that an office job can take a toll on both your mind and your body  whether you work in a medical clinic  at home  or financial institution  any office job requires long hours in uncomfortable positions  as a result  many people experience posture-related back and neck problems  at the root of this problem is the quality of an individual s office chair  without a good office chair  you risk not only daily discomfort but the possibility of facing permanent damage to your back and or neck  it s no surprise to those that work in an office how important a high-quality office chair is  the difficulty can be knowing which one will work best for you     an ideal office chair is one that will not just keep you comfortable all day  but for years at a time  given the extensive negative impact a poor office chair can have on your overall health  the importance of owning the right one is difficult to understate  office chairs are not like a pair of shoes  you can t try it out for a minute or two and know for sure if it fits  to combat this issue  it s important to have a chair that you can customize and adjust to your liking  you need your chair to work for you  not the other way around  the need for comfortable office chairs that can reliably provide high levels of comfort for long hours has grown tremendously over the past few years  that s because  today  a huge chunk of our time is spent in the stuck in our chairs  given that you are forced to sit for about 6 to 8 hours a day at work  a

1048,Has anyone noticed how some people put on a total show at work?,the most recent job i have has a close environment with a few other people  one in particular is a younger guy who is either a total dork  putting on an act or both  hired by from what i can tell either an acquaintance situation or a family friend situation  who s family owns the company    this person desperately wants to play the part of a boss  embellished their linked in to give them a title they don t seem to act out at work  what i ve noticed is a super over the top outgoing personality  i feel like i m watching a tone downed michael scott character in real life    every once in awhile they randomly announce to the rest of us how much they love another coworker after getting off the phone with them  why  i have no idea because i ve barely seen them interact with said people  ive never heard anyone else here do that  when in meetings most of the time you can hear a huge fake laugh whenever the boss says something  when on the phone with other people they talk to them about what he  needs them to do  as if he s in a position where they need to do anything for him  it s like he s engaging in subtle manager speak  there are probably a million other attributes like this i can t think of yet   the theres a more insidious side  which is likely not so embellished   when they interact with offices outside of our area they make very personal paternalistic comments about how people should live their lives  budget their money  and they make jokes about disciplining people or if it was up to them  that employee would be gone  the best part is that they hardly do anything and will come in towards the end of the day and go  man  what a crazy day   i suppose all this alongside the ass kissing  which the higher ups seem to love  is just to convince everyone else that they re very important and deserve a leadership position  however despite the act  this is also the same person who cut holes in their mask  to let the hot air out   i personally cannot stand the massive level of douche vibes i get from the guy  i suppose it s their personal goal to ass kiss their way to the top of the ladder and it seems to work  at least here  the higher ups love the guy  it actually seems like they prefer you act the part  because some of the management have been so incompetent about covid  i can only assume they put on that  professional mask  without actually being smart of professional themselves   does anyone else have experiences with people like this ,kahv81

1052,Read my post and tell me if this sounds like a dream job.,i got into this job because i thought it would be a nice break from retail  how very wrong i was    15 hr to sit on my ass and answer phone calls  sounds sweet  yes it sounds nice until you actually do it   i'm coming up on my 1 year and i am already getting burned out   i hate how every minute of my time is tracked  people used to go to the bathroom if they got an upsetting call  well now if you go to the bathroom longer than 5 minutes  your time isn't paid  sounds like wage theft to me  as it takes a minimum of 2 minutes just to walk to the bathroom and back   i actually got coached  for using the bathroom too much  i guess twice in 6 hours is too much  i have to drink a ton of water otherwise my mouth dries out from speaking   speaking of speaking  the calls are back to back  your allowed about 8 minutes in your entirety of a six hour shift to do the following    - log into your computer    - check your emails  which includes a bunch of pointless fucking memos    - punch in    - take the daily health survey for covid-19    - fart  burp  hiccup and take a few seconds to collect your thoughts after someone screams at you    - request any time off  but you will probably run out of your five minutes before this   did i forget to mention our computers aren't even really computers  but  thin clients  so every thing takes about five times as long to do than using a regular computer   your calls are back to back  and everything is scripted  there is nothing new  you say the same sentences over and over and over again  some of them you have to read verbatim or you get in trouble   i thought maybe i could just reduce my shift to allow some time for mental health  nope  if your not meeting your metrics  aka  kpi's  you cannot make any modifications to your shift  even if your in college  you have to work a minimum of four days a week  so good luck having a second job  did i mention this is only part time  so i guess you have to spend a required amount of hell er i mean time with them  even though they supposedly offer  flexible scheduling   your allowed 8  occurrences  a year  this includes calling off or being late  did i mention your  late  if your one minute over your start time   they also don't show your number of occurrences anyway  so you just have to guess if your gonna get shit-canned or not   did you trip and fall on the way inside and need to get a band aid  too fucking bad  your now late   your allowed 20 hours a year of unpaid time off  did i mention this has to be put in two weeks ahead of time  so you can't use it for any kind of appointments   so you get eight whole days a year of being sick or needing to see the doctor or anything really  getting any kind of day off beyond this is like pulling teeth  i've had to submit emergency room paperwork before in order not to get fired   i've had to put off important health issues because i could not get the day off  and that was the last appointment they had for a whole month   communication is absolutely abysmal  literally every other day there is a new policy and your expected to use those precious 5 extra minutes to read the memo and understand it  you also get coached if you did something wrong because a week later they change the policy again and screw you for going over your allotted five minutes to read the new policy   everyone above me has absolutely no clue on procedure because of how often it changes  you can be told one one thing by one supervisor and something totally different by another and if one of them is wrong  guess who gets left holding the bag  you   i'm getting to the point where i dread going in  we are constantly hiring because either the people at the top don't understand that being a being a literal human computer is not an optimal job for many  many people  or they just don't give a shit   it would be so much better if you could take a very small break of even 60 seconds in between calls  but having any time that deviates from being a biological supercomputer is totally frowned upon   i'm not even 30 and my hair is going grey from this bullshit   what i typed does not even scratch the surface of this ball of shit that is working in a call center ,kaxhu7

1077,A life of labor is not a life i want to live,gonna be honest here  this is just a rant  i'm stuck in a retail job because its the most stable job i could find around where i live  the longer i work here the more i start to think about how much time i've wasted at work  theres an entire country  world even  that i could be exploring  but im stuck making money for someone else  the store im in makes more money in a day then i do in a week  its ridiculous   my pay isn't horrible compared to other places  and the fact that they pay weekly has made it easier to live paycheck to paycheck  but even so the fact that i sell my time for  13 hr is painful  and the amount of people in my life who have told me  thats just how life is  is depressing    my dream is to take my cat and my boyfriend and go do some vanlife  and just see the country and everything that life could be  thats real freedom  my family has laughed at me and called me entitled for having that dream and not wanting a career  but i do not dream of labor so why should i  if i do anything  i would like to do freelance web development to fund this dream of mine  because at least that way i am my own boss and i can do something i actually enjoy   its just disheartening when it feels like its so far from my reach and everyone around me acts like im lazy for not wanting to work my life away  but you know what  if wanting to be free from this soul sucking job of mine makes me lazy  then yeah i guess i am ,k7dmvv

1080,Question about the idea of coping with stress,i'm writing an essay about the destructive norms in our current work culture  how students are taught to accept it  and get introduced to it from an early age  something that has frustrated me for a long time  is the notion of putting the pressure of coping with stress upon the individual  we are taught breathing techniques  instead of removing the external factors that cause such stress  work  school for example  why are we to blame for not handling stress well enough  when it is a perfectly human reaction to the expectations we live in  would you blame someone for bleeding out after shooting them in the gut  where can i find some resources to keep reading about criticism surrounding the notion of stress coping  thanks in advance ,k8krzu
1081,The hourly based pay system is inherently flawed.,i just want to share an experience of mine from a summer 2 years ago when for 2 months i worked for a printing company  minimum wage of course  and the thing was that whenever we ran out of work  we were sent home early  with no pay for the rest of the day of course  yes  they could do that legally  so you don't want to hurry it since if it is finished before the end of the day you lose income  but if you are not fast enough  then some asshole will come harrassing you  so what do workers do in this situation  they literally pretend to be constantly occupied  working hard  and literally sabotage stuff creating work for themself  what is absurdity if this isn't ,k7q7jt

1092,Control through requirement.,why do they ask about your gaps in employment  why do they ask where you envision yourself when they already have an answer of ideal rather than expecting to hear the truth  they ask a question to hear the answer they've pushed through generation and brainwash  this is control   it's not enough you come to work for some company doing something that does nothing  you need to think the way they want you to think outside of work  you're controlled and manipulated in just accepting things should continue the way they are  because you're comfortable and have never heard otherwise  or worse  otherwise is met with distain and disgust   everybody doesn't need to be working  everyone doesn't need to believe the way we've been doing things isn't wrong  we don't need 6 supermarkets in every town of 15 000 people  we don't need however many thousands of mcdonald's there are everywhere  we don't need to be this spineless and unquestioning   sure  working is hard and a challenge  but it's not the real challenge  the real challenge is fighting to do what's really in your heart  and actually follow your wisdom and grow and be self sufficient yet ingrained enough in society to be content  the real challenge is harder  but the challenge of work is saturated with actual suffering  without end  except a retirement  when you're finally  free  and unhealthy and crippled  and empty because you spent your whole life doing a repeat of the day before  those final days where you're finally free  after you've lived so long that time is perceived so quickly because you've existed so long  that one day you'll wake up on your last day  surprised and in the worst possible existential pain ,k9adzg

1123,"When WFH ends, the levies will break...",working sucks  we all know and understand this to be true on some level  working from home  however has lessened the blow to some degree depending on what you do for a living  for instance i work an it gig and most days i log on  press buttons  get on conference calls and pretty much fake the funk  i play video games during the day  i fake work some days and i even skip some zoom meetings by pretending to have internet problems  it s great  i ve learned to exploit the system that was designed to exploit me   it s all  relatively  good now  but what about when this coronavirus shit wraps up  one day the system will dope us all up with the  vaccine  and our job will come knocking like an abusive ex lover  demanding that we come back  how will the masses re adjust to traffic  public transportation  cubicles and water cooler talk again  for those of you who work from home  can you imagine waking up at 4am just to be at work by 6  just to do some bullshit job you hate  i can t and when i think about it  i feel very ill  how will you handle the great return ,k7onsd

1131,"I don’t know where to post this, but I want feedback on this idea. A more reasonable approach to wealth redistribution.",so we all know the biggest issue facing america  and really the entire world  is growing wealth inequality  shrinking middle class and stagnant wages  right-wing media would have you tremble in your boots at the sound of those dreaded words  wealth redistribution  but no matter how you slice it  that is what needs to happen to stop us from sliding further into a disgusting dystopia where all is run by mega-corporations  where the only question society tries to answer is how much profit can be squeezed from a single human life    so the question really becomes how do you make wealth redistribution palatable  you ll never get right-wingers to agree to just tax the rich fairly and implement universal basic income  we re a long way off from that  so here is another idea  we completely change the corporate structure  make corporations legally obligated to split a certain percentage of profits with all employees  for example  50  of net profit goes to  lower-level  employees  then the remaining 50  can be split at the corporation s discretion between middle management  executives  and reinvestment into r amp d and expansion   i m not saying this solution would be any easier to implement than ubi and a wealth tax  but i believe it would be far more palatable to the right-wing  another problem of course is if we don t close tax loopholes for corporations  this scheme will fail miserably  but on a fundamental level  what are your thoughts  this is a way to achieve wealth redistribution by simply acknowledging that the workers who produce the products deserve more credit for their work  this scheme directly ties workers  wages to the corporation s profits  fixing the problem of stagnant wages and shrinking middle class ,k781vg

1135,No Training?,i have posted some of my story here before so this may sound familiar  i quit my tech job a year ago but i'm still struggling to process some of my experience  i guess i'm looking for some insight from others who have been in similar situations   i worked for a software company that made a cloud-based product used by many well known companies  i started out as a technical support engineer and eventually moved to a different role that was essentially onboarding new customers who purchased the software  at no point during over 2 years working for them did i ever recieve any formal training  we occasionally had meetings here and there that were called  training  but it never really helped  the software is incredibly intricate and understanding how it is used and functions on the backend it absolutely essential to do tech support  but the company never really seemed to make any effort to teach employees before putting them to work    is it common for tech companies to provide no training  or  training  that doesn't fully prepare an employee for the work they are expected to do  from the job i had and several interviews i've had with other companies i get the impression that this is the case  the attitude seems to be  just get your hands dirty with it and you'll eventually learn it   i've had some people in my life  boomers  with the attitude that i  wasn't trying hard enough  or  just don't understand how working is  which hasn't had a great effect on my mental health  this just seems to be the attitude of society in general   i eventually quit that job on the spot one day after reaching my breaking point  my experiences have soured my desire to work in the tech industry and although i am currently working toward self-employment i'm feeling a bit lost ,k7x2zj

1155,Something I realized,last night before going to bed  i was thinking about how in the past before modern day capitalism there were roles created for everyone automatically  and for the benefit of the community  fathers would teach sons how to hunt  mothers would teach daughters how to cook  and everyone had a role  nobody was homeless  and nobody was overworked  and this is what struck me - only under this modern economic system is homelessness possible  or dying of a heart attack from being overworked  or having health complications from undue stress via financial hardship  on top of that  most of the work is meaningless and unneeded and excessive  designed to only benefit the few instead of the entire community  the fact that we have to compete for jobs at all is ass backwards  there aren't enough jobs to go around  and most of the jobs that exist are either underpaid  unnecessary  or both  in the past  there was no anxiety of having to find a job  no anxiety of worrying if the next paycheck will cover your living expenses  no depression generated from the feeling that you don't fit into this hellworld  the anxiety  the stress  the depression - these all exist precisely because people are having a healthy and natural response to the environmental conditions they find themselves in  these feelings of dread we all have is our body yelling at us that something is terribly wrong  instead we are taught that we need to medicate these problems away  ironically further greasing the wheels of the capitalistic death machine by generating revenue for pharma companies and  mental health professionals  the changes needed to this system go way beyond just a decent ubi  there needs to be a fundamental transformation of the entire way we view the world  don't ever accept this current paradigm  and realize that it's not you  it's the fucking insane system we are imprisoned under ,k7xpzo

1160,Anyone else depressed from the idea that you'd have to work FOREVER?,i'm not against working  don't get me wrong  i like working on projects  etc  and by no means i want to just sit and have all the luxuries    it's just that the idea that if you stop working  you could literally risk basic needs such as food  shelter  etc  sure you can work part time but considering the covid situation  the inflation  etc  it's very tough for someone to even survive on a part-time gig  you'd barely be able to afford very basic stuff if anything  meaning forget about any saving for future  some people struggle with that even with a full-time job    so a full-time gig is required just to keep afloat right now  meaning you'd have to keep doing it forever if you want to keep afloat    i've been working full-time for over around 5 years now and already tired so the thought of having to keep doing it till the day i drop dead is alot more depressing than i can articulate ,k9anou

1165,Someone stab me so I can leave for a few days at work,two years ago i started working at a grocery store as a part time gig while in college  my first day the center store manager pulled me into her bosses office and told me if i heard anything in appropriate about her i needed to report it straight to her  that's a huge red flag  especially on my first day  turns out what people were saying about her were true  she goes out of her way to bust people's asses over the smallest of things  you can't drink water outside of the break room  if you're two minutes late she will try to get you written up  must be total black shoes no white logos or anything  the normal crazy shit  fast forward two years and we are in an international pandemic  i'm one class away from my degree and my job is pressuring me as an  essential employee  to work more  i end up working 40 hour weeks minimum  and i'm like ok i like the money and the hazard pay is kinda nice  well over the summer the night guy they hired called out  twice  and guess which poor sucker had to deal with it  see since i was the  newest hire with the least time restrictions   bullshit but ok  i was scheduled swing shift  so when the night guy didn't show up at midnight  i was the only one awake to work that shift  so i worked two fifteen hour shifts  still once again not too bad i got a massive pay bump and overtime on top of that for those shifts  but here's my favorite part  see the first time the center store wasn't there the next day so no problems  the second time she was the only one in charge  and i left at 6am that morning  started at 3pm  and had to be back that same day at 3pm since you know that's my scheduled shift and nobody is going to cover it other than me i guess  the center store gets there at 7 and looks at the one thing i didn't know i was supposed to do  make a peanut butter shelf look nice  and immediately thinks  that kid did nothing last night and stole massive amounts of time  so she spends four hours that day watching the security footage trying to find any reason to write me up and get me in trouble  she found nothing except me dancing at 3am working the entire frozen delivery we received late  and working backstock for three aisles until the morning supervisor arrives and that's when i leave since it's already me making  37 50 an hour for the last few six hours  i don't find out that she was watching security cameras for the next two weeks mind you  but one of the other supervisors does  and he hates the center store  so he files a report to hr saying she did this  and hr informs her that this was filed but also informs her she technically did nothing wrong and to keep in touch with them in case something happens as they can offer legal assistance  so one month after finding out that all of this went down because i got told to work overtime overnight and come back later that day you can imagine i'm pissed beyond belief and also seriously burnt out  because as you know  it's the middle of a fucking pandemic  so my burnt out dumbass starts getting sloppy and i show up to work three minutes late a couple days a week  well time clock rounds that up to five minutes late  center store thinks i'm trying to report her to hr and get her fired so she jumps on this opportunity and pressures the store manager who's been an absolutely awesome person to me and everyone else so far into trying to write me up  he sits me down and we talk and i explain i'm burning out i want to finish my degree but i need money to afford the rent because my rent is getting up there in the country as terrible rent  so he gives me a warning and pushes me to finish my degree and asks to not be late  and i try and do ok for a while  we hit thanksgiving season and we start having people getting sick and calling out normally they get told no doctor's note and no covid symptoms means they need to show up  but one guy gets a letter in the mail from the state health department that says he is required to self quarantine due to his roommate being positive  so he can't show up until he gets some test results  my ass gets roped into working twelve days straight  only two days of overtime mind you because they stacked the schedule to make sure they pay me as little overtime as possible  so i work it  and i slip up and am late a few times  just three minutes twice  i get four days off  my first day back after that time off they ask me to work another six day week the next week  at this point i tried to say no but they told me how desperate they were and how grateful they were that i was putting so much time in and i felt bad about the late things so i said yes  i find out i have ten days to finish my last class to get my degree so i start busting my ass off trying to catch up  i take the first test of six i need to finish  this professor is an angel from the heavens if those exist i swear  and lose track of time so i'm  seven minutes late  rounds up to ten on the time clock  yesterday  center store sees this  i get pulled into store managers office with the center store on his side and get asked why i'm late  and my dumb ass stops for a minute and says honestly i just want to finish my degree and leave this job i don't want to be here anymore  store manager cuts me off and scribbles on paper  reason employee says he's late  he doesn't want to be here  says that he hopes i can get my act together and he doesn't want to see me late again otherwise he's going to write me up and suspend me again  at this point i'm done  i'm tired  i hate this job  i hate the idea that i'm  essential  and yet i could still be fired today and replaced tomorrow  i was supposed to graduate last spring  now i have one week to finish this class so i can get a degree and hopefully do something a bit better than trying to be the reliable guy in a grocery store who always shows up even if it's a little late  my back is in constant pain  my hands are cracked dry and ready to bleed  customers say things like  at least you have a job  and then  when did grocery's get so high  and i reply  at least you have money for food  and then i get in trouble  i've tried giving myself vitamin c poisoning to induce vomiting and other food poisoning symptoms just to claim it might be covid but at work so they don't doubt me  that's the most fucked up part  i'm trying to self harm just so i can get away  just for a few days  i worked every major holiday this year  and the only thing stopping me from getting fired is that christmas is right around the corner  i want to quit but i can't walk out  i'm only working so much so i can stay in the same city as my girlfriend  she wouldn't leave her mom to move in with my parents   well  she would actually  but she won't be happy  if someone can come to my work and stab me with a small little knife in the side that would be perfect  i can't take it anymore and i have nobody to talk to  three years ago i kept having thoughts of killing myself  and i'm scared today because i want to live but i can't live like this ,k98e9p

1167,Two weeks of work requiring a MONTH notice. Feel like they own me,i worked in a job for two weeks and handed my notice in  they told me i had to give a months notice    this is nothing but clownery because in my country the gov website states that if you ve worked somewhere less than a month you are legally not required to give any notice  however  i signed a contract which has tied me into doing a whole month as they clearly realise trapping people is the only way they ll stay working at that miserable place  they are severely understaffed and since i ve been there four people have handed in their notice so they wouldn t budge on letting me go earlier    so  i have been trapped doing this for the past month and can finally leave on thursday  i was actually ill for several days last week so can t really tell them i m sick to get out of the remaining days    how do i get through this  should i just walk out  i can t bear it any longer  the next three days are going to be pure hell ,k908kz

1183,This restaurant is open 24 hours!,i don't think the modern trend of shops and restaurants being open for 24 hours  or very long hours  is good for business   the majority of those hours run at a loss  late nights are always loss except bars on big party weekends  most restaurants only make profit a few hours a day of lunch and dinner   it's horrible for workers because they work longer hours and there's less of them in every shift  so more work per person and less money your boss has available to pay you   i delivered food in different types of restaurants for several years and online orders didn't care about hours  it didn't matter what time you closed  always  10 minutes before you close  you will get flooded with online prepaid delivery orders  it would take the one driver who is still working another 2 hours to deliver everything  and then the next morning  broke students would call demanding refunds because the food was too cold   some restaurants experimented with different opening and closing times and it really didn't matter  10 30-11 am open and 10 00 pm close  stop online orders at 9 30  are like the most optimal for restaurants  being open later means those people who would have ordered the food earlier would rather get it delivered at the last possible minute   chinese restaurants usually close between 10-12 and pizza places sometimes as late as 1-2 am and some restaurants specifically cater to bar customers and stay open 3-4 am  jimmy john's  mcdonald's  they would make money for like 2 hours at night and they couldn't find employees to work just for a couple night hours  so it was always horrible for the few drug addicts who had nowhere else to work  and if you were a student  good luck not failing your classes   in the old days  it was better because all restaurants would stay open at the same times  very few exceptions like some bars  most countries that are not usa are still like this  people would only go out to eat at specific times and staff would be plentiful and all hours would be profitable  pay and employee morale was better   corporate managers or even small family restaurant owners don't understand the concept of diminishing returns  they think they can make more money if they stay open longer hours and overwork and underpay their staff  and that doesn't work in real life      tldr  a restaurant that's open 8 hours or 24 hours makes the same amount of money per day for the owners  more hours more overworked and underpaid staff  online delivery orders will always get submitted on grubhub 10 minutes before you close ,k8ejd9

1201,Direction of the Antiwork movement - how not to appear stupid and lazy in r/all and having more people to join,hi all  i would preface by saying this- we all hate wage-slavery  we seek to obliterate  or diminish  the opression by corporate entities who seek to maximize stealing the value of labour  over time we have incorporated various flavors into our movement  anti consumerism  unionization  etc  we simply seek to make the world a better  liveable place for everyone   we have grown  branched out  our demands haven't been excessive  it's just a slight redistribution of wealth by implementing policies like ubi  universal health care  basic housing space for all and various other feasible  humanitarian policies  but to actually improve society  we need people to advocate for the change  we need to advertise  to show that change is possible   however  the prospects of a complete systematic overhaul could be  daunting to many  my own opinion is irrelevant  but i just want to ask this  are we biting off more than we can chew  is advocating for communism really the direction we want to go  given that many americans could be  skeptical about it  why can't we develop the existing system by implementing the aforementioned policies   also  recently i have observed that some of the comments and posts are rather  extremist  do we really want to start advocating for rights of drug dealers  prisoners  etc at this very moment- when our movement is at it's infancy   let me know your thoughts regarding the direction this movement is heading towards or what steps should be taken to improve it ,k8ezaw

1208,I'm unemployed by choice and also a believer in hard work and discipline. Anyone else sharing my lifestyle?,i'm probably living in a quite unique way and i'm interested to see if there is anyone else doing the same thing  basically my situation is this  i'm living in finland on unemployment benefits  some inheritance money  i spend money very frugally  just on essential things  a bit of candy or chocolate now and then    my life revolves around self-discipline  a daily routine and a self-improvement mindset  i'm practicing saxophone  guitar   singing and juggling daily  i watch a lot of motivation videos and i'm inspired by the likes of dave goggins and jocko willink  my core values are faith  duty  discipline  humility and hard work  i wish to remain umemployed for the rest of my life  practicing an ascetic ethic and devoting myself to artistic pursuits  i want to volunteer in a multitude of ways  all of which i've done before can't right now cause of corona  teach juggling for children  teach guitar as a volunteer  do gigs for elders as volunteer  perform as a juggler voluntarily  juggle on the street  perform music on the street     i generally prefer performing voluntarily even when offered pay because there's less expectations and i feel much better about it when it comes from a place of generosity anyway     amp x200b   it's ascetic monkmode for life  basically     amp x200b   so  other self-discipline-oriented unemployed-by-choice people here  i can't be the only one ,k8sulw

1230,Just got fired today (Call center),so after 5 months at a call center ive been layed off      and to be honest i feel like just ranting   i fired due to not meeting standard required statistics which really pissed me off as i did so well  my customer responses was very high 4 5 - 5 5  i only ever had one escelation in my entire stay with this company  when everyone else gets on average 4 a day  escelations is when a customer wants to complain about the service and take it to a higher authority  my overall performance was great  but the business told me i needed shorter phone calls  less gossip on the phone  basically rush calls and get more work done  quantity not quality here for sure  and what do you know ever since i tried doing what they demanded my customer responses went to 2 5 and none of them enjoyed the call   i was also fired for having 3 separate illnesses in 5 months  with the 3rd illness being 2-3 hours long  i returned to work after my pain had gone but they saw this as if i had 1 week off  fucking 3 hours illness yet its still classed as one that is 1 week  an absence is an absence i guess   stupid thing is i told work that i was getting ill and needed support  yet i was penalised for taking any support  extra breaks etc   i had to go hospital today to get treatment for the pain as work made it worse and worse and now all is well and am receiving treatment  i literally told work if i can get time off for medical treatment i wouldn't get anymore illnesses due to being better but no help there they saw it as another illness and sacked    support  hahahaha    im not so surprised as a few classic red flags appeared during my first weeks 1  majorly high staff turnover rate  60 people started with me  45 left fired  2  6 month probationary period  for a fucking call center agent  um what the fuck   3  couldn't book any holiday in my entire time here  no one could    some extra to rant about includes the fact i'd have inbound calla  spend on average 40 minutes dealing with a case for a customer  phone call ends and not 10 seconds after i'd have management calling asking why i was not taking another call yet  the fuck give me a break    i was micromanaged extremely closely  every day my manager would call me for up to 1 hour a day to ask why this and that happened and why its not  sustainable for the business   the amount of times my manager would say this along with other micromanaging techniques began to feel almost harassing and made me feel as if there is no reward  only punishment   infact there was no reward working here  not once did i get someone say  you did good  or  well done    lastly the old  tell me if anything is troubling you and we can see what we can do a a business to support you    ugh i'm annoyed as hell but relieved too  working 9-5 30 is soul crushing  i feel i can rebuild what has been lost and damaged now    hope everyone is well and thanks for reading  ,k5krhd

Tell me that’s okay,i quit a few weeks ago  i have a pretty standard office job  working from has been difficult   i ve never liked it   but what really made quitting necessary was the people  i d get berated in meetings for the most absurd reasons  and when i shared that with my boss  it was just  shrug  that sucks   though sometimes she was guilty of yelling at some of my coworkers  onboarding was basically nonexistent  partly because of covid  but even before that  it was like i wasn t even working there  i got so little training  the straw that broke the camel s back was when i wanted to take time off when our family dog died  and my boss said  i m sorry but that s not our culture  what the fuck    my last day is next week and i have  completely  checked out  i feel bad for leaving my coworkers peers in the lurch  because they were kind and hardworking and they don t deserve the extra work that will be piled on in my absence  my clients customers whatever you want to call them are similarly left behind  but i can t bring myself to do anything for this company anymore  why should i help when i feel like leadership has gone out of their way to treat me like shit  it feels like so much of my energy was put into trying to be a good employee and now  it didn t matter  it never would have mattered  and now i m too burned out to care    if i were talking to someone  and they told me all of this  i would tell them to spend their last few days on the job surfing the web and day drinking  i think i need someone to do that for me  tell me i m not defined by my job ,k6n34v

1273,Is there a solution? Symbolic exchanges with loved ones,i've been following this sub for a little while now  and while i agree with the sentiment  it feels a bit like we're using work as a punching bag rather than find solutions to find meaning and fulfillment in our lives  i was watching  an overview of baudrillard's philosophy https youtu be 1yxg2 6 yls  after reading this week's pinned post about the society of the spectacle  and i thought maybe i saw a glimpse of a solution   if we spend more of our time focused on exchanging symbolic value with the people we are close to rather than amassing commodities  we might end up with a more content mind  for example  i dm some d amp d games for some friends  and i find that producing this to them is very fulfilling because the quality of the work is not a great factor in the symbolic value of the product  rather  the value comes from the apparent sacrifice of my time and energy to my friends  and the ability to create these good times with them   i guess my point is  perhaps the sort of 'work' that is important to do in this day and age when we have enough resources for everybody is the symbolic kind rather than the larger societal utility kind  we don't need everyone to work wage jobs  but we do want everyone to feel like they belong and can connect with others  once we're able to get something like ubi  a 4 day weekend  or a base wage that is high enough to survive with much less work than we are currently enslaved to  we'll still have the symbolic work left to humans  which no machine will ever be able to replicate  by definition ,k6kcwg

1276,I lasted 3 years at a popular retail place,   i lasted 3 years for retail and never again  at first it was a ok job but it kept getting repetitive everyday stocking the same stuff over and over  then i moved to asset protection as a customer host  i was shocked on how much people stole and how bad customers and associates acted  i was so good at spotting theft that i almost got to be a apa  asset protection associate  then my manager quit a year later   she was the best manager i ever had  she encouraged me to be a apa before she quit  when she left things went downhill from there  the apa position i tried to get got taken by a mcdonalds manager and she didn't know anything about security and shrink  so then i moved to sporting goods position   they made me cover half the store with no help  i had to do automotive  hardware  food  and pets returns  the returns was fine is just i was one person and i was expected to get the returns done before my shift ends  now i can sell firearms  fishing and hunting licenses  this company has a bad system for checking backgrounds to sell firearms   we were taught if a customer wants to buy a firearm we would have to make sure they aren't scamming the system or for nice terms  not a crazy person  here is where i quit  a customer wanted to buy a firearm  he was already angry and yelling at me from the start  immediately thats a red flag and no sale  it got so bad when i told the customer no i can't sell you a firearm right now   he got really pissed and caused a scene by my area   note this was a week after when there was a shooting on the news from these stores  so i was still really freaked out because of that  so the customer wanted to speak to a manager  i called my manager and told him what's going on  the customer was extremely nice to the manager while smiling behind his back at me   so i talked to my manager and told him i'm not selling this customer a firearm  then he said if you don't sell this customer a firearm i will write you up  so i walked out and quit  i will not be responsible for another shooting  that made me mentally sick and had nightmares for months ,k5if2q

1290,Fuck the United States of America. Working here is bullshit.,income tax is theft  the very concept of the taxation that we face today would have sent our forefathers reeling  the process by which certain taxation regulations even got passed has been shrouded in illegal deception and manipulation   today i was reading about the extent and level to which the united states government is trying to regulate cryptocurrency  bitcoin was created as the antithesis of this  all of this   the manipulation and deceit surrounding the federal reserve has been astounding  it admittedly caused the great depression  we have layers upon layers upon layers over this stinking onion of people's greedy little hands just trying to get any piece of the pie that they can  banks provide a service in lending  but why are we subject to seizure in our personal accounts from an entity that is so intertwined and incestuous with the government that they both might as well be called big brother    at 18 i had a bank account that i accidentally overdrafted getting gas - the charge did not show up until later and i did not know i was over by  2  two  dollars  my bank charged me an overdraft fee every single day  at the time i was working 30 hours a week in a minimum wage job while in college full time  i did not have a dime to my name  without the college meal plan i would not have eaten  and believe me i'm paying that college meal plan back a decade and a half later in interest charges alone  i have not even touched the principal  anyways  i went into the bank to plead with them to stop the charges  i begged  i cried  nothing could be done  it hit  200 and the only reason it stopped was because thankfully there was a cap for student checking  i had to pay it off because if i did not i was told it would ruin my credit   speaking of credit - everything we purchase in the us is based on owing someone something  we own nothing here  every asset can be seized by our government at any time  for any number of reasons which may or may not be valid  who cares  who is going to protest when there are a number of ongoing protests already happening with no one even blinking an eye  we might as well just put our heads under water and scream into nothingness   banks own us  and by proxy the government owns us  the way the government regulates inflation is through the banking system  it's a joke  we are all slaves to an agenda and a system that is milking us for all it can  we eat the preservative encrusted food it pushes at us  i'm looking at you sugar industry  and we get fat on the thought that we are free  we must be anyways because we are allowed to say that   but are we really  anything we say can and will be used against us by a court of our peers  people lose their jobs over something stupid they said on a social media platform  yeah  i get it  racists shouldn't be allowed to be employed in a role where their disgusting personal beliefs might affect their service  but it's a slippery slope  motive in the eyes of the law holds an utmost importance  but in the eyes of the cancel culture judge and jury ignorance is no excuse  even if what you meant to say was taken out of context entirely  so how are we free when something that is harmlessly said might cause you to lose a job - which in this country might mean the difference between a roof over our heads or sleeping on cardboard outside  i get it  ostracization as a social reinforcement for behavior and a culture that is against what we as a people want  is a necessary tool  it's been used for biological and evolutionary reasons by all species  but what happens when the lines between what you are ostracized for blur  and it starts to feel like you can't say  do  be anything other than what you are told you are allowed to think  believe  and feel   we are 27 trillion dollars in debt  an unfathomable sum  by a country that states a reason for the federal reserve is to help control inflation  why are our justifications swallowed like a spoonful of sugar when they constitute excessive and inexcusable hypocrisy   just today  reading about the crackdown on cryptocurrency  the us said it needed to do so under the excuse that cryptocurrency funnels illicit activity  what about the 400 billion dollars wachovia bank funneled for the cartel  those were united states dollars motherfuckers  everything is just swept under the rug   the middle and lower socioeconomic classes received next to nothing in terms of relief during the pandemic  while evil corp walmart who feeds every dollar it can into third worlds regimes to get bottom of the barrel prices in roundabout ways  through the companies who own the products they sell  is allowed to up and up their gpm's while paying their employees so low a bulk majority of people have no choice but to get food stamps  people who wake up and breathe and work their asses off only to be told they need  government hand outs  to survive  let alone thrive  let alone wake up and have a hope and a prayer on formulating a plan for a different life that does not involve entities exerting their power  keeping it looming over everyone's heads  people who were forced to work during the pandemic  people who remain the most at risk population for getting sick and ending up on the streets because of it   one time i overhead two judges talking about how the fines for someone driving with a suspended license were not high enough  and that  200 was nothing  but if you've ever been there  you know that to some people  200 is everything  the mindsets and the understanding in this country is so fucked from individual to individual  the people making the rules can never fathom the day to day of the vast majority of the population  and this is a democracy   we're in the matrix  an ever-spinning web of officials and laws and regulations and backdoor agendas  draining each and every one of us in this country from every orifice they can until we're old useless turnips  and then we're tossed onto the heap pile  work  work  work  you can reward yourself with a mcdonald's burger  an ice cold coca-cola  six hours of tv a night until you're bleary eyed and useless  and maybe on drugs to numb the grey of monotony and shackles   human sovereignty is not this  education is at an all time low  family values are even lower  both parents in the rat race  barely affording the cost of keeping the kids in daycare  who can buy a house without a leg up from mom and dad  commercials about medicines who side effects cause more symptoms than the illness itself  yet we go into doctor's offices and ask for them by name  our meat factories are places of actual evil  what we allow each other to put into our mouths to make a bigger profit margin is poison   what is lower than this  in my opinion we are reaching the depths of the degradation of society   media is a joke and cannot be trusted  we are told what to think by the ai in social media  like lambs to the slaughter  and yet we continue ,k6wdo3

1293,"Wage slavery, but for my family",i work for minimum wage  for my family  the context of as to why differs from the greed of successful corporations - i'll explain  firstly  the reason i'm paid such a low wage is due to the size of our business  only 3 employees and have only been in motion for about 3 years now  secondly  the profits go directly to my family  which ultimately benefits me as i'm lucky to have supportive parents  in that sense     however  it seems my father  owner of the biz  has diluted himself into thinking this will turn into some turn-key capital acquiring powerhouse of which will support my entire family  the reality is we are grinding our fingers to the bone for rich people  luxury automotive repair  i'm the service writer  and the only reason we have a decent clientele base of affluent people is 1  they are the only ones who can afford  and who are stupid enough to buy these luxury vehicles 2  they know we are a very small business and take constant advantage of that fact  both in the sense that they use their economic position  and its perceived importance   to bargain and take total advantage of my father  who unfortunately bends over backwards at their beckoning request     its painful for me to see how incredibly hard my father works trying to appease these people  the majority of which are alarmingly stereotypical in terms of their unfeeling class awareness  i work on the east end of long island  and i want to stress that i work for  literal  billionaires  we started out by doing auto repair on site at the estate of a billionaire with an absurd collection of multi million  yes  million  dollar vintage ferraris  his influence has since led us to acquire tons of affluent clients and once we could no longer facilitate traveling to each estate for service my father decided to rent a building and take out loans to set up a proper shop  my  family has been  and still is in a state of literal paycheck to paycheck living  the business has not at all helped in terms of financial mobility and now thanks to this venture we are in much more debt than before     i started helping my father when i was about 14  seeing the estate of a billionaire up close at that age was the catalyst for my largely anticapitalistic views  hard to describe how impactful it was to watch another man of my fathers generation treat him and us like shit whilst standing on the polished porcelain floor of one of his 6 garages  knowing i had to hold my tongue as our income depends on it  at that moment any positive sentiments i had about rich people flew right out the door and i began taking serious interest in these dynamics     anyone who idolizes the rich or the pursuit of capital in general has not dealt with rich people on a regular basis  and if they have and still do idolize these things - they are either lost in the myth of meritocracy  or they're a sociopath    to summarize  my father like the majority of people idolizes these positions of affluence and genuinely believes with enough  hard work  the we too can join them and separate ourselves from financial anxiety  its blatantly obvious to me that we are being taken advantage of  and at best our business will continue to provide the base level  sustenance  which can be provided by wage slaving for a cooperation  none of us have  business  experience and have very little  financial education  - in short  we are honest people  we don't have health care  we don't have retirement accounts or the ability to save money  my father is 60 and will likely have to work until the day he passes along with the rest of us     i wish my family could come to the same conclusions i do - it would be a large source of comfort as i feel  guilty' for not being stoked to eat the crumbs of billionaires  above all i wish my family and the millions of others who are in similar economic gridlock could simply exist without this anxiety and struggle over basic needs permeating throughout every aspect of our lives       never let someone tell you wealth isnt immoral  civility has no bearing on the inherent immoral nature of wealth  and the personal characteristics of someone who holds said wealth are largely unimportant  although i'd like to add that from my personal experience  most of these people are of astonishingly low personal character       thanks for reading  had to vent,k5cvnd

1296,"It's ridiculous that society is willing to tell us that we don't deserve food, water, shelter, education, comfort or happiness but then act dramatic when we say we're suicidal",i just don't get it  people will tell those of us who don't work that we don't deserve to be treated like adults  and yet they still get dramatic when we become suicidal and then want to know  whats wrong  i hate when people ask me what's wrong  because being treated like a child as an adult is what's making me sad  it's not some other underlying cause    i just don't think it's fair to expect people in my position to want life  i'm 26 and i still don't know what it's like to have my own place  i don't know what it's like to be in a relationship or have friends  i don't get to make decisions on what i eat or what i wear  i don't get to decide what i do on any given day aside from what i choose to browse on the internet  i can't participate in family functions or even simple things like going out to lunch with them because i don't have any money  i'm not even in a position to be able to do my own laundry because i don't have a car or money  so i'll sometimes be forced to wear the same clothes for weeks  which believe me i know  is disgusting    not being able to make decisions on my own lifestyle is probably the worst part though  i'd be a vegan if i had a choice  but i've learned that having preferences when you're in a position that you can be kicked out of is a really bad idea  so i eat meat everyday even though it goes against what i believe  i'm in my mid 20's and i'm not even allowed to drink because my dad won't allow it in his home  knowing that i have the same rule's teenagers have over them is just so depressing  i'm soon going to be in my 30's and i'll still be treated the same way i was when i was a 13 year old  just because i don't agree to give up 5 7ths of my life to a system i don't agree with  capitalism really is a cult in my opinion  it's either do it their way or you will be tortured in some form  whether it be living with someone against your will or being homeless  you  will  suffer    i know things could be worse  and i'm thankful i'm not homeless  but i feel like i have the bare minimum of what can be considered  a life  and i don't feel like it's fair to expect people in this position to be happy  i just want to be treated like an adult  not because i take part in capitalism  but because  i am one  until that happens  and believe me when i say i know it won't happen  i reserve the right to want out of this world    if pain free methods out were legal i wouldn't even exist right now  i don't get how society as a whole can agree that euthanasia should be illegal and then complain about having to take care of people like me  when i'm literally asking them for a pain free method out  you can't call someone who is asking to leave the world a burden to the world  the people forcing us to be here are the ones creating the burden  i wake up everyday and think to myself   i just want a pain free method out  that's all i want  that's all i'll ever want  i've had this same exact thought every single day since i was 18  i do not want to be a burden on anyone  but i'm here against my own will  you can't force someone to live and then complain that they exist  i'm only here because enough people in the world believe that people like me don't deserve to choose for ourselves if we live or not  i'm only here because of the beliefs of  other  people   when people tell me to  get my life together  what they don't understand is that on a scale from 1-100  living with my dad is about a 2 in terms of overall happiness  but when i was working  doing things against my will and being forced to be around others  i was at a solid 0  people don't understand that not all brains work the same way  some of us really would rather die than be around other humans all the time  but it does not follow that i enjoy living at home  society isn't offering me a way to  get it together  because i'm not a person who can be around others everyday of the week and be happy  my brain doesn't work like theirs  and it never will  i would never choose to work with  or live with people  and as long as those are my only 2 choices i'm going to be suicidal    at one point my dad did kick me out of the house  for a day  and i can honestly say that even though it was the most terrifying moment of my life  it was also one of the happiest  because even though i was homeless  it was the first and only time in my life where i could call it my own  i realize i would have probably hated it very soon once hunger set in  but really think about how much a person has to  hate the choice between capitalism or living at home to actually get excited to be homeless  i'm so desperate to be treated like an adult that being homeless for a day  felt good   it's too late to get help because i don't even want to be a part of this system that is willing to do this to people  even if there was a magic button that would make me a normal  functioning member of society  i wouldn't press it  as long as society think treating people this way is okay  i refuse to be on their team  i just want to do everything i can to push towards a world where everyone is treated with respect and kindness  regardless of how their brain works    some humans are just not willing or able to take part in capitalism  and we're going to suffer endlessly and relentlessly for it  doesn't matter if you're a good person  doesn't matter what you know  doesn't matter what you do  if you don't have money  it's game over  capitalists really do believe our suffering is justified  and yet they expect us to not be suicidal  sorry but that's not going to happen  if they expect to live in a world where they can set certain standards for who should and who should not be treated like an adult  then some people like me aren't going to meet those standards  as long as i'm being treated so badly  just for being myself  i reserve the right to be suicidal  my brain is reacting exactly how it should to being treated like a child despite being an adult  i would honestly question my sanity if i was not suicidal under capitalism        it is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society  -  jiddu krishnamurti https www goodreads com quotes 13620    to be

1306,"Working doesn't cure depression, and can in fact make it worse",when i was in my 20s i used to be unemployed and to suffer from crippling depression  desperate for a solution  i allowed myself to be convinced by some friends that i was depressed because i was unemployed  one of them  a very conservative christian  even implied that mental illness was an imaginary concept  just an excuse of the lazy to refuse to work  so  partly to shut their mouths  i searched for a job and eventually landed one  it was a job with nice pay and benefits  i considered myself lucky and felt happy at first   the first few weeks went fine  sometimes i couldn't focus very well and i sensed my motivation dwindling but the rhythm was slow and it felt good to be contributing to society in some way  i also liked the change in my lifestyle  it felt more structured and i could enjoy my leisurely time more because i had worked hard before  it made for a nice contrast and a guilt-free enjoyment  at least that's what i was telling myself  in retrospect to reassure myself    but then things went south pretty fast  my manager was intent on squeezing me like a lemon  welcome to capitalism  and when i had mastered a task she immediately piled one more on me  soon i had 7 different jobs to do  daily  in the office  it became a non-stop grind  stopping only for the midday lunch  i began to crack under the pressure and to make mistakes  which added even more stress because there was an extremely low tolerance for failure and  unmaking  the mistakes was a a hard job in itself  the constant stress compounded my untreated depression and  despite trying hard to be a good worker  i became a wreck  i dreaded going to work  when i came home  i never managed to practice any hobby because i was too exhausted  and i just ended up in my bed  browsing reddit on my smartphone  or watching tv series  until the night came  i began to suffer from severe insomnia because i think my brain wanted to delay as much as possible the moment i would be waken up for work  when the week-ends came i slept until the afternoon to recover some sleep  then i would try to play videogames but my brain was obsessed by the coming monday  so much that i couldn't enjoy my gaming  i thought that things would eventually improve with everything becoming more routine  but it never really improved  the time just passed a bit faster  the only moments i felt happy were during vacations  otherwise  i was more unhappy than i had ever been  i began to take antidepressants but they didn't help   i wanted to go part-time  working only the mornings  or working only 4 days a week would have ironically made me a far more productive worker  but i couldn't  so after a year  i sent my resignation letter    my depression is now cured  it was caused by childhood trauma and toxic mental schemas  working a 9-5 job  which in my case turned out to be a 8-6  was just making it worse ,k5qz37

1311,Discussion: What do people here think about the military?,first of all  please forgive my english  i am from india  and english is not my first language    i want to see what people here think about the military  working as a soldier  i myself never was in the military  but know people who did join the military  including my family relations  i have uncles and cousins who were and are soldiers  i have great respect for all soldiers and i admit that military is necessary  but that does not stop me from realizing how terrible the military cultures is    basic military training feels like brainwashing to me  and military culture itself is borderline cultish  everyone is made to dress same  have same hair  told they are worthless  denied much privacy  insulted  made to self-blame and broken down before being built back up as a 'soldier'  i have been told that the training is challenging and fun  but at the same time being yelled at for no real reason and group punishments degrade you  it might be necessary to 'create a warrior'  it might useful in preparing the soldier to face the stress of combat  but you can not deny how degrading and insulting it is    once you are done with everything and are finally a soldier  good  all those childhood dreams of being a badass warrior fighting for god  people and country quickly shatter  you realize it is all working for some powerful big fat people to be cannon fodder for their dirty work  you are treated terribly and quickly realize that being a soldier is not what you imagined it to be  fighting like rambo all the time  you may never see combat  and do boring tablework mostly   so  you get brainwashed  get degraded and humiliated as a part of your training and your job  you can  possibly get traumatized from seeing combat and get mental problems  possibly get permanently injured  and possibly even die serving the big guys' interests  you will be worked like an ox  paid terrible wages  have a chance of facing discrimination and harassment at work  you might get bullied  and things do not improve once your service ends  there exists enough studies on how much veterans suffer  and how they have increased chances of getting anxiety and depression and are more likely to commit suicide       to me  being in the army sounds worst of the worst ,k6rrbn
1312,Our CEO is kind of a dick,i won't go too much into details or mention which company i work for but it's a big company  several months ago our ceo invited the whole company to a zoom meeting talking about how if we aren't able to get to a certain market share then he can't guarantee that we will all have jobs by the end of this year  we worked hard and were worried about what might happen if we can't hit that goal  a lot of us would be screwed considering we are in the middle of a pandemic and good jobs can be scarce so we did our best   fast forward to now and it looks like we hit  our  goal but i found out about something concerning  now  this was never announced to us obviously but a co-worker of mine happened to come across an article with his name in it  when i read it i didn't know if i should be pissed or happy  our ceo's name was on it mentioning how he broke the record for purchasing the most expensive mansion  within that county but trust me  it's worth a lot  a few months ago  this was shortly after our little company-wide  zoom  meeting and happened before december   like dude what the fuck  he threatens our livelihood and brings up how if we can't do our job correctly  he cursed while talking to all of us too  then he might have to lay us off but then goes and buys the most expensive fucking house during a pandemic  am i crazy or does he come off as a complete asshole  i am pretty sure that whole zoom stunt was because he knew how expensive that was going to be and scared us into working harder to cover the difference   just had to vent about this  can't believe he did that ,k6xd56

1339,Going voluntarily homeless; how to deal with parents?,i'm going to stop renting my room next year  i've already made thorough preparations for living comfortably without a roof over my head  i've   - invested in good  compact weather-resistant gear  found a few good spots to sleep where no-one will bother me - identified public sources of water  electricity and wifi - put  40k in a mutual fund  which i should theoretically be able to draw  1600 a year from  and planned how i'm going to eat for no more than  1600 a year   even if the stock market ends up being shitty  it still should be enough to last me 25 years  which should be enough time to get my passion projects off the ground since i can work on them full time  if push comes to shove  i also know how to dumpster dive  - had a few  trial runs  of not living in a house  and learned what to avoid  has anyone else done this or is thinking about doing this  i'm not sure if i should tell my parents about my plans  i'm 100  sure at least one of them would freak out if they knew   i could lie to them  but i'm afraid they'll find out eventually since i want to stay in my current area where all my friends are  if they do  it might be worse than if i'd just been upfront with them to begin with  maybe they'll understand if i explained all the precautions i'm taking   i'm also worried about whether they can forcibly take me off the streets if they found out  i'm nearly 23 and live in australia  does anyone know what the law would have to say about this ,k70vfn

1353,Cameras at work,is it just me and my line of work or is everyone relentlessly watched at work on the cameras  i've had multiple jobs in the past few years where we've been watched 24 7 on the security cameras  and threatened that our managers and bosses can see when we're not being productive   my first job at a retail store had cameras in the store obviously to catch shoplifters  but i heard that after i left they added a camera under the counter where the girls worked at crotch and butt height  and the husband of the owner would watch daily   my next job at a doggy daycare  my manager would watch the cameras religiously and confront you if she saw you on your phone or speaking too long to a coworker  then she would go home after her shift and continue to watch all of the cameras for the rest of the night   my current job has cameras everywhere  my boss's husband watches the cameras every hour of every day  he keeps them on at home  when traveling  while working  according to my manager one of the cameras records audio and they regularly listen  so we have to be careful with what we say   i'm pretty sure this is illegal  i didn't find this out until i had been working here for three months   i'm currently trying to leave because there's no masks  social distancing  or covid protocols at all    it puts me on edge every single day i'm at work and i'm positive this is affecting me negatively in the long run  my paranoia is leaking into my everyday life  i'm always on edge  i don't have any trust in my bosses  coworkers  or their family members apparently  knowing i'm being watched by my boss's weird husband is anxiety-inducing and makes me extremely conscious of what i'm wearing daily    this sucks  is this a commin thing  or and i just extremely unlucky about being watched at my jobs ,k4oln8

1356,"Being fired for not giving 100%, while giving 100%",i'm gonna tell you about what happened last time i had a job   in april i was employed at the post office  mostly sorting letter formats  stamping  etc  i probably had some more luck getting the job  because i have a certificate about disability due to my severe mental illness and where i live companies must have a certain percentage of workers with disability  to help inclusion  everything worked fine for months  even if it was quite hard for me because of my mental struggles   then one day there were a lot of factors influencing negatively the particular task i do  for example i got boxes of letters not neatly arrayed  but all over the place  which meant i needed to arrange them myself  also the machine i was working on had a lot of problems and i had to call the mechanic several times   so of course the carts with workload accumulated at my work area and the shift supervisor came over to me and asked me why i don't give 100  i tried to explain the factors making it hard that day  but she interrupted me  starting to get personal  implying that i'm worse than anyone else on this planet   not only did i do as fast as i could  i was also one of the few workers staying longer when asked and helping others  when i had completed all my tasks   the next day i was called by the staff manager  she wanted to push me into quitting on my own  which would bring me more problems in the future than if they just fired me  but for a solid 45 minutes of discussing i refused to quit   i brought in the employee representative and the commissioner for the disabled and they were appalled by the way i was treated  they worked out quite a good deal for me  they couldn't change that i was being fired  but the post office company had to pay me for another 1 1 2 months on leave   this wasn't the first time the shift supervisor fucked up that hard and from what i heard she got into trouble because of this  i guess this is a perfect story on how to lose hard working employees by demanding perfection in an imperfect system     amp x200b   tldr  i was fired for supposedly being too slow  while there were other factors making my workload aggregate  after involving the employee organization  quite a good deal was worked out ,k4j7e5
1357,Is it just me or recent interviewers are getting worse and meaner (rant/vent),hi  i usually would post these kind of rants under the monthly thread but i couldn't find one   anyway  i have reached a few final stage interviews over the past few months  every one was outright horrible  made me eyeroll  if i keep on doing interviews  i might end up getting ptsd from the humiliation and debasement    in the end  i accepted the offer from the interviewer who wasn't snobbish  he was genuinely curious about my past experience without being condescending    i have met interviewers who probed about my privacy  they want to know my educational history down to elementary school  why i didn't stay in the states post-graduation to work  i'm non-american  and also wanted to dig deeper into the health issue  which is depression that i'd rather not reveal   there were also two guy interviewers who made sure to put me in a tight spot  one of them made a snide remark when i was elaborating on my skillset  he probably was not impressed that i would choose to talk about such a  basic  skill  honestly  if employers did not turn interviews into hunger games  we didn't have to bullshit them all the time    one interviewer wanted to know my passion and specified that he didn't want textbook answers  i already knew by then that the work must be demanding and exploitative  i hate it when people glorify their jobs and the hustle  if he wants a  passionate  worker  i'm sorry to say that i'm not one  i won't do a sloppy job either  just don't use those buzzwords that make me want to puke   the most horrible experience must be the  i want to know all  interviewer  asking irrelevant questions and invading my privacy  i hated that dude to the core so when their hr extended an offer  i turned it down without a second thought   i have learned from experience  that if you hate the people who interview you  it's likely that you'll hate the job  being antiwork   bad work environment is a devastating combo    my ex-boss was my final interviewer  he spent an hour to tear apart my resume and acted all snobbish  as if  should be grateful that they were giving me an offer  hated that dude too ,k4jhox

1359,I really hate those Online Training Programs you need to do every year and try my best to rush through them,yeah  i know whats the purpose of them  heck as someone who was in audit i know the importance of ensuring employee's adequate training and familiarization with the firm   but its all just a rubber stamp process at the end of the day  to say hey we did out job and told our staff about what they should know so you can't blame us   all this stuff is fucking bullshit that no one believes   no bullying  anti harassment  fair treatment  standing up for core values  no discrimination  making worker's lives comfortable  respect  meritocracy  whistleblowers  standing up for yourself etc etc   its all fucking bullshit that no one deep down believes  the funny thing is many companies all said the same shit  and surprise the most established firm i worked for ironically did the complete opposite of those values   even if they don't directly bully like calling you a names  what's to simply stop them from giving you a hard time by overworking you  saying you make tons of mistakes and finally in your end review  saying how shit you were  after all if they say you were a crappy performer  then clearly you're in the wrong and therefore its you who's failing these values    also another thing  you report me to hr  but do you have any direct proof of me doing anything against you  if not then you're just a damn troublemaker  a low performing one too  do you think the firm will take the side of a low performing troublemaker over me    people know all these rules or values ain't gonna stop them from being assholes  they'll just work around it  for example they say you should discriminate against some older lady who's going to be on maternity leave for promotion  ok then i just say the other person has done a better job and he should get it  since reviews are subjective or different metrics are arbitrarily given more importance  the boss has done nothing wrong to snub that lady  after all we hire and promote the best people right   in short all this stuff they preach in training doesn't really work  no one really takes it seriously or even if they do on the surface  they'll just work around it  even in stringent established corporations ,k4m69y

1364,Attitude problems?,i love how when you have a customer yelling at you  being just completely unreasonable  demanding ridiculous special treatment  and you still do everything you can in the best demeanor possible and yet still not good enough  yet all they have to do is call corporate   get everything they want because god forbid the company lose a trouble customer that will do more harm than good  and you get a lecture about your attitude problems  written up  or even terminated  we are not robots  we can only be so professional under so much stress and abuse  learn that your employees are people and that we can only put up with so much before we put our foot down with a customer in a professional but stern stance  it's quite ironic that these companies always say  it's so hard to find good people  you had good people you just chased them off ha ha ,k4ruck
