1,"Don't you hate this kind of ""arguments""?",im talking about those arguments that sound lefty but are not more than a continuation of the exchangevalue society and commodification of human lives for example when debating access to healthcare or education most would say you deserve it because you produce instead of arguing in favour of it as a basic right of every human being therefore just reproducing the logic of productive and unproductive labour or the disciplining of human lives for capitals sake as a permit to ask for usevalues even when defending inmigrants the left is prone to say but they are workers too or they pay taxes too which is just missing the point  this reproduction of the workethic and abstract labour power sickens me maybe im just an idealist but i know we can go further than just criticize distribution or exploitation of the working class we should strive to criticize the basis of our society our mode of producing and thinking about labour and our lives too this is the big challenge today more than ever and with the decline of formal work it will be the debate to come and to win,8y2jzf
