33,2018-2019 British perspective of work,hello readers this is an incomplete collection of notes and poems compiled in a talking word script that i hope people can relate too i am not a writer and i consider this work incomplete and at worst a topical ramble i have been through some exceptional hard times and i needed to express intense emotions when work induced isolation was ruining my life  for context i am a young adult with learning difficulties since birth  i live in the north of england in a region often ignored by the london centric spending government apologies if my grammar is awful       lips whisper pockets empty the north forgotten to those with plenty a region where our ts are lost in water furthest from the south looked upon as paupers  thought is a gift to which we paint a broader picture bristles dipped with colour from my hearts own literature tedium is endemic moods are low will tomorrows brexit be the killing blow to the essential collars soaked in workmans blue austerity drains them as the one percenters grew  like you i am stuck in the cycle of 9 to 5 what is a mans life worth when it takes a nosedive  concrete ledges beckon an escape to stand upon the railings is prevention too late where my desire to pass to the other side is as equal as the shame that wants me to hide seeking a remedy from the daily torments i face ive turned against myself with the blame i continue to lay  our culture born from capitalistic greed  we hoard our belongings from the desperate and thieves  we are told to want the allure of possession  a shackle we voluntarily apply  i dont believe that my future is bright i see exploitation in my ceaseless fight i yearn for social mobility stuck in place trapped in a selfmade cage most of us are destined for the scurrying we make tiresome hedonistic treadmills in the familiar rat race  who else tells themselves that they are better than this where is the solidarity competition is fierce sweat expelled tears swell bleeding hands our freedoms knell we build a society with no thought of the game a system that forgets the forgotten if you want to see reality look about you and see who is suffering  our country is held together from those shouldering pain its structure and history wrought from colonial gains    why are we this blind  cannot see the outcome selected rhetoric stifles our view the economy ablaze with the fires of consumption we must perform our systemic patterns of survival for momentary rewards  our bodies have become their machines until we are left in sterilised wards no room for defects you must fit the mould or you are cast aside  what is the purpose of being alive when profits grow but our share is the same pushed to give our time for what seems like a handful of grain its unforgiving unrelenting inside this imprisonment we ignore the outside worlds thinking we are above the delicate ecosystem that delivered us we cannot out compete the sun no matter how hungry we get we are all destined to burn out  him her you and you no matter creed religion race we threw away our humanity for individuality immigration assimilation some believe our country should be a british born nation of likeminded caucasians look toward the businesses who criminally devour our resources so why do we bicker about people just like us who have a different pigmentation  our culture is twisted we have become divided look to the corporations who need to be reminded to value us for all that we do they feed and gorge off our labour so choose between the two the options before me are all i can see a life of uncertainty or wage slavery  in the hands of the extremely wealthy we slowly delve harvesting our data they will adapt with a wellplayed move the gap between class is chasm that may not improve into a world where none of us matter plastic oil trinkets manufactured served on a consumerist silver platter  a number we are packaged and designed grasping for opportunities before our class is outlined betrayed by our eyes hair and hands the clothes that we wear let them know what we are worth we need to talk all of us have got to listen learn to say i love you before the only smile we know is on the nextday deliveries that turn up to your door  every brother and sister simple pawns in their game to remove yourself will bring societal shame whatever they want us to do we must do the opposite collectively we have power vote with your wallets  can you feel it pressure is about you this never seems to change rent is climbing higher the weekly shopping list is looking rather dire that pain you are hiding from which there is no freedom until you retire you keep it to yourself because the smokescreen is easier to maintain wrapped around the cigarettes you light its just a short break from the train of thought that each and every step there is always something you have got to do the present seems like a luxury gifted to the few stress is what we know stress is where we go pressure applied wasted time standing in lines relying on our system consumed by whitecollar crimes  hidden movements flowing at the top paper has a price and panama was the plot money laundered tax evaded the loops to which they thread will always leave us jaded as long as their numbers are in the green we have to live in the red we are in this together i want to leave this place but where can we go  there are no alternatives so i ask why must i work so hard for so very little why am i punished for being born the way i am where my fall from grace is only respected when i am no more judgements cast upon me when my heart was still beating questions get you killed or they strip you of your credibility watch not what they say but why it is being said my words here will be misconstrued to avoid the truth that have left so many dead  turmoil is brewing politicians hold the ladle they stir the pot to feed themselves and leave us at the table they need us they hate us they force us to live like this what options are there when you are tied to loans and debts mistakes from your past when we didnt know any better the promises of a future our bones will break under the pressure mental health is in decline nhs is on the line is that another parking fine  rules structure bureaucracy the ideological prisons and rigid tram lines that keep us in our place all i need is food and water a roof and a progressive pace every single one of us is equal in the capacity to understand the struggles of each other take the time in this moment to think of how toxic it has become my hands are like yours and they offer a sympathetic touch my eyes hold an empathy for anyone finding it too much are you willing to stare back at yourself when you see this familiar pain im in the tears i feel are just like the ones that fall passed your chin those lips that sit above are staying fairly silent the truth is often said to hurt as we gaze upon its violence   right in this moment detached from our own woes someone  is fighting with survival drip drip droplets miss the rim they are left to sink or swim parasitic infections no strength to their limbs can you face it that not everyone has clean water overflowing rubbish in our bins and all we seem to care about is our precious little daughters young men are killing themselves one to many if you have lost someone here have a penny the homeless clutch their cups they beg because they dont house them we pass them like theyre nothing desensitised how do i arouse you to care more about each other its built within ourselves to turn our backs on the hungry and the blind we mimic the very creatures that push us to merely survive  consume possession collection things are all we are ever after knock knock a cardboard smile is at your door shareholders riches bloating some of us are barely floating will we make it to the next chapter where we can raise the living standard so the pavement is not someones bed where education guarantees a life where you get fed we are in this together let go of that ego that resides in your head  pacing between the roles we fit is a shared humanity we are not all that different invite humility   i sit sometimes lost in my own thoughts i feel lonely amongst it all have you ever felt like that   abrupt end change of pace swiftly moving on with haste like our lives it never seems to stop  money fuels corruption but our subscription is to blame the market forces power wealth and greed a grotesque relation to fame its all pretty tantalising for those who have access if we could have but a small taste would we fall victim to its poison look at history it has always been about us the people who haul the burden carry the foundations of those in the seat of power your decisions our decisions will incite change if we stand with one another sadly we are being used daily we sink our time into things we should refuse tax is inevitable necessary to be exact but surplus profits seems to avoid the cut so it is taken from our cheque spent on things beyond us in a global game of chess  life for most of us is a living debt to servitude to a system designed for those who steer it  how many of you who cannot understand me are willing to try and hear this  my voice but a murmur below the ivory tower hidden from our sadness they know who really holds the power  what do they have to hide from our unsightly struggles sickness and abuse do they think any of us want to lose  is it too much to want just enough to be without destitution and the intimidation of danger  i ponder where does the time go on the ticking clock think about every pot you have ever washed there are people who look down on us even when the cards dealt are not always fair who here does not have a safety net to catch them when you fall the pit below is endless and the climb upwards equally tall addiction is a drug healing whilst it hurts depression hangs across my shoulders like ill fitting shirts of which i wear to try and seem like i belong buttons come undone threads bare and free what happens now when i dont know who i want to be   who even said we must play with these cards i long for something simple i am now at the table nervous and feel like i dont belong outside this casino where i gamble with my life i once believed there was a world free from my inner strife the dice is in my hands do i roll and hope for 6 the lighting here is dimming and i cannot find the fix  i look ahead to see trials long and ever winding selfperceived horrors ever present that remind me of projections that chase me just before i sleep my imagination running with the wolves and i am the defenceless sheep through a corridor immeasurable filled with doors that never seemed to open a story with no middle and an ending abruptly boring a journey im ill prepared for a tragedy in the making i am reaching out for help someone please answer  i am scared  so very intimately scared  you think this is just an art piece but all of it is very real in the coming moment brings with it a silence of which i want to wield hanging somewhere from these words is my bare and naked thought on a life i no longer want to live a battle that continues being fought ignore me as the writer and align this to your will think towards our collective future and fight them until we have our freedom from their exploitation,lt4kff

45,"Serious question, why do you think a life without work is a good idea?",i am not posting this to call you morons this is serious i really want to know why  as someone who loves the joys of watching ones work become progress and reward i have always thought that work was the pinnacle of life but some dont and as much as i preach every human gets to have their own ideals because that is what makes the world go round i came across this philosophy and thought to myself a life without work is like a phone with no charger wouldnt last i grew to become curious so i wish to know why would a workless world be a good idea something progressive or even leisurely for that matter i understand if some of you find a post like this to be unfitting and irregular but it has been itching at me for awhile now and i really must know  tldr i want to know how a workless world would be a good idea as someone who prides himself on his work but with utmost curiosity sincerely  edit i made this post at 3am and i was already offended about something else entirely so i was not in a rational mindset the responses were very insightful and i am grateful that this was taken seriously but i wont be responding anymore not taking it down just to potentially see more view points but i really mean no harm bruh moment,ltlt35

47,Not reaching for Eden,ive been a member of this sub for years now sometimes i take a break because it just makes me so angry upset and depressed but only because i feel powerless to change anything   i think the crux of my anger is that we as a species are no closer to creating eden in fact with every passing generation we seem to be moving further away  my grandparents both working class had one person in the relationship do their 40pw came home to a house they could afford ate a reasonable meal and maybe went to the pub without a second thought as to money  sure now healthcare has developed we can get to other places easier i can complain about things from a screen in my hand to the world but life is demonstrably harder for a lot of people even just in the first world  we well maybe not we actively vote against progressive policies in the name of economic progress i cant ever imagine a system like public libraries being voted in nowadays in 2019 a major party ran on a campaign including free broadband for all here in the uk and it was ridiculed  if were not trying to reach eden what are we doing,ltkquk

73,What are the alternatives?,i just stumbled upon this community while trying to find job advice   it never occurred to me that antiwork was a logical concept   im unemployed since last summer due to covid and have been struggling to get back into the work force ever since but why what am i doing what are we all doing  i use to work in a corporate job office administration at first it wasnt terrible but as the years went by it started to take its toll on me   no matter what position i moved to it all started to feel the same this numb monotonous depressing feeling starring at a computer screen day in day out working for who for what i wasnt truly helping anyone other than filling the pockets of the higher ups it literally was all a money grab disguised as a legitimate business   before this corporate nonsense i was in the military i did a short gig there and decided it wasnt for me though i do miss it and romanticize it at times   the military was a different type of slavery but at least they had us so busy and the work was so unique that you didnt have time to think about anything you are taught to think and operate as a team operating in a very controlled rigid and structured environment no excuses there is an answer and solution to everything and you better know it it was in a sense dehumanizing you are no longer you but rather a machine classic stuff   ive been reading a lot of posts on here about younger people having this feeling of to put it bluntly wtf is going on what are we doing and why   i remember feeling that same exact wtf feeling when i was in my late teens and so to feel this at such a young age what does it mean what does this show us as a society a lack of true purpose  a lack of proper guidance a lack of caring who is responsible for guiding us listening to us  sorry im just venting stuck here behind another screen unemployed and paying rent why in the fuck dont potential employers tell us the specific reasons why we didnt get the job staffing capacity too many applicants if i ask and someone reads the email then that means you have the damn time to give me some pointers   this is just all so frustrating the days pass by and noone says anything no emails just silence and you keep wondering application after application its really maddening but i guess this is the game we play yea  anyways thanks for reading,lt45bs

75,"Ironically, antiwork is the most pro-worker subreddit out there",it just says a lot about how fucked up and massively biased against the worker the system is the only and true creator of wealth  the only way to change the world seems to be not to work to make it happen as logic would require but assume an antiwork mentality and realise that the only way out is to refuse to participate in consumerism that destroyed our planet while making a small elite minority obscenely rich,lstbzb
76,"Why Capitalism is not bad, but also really bad",the reason why many of us perceive capitalism as a bad thing is because of the way it can be exploited   i live in belgium and i will compare wages from belgium with the usa  minimum wage usa  725h  or 6h this equates to 1256 or 1040 monthly 40 hour work week  minimum wage belgium 108h or 9 this equates to 1962 or 1625 monthly 40 hour work week  both are before tax and when it is taxed we receive some benefit from them health care for example belgium is a capitalist country but here they dont exploit employees as much as in the usa  when i finished high school when i was just 18 i got my diploma in metal shaping techniques this includes cnc i got a job after 3 months as a cnc operator and i started with 14h or about 1750 monthly which equates to 2113 before tax  us minimum wage workers get much more exploited than some of the other first world countries this also includes vacation rights paid leave  the fact that the usa has a minimum wage of 725 has more to do with the ownerscompaniescorporations than it has with capitalism ofcourse capitalism is more than just about paychecks money and workers rights capitalism exploits nature and animals in their natural habitat corporations dont care about climateclimate change and this is what makes it really bad  thoughts,lt3sls

84,A Retail Nightmare,this will be a long one so brace yourselves  this is the first time i have posted on reddit and i am doing it because this a very important topic for me let me start out by saying that i work for one of the worlds largest kitchenware companies i chose this job mostly because it was one the highest paying local jobs i could find outside of highschool i knew before i chose it that i had only three options out of highschool which was the military college or manual labor and of course calculating the risks i chose to do more laborious work my mind was set on having no college debt and not feeding the military industrial complex which even at a younger age i knew a fair bit about well here i am now 21 years old and drowning in more anxiety and depression this being one of the worst lows i have felt in a long time and its all due to this corperation i worked a job before here it was a small parts warehouse for a giant boomlift manufacturer it was a terrible warehouse and luckily i was only there for nine or so months i was hired as a temp and got terminated whenever i questioned my boss about being told do his job as a temp this was my first realisation of how unfair workplace treatment was i was being used and being severely underpaid to do many tasks that was supposed to be done by supervision this caused many discussions with my father who is a union worker he was the one to introduce me to cruelty of the workforce he recommended finding a union job as well and so i did the corperation i work for now has a fully established union but it is blatantly corrupt not only my union but this corperation to set the tone here my union president is the father of the corperate supervisor that watches over me which is a blatant example of conflict of interest i have done a better job representing myself than my union has done for me and i believe its because our union and company are working together after months of failed negotiations the company and union had finally reached an agreement the problem i have now is that we were not given enough time to read it and decide on a vote our union not only did not show us a printed copy as an exampe to read but failed to tell us the worst parts of it the union president and his circle had forced in a non strike agreement which is the only weapon we have against my corperations current abuse we have been working exploitive overtime six to seven days a week at ten hours a day for over a year the company is continuing to over order and schedule shipments while we are stuck suffering we are so far behind that truck drivers are refusing to pick up product here because they are sometimes waiting over night to be loaded which has created little to no space in the warehouse making product harder to get to and hindering production as all completed shipments have to be staged everyday we get further behind we have lost most of our staff and the management show no urgency to fix the situation they keep threatening more overtime which in return is causing more people to leave and it makes it more stressful for those who stay they have attempted to hire more but it is failing last group they hired 30 people but only two stayed for a few days and quit especially as new hires have to work 90 days in a row at 10 hours before given union protection and vacation the pathetic thing is they pay union dues at the hire date which is illegal however the union is working with the company several high level management personnel are related to our union president they have put in a policy that union employees give up their right to representation until probation is over which is a loophole because you agree upon it from hiring date by the way vacation is only three days for the first year people are literally being asked to work everyday 10 hours with no days off it is no wonder everyone is quitting the job was okay but since covid our company is taking advantage of the pandemic for disgusting profits we werent even entitled to hazard pay despite being essential we have had 50 infections in a 400 man workplace so far they still do not enforce safety rules and everytime they are reported they do the bare minimum to make it look like they are doing something equiptment isnt cleaned people arent wearing masks and they are forcing us to work close together as we are running out of space within the year we have lost over 100 employees and over 5 this week alone our contract says we are supposed to be at 400 union employees at all time but we are falling below 300 i truly believe our president of the union is working with the company to get rid of the union and is doing the bare minimum as an illusion to show he cares and these problems just scratch the surface i cant take it here anymore it has made me utterly depressed i am trying to survive till june  i dont know if i will make it this new world is just so broken and people like us are suffering,lstybr

89,School trains us to be corrupt slaves.,in school we are rewarded for hard work school is long hours then we have homework overall it is worse than a 95 job by the time university comes you must study nearly 12 hours a day to get a decent mark and complete your assignments this trains us to do as we are told or else we suffer the consequences of failure which usually is to redo a class no where in school are we taught to explore our passions or to explore ourselves we are told that exercise is good but that doesnt even count towards any credits in university you have 1 chance if you pick the wrong subject and realize you dont enjoy it too bad switching costs money and now you are an adult trying to do anything leads to pain but being a slave and just doing what youre told leads to money we are studying subjects we dont like which primes us to accept the jobs we wont like trying to escape in anyway to find what you truly like is painful  because we already dont enjoy what we are doing the next best thing is to optimize what we like and we all like money gamblers get a high every time they win much like this we get a high when we get paid  when you cheat in school and not get caught you are pleasantly rewarded with a good grade there is no reward for hard work but failing to understand there is little reward for understanding but getting a question wrong at university level mostly right is near 0 mark for that question multiple choice is just right or wrong you get rewarded for getting the correct answer whether through understanding or a cheating technique students are being taught purely not to get caught which is corruption true understanding of the subject is near pure torture students are learning more creative ways to cheat better analysis of which person around you if any has same answer order as you or perhaps working together with a group of cheaters sitting in a bubble utilizing hand signals sometimes as simple as paying someone that looks like you to do the test  we want ethics but fail to make it more rewarding than corruption at the school level just like the general world we are in corruption is deep and its within us all it starts as early as school we need to find ways to eradicate corruption from ourselves and our society im sure you know of cheaters getting higher marks than you just seeing such practices can corrupt our hearts even if it is a little bit to fight it we must identify corruption in the system within ourselves within others and educate each other,ltb1v8

91,Too many people,so this is just my opinion on how our system came to be the way it is now  i believe one of the major contributing factors of our current system of under paid over worked employees is the simple fact there are too many people with a large enough pool of potential employees who are desperate to find work to make ends meet large companies can under pay employees because they know someone will be willing to work that shitty job at that shitty pay there is no incentive for companies to pay more when they can easily find someone to do the job  the population has increased without a similar increase in available jobs thus leading to an increase of potential employees so they have been able to increase the required education and skill level needed for so called every level jobs making it harder for people to get that job without increasing the amount of debt they owe in order to hopefully obtain stable income and comfortable living  our grandparents had it easier and better due to the fact there was less competition in the job market   i believe if there was a drastic enough decrease in potential employees working conditions and quality of life would drastically improve  edit typo  edit2 im sorry if this post comes off as i mean there needs to be a reduced population im actually advocating for less of us needing to work in general so those who chose to work can improve working conditions,ltlajo
92,Nothing Matters More Than Busines,an angry dog attacked my car in the middle of the night and ripped a chunk of it off and ive spent the entire night freaking out thinking about how im gonna pay for the damages messaged my boss about it and she said she cant come in today due to previous obligations and wants to pay the uber fee for me to come in i live half an hour away  i havent even responded yet because its so absurd to me im literally hysterical and you still want me to come in i work in retail i have to pretend i care about the customers which is hard enough on a normal day but you want me to do that after ive been crying all night and the best part is that she was actually supposed to work with me today but decided she wouldnt come so i was supposed to handle everything alone for 10 hours on a day she knows is going to be busy and now i have to do it while fighting against a mental breakdown im so over it,lsxj16

96,I miss weekends... No one tells you you're going to lose them when you enter the workforce and I hate it.,god one thing thats been eating away at me since i graduated college two years ago is how i dont get weekends anymore i thought by busting my ass in school i could get a a nice cushy office job id get to put in my 9 to 5 and go enjoy the rest of my life in reality work hours are for handeling the emergencies and your time off is just for catching up on the long term projects and whatever chores you can manage to squeeze in between it the closest thing ive had to a long weekend was when i had to use my paid leave to get a cyst removed at least in college i had some peace and quiet to study without being interrupted for 5 hours and then could go out with friends instead of being constantly bombarded with fucking teams messages either about work or mandatory social events  i havent been on a vacation hell i havent left my state in two years and if i ever have the audacity to complain im just an entitled millennial with no work ethic i actually work in my dream industry i like my coworkers and i like what i do but christ i dont want work to be my entire life this cant be all there is,lto7sh

100,Work related rant,hey all so im kinda fuming i was scheduled to work an 11 and a half hour shift today which isnt too abnormal except today wasnt given a break until i got in a argument with a coworker and mentioned how it was against federal us law for this to happen which would have been avoided if they had just let me go home early i had asked for a break several hours before i was scheduled to get off however i was not allowed anything but a 5 min sit which btw is not the required time for working 8 hours so considering i didnt get my break i asked to go home 30 min early which was again denied so i was starting to get exhausted emotional and reactive one of my coworkers said something close to if you had been more caught upfaster then you would have been able to get a break which is just not true and irrelevant federal law which trumps my states law says that a 30 min break must be provided if an employee has worked 8 or more hours and another 15 min for every 4 hours past that edit i looked in to it more and i was wrong about the federal laws unfortunately however caseys does have a policy regarding employee breaks that definitely was not followed by my managers so i stated that it was illegal for me to not receive a break and someone should have covered for that time which would have been doable there were others who could cover my break this apparently startled my management as i soon had a chat with my store manager and a 2nd assistant they basically said that kansas my state has no such laws and i should have communicated my needs better i asked several times and made it clear how i had not been allowed my break and that these days happen bull shit it is immoral and illegal to force someone to work 11 and a half hours with no break there is no it happens i ended up spending the last 30 min of my shift writing this post probably only because they were scared hr or a lawyer might get involved if only i had the money to hire a lawyer tldr corporate america is cancer fuck this shit i want to be an artist,ltyy90

120,Is this just an American thing? A rant!,ok let me start off by saying im an immigrant working in the states amp that i have sadly worked 20 years in retail amp only 3 years have been here in the states my current job is the worst job i have ever worked in retail everyone who works here feels it is absolutely shitty especially this last year i have never worked for a company so money hungry so void of empathy amp compassion not just for the employees but for the shoppers too during a pandemic i have personally had 4 anxietypanic attacks at work 2 by my now ex boss amp then by her boss who apologized for causing the attack and then followed it with but its just how i am which negates the fucking apology the rest by guests who frequent this establishment i have literally had things physically thrown at me by bosses in other jobs amp been denied higher positions because of the color of my skin amp still id rather work there than spend another day dealing with this shit maybe im just done working in retail this is not my path in life it brings me no joy it brings me no fulfillment i just find it weird that people here push the notion that a job like this is honorable amp good when all i have seen is how fucking disgusting people are to retail employees you have no right to treat anyone behind a counter like shit ever the customer is always right is an antiquated term that should not be used anymore because 910 times they are wrong nobody dreams of working as an assistant manager of a retail store all their lives nobody only people who dream of owning their own businesses have those kinds of dreams look this turned more into a rant but i think we gotta stop putting certain jobs on pedestals amp instead treat them as they are stepping stones for people to focus on the things they want to do with their lives,lrqa1c

124,It's Quarterly Performance Review Day...,these loathsome conversations with managers about what went well and challenges i faced this quarter and what im going to do to be an even better employee  are such an incredible hassle  ampx200b  cant wait to be told that despite being in a historic pandemic we still have to meet our ridiculous targets and that failure to do so reflects badly on each of us individually despite the fact that this organization does everything in its power to make our jobs as difficult as possible  and instead of hiring more people to replace those that left we just have to pick up the slack by doing more work but even bringing that up is pointless as everyone is too powerless within the structure to affect any meaningful change  ampx200b  im going to smile read my script and get it over with while throwing out two or three stupid action items that will never be completed or followed up on just venting but im sure there are people who can relate to this silly dance routine were forced to perform every three months,lrhsl6

126,Is it wrong to do as little work as possible?,obviously i have not made it until retirement to the point of not having to work i really hate my job i do assigned duties with initiative and my tasks are done efficiently with quality nevertheless i fucking hate work and will avoid any new tasks that are not in my description as much as possible people say dont you want to be promoted you have to prove yourself take on additional work to so you have more experience and can take it to another job  if i am doing my job satisfactorily and customers are happy why not give me a raise then i do work for the government and it sometimes seems that once you do your job well and are reliable  your supervisor will not let you go meaning your current sup will bad mouth you to keep in you in the dept  while i see some validity of the last point being able to acquire new skills to take to another job with higher pay but not the others anytime i have taken on additional duties not in my job description it ends up permanently becoming my job then people dump all types of shit on me yes i am an administrative assistant but just because i am a jack of all trades does not mean i want to do higher level work without an increase in pay i really want to find a job where i can mostly work alone like a skill trade of course i would still be working but i wont be in the office around the political bull shit  my coworkers look at me funny because i leave at my assigned time every day and i decline ot although not mandatory the previous person in my position took it on because she really needed the money  why do people try to shame a person for my mentality i already know i am not getting out of work until retirement so why should i take on additional duties that are not in my description and a paint in the ass,lre9ov
127,Last week I worked 3/5 work days due to a snowstorm and I had never felt so good in YEARS!,i have been working mf for lord knows how many years now the whole never ending 95 cycle i had adequate time for hobbies exercise care and maintenance of my home etc but i was also very rushed  last week we had a really bad snowstorm and i only worked tuesday wednesday and friday   i cannot even begin to tell you guys how much better everything was i got caught up on so many things but not even just that mentally and physically i was in another league i felt much younger and i had so much energy i was happy and in a great mood all of this while i was stuck inside but i was able to accomplish so much for myself i could only imagine what i could have accomplished if i was able to leave my home and do other things for me  it got me thinking that this whole 95 mf cycle is literally vicious and is just a modern version of slavery after last week my eyes were really opened to how we are all part of this horrible facade and every single one of us is being taken advantage of   and for what for me to make somebody more money by selling their product what will they do with this money use it to buy other stuff that feeds more and more into this cycle  so much of our lives is all just made up and we would all be 100 fine and live our lives happily without this crazy cycle of work that we are all forced to participate in   who else thinks that 3 days work and 4 days to yourself is a good idea,lrxd1z

137,"I don't know where else to talk about this, I feel so isolated right now...",i gave my current workplace my letter of resignation and 3 weeks notice this was meant to be my last week tomorrow was meant to be my last day i had plans for it with friends at work  earlier today i was pulled into an office and told that i needed to leave the workplace immediately and not come back due to social media posts the posts reposting some of the images from this subreddit to my instagram stories   my workplace doesnt have a social media policy or anything like that they dont even have a resignation policy i didnt mention anything about my current workplace not their name or anything didnt mention any workplace literally just reposted some comics and tweets with no additional text   i wasnt even given time to think wasnt told i had to leave by the end of the day i was told i needed to leave straight away i was told it would be preferred not to take my personal belongings as it would cause suspicion just to take my bag and leave i went to the bathroom to gather my thoughts for a moment but i was followed in there  how ironic i was told i was a valuable employee today i dont think you treat valuable employees like that i feel so sad and empty so discarded not once did anyone ask me for my feedback on why i was leaving or anything even today no one asked why i posted those things to my stories and if it was about work   literally what the hell   update i saw my friends later that day when they came to drop off my stuff right after i was escorted out it was announced in the office that i wouldnt be coming back into work so much for not wanting to make a scene they singled out my friends took them into a room and questioned them about me i feel so disgusted i cant believe they did that to my friends they had nothing to do with this i feel so guilty that theyll be targeted now  i still dont know how to process what happened yesterday i feel awful,lryd5o

139,I remember when I nearly got fired for mishearing something on a phone call because the entire office was singing Happy Birthday.,man not long since found this sub and i love it the stories of cesspit employers are interesting so i thought id chime in with one of the worst places ive worked at warning its fairly long  several years back i worked collections in a loan company the fraud team at the time was literally just 1 guy it was a startup that got too big for its boots really fast so this guy literally just couldnt take holiday course theyd never have said that to him but it was implied we were mates so i said if he trained me id cover for him for 5 days   on the day he was meant to train me the day before his holiday his manager made him join in a forced lunch  one of those cliquey cultlike meetings where they all ate in their shitty little work canteen and did nothing he ended up having 45 minutes to show me the ropes  because of this amp trying to catch up on the afternoons work  approving loan applications meaning they were all building up in a backlog  he had to rush a bit he ended up paying out 2 fraudulent loans that day and they told him not to bother coming back from holiday they then forced me to take the job as the only qualified person to do it in the building thanks to my extensive training   for 2 years i sweat bullets i never made a single mistake in 10000 applications because doing so meant the chopping block during this time they offered a job to a 5year employee who was great at his job in collections he made a mistake in his first week and got tossed out  of the company not just the team   anyway onto the title of the post one day as the company just loved fucking making noise there was the usual weekly occurrence of the entire office signing happy birthday loudly to a colleague who sat nearby who cares if im on an important call to the bank  cifas cause fuck me right   i misheard a viral piece of information paid out a fraudulent loan into a brand new bank account set up by a fraudster 10000 flawless applications but fuck me right pulled into a meeting within the hour   manager  who was the antichrist  kept asking me why i did it i said it was a mistake   is it because you dont care about your job  no it was genuinely a mistake but would you say you didnt care about your job it sounds like you want me to say i dont care i dont want you to say anything i just want to know if you care   im paraphrasing but this was the really weird exchange it was an odd place they were all super obsessed with the job most of them were fucking most senior managers who eventually moved on always came back because they couldnt hack it elsewhere when they saw what an actual job is like   anyway fortunately i have had a hearing impairment since i was younger its not severe and doesnt impact my life i turned around and basically said that everybody was fucking singing happy birthday in my one decent ear and my disability made it impossible to hear properly   her tune changed immediately and i was let off after that i fucking bolted within the month  into another job that eventually fired me because the job it turned out didnt exist and i wasnt needed   fuck work am i right,lsf5eb

153,A reminder that self employment is not the solution anti-workers are looking for,i often get the feeling that people who want to understand our movement want to counter by saying that we should just all be selfemployed while selfemployment would fix a lot of the problems many people have with traditional work it wouldnt solve the main problem which is the idea that you are a slave to the market the idea that your worth is directly tied to your productivity is a terrible idea and antiworkers want to get rid of that  in her episode burning yourself out the closest feeling to death that isnt deathhttpsyoutubemtyuvhsvpy jaiden animation who is selfemployed talks about her typical day of her work she talks about how every time she isnt working she feels like she should be even though shes doing something like eating pooping or even working because if shes working she could be working harder this video perfectly illustrates how self employment isnt the solution to antiwork peoples problems and in fact its possible to work even harder and longer in selfemployment than in traditional work because theres no one telling you to stop working getting rid of the markets desire to always turn a profit and the constant need to make money in order to survive is whats going to help us not self employment if you are selfemployed thats great there are plenty of reasons to be selfemployed but to escape antiwork problems is not one of them,lru530

159,Consent v. Control,reading through peoples experiences for me has brought up the question of what things we consent to whether that consent is genuine and what that means for our society   under us law the basis for american employment is contract  in order to create a contract you must have a manifestation of agreement by all sides and a meeting of the mindsie consent from both parties to the same thing or the same general thing  therefore the legal basis of employment is at odds fundamentally with the theory espoused by some marxists and often reflected in sentiments here that employment can be analogized to slavery  to be clear at the outset i dont agree with this sentiment and from a historical perspective find the argument offensive  but i think examining the distinction can reveal areas where modern society at best manufactures consent from its members  the legal distinction between undesirable work and slavery is easy to makean individual employed for minimum wage is not a slave because they cannot be compelled to work by force or to put it another way they can always technically chose to quit any job at any time  there is no threat of violence or as a general matter governmental authority compelling work by force  there are of course a raft of other distinctions between a modern employee and a slave most succinctly invoked by the concepts of life liberty and propertybut which are really a whole list of things which if examined closely set out in stark detail why a job you detest is not analogous to the total loss of rights and freedoms that were experienced legally by individuals in the past and illegally today  that said there are situations in which contracts may be voidable or unenforceable because we do not believe consent can be adequately given  and the line between those concepts and the circumstances which undergird everyday employment for a huge segment of americans is at least in terms of intellectual underpinnings unclear  there is a concept called unconscionability which is the idea that where a contract is extremely unfavorable to one side both in its terms and in the circumstances in which it is negotiated it cannot be enforced  the central question as to circumstances is what is relevant here  because what bargaining power can an unemployed individual be said to have when they are dependent upon future employment for shelter food and healthcare  where on the other side sits either a far wealthier person or an entity whose needs are nonexistent save the unyielding course for profit were there any fair way to negotiate between the two we would have no need of a minimum wage  yet without this law the average persons salary would never increase it seems  which is to say that if we are concerned with the circumstances under which a contract is negotiated we cannot give our blessing to the vast majority of contracts an employee signs  this is not to say that employees possess no leverage but it is to say that the bargaining power employees possess is largely not enough to ensure terms we as a society would deem equitable  this suggests that consent to employment may be analogous to the concept of social compact theory  social compact theory holds that a government governs by the consent of those it governs  ie governments are or should be created and developed through the consent of their citizens  this concept while influential in crafting democratic policies is obviously aspirational  no child any more than they choose to be born chooses the rules their parents place on them and so too no man woman or other the mesh of laws that they must abide by or sacrifice what rights had been set aside for them  society may value particular freedoms but it cannot value choice  because where an individual has the choice to leave a society there can be no authority and no rule  therefore every society creates fictions like thesewhich imitate consent and curtsy to our desiresall while keeping us firmly within the track we are told to keep upon  this is all to say that our consent is a formality and a ritual so long as our choices are prescribed  free is an exaggeration,lsh3b1

As if things aren‚Äôt stressful enough we are now engineering stress??",im so sick of this kind of shit like i just want to clock in do my work and be left alone theres another manager in our division that im cool with when in the office we would talk about shared interests since working from home idk what his problem is but he has stirred up drama through miscommunications twice   yesterday he ims me to small chat then asks how things are going i say fine and make some jokes about us being behind on some processes but that this other coworker who he manages is working on it and we have other stuff to do until then well oh boy he takes that and runs for some reason comes down on my other coworker asking why our stuff isnt done he manages this coworker for stuff on his team but technically doesnt manage him over the stuff he does for our team and then asks my manager why im asking him about stuff going on on our team   i immediately get a call from my manager because now coworker is pissed since theyre extremely busy and she thinks ive gone to another manager about issues i was so hacked off but i calmly explained and she pretty quickly realized what happened and left me alone even though its petty i copy and pasted the entire chat transcript into a document and sent it to her and im going to start keeping all records if this is going to keep happening its ridiculous   then on the phone she decides to tell me that she wants me to do all of my work out of a shared network drive instead of my personal network drive she doesnt even want me keeping two copies and updating the one on the shared drive because she says this adds extra work im doing what i want on this i dont care im not having all work lost by having it only in one place she says its so that if we are out sick people can jump in and view our stuff to work on it what it really comes down to is micromanaging and i have a feeling she has been micromanaged into a micromanager from the person above her the other pot stirring manager may even be going through the same so ill give them the benefit of the doubt while carefully interacting with them going forward   theyve been acting weird the last few months wanting to be able to view everything and have us check off as we work then asking why do we have back logs on our work all we are doing is working off of data in pdf and excel reports do its not like they can see things change in real time its honestly one of my biggest pet peeves i cant stand managers hiring me because im supposedly competent enough to do a job but then treating me like a child that has to be parented morale has dropped so much over the way things have changed since july 2019 when leadership switched over i used to love this job but lately all i want to do is leave and go somewhere else but i cant right now due to the economy,lsa232

261,Wanting a discussion on why you should be paid the full value of your labour when you did not take the risk of creating the possibility of your labour.,i know i will get downvoted my goal is an honest discussion out of curiosity  according to the current economic system  correct me if i am wrong i am not too well informed but i am trying to learn in order to create jobs and wealth you need to provide value to those around you you need to take a risk to create the means of producing that value and you are rewarded with the profits you acquire generally the higher the risk the higher the reward but this can vary from industry to industry barriers to entry volume etc  now i have seen some people in this subreddit suggest profits is essentially stealing if this is not you i am not directing this post towards you just does that do but if we do not give profits as an incentive for this transaction to take place then why would it occur even your local farmer from the babylonian era wanted to make a profit on his goods or else why create them what he paid for the seed to grow a crop is not what he sells the fruits from that crop for why is this any different,lpyxo1

273,Have any of you guys seen the anime Golden Boy? After lurking this sub It made me think about this show,this 90s anime is a goofy and extremely perverted comedy but it has a message that i think relates in one way or another to this sub    kintaro main character is a freeter and has done various jobs as he quests around japan in pursuit of knowledge his ventures include computer programming housekeeping teaching the culinary arts and most of all studying kintaro is also often seen demonstrating the skills hes learned in previous chapters to overcome challenges faced in the current one   so the show goes to explain every episode that he is what is called a freeter and i always found that interesting apparently young people were living this life style in japan for one or more reasons ill go back to this  a freeter is a japanese expression for people who lack fulltime employment or are unemployed   in golden boy the main character jumps from job to job not being tied down to one thing and taking the experience he learned over to the next job jobs including computer programming housekeeping teaching the culinary arts they also mention that the main character went to law school and is very intelligent but intentionally dropped out right before getting his last credits to get a degree to live this life style of being a freeter  so in real life japan people chose this life style for multiple reasons including      to enjoy life and deliberately chooses not to join the rat race of the japanese work environment  having specific dreams incompatible with a standard japanese career   not finding a decent job before high school or university graduation in the system called simultaneous recruiting of new graduates which is unique to japanese society those left behind are forced to take low paying irregular jobs this usually has to do with their dropout status from previous educational institutes those who dropped out of high school have the worst prospects  so i naturally drew parallels to this sub people not wanting to get caught up in this lifestyle of soul sucking corporate lifestyle but to live life to the fullest the main character realized that hed be happier going to job to job meeting and helping new people instead of finishing his law degree and living a mundane monotonous life behind a desk  ive always wondered if anyone actually took inspiration from this show and traveled and lived the freeter lifestyle even for a little and how it effected their life positive or negative it always made me think about life even if the show is not that deep on the surface and is just a silly comedy,lr3p9m

298,"Thoughts on ""Dirty and Dangerous"" jobs in an anti-work society.",i think one of the main reservations a lot of people have with an antiwork society is the removal of incentive for dirty and dangerous jobs like dealing with sewage building infrastructure etc  to this point if we think logically we can actually imagine a much better scheme even if some form of dirty or dangerous labor is still necessary  1 many dirty and dangerous jobs are only necessary because of capitalism  sweatshops are only necessary because of a consumer culture predicated on consumption meant to ease the stress of work life for example and wouldnt need to be done under a more civilized social order  when thinking of the necessity of dirty and dangerous jobs we must remember that many jobs we think of as dangerous are not actually necessary  2 capitalism adds to the dangers of jobs by cutting corners on protective equipment healthcare and will abandon workers who are broken by their jobs  3 capitalism necessitates the expansion of dangerous jobs such as updating infrastructure by diverting resources away from what is good for society in the long term for example roads that last 50 years vs roads they can service yearly   so we can logically assume that a more sophisticated social order can exist where we accept the destruction of useless dirty and dangerous jobs and the non work of people in these jobs  by ensuring everyone a livelihood and care regardless of work ability dangerous jobs that are still necessary are made less dangerous since a society with the goal of improving human life would definitely provide as much protection to these types of workers as possible  healthcare for these workers would not be something left solely up to their responsibility and people would be cared for even in the horrible scenario that they are crippled while doing dangerous jobs for society  furthermore if society adopts a long term sustainable approach to design and infrastructure there will be less and less of a need for dirty dangerous and necessary jobs  moreover actual dirty and dangerous jobs that are still necessary would no longer be alienated from their work and would see the fruits of their labor in the direct benefit to a society that actually values them  a society with different values might find people tripping over themselves to assist those doing dangerous jobs by taking care of their families and residences when their work is necessary,lqf0f0

319,The positive psychological changes I experienced after working for myself,in an attempt to maybe one day escape the 95 grind i started working on a project that ive always had in mind but never put to action opening an ecommerce shop that imports and sells things from my country  to my surprise the sales have exceeded my expectations people who came from the same country as me have been buying things from me like crazy and locals are interested in the unique things i sell as well i made about 500 in profit in my first week and a consistent 6001000 every week since but thats not the main point because this business made my life so much better in other ways besides money   here im going to share the positive psychological changes i experienced after starting my side business  1i found out that im not as lazy as i had imagined  though im always seen as a pretty solid employee the truth is that there has never been a job where i felt motivated to do my best i maintain a slightly above average performance to keep my job but i also fuck around on reddit and facebook whenever i can and is just better at hiding the corners i cut i try to never arrive a minute early or leave a minute late and absolutely hate it when anyone from work sends me a work related message when im not at workfor many years i thought of myself as a lazy person who lacks drive and the determination to succeed   however with this business im always thinking about ways to grow it i make sure to maintain a high quality standard for everything i sell and when a buyer sends me a message to ask about a product at 1am saturday night im answering that mofo with great joy though it may just be due to the honeymoon stage this has never happened in any job i hadits like ive turned into a different person as soon as i started working for myself   2my self confidence is improving  i think this has to do with the fact thatin a job youre inherently inferior to your manager and superiorsespecially if youre young however if you own 100 of a small business youre the king of it you can do whatever the hell you want with it as long as it works and its legal you dont report to anyone and have the power to choose who you want to do business with on your own terms even though i do need to satisfy customers the power dynamic is much more balanced compared with that of a boss and an employee  ampx200b  3less stressed about money and my job  though a couple of thousand dollars a month isnt enough to make me rich it allows me to spend money on wants without compromising my long term financial plans in addition the diversified sources of income relieves the stress of losing all income like i did last year when i got laid off from my last job  my job is okay now but if it starts to suck and i decide to quit i can always do so and rely on this income this option gives me more negotiating power on work related issues and reduces the feeling of powerlessness      4boosted creativity  since i started this business im always thinking about how i can make it stand out against competition this resulted in me coming up with creative solutions to unique problems and the learning skills such as graphic design which i wouldnt have learned in jobs within my field      5a sense of purpose  theres something special about working on something every day and seeing salesinstagram followersnumber of loyal customers grow little by little whatever i do for this business accumulates over time if i keep working on it and whatever content i create will forever be minethis aspect seems to be lacking in most jobs where you sit in your desk doing the exact same thing every day the only thing that accumulates is years of experience but whatever is produced still belongs to the company and could be taken away at any time leaving people with nothing to show for their years of hard work other than a new column of experience on the resume   at first i started this business only to earn a few extra bucks however it has improved my quality of life in so many other surprising ways if there is a project you have in the back of your mind that you havent taken action towards i would encourage you to do the same if it turns out to be a success and you need to hire employees always remember to be the type of boss that you dreamed of working for,lph15a

322,A Suggestion,so ive stumbled across this group and although i agree with most of these arguments i think you guys really need to evaluate the actual meaning of the word work see work as defined by oxford dictionary is activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to achieve a purpose or result in other words it simply means doing something either physical or mental to reach a desired result and once you grasp this definiton youll realize that just about everything we do involves work for example writing takes work cooking takes work cleaning takes work exerciseplaying a sport takes work making musicsinging takes work and if you want to apply it to the basic necessities of life growingproducing food takes work buiding shelters and buildings takes work to produce clothing takes work traveling takes work generating electricty takes work etc etc etc even animals in nature work to obtain their necessities for instance a bear isnt just given all the food it needs for its entire lifetime it has to travel or hunt to find their next meal hell even plantstrees have to work by science in order to grow and a lot of you advocate being self employedrunning a buisness but fail to realize that youll still be working point being it is absolutely unnatural and impossible to thrive or survive without doing any sort of physical or mental activity no human being even in agarianancient times survived by doing nothing nor any species for that matter therefore your aversion should not be directed at the idea of work but more so at job or employment as these are more specific and are what youre referring to anyway while i am against employment as a form of working to claim that human beings shouldnt do any work at all is absolutely absurd we need to differentiate between work and job as they are two separate terms so i suggest renaming this group to antijobs to avoid such confusion any thoughts,lqugg9

360,"Burnt out at work, exhausted but financially trapped to stay",throwaway account for semiobvious reasons  just needed somewhere to get this obvious reasons  just feel like i want to quit my job as a doctor its maddening and frustrating when you go to work at 6am on weekdays and work continuously until 730pm  any sort of lunch break you have is taken up by meeting and tutorials half of which you dont attend because you are busy with patients in the ward  which gets you into serious trouble with your department on weekdays you will work from 6am until 2pm  the overnights are bad  when you work shifts from 6am till 2pm the next day without a fucking break or more than 1 hour of sleep  and get called the next day by another team to be told they think youve been over cautious and done too much for a supposedly straight forward case amazingly you must declare when clocking in your workplace hours that you work from 8am to 5pm on weekdays and 8am to 12noon next day for night shift days so you dont get called up and accused by your department of violating working hours  thus you do not get paid for any over time work however you will get screwed if you go into work the same time as your boss 8am and have not prepared adequately for ward rounds and you will be screwed if you havent finished your work and left at 5pm or 12 noon on the dot  the days are bad  when families and patients complain continuously about not being updated often enough or early enough in the day it is frustrating when you are tired burnt out but need to be constantly on and paying attention to every little detail in a patients charts  in a history you need to be on when you communicate with your patients and their families you need to be on when you sit in a meeting less you get shamed for lack of participation  you find yourself denied leave or having been missed out in an email for leave requests and being told you are not allowed to have a break although its been 6 months since your last day of leave  you are told by your department your patients and their families your superiors that you are never enough you are never caring enough never meticulous enough never concise enough never detailed enough never clever enough never as skilled as enough never as hardworking enough never enough  its not that we work for appreciation or we even need the acknowledgement  just a fucking break from the hate and constant criticism over small things would be nice  am trying so fucking hard and giving every ounce of my being to my patients to my work  and it is fucking enough on my end to be told that i need to be doing more am sick of the passive aggressive conversations from nursesseniorspatients oh sorry to be disturbing you now  i know you are probably on a lunch break  no i am not because i have not been on a lunch break in months  if you would like to know i once wet myself in the ward because i was so busy i could not even fucking pee  i do my best to be polite and respect to those around me but am reaching a point where id like to shoot myself in the head after all the shit that happens  am tired of my own family implying i dont come home early enough dont reply texts early enough am not mentally present enough when im home  every single minute of every fucking day  people are bitching about something or another and in all honesty  i would say this is the main job of a doctor to be bitched to and make sense of things and coordinate things while enduring a barrage of bitching from everyone  would change speciality but have heard from other juniors elsewhere they are similar drowning and flailing  would quit but am financially bound to this for life  all for a job i once upon a time loved before it chewed me up and spat me out,lqhsun

366,I‚Äôm new(ish) to the working world and it‚Äôs so nice to see people echoing my feelings! So happy I found this group,im new to reddit amp im so happy i have found this thread im a 23f i joined the work force in 2019 after being hired at a cooperate firm   i had worked since i was 15 but as i was in school it was always parttime amp this meant i never fully grasped the realities of working full time it took me around 5 months of full time work to know that i hated it   none of it made sense to me i instantly felt like they wanted me to work at a capacity that wasnt just or fair then i realised this wasnt a unique problem and was pretty standard  a few things  that shocked me included but not limited to    the work hours   i wasnt paid for my break   only 21 days of holiday  it felt and still does feel like a huge scam   i remember i got sick once during my probation i had tonsillitis and literally couldnt talk eat or swallow i lost 120 in pay those 2 days i was off because i was on probation and apparently hadnt earned the right to be sick yet wtf i was still sick when i came back but literally couldnt afford to lose more money  in addition i feel that in order for me to succeed in my job i have to put in overtime constantly im never ontop of my tasks because frankly im not willing to work over the weekend nor am i willing to work till 8pm most nights nor work at an inhuman like pace during my work day some days are productive some arent im not a machine this is created issues around my anxiety levels amp stress i dont like to feel like im not doing my job well or be behind especially when im surrounded by people burning the midnight oil regularly and going the extra mile i constantly feel like im lacking but i dont like the path i have to take to reach success   also my corporate job pays but the pay is one of the only good thing i get out of this job i hate that we put money in front of joy fulfilment amp money is one of the biggest indicators of success that is very backwards to me yes money is an aid yes i would love to be rich but im am not willing to give up most of my waking life to have it im  more than willing to work hard when i work on something i enjoy or find it meaningful i think this is true for most people but why do so many meaningful jobs pay so low it all feels so unbalanced and exploitive  i hate participating in it but whats the alternative   arghhh thanks for giving me a space to rant,lpwmtt
367,Essential vs Non Essential,i think the pandemic forced a very interesting idea to the main stream the idea that some people work essential jobs but the vast majority work non essential jobs im sure most of us here knew this to some degree already   i think its even more interesting that many people who work non essential work are almost forcing the majority to believe that the non essential is actually essential when it is not people trying to find meaning in something where there clearly isnt any meaning like a physchopath trying to convince his victims that he loves them before he kills them  in case some of you dont know of this man david graeber please check him out he discusses a lot of the non essential vs essential and possibly where we might be headed,lqkedh

391,Your depression is Jusfified,i see this coming up over and over again  our society likes to believe everyone should be happy and depression is not a suitable response to any problem you will be told that you have a mental problem if you are depressed in life without any further investigation into it  listen if you spend 8 hours flipping burgers a day at wendys your life is not going to be satisfying it is going to be depressing but society will wrongly claim that the reason you are unhappy is because you suffer from depression that you should not be unhappy  im not picking on a wendys burger flipper as the vast majority of jobs out there are just as dismal  this depression is caused by the shitty life circumstance it is cause by the daily 8 hours of burger flipping torture the problem isnt the depression the problem is the life circumstance which is causing your depression ie work its the burger flipping job the office job the construction job fill in xyz job you have here since so many jobs are unfulfilling and will lead to deep an unescapable depression  our bodies and minds cannot be tricked so easy with the dumb solutions therapists may suggest when this torture and abuse goes on for years on end the body is smarter than that you feel bad because you are unhappy with a system that uses and abuses you,loopte

393,"As antiworkers, are all of you also anticapitalist? If not, what are your views regarding the problem of work and its solutions?",to me the link between capitalism and the plague of work as we know it the obligation to work for money under threat of starvation  alienated work ie work for a boss who decides what is to be done and how and who keeps the product amp the profit is clear  also even if i consider laziness leisure etc to be essential amp a very important right i consider activity to be not only the very condition of life but also the fundamental way through which one can achieve happiness  so i hope for  believe in a world in which work would be freed from the violent limits of capitalism and become mainly something good  but surely my interpretation is not universally favored what about you,lnujj5

399,Exploited for free labor at 16,this might get kinda long cuz the more i write the more i remember hahah scroll down for tldr  this happened over ten years ago but its only just struck me how fucked up this was   i was homeschooled at 16 and wanted some spending money so i started looking for a job i was a pretty edgy teen so i didnt want some boring mcdonalds job or somethingi wanted something cool and unique i picked up some weird jobs due to this attitude including making file trees filled with images stolen from the home depot website no idea why someone posted me to do that but they paid me so    i eventually stumbled onto something i thought would be perfect it was to work security part time at haunted attractions now i dont think its legal for a 16 year old to be a security guard in ca but i figured myself for something of a badass and applied anyway and they told me to come in for an interview   when i got there the place was absolutely packed there were no joke at easy 2030 people there eventually i get called in and theres these 3 guys sitting at a desk in the middle of a large dance room the kind with floor to ceiling mirrors along all the walls   they told me they knew i wanted to work security but they had everyone audition for the role of maze monster first anyway i thought that was weird but whatever they gave me a few different rolesyoure a clown in a straight jacket and youve for an itch on your nose is the one i remember most clearly they were all like that   it was tons of fun and they seemed like really cool guys they told me a little about the company said that its spent xx years doing this and that theyre opening a new location in home town and yadda yadda they told me the hours thurssun something like 6pm12am or whatever and the pay10hr for a high school student thats perfect   i get an email a few days later saying not only was i hired they were so impressed with my acting skills that theyre making me part of the elite teammuch cooler than the average maze monster id be working in front of the haunt to encourage people to come buy tickets and keeping people in line entertained i was unbelievably flattered because id never acted a day in my lifeand here were professionals who wanted me as part of their elite team    some time goes by and they announce when training will begin itll go on for about a month and a half before the scare season starts 3 times a week for 6 weeks were to meet up at the local sports park for 3 hours   wear exercise clothes   kind of weird but ok   the next six weeks are hellish theres about 20 of us all varying ages and health status they make us run laps to start push ups sit ups all sorts of other things a bunch of people quit on the first day they announce one day that were going to be making our characters for the hauntthe way they do this is line us up and tell us to get in character and theyll come up and ask questions if we hesitate they make us do push ups mind youid never created a character in my life let alone a fully developed horror character that i can also act out i did a lot of push ups they also berated us made fun of our characters all of your characters suck they all just have daddy issues come up with something unique unique these guys also had characters btw and one of them was literally just killer clown   i made some friends with the other employees one of whom was a man more than twice my age wed run the laps together joke around etc he eventually made a facebook group for the employees where we would bitch and complain about the bosses he in particular would imply that they were gay in pretty derogatory ways as a closeted gay guy i mostly didnt interact hilarious side note this guy would also call me at weird hours and hit on me saying my voice was sexy so theres that   fast forward a bit and the season is about to start they gather all of us monsters along with all the other workersconstruction workers that are going to build the maze concession workers security etc etc in front of the building were going to work at they pump us the hell up about this   a week later they fire everyone except the elite monster team because they couldnt secure a seasonal contract to rent the building seems like a pretty big damn oversight for such an experienced team   but as i said they didnt fire the elite team we were given a time and a placeand by now there were only like 6 of us they had work for us we were going to work at various haunts throughout socal in mazes that needed help because we were so well trained and elite   we worked at i think a total of three different haunts each night everyone would pile into my car as i had access to a big van that would fit all of us and drive to the haunt wed be working at   this was when i learned that i wasnt going to have the costume i thought i was going to have i wanted to be kind of a zombie in a straight jacket instead they had a purple frilly dress for me to wear i was actually pretty down with that and it was fineuntil one of the original workers at the maze we were at started harassing me about it trying to figure out if i was a chick or a trnny another night the bosses would come in like every few hours and berate my performance and say it sucked   at one point i had to basically move to la for like the whole month of october to work at a haunt we stayed in a warehouse full of old movie props which was actually pretty cool but at this point i had no money because we hadnt actually been paid for any of our work yet i was eating those 99 cent bread loaves from walmart and free tea from the concessions stand sometimes at the end of the night the owner of this haunt would buy everyone pizza so thats what i ate for weeks   the season ends and theres no word from the bosses for a few weeks then finally i get a call i have to go meet up with them to get my paycheck   i get there and its a lot like my audition was three guys sitting at a table i sit down and they slide across the table not a check but a print out of a bunch of postings from the facebook group on top is the only post i interacted with my friend implying the bosses are gay and my commentlol or whatever it was something noncommittal and innocuous they say that this facebook group counted as defamation and so they were only going to pay me the gas they used to get to the haunts they gave me a check for something like 23 not nearly enough to cover a huge chevy suburbans gas driving all around southern california   but i was 16 it was my first real job i thought i

413,"My job has definitively proven to me that no matter how good you are, you‚Äôre still ‚Äúaverage‚Äù",so every year the managers all get together and rate people on a scale of 15 and your score determines how big of a raise you get i started working there late 2018 so i had my first yearly performance review last april for 2019 for that year i was given a 3 despite my manager constantly singing her praises and telling me im one of the top 3 employees in the office she said with full transparency if it makes you feel any better you were a very high 3 very few people got 4s and no one got a 5 and i personally think they have the bar way too high for someone to reach a 4   ok i said i spent my entire summer helping other teams get caught up and doing other peoples work and i took every development opportunity that my manager threw my way so how could someone go from a 3 to a 4  she said i need to make a bigger impact across the office   ok what does that mean  im not sure she said im a little confused too ill need to ask for clarification from my managers  so this past year 2020 i once again did every extra side project they threw my way on top of a doubled to tripled workload i volunteered to manage a difficult customer i mentored a new hire i spent two months working overtime every week to help another office get caught up i took 3040 calls daily i lead a customer audit i came up with several process changes to help lessen workload i did weekly customer calls with another difficult customeryou get the gist   i had my 2020 review yesterday guess what i got  a fucking 3   im under a new manager now since my other one is on leave he said do you have any questions  i said nope  i think he could tell i was irritated because he said dont worry most of the rest of the office got a 3 too   fantastic that makes me feel so much better so until i finally fucking find a new job im just going to sit back and relax like everyone else because evidently extra work doesnt mean jack shit i mean ive known that for a while but up until last summer i ate all their shit up never again,lnt8wz

415,Work hard and you will succeed?,i want to start by saying that i absolutely hate working however have always seen it as a necessary means to an end ive often worked 2 or 3 jobs simultaneously to make ends meet as ive lived in my own place since i was 21 and always had a car so wage slavery has had me hooked for a while now i worked 6 days a week over two jobs for a year and a half until the pandemic hit and had no life  im 27 based in scotland and work for local government or council as it would be called here within their hr services department prior to the pandemic i had an hour commute to the office 95 and then same again on the way back  now i work from my bedroom i grew up in a deprived area living with my nonworking single mother and siblings although my dad has always been in the picture like any workingclass person my age i was brought up to believe that if i work hard ill get on in life this idea of social mobility is whats sold to you throughout your youth and what ultimately pushed me towards university where i spent a number of years achieving a 21 in business hons and an msc in human resource management while sacrificing a lot in my personal life i do not like hr  i have worked in my organisations hr services department since summer 2018 and in my current role for almost 2 years now for the most part local government workers have a bad reputation here in the uk as theyre very safe jobs although not paid very well which are great for lazy people i knew this before starting but figured id be able to get on in the organisation with my education once id gained some experience as they dont typically recruit graduates my understanding was that if i work to a high standard take on extra reponsibilities and show that im keen then id be able to progress after a year or two  this week though ive been unsuccessful for a job that i am very familiar with and one that i do a lot of already in favour of a colleague whos worked for the organisation for 30 years or so without progressing while id agree they are capable of doing the job this person does not have the education i have and is not nearly as outgoing as i have shown since i joined the team  ive been a tremendous yesman and always the first to take on extra responsibilities to air my thoughts in team meetings and to find solutions to the issues we face in fact after their retirement plans were announced the postholder inferred on several occasions that their job would be mines before interview when looking at it it was hard to imagine how it couldnt be  after all that old mantra is what ive been assured all my life id worked hard done well on the job and gone above and beyond regularly and always understood id be rewarded accordingly  on learning that i hadnt got the job my manager advised i gave a strong interview but was pipped at the post they didnt offer much meaningful feedback beyond the old work on your interviewing skills there is an implication i am supposed to take the knock continue with my head down and continue to work towards getting the promotion it just wasnt my turn my conclusion is that i simply have not occupied a seat for long enough to warrant a move up the ladder  there is an unspoken queue and i need to serve my time first my experience to date has also shown me that my education is of no value here at all  which is ironic as i was recently asked by my manager to host an online recruitment event at my old university my eager peoplepleasing self obviously agreed  the last few days have obviously now given me plenty of food for thought about the way forward i dont doubt that if i carry on ill get a promotion eventually but now im not sure im willing to if i dont show im willing to and stop offering to take on extra responsibilities etc itll be held against me as ive set such a high standard for myself since i started never mind feeling like a dick for going above and beyond ive actually shot myself in the foot a bit going forward  i have a colleague who has got incompetence down to an art form and they earn more money than i do purely as theyve worked there longer lets call them steve i always find myself picking up after steves mistakes and i suppose you could say ive looked down on them for their laziness now im beginning to look at this in a different light  steve just wants his bills paid shows up to the mindnumbing 95 doing bare minimum and lives a reasonably comfortable life   maybe steve has it all figured out and ive been too naive to realise there is quite an uncomfortable realisation there  while i havent read david graebers book ive listened to a good bit of his stuff and can comfortably say this is a bullshit job and the work is brutally unfulfilling however in my pursuit for promotion and better pay ive tricked myself into enjoying it as a challenge even going back to university  i told myself id put up with it as long as im paid well while im not exactly paid well i have now been working from my bedroom since march 2020 and will likely continue until the end of the year at least as before there arent many safer jobs to have in this pandemic and economic climate and this allows me to save a decent amount of money per month and so im left in quite a fortunate position going forward  i am completely disillusioned and have told myself ill take a few weeks to figure out my future plans i have a feeling that moving organisation wont be any better though i could also change career  for example ive always thought about doing teaching which i suppose would be more fulfilling work id also like to work for myself but i dont have any skills etc to make this a reality in a way id be far more content cruising at the minimum in my comfortable job for the next year or 2 and saving my energy for my free time   i understand this sub is against the concept of work altogether but whats the alternative or the best compromise in the current system do you still believe that hard work gets you places or have you abandoned this mantra altogether id be interested to hear from other people who have had similar realisations or any podcastbook recommendations etc,lp5dyt

478,I turned 28 on Tuesday. First thought I had waking up today was that so many years of my life have sped by while working full time,good morning existential crisis ive had them since i was 23 when a friend committed suicide and theyve at least gotten better sometimes i still get so sad though especially when i think about getting older and seeing my parents age and pass away me passing away   but this morning i realized that im 28 now im almost 30 and when i look back at how fast 18  28 went i feel basically 40 like 40 will be here in a year and me being old and dying is close enough to feel it following me year after year   this is melodramatic i realize but i started thinking that college went by at a steady pace it wasnt until i started working full time that the years sped by you spend so much time waiting for two dats each week to try to cram in things you need to do then a handful of hours for hobbies i just dont have time to do the things i want to do or used to do i have to choose do i devote time to computer stuff to potentially change careers and better myself or do i play video games learn languages etc   i read once about some theory that said that time only seems to go by faster when youre older because youve had more stretches of time to compare against a 7 year old feels like a summer lasts a lifetime because they havent experience many summers yet   while that may be true i think the reason time goes by so fast is because of work toiling day in and day out waiting for the weekend waiting for the major holiday waiting for another vacation you blink and before you know it another year is gone i go back to work tomorrow after taking 9 days off and i didnt want to go back 72 hours ago it feels like i just barely had enough time to let my hair down for once and have freedom it was just enough time to put the house back in order and feel okay with that but i didnt spend much time on hobbies just recuperating or trying to   im privileged i have a relatively good job with some minor flaws i make enough money to be comfortable pay rent pay car payment pay utilities pay groceries etc but little left over and barely save ive got medical bills up the wazoo im trying to pay off and each month i wonder where my money goes but im housed clothed and fed im privileged where income is concerned compare to many but im poor in time and the older i get the more loss i feel over time,lp5tka

531,Exploitation: An Antiwork Math Class,what is exploitation  it is not just the conditions of laborers in the developing world it is merely the utilization of a resource in more and more expansive ways  oil is exploited as fuel silicon is exploited as computer components and humans are exploited as labor  the simplest exploitation of people as a resource under capitalism is profit  imagine you are in a simple fast food chain where you are the only employee  you work for a wage to produce hamburgers which your boss sells for a profit  this simple exchange is exploitative since by the nature of it you are adding a certain amount of value to a product but only receiving a percentage of that value back as a wage  you may be okay with this relationship  although you are not able to retain all of the value you add to the hamburger your job offers you a certain amount of stability  you would not after all be able to create the hamburger without the resources your capitalists owns their industry connections also may provide you with a certain piece of mind that your job is more secure than it would be if you were managing the resources needed to produce the hamburger on your own  this is exploitative but it is not that bad  one day your boss hires a second worker and installs a drive thru window  you dont think much of it having an extra pair of hands is helpful and the extra business makes you feel like your job is more secure  conservatively the job can handle 2x the business now and both you and your coworker are 2x more efficient than you were on your own  however your pay does not increase  you are doing the same work at a more efficient rate and putting out twice the value and your boss offers you as the senior employee a healthy 10 raise  however this is already getting screwy because you are now working twice as hard but getting an even smaller portion of what you are creating despite your raise  the boss hires another two workers with the profits in the business and now the restaurant and each worker with it is able to put out 4x of what you as an individual were originally creating  you individually are given another 10 raise  you are now working 4x harder for 12x the pay   and this can be extrapolated out into the entire working class  this is basically the math behind that commonly shared wages stagnation graphhttpsaflcioorgsitesdefaultfilesmigratefilesfivecausesofwagestagnationintheunitedstatesjpg   every year the capotalist class is able to double or triple the amount of resources and money they are under control while we in comparison are given a smaller and smaller share  this doesnt stop at wages either  employers used to include a decent amount of job training even for basic things like professional writing  these days  they dont have to do that you pay for it now with your higher education saving them money on the clock for when they train you  the pandemic is another example  cant stop the growth of businesses so instead well force nurses and other healthcare workers to work 5x harder so we dont have to close anything  exploitation makes it a mathematical certainty that the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer  unless you are doubling or tripling your income and resource acquisition you arent even keeping up pace so save your fantasies of escaping the system by working inside of it if you still have any  every year you are doing more and more work for less and that is why work fucking sucks,lmtogq

554,"Punishing or giving ""points"" for calling in sick is archaic and needs to go away already.",i could literally write 10 pages on this but i will keep it brief as possible its something that really gets under my skin  why do we supposedly punish employees for calling in sick or give them points ask any business and their response 99 of the time will be so people are encouraged to come to work and not staying home all the time  this has to be the most dumb as fuck argument ever   for starters if you completely got rid of the punishment points or any negativity at all for calling in sick i doubt very few would abuse this  why because people need money employers seem to think without points or other systems for calling in sick people would just call in all the time   bullshit   the point of a job is to work for money to pay you rent car payment bills etc the only people who might be breaking the rules is either teens living at home and thus little or no bills or people who are so filthy rich they work out of boredom yes these people exist  so if someone is fired they make no money if someone stays home playing hooky then they arent making money either   it also is a highly discriminatory practice some people have poor immune systems and thus get sick more more often than others ive seen people rarely get a cold or flu  people also have chronic illnesses and managing that while being berated at work for being sick too much only adds stress which is highly unhealthy for someone already in that position   i cant help if im sick i do not make myself purposely sick or go around licking doorknobs   why the fuck should i be punished for this  in what fucking world does that make sense   on top of this if people were not goaded guilt tripped or had their job and financial security dangled in front of them like a god damn carrot i surmise many people would actually get less sick as ive observed all too often people coming to work sick  especially when companies give out awards and other bullshit for perfect attendance or adjust your bonuses if you miss any days  im currently at the precipice of losing my job for calling in to much i have a myriad of health issues sleep apnea adhd chronic fatigue chronic pain etc  some nights i get 1 hour or no sleep   work would think it would be better if i drove into work on no sleep and risk crashing into a car and killing myself and possibly others then take the day off,ln2qws

556,"Planning to quit my job, advice and input needed",sorry if formatting is weird im on mobile    ive decided that im going to quit my current role and just be jobless until after i finish my masters degree in may im in a pretty significant transitional period with my career and im honestly just burnt out with my current role i work in human services with children with disabilities its rewarding work but it never ends there is no clear end of the work day or start of the next its constant ongoing decision making for others who need you and im exhausted honestly i cant even focus on my own family and my own home because im constantly making decisions for others and being needed i work from home client files are kept at home and the line between work and life is so blurred it really doesnt exist ive contemplated suicide just to end this feeling im out of that space but i still need a solution not to mention im in graduate school online full time   so now im thinking if i quit this job at the beginning or middle of april ill have about a month off to finish up school and just do nothing my field is in pretty high demand and i think i could easily secure a job in about a month or so when i start looking i just need a break if my partner and i keep our typical spending habits and nothing catastrophic happens we would need less than half of what is currently in my savings account for me to not work apriljune we could also probably be more conservative with our spending and id be saving so much on gas and car maintenance i currently drive about 350 miles a week to client homes if our tax returns come on time we wouldnt even need to touch my savings then ideally i can find a contract position that pays enough for me to only need to work part time   is this plan reasonable my partner is supportive but i think hes just being nice because i am on the verge of breaking and he doesnt want to push me over by challenging this i dont want to end up homeless we have a ton of family nearby that i could lean on worst case scenario wed move in with my parents if i cant find a job i feel like this is my only option right now   i need a break or this is going to kill me im burnt out i have decision fatigue and its driving me into compassion fatigue which is a death sentence for the field im in i get anxious when my phone rings or buzzes with a calltextemail im currently avoiding getting ready for my next client im not built to do this every day i know i need a break before i move into a more senior role any advice or encouragement is welcomed,lm2fle

565,Stop eating out and buying avocado toast.,contrary to popular belief most rich people are rich precisely because they do not buy 2 yacht they work hard and they are disciplined with their money and since they save it and dont spend it thats how a lot of people can become millionaires even without having a six figure salary  of the goal is for poor people to not be poor and to gain wealth then it needs to start with their own spending habits like not buying food at mcdonalds his isnt making their situation worse you can eat healthy at low cost if you dont eat out all the time there are also food banks that the poor have access to if it helps them save money to pay off debts and things like that  of you want to stop feeling sorry for yourself you need to change your own life with some discipline the vast majority of poor people do not have budget and they dont actively save every penny for emergencies and to pay off debt of you can point me to a poor person who does all the finally responsible things and is still poor maybe that is a discussion for charitable things but the truth is that you cant help someone who isnt willing to put on the effort to help themselves he cant keep giving men fish who are unwilling to fish themselves and thats what the welfare state has been doing or at least giving them money has made them lose incentive to make money because they would lose the free money otherwise its sad when people make more money on unemployment than they would if they simply worked even a minimum wage job ,lmr7t2

589,My Pandemic Workplace Meltdown,this is just a vent  rant meant to get this off my chest i made this account to post here after lurking for a while writing this at work because my employer doesnt deserve any better the pandemic has absolutely ruined my perception of my workplace for context i work for a small business that employs a handful of people maybe 1020 i actually know the owner for the most part i enjoyed working here the coworkers are nice and not too uptight of course heading into the pandemic the owner sat all of us down and gave us the classic we have to be a team and help each other out speech i reel every time i think of it and how little help anyone here has gotten everyone since then aside from myself and one coworker who take care of the actual day to day tasks had been reduced to half the amount of hours they used to work and some were let go entirely did i received hazard pay for showing up to work no but at least they will give me the dollar raise i requested to help me stay afloat right nope not in the budget but i know the budget isnt as tight as the owner claims how do i know this well apparently its still in the budget to continue to send their kids to european private schools apparently its still in the budget to take frequent international flights apparently having 3 antique furnished houses in different states is still in the budget meanwhile unemployment benefits for my coworkers is near an end and there is no talk of returning people to full time  so as a consequence of this pandemic i have learned that work as a team and help each other means that i have more responsibilities less help and stagnant pay while my bosses life is exactly the same whats the cherry on top of it i now question why i had a manager at all clearly if i take care of the daily operations and my manager isnt required full time because i take care of the responsibilities here then i dont need someone to tell me what to do yet i dont get help or pay to match whats worse is that the nepotism in this company is rampant one of my coworkers is the bosses relative this relative is not a manager just a coworker however they feel the need to report to the owner that somehow my one other full time worker and i dont work hard enough despite us working harder than ever now so on top of all my other grievances i have been putting up with slander at this point why dont i just find another job theres so many possibilities around which reprehensible corporation do i want to work for amazon walmart grub hub doordash ooooh what about one of the many other small business around ah of course they dont cover the cost of rent silly me guess ill just bootstraps myself until something comes along i hate this all so much watching my coworkers struggle while the owner walks around as if nothing is happening i guess this end my rant sorry for the long post and probably bad format hope everyone else is sticking it to their boss somehow  tldr owner of the company is completely unaffected by the pandemic while their employees suffer and im overloaded with work without help and feel like there is no recourse,lmpk1e
590,Thinking about quitting my job but I'm nervous.,warning this is basically just a rant im sorry im just looking for validation i think i dont know ive been at my job for a bit over 8 months and it is my first real job im 19 and in college as well when i first started i was full time in college with 5 classes a combination of online classes and work not listening to me needing less hours resulted in me dropping 4 out of my 5 classes when i first started we had 7 employees if you include me now we have 4 i am now only taking 2 classes but i keep asking for 2025 hours my manager will put me on the schedule for that originally but then scratch out my hours and tack more on without telling me this results in me working 2835 hours a week i enjoy the money but its affecting my mental health very severely and i often cry in the cooler at work when im alone i also work nights now i never ever wanted to be the person to close the cafe never ive been doing it alone for nearly 3 months now ever since the new manager came not only this but she constantly talks shit about me behind my back even though others have said im the hardest worker there i get out of work at midnight most nights and this combined with my depression causes me to sleep around 910 hours a night and limits the time i can study or even relax even getting a concussion a week ago was not enough to get less hours my manager added even more actually and then called off her own shifts twice in a week but guilt tripped me the two times ive called off in the 5 months shes been there i hate her i do not mind my job one bit when im working with coworkers and not alone i work 7 hour shifts alone often and it stresses me out beyond belief i have to cook all of the orders that come in prep put away truck all by myself on days it comes clean make the 200 donuts we make every night and clean the store all by myself almost every night i want to quit but only working somewhere for 8 months looks bad on a resume and the anxiety of finding a new job also makes me feel sick i like the comfort of knowing how to do my job and my family would be incredibly disappointed in me for quitting plus i have an apartment with my boyfriend who also has a part time job and it would be so unfair of me to quit i hate my life so much and the only good thing about working so much is that im so stressed about my job and such that i cant even worry too much about killing myself or my mental health another thing im worried about is that since its my first job that i must be blowing this out of proportion and that everywhere is like this people have said at least youre not at a factory i just feel so worthless at my job and i feel like its not worth the 825 an hour i make it feels unfair that my manager make more than double the amount i make even though she works less and calls off more i just hate my life so much and i think quitting would only make me feel more hopeless and starting a new job is too stressful and scary i just wish i could exist without working i want time to make art and do crafts without people pressuring me to do it for a career or to sell my art everything feels hopeless,lm5fe7

606,My Work Experience,i recently started a new job for a company in a low cost of living state making items intentionally being vague for several reasons my previous employment includes an engineer role at a major corporation  i am paid 1200 an hour with no benefits yet i work 10 hour days every day there are 10 of us on a single item and other teams working on different lines for different products but the 10 of us make up our entire production for that productitem  these items sell for approximately 5000 each and we produce about 67 of them per minute for 10 hours each day that means that in the first two minutes of i have paid for my hour worth of labor or in the first 20 minutes i have paid for my entire 10 hour days salary cost with my labor alone  these items are also very inexpensive to make and dont require any expensive equipment you couldnt afford to put in your home garage they purchase wires glue and the other stuff in bulk and very very cheaply  in the break room there are several antiunion posters and we live in a right to work state anyways so they are doubling down there they also placed all of the losses on a bulletin in the middle of the room that shows how much we lost to warranty and several external issues   it annoys me so much that people see the 036 of items were warrantied and cost us 8000000 dollars and go wow we need to work harder to make up that money i only make 24k per month and that is 4x my annual salary yikes slightly edited real conversation i overheard edited with the 24k part instead of realizing that 036 is out of 9964 of items that made it and produced a massive profit for the semiquarter 2 months  the product we make is a requirement under osha as well there are no demand or outlook issues this company has us working like slave labor while criticizing us for 036 and telling us unions are evil and will steal our rightfully earned peanuts  what the fuck,lmb1op

651,"Care workers, social workers, nurses: Why are you anti-work?",ive seen a lot of posts here by people who work in offices in the service industry manual labor etc im curious if there are more people like me here in the antiwork sphere who work in what could be called a caring profession most of us choose these jobs because we enjoy helping people and because we feel our work is meaningful at the same time the work can be physically and mentally exhausting working conditions are often shit so my question is why are you antiwork    my own background is in social work and i have worked in several different group homes for people with mentalphysical disabilities over the years i have found that even though i love what i do and i care deeply about my clients i still hate work i think the  pressure to join the workforce and be a functional adult  was what really made my depression and anxiety spiral out of control when i finished school im almost thirty years old now and i still havent adjusted to the pressure of work my social anxiety makes it that im terrified of conflict and im scared to make any kind of mistake at work because im so scared of my coworkers thinking badly of me it consumes me and i cant switch off after my shift is over   i like working with the clients and i feel like im doing something meaningful but everything around it the employeremployeerelationship the stupid infighting and gossiping in teams of coworkers the time constraints it all sucks i never take a break at work maybe one or two quick smoke breaks a shift the rest of the time im on my feet trying to finish my list of tasks i almost never finish on time almost nobody finishes on time i would claim that its impossible to finish on time if you actually do your work properly  its exhausting being so directly responsible for the wellbeing of other humans and being so understaffed that you will never have enough time in your shift to actually give every client the attention they need,lmr03n

654,I‚Äôm not depressed but I seriously would rather die than waste the rest of my life doing what I‚Äôm doing right now (badly need advice),so i started a new job in my field today and i came to this realization  after all the time effort and money it took to get my degree and get to this point ive realized that i hate my pointless career choice and it feels like nothing more than a complete waste of my life  quickly id like to explain how i got here though  all my childhood up through high school i felt motivated to be a high achiever i always got straights as i was on sports teams in a bunch of school clubs etc for whatever reason i felt purpose and enjoyed being a high achiever i graduated near the top of my class and though i wasnt necessarily always happy starting around 11 when my parents split we moved etc but i was doing pretty well  then when i got to college everything changed i went through a few phases of pretty deep depression my anxiety and ocd worsened as well and a lot of my time was filled with simply feeling a decent level of pain and anguish it was difficult and i felt like quitting a lot but eventually i got through it it took me about twice as long as everyone else 8 years due to a combination of not knowing what i wanted to do my first two years my mental issues and simply struggling to adjust to the speed and difficulty of college classes but in the end i got through it and got my accounting degree with a good gpa granted with many dropsaudits from a good school  so everything seemed great but for some reason i just had little motivation to find an accounting job i dont know why but i just felt more comfortable at my menial fast food job with a few good friends sure the restaurant was horribly run they had me on the night shift i worked 4045 hours a week and i traveled about an hour there and an hour back every day but that just seemed okay and i didnt really want to leave i was well liked got a bit of ot and i did really well handling customers and honing my customer service skills   living with my mom again however she forced me to get an accounting job so i applied and got one pretty easily for last tax season janapril 2020 the job was okay but it was often boring and tedious i once again traveled an hour each way a day and worked 40 hours i did fine but it just wasnt appealing i was also always tired being that i only got a few hours of sleep a night im a night owl who hates mornings i will legit stay up until the sun rises and sleep into the afternoon if i can i had hoped they would keep me on once tax season ended but due to the pandemic and the fact that they didnt have enough work after tax season ended i was let go  so over the next ten months until today i was unemployed and i finally felt truly happy and fulfilled to some that might sound crazy im 27 and i was unemployed living with my mom but to me it was such a refreshing time i felt free and got to learn about myself educate myself on what i wanted to learn about spend time on hobbies and work toward the things i was passionate about most of my friends are also online so i got to talk to them and play games online with them a lot and just relax having much less stress and feeling content truly those 10 months felt like actually living they felt meaningful and hell the craziest part is that ordinarily those 10 months would have seemed horrible and there were small periods of times when they were for example the two worst things in my life happened i lost my dog and my grandfather both whom i loved dearly there were some very difficult days but thanks to overcoming my depression in the past i was able to continue moving forward and was able to regain my happiness honestly i feel like beating truly dark depression and being able to move forward no matter what comes at me is my biggest triumph  but now i have a job again and i hate everything about it i hate getting up so early to go in i hate going in and being around strangers i hate having to feel on for people i hate the stress and time pressure that i amwill be put under i hate feeling judged for my germaphobia which has only been amplified thanks to the pandemic even though i dont even fear covid that much and other small quirks frankly i hate it all im the type of person who needs a pretty significant amount of alone time and when i work i obviously am unable to have it though its obviously much different around family friends etc even being around them too long takes its toll on me a bit  i simply like my alone time i dont need much at all just the basics and maybe a computer with a few friends to talk to and play games with thats my dream lol not working or working very little having a modest lifestyle and having a lot of free and alone time to do what i want as i choose do i enjoy going out and doing things do i enjoy trips do i enjoy visiting family watching sports games shows together etc absolutely but if im working a lot of hours i simply dont want to do very much of that i go crazy without my down time lol  i used to think i wanted to get married have children etc but i dont think i do anymore maybe if i found a woman who feels similarly to me but as far as having kids i dont know i feel like my life will always be run by them and other than caring for them which obviously holds a lot of value the rest of my life will be pointless ill never get to do the things i like to do and feel happy andor at peace just thinking about the permanence of it and potential for being constantly stressed and unhappy gives me a small feeling of anxiousness  i dont know if anyone can relate to any of this but its how i feel i dont have a motivation problem at all and my depression isnt much of a factor either i get myself insanely motivated and excited to pursue my hobbies and the causes i feel are important its just unfortunate that a i cant make money through them and b im not particularly efficient though im thorough and accurate its not even that i dislike accounting i like messing with numbers its just the going into work the time pressure the early and long hours etc i tried looking into some independent contracting where i could work remotely and get paid by the return or document not by the hour that honestly sounds great bc i can take my time and wont have to start so early unfortunately i got hired instead lol  i know this is a very longwinded post and might even seem like a stupid post to some people but its how i feel maybe i just havent found my passion that can make me money but im not sure ill ever get that opportunity i can do what im doing for awhile i can suck it up through the tax season even but doing it my entire life just seems unbearable hell im sure i could even eventually pass all four parts of the cpa exam i did spend 2400 on a course but the traditional career just seems horrible to me  thank you in advance to anyone who actually read some or all of this and is kind enough to respond i figure im not the only person in the entire world feeling a bit this way  ps im not helped by the fact that my family even though they are great people are big on working long hours even if you hate your job most of them waste their lives doing it even if they arent compensated for their efforts,lmext0

658,"Introverts, extroverts, social skills and ""office politics""",just following up on another post about this  i dont see it as so much of an introvertextrovert issue  what i have seen in my 30 years of working is that its much more about how much you are willing to be used by your boss and coworkers to meet their emotional needs  if they want you to be their therapist best friend sondaughter motherfather sidekick drinking buddy emotional chew toy or just join in when they are trashing or gossiping about other people you better do it  having healthy boundaries can actually hurt you in the workplace  now of course no one ever talks about it like this  most people probably dont even know they are doing this  they just think they like and get along with one person and not so much another without ever thinking about why that is  i think it falls along a spectrum with stuff like sexual or racial harassment at the more extreme end  notice how many stories involve the target feeling like they couldnt do anything about it because it would risk their job or their entire careers  the boss has the power whether their agenda is to make jokes about your tits or tell you all the gory details of their divorce  its just as difficult for an extrovert to set boundaries as for an introvert because in both cases it is about challenging power dynamics,ljcroq

700,And the system keeps chugging along...,i realized that the reason people leave is because of two things  1 your pay is stifled the second you accept and offer it will stagnate from that moment on 2 simultaneously the employers demands and expectations of you will increase from that moment on they want more while not giving you better pay marginal amendments if that  thus when you start a new job its worth it  its a lot of new work but youre being paid really well  however there will come a time likely in 23 years of your start date where the effort required no longer is worth the income this is because your pay hasnt really increased to match your new workload this is when you leave the job  i am an idiot and have been here for too long i hate them and they dont like me theyre trying to make me do more when i know new hires junior to me are making 20 more than me  and thus this is the 23 year career switch churn cycle and the system chugs along  i cant wait to leave my job i started interviewing a month ago and cant wait to land something good i studied all weekend for interviews,lk136z

734,Newcomer with a few questions.,i recently found this sub and im confused about the general consensus on labor here ive seen many comments and posts that have phrases like abolish all labor and such does this mean abolish labor as we know it by getting rid of exploitative and unfair labor practices and reforming the way we work or is official position on labor in this sub that labor is inherently exploitative and needs to be abolished in all forms permanently if its the latter i dont see how human society can survive like that people need different services and products to survive and labor provides that,lk3h70

768,The interview I had the other day really re-established my loathing for corporate America,last month i was fired from my assistant manager position at the local united post savages retail store when i came back from quarantiningtesting after a covid19 exposure negative test result thank god under the pretense of not being a good fit despite my work history in the position with stellar feedback from customers and praise from two out of three coworkers in reality the store manager didnt like me didnt like the fact that i learned my job quickly and did it well and hated the fact that the two associates liked me better than her however thats a story for another day  naturally i was back on an exhaustive job search because you know i need to live and whatever fortunately my former employer didnt fight my unemployment claim so now im making more money not working than i did putting in 40 hours plus overtime in retail hell thanks covid bonus money  id applied for an administrative position and being a guy this has always been a difficult task since apparently in my state its weird for men to work in an office unless theyre somewhere at the top of the food chain but since no employers were hiring ceos without 85 years of experience and three college degrees i had to start somewhere  i ended up getting a call regarding the position and we scheduled a zoom interview i left my pajama pants on put on a good dress shirt and positioned myself awkwardly in front of the camera waiting for the interviewer to begin the meeting  just by looking at this disheveled carcass of a oncehuman i already knew this interview was going to be filled to the brim with buzzwords gross expectations and the importance of it being a family company ill jump to the sweet part of the interview  interviewer so walk me through your work history  me explains whats listed in broad daylight on my resume  i why did you leave your last position  m it was a mutual agreement that my departure would allow me to pursue a position more aligned with my goals and desire for growth  i okay well circle back to that later interviewer then proceeds to tell me her experience with the company and how shes dedicated the last 30 years of her life to this place etc in short im looking for someone dedicated that wants to grow with the company  m understandable  i im not getting the impression that that person is you however your work history shows that the last time you worked in the same position for more than a year was back in 2017 and most of which were entry level positions it doesnt seem like youve really moved the needle in your career journey  m visibly taken aback and mildly annoyed well when one has had a rough work history of holding positions in toxic environments under concrete ceilings unrecognized achievements supervisor plagiarism and other growthstifling situations one doesnt exactly stick around with that being said having no college experience due to personal reasons and despite having a collective 5 years in administration i havent been able to secure any positions in a higher tier than entry level  i what reasons do you have for not going to college  m may i ask why youre keen to know  i well it just seems peculiar that someone of your age has no college degree and only has experience in entry level positions  m with all due respect is this an interview or target practice quite frankly for the past few moments all ive received from you are insults and i find your demeanor to be highly unprofessional and inappropriate  i i beg your pardon  m you asked me to walk you through my work history all of which ive said is visible on my resume and you subsequently stated that you dont believe im the dedicated candidate youre looking for and criticized my work history and lack of college experience which raises the question of why youd even schedule this interview with me in the first place  i well i wanted to give you the consideration of explaining yourself and convince me that you are in fact an ideal candidate  m you mean beg thats not going to happen and the consideration of explaining myself i dont have to explain myself to you nor do i need any consideration from someone who would raise their nose at another individual without the same occupational background ill be withdrawing my application from this position please do not contact me further  i then ended the zoom call maybe i overreacted but i felt very insulted and my work history was nowhere near as bad as she made it sound the buzzwords circle back and move the needle made my eyes twitch and the audacity of her judgement was just disgusting to me ive never been so offended in an interview before,ljpuge

774,"Erosion of Worker Compensation, Unlimited PTO, and Demoralizing Situation",so my company recently switched me to salaried exempt from overtime pay froze my accrued pto and instead gave me unlimited pto i will still get paid my accrued pto upon termination or when i leave the company but the payout dollar value is frozen my accrued pto hours will be reduced by the same  as any future raises so they can still say that theyre paying you out at your final rate but the final pto payout amount will still be the same as at the end of 2020 regardless of how much longer i stay at the company  its obvious no matter how hr try to spin unlimited pto that its a scam and companies are just trying to minimize the amount of pto employees take every year and reduce the amount of money they have to pay when employees leave i searched for unlimited pto posts on reddit and it seems widespread across industries and being increasingly implemented at more and more companies i know my companys policy is at least better than those people that completely lost their accrued pto after their companies switched to unlimited pto but it still seems dirty  looking through my employee handbook apparently this pto payout policy doesnt apply to california colorado    illinois louisiana montana and nebraska which require employers to pay the remainder of unused accrued pto at the employees final pay rate my state of new york and many other stateshttpswwwpaycorcomresourcecenterptopayoutlawsbystatetextdoes20your20state20require20employers20to20payout20pto3femployee20contrac2020201020more20rows20 just defers pto payout requirements to employer policies so were just at the mercy of our employers  i reached out to my state assemblyman to see if ny labor laws could be amended to be similar to those other states and they told me that the ny assembly labor committee responded back saying the committee staff have concerns that this type of legislation may discourage employers from voluntarily instituting a paid time off program  this is just demoralizing were powerless as our employers continuing eroding worker compensation and conveniently using the pandemic to justify these policy changes despite record profits and our government is too scared or corrupt to act and look out for the regular people which theyre supposed to do i think in the upcoming future once a majority of employers have implemented unlimited pto earned pto will just be another worker benefit lost to history just like pensions severance right to disconnect and probably the 40hour work week  thanks for reading my rant and what policy changeserosion have you seen at your employer,ljzuq9

777,"What options are there for making money, but with the least amount of time and effort involved?",ive spent my adult life and even most of my adolescent years thinking about and working towards the career im currently in and im now in a place that i should be very happy about the problem is im neither content or fulfilled ive come to realise that the industry i work in is very exploitative relatively poorly paid and i think much of the work is very monotonous and there is little room for creativity   most people would probably think im emotionally unwell to be questioning whether i should continue in a career i have spent my life focused on    but what ive come to realise is that i dont particularly enjoy working before finding the job im currently in i was out of work for a couple of months and i found that i was comparatively happy in this situation i had a better feeling of selfworth i was much less anxious less miserable and i spent the wealth of my time reading and writing for some people a job gives them confidence and strength but for me it seems to be the opposite i feel stronger when i am completely in control of my life and when i feel that im using the precious time ive been given to improving my understanding of the world or being creative im not someone who slips into inertia im never bored because i always enjoy learning and books are cheap and the most extraordinary resource is at my fingertips it seems quite sad to me that some people are completely lost if they dont have a job surely you can find satisfaction in life without being forced to turn your waking hours into profits  when i speak to people about my concerns the usual response is along the lines of ah well what you need is just another career or that old hackneyed quote find a job that you love and youll never work a day in your life its a bit like being a heroin junky and people suggesting other drugs you could choose to become addicted with instead   the other stock response i hear is well you have to work hard if want to make money or theres no easy way to become rich as if the only possible aim i could have in future is to become wealthy ive realised im not that bothered about having money so long as i have enough to pay the rent on a little flat keep me stocked up on food and books and very occasionally go travelling on a shoestring budget i dont want a car nor am i interested in gadgets or expensive clothes im happy to live a frugal existence if it means im able to spend more time doing the things i enjoy  is this possible what options are there for making money but with the least amount of time and effort involved,lkplyj

813,Doing something you love,i had a discussion with my parents recently about my current position im in and how much they hate that im doing it   for reference im a research technician with a university i have my bachelors and am currently doing a masters while workingthe job is not permenant as are many academic jobs and it is grueling work but i have a very flexible work schedule and im loving the big picture of being part of moving knowledge forward and doing applied research  the discussion with parents started with them asking when me and my wife were going to move into a house together i explained to them that i am currently doing a masters while working and hope to pursue a phd after and even after that there may be postdoc positions so it could be a relatively long time before we settle into something permanent like a house ive discussed these plans with my wife and we are happy with where our future is headed they scowled and said something along the lines of you are too smart to go down the career path youve chosen you could get a job anywhere in industry and make so much more money i told them id rather do something i love doing and live rental to rental than hate my life for 40 hours per week just to live for the other little bit of time in each day  they think i have some sort of mental illness for thinking like that but it is the absolute truth id rather stay where i am now heping to make impactful discoveries than move to industry where my labor makes more money for some company  maybe this doesnt necessarily fit into the theme of rantiwork but it is just an experience that i thought would spark some good discussion in this subreddit,li35rs

825,Supervisor gives me grief over the tiniest things,my direct supervisor gives me grief over the stupidest stuff ever today he felt the need to bring up that i didnt follow procedure by signing a new user into their work email for the first time so they ended up using the wrong app like damn thats brutal boss guess you couldnt just tell them to use the other app i hate being micromanaged like this he can never let little things go he always feels the need to bring them to me and try to make me feel dumb yet he messes up all the time and i cant say anything to him   a few days before this he tells me i didnt assign someone a license to an app i absolutely did i made other changes to the account that cannot be made without them being licensed first but he proceeded to give me a long talking to about procedures and how i cant be missing things even though i didnt and he wouldnt listen   other times i ask a simple question like i need an answer to x and hell be like okay here we go again give me the ticket and i can take a look at it or conversely just ignore me altogether and let the issue sit there untouched all day he even admitted to me once he purposely doesnt help me right away when i ask questions because he thinks it helps me learn to figure it out by myself like no i just need an answer to the question i know what i am doing and have no issues doing the work once i get the information i need often this is very niche technical info that cant be found without someone having prior knowledge of the tech or good documentation which we do not have   im on the verge of quitting because of this guy he has maybe 1 year of seniority on me in my industry but still acts as though hes a 20 year vet hes fake as hell and it annoys me i cant work like this for much longer thinking of quitting and explicitly naming him as the reason on the exit interview,lhul8h
826,Convince me,so i have a job im sympathetic to some of the ideas ive seen while lurking here but a lot of them seem to be from people who have meaningless bullshit office jobs and i feel like i remain unconvinced no offense to office workers in general im sure lots of it isnt bullshit    i agree low wages are bullshit im not paid enough for what i do when i directly know people who will brag about how they do fuck all every day on their computer at home and their salary has an extra figure on mine good for them but a system that values them more than me is bullshit so okay sure    governments shouldnt be facilitating things for billionaires and millionaires definitely when lots of normal people are straight up living crisis to crisis absolutely      but blue collar work feels sort of different like yeah my boss makes more money than me but i guess i can at least be comfortable with that since he had to bet everything he had on his business succeeding and at least the difference isnt in orders of magnitudes like it would be at a huge corporation i dont want to take that kind of risk so i get a smaller reward that doesnt bother me       i work in an industry with often troubling health and safety issues and protection of labourer rights is virtually nonexistent i knew that before i signed up for trade school and frankly it doesnt bother me that much i have a threshold of acceptable risk i wont cross and my boss respects that at least healthcare here is free you americans are absolutely living in a hellscape on that front      40 hours a week doesnt bother me since i used to work almost 80 at a shitty company so thats fine by me i like almost all the people i work with and im about as okay with having a day i work as a day i dont work i made sure to live close enough to work that commuting isnt too bad i think my free time is fine though idk how the fuck i would have kids like this so there is that im not sure i really want kids though    automation wont be coming for my job for a long long time way too many oneoffs random chaos totally unpredictable things people wouldnt trust a robot not worried on that front       i guess the only thing that pisses me off is i probably wont be able to afford a house in my city in my lifetime haha but im not so sure thats an issue with work so much as capitalism our real estate market has fuck all protections so foreigners just jack up prices to infinity       anyways i dont think im a unicorn in that ive found a decent hands on job i dont think jobs like these are particularly rare and i think they genuinely contribute value to society in a way you can feel good about hell you can even have loads of fun doing it if youre the right kind of person its not for everyone and im actually very much proubi because no one should work a job they hate and still struggle but not all work is bullshit in fact a lot of it isnt its underpaid though i dont think work is the problem i think the way we assign value to work is completely fucked tell me how im wrong,lig1cr

830,Idea; A platform that gives a little control over your boss.,what if there was some sort of boss review website or app where you could freely review and discuss your boss if theyre crap you can ruin their rep but if theyre good who am i kidding when does that ever happen  i feel like its a possibility for positive change and better treatment from shitty bosses a shit rep could really fuck up their power dynamic and fear being disliked by the general public   it sounds a little cruel on paper as theyre just people but is it really any different to being a regular wage slave where you have to manage your output and behaviour  what are peoples thoughts  purely for discussion i really havent thought it out,lhplhf

832,Crazy crazy,so i commented a story about my old work last night and a few people thought it was crazy it wasnt the craziest story from there amp i said id post the crazy story   tldr version poison and intrigue   i took a job working as tech support at a large telco in australia i wont say which but most australians will probably work it out if you work it out amp dont believe the story you can google the name of the company amp the main aspect of the story amp you will find a new article confirming it  so anyway went through the training made a few friends through the training one guy in particular i got along with pretty well as he had a dark sense of humour like me i also made made my first enemy i guess a drone with pink hair that decided her path to power was to take it upon herself to police the milk honor system for tea amp coffee 20c for those that used milk hardly anyone at the company would pay amp i dont drink milk but that never stopped her from confronting us over it amp chairing stupid meetings about it at least once a week which was especially frustrating as it wasnt her job and as a low level employee she had no kind of authority  at the end of the training someone high up from corporate came along for what would be the first of many corporate wank sessions she asked us how many of us had our internet with them no one raised their hand she laughed amp said well our standout feature isnt our price nor our speed its our support so it makes sense that tech support wouldnt need that my buddy raised his hand and said well actually its because paying to have internet with you is like paying to go down on a hooker  buddy was fired on the spot its a perfect line that still haunts me on the nights i cant sleep  anyway the next morning we were all called into the meeting room again we all got in there and one of the managers asks the question who hear drinks tea or coffee everyone in the room groaned expecting it to be one of the usual honor system witch hunts she actually looked pretty nervous and said come on guys we need to know pretty much everyone raised their hands the next question was  keep your hands up if you drink milk there was a groan again but the manager persisted so ugh how are you all feeling ugh no ones um coughing up blood or anything  this led to puzzlement so she spilled the beans we found rat poison in the milk  anyway the whole thing went mental from there the homicide squad were called up from the state capital turns out that particular rat poison a fully grown person would have to eat about 1kg worth to kill someone but had a pretty good chance of causing bleeding from the gums and a few other areas we all got interviewed personally by the homicide squad i was talked to a lot about my buddy as he had been fired the day before so he was suspect number one   i did not believe that it was him as he wasnt that kind of person that i could see him possibly punching someone in the heat of the moment after being fired but not forming a plan coming back amp poisoning his coworkers amp told the detectives that they asked who id suspect i said pink hair amp explained the history anyway nothing ever came of it they eliminated my friend through security cameras timing etc said it couldnt possibly be him this was after months of borderline harassments mind you they did narrow it down to the worksite though it was a poisoning attempt from someone that worked at the building  the corporate environment is the unhealthiest kind of workplace ive ever worked in and i believe this story is a perfect example of that environment,li144p

881,my goals towards antiwork,hi everyone so for years ive hated the idea of working 9 to 5 for the rest of my life until retirement where all my youth is gone plus no guarantees i may never make it to that age because you never know  i also make only like 35 k a year so now ive been investing started with 15k now have 62k as it has grown will be adding a few thousand to that and moving it all into accounts that grow on average 10 percent a year rather than the 7 percent a year average interest my current investments provide  my goal is to hit 100 k and buy a couple tiny houses look up tiny houses and buy each for about 25k to 30k that way i have two homes in different parts of the country as my home bases theyll be paid off meaning i wont have to worry about rent or a mortgage and theyll fit my minimalist lifestyle then from there my shit paying job will enable me much more freedom even though it pays shit because my earnings mostly can be saved then each year ill be able to put a good 23k plus away since i also do a few thousand in under the table work each year at that point by my mid thirties i should have another 80k or so which i can use to travel on the cheap living in places like thailand doing workaways or woofing and just enjoying a mild life where a lot of my time is spend relaxing and doing music   anyway it may bit be glamorous but itll make me happy at all times i will funnel more money into my mutual funds account investments so im making an average of a few thousand dollars a year in passive income too im so excited,lj86sh
882,Curious about the anti-work philosophy,completely stumbled in here through the suggested subs in the app  never even heard of anti work before but reading the comments i definitely dont get it   i understand the aversion to what seem like unfair work conditions for some but it seems like from a philosophical perspective there is a belief that somehow we shouldnt have to work at all  if thats the case how do things get made delivered etc  my job is in the marine industry where yes there are mariners doing the hard work onboard the ship dock workers doing the hard work of transferring cargo sales and logistics workers trying to keep the ships busy and efficient and all kinds of office staff it and hr to support the industrial operations  at face value some of the jobs probably do suck or some of the jobs report to a person thats an ahole  some of the jobs though the people love it  but from the perspective of whether the people should have to work i guess i dont understand how the cargo we want as consumers gets to us  how does the cargo that other countries want from us get to them  without workwhat happens    is anti work due more to a disdain for unfulfilling jobs or a belief that there is another way to do things,liavdy

911,A question for the antiwork community,tldr as an outsider to this community im just interesting in what you all think about some questions i have   so  while i wouldnt identify myself as a part of this community i understand where you guys are coming from i am lucky enough to enjoy the work i do but i get how many people are fed up with capitalism and believe that life should be less about work  but what i ask is what is your solution nothing will happen unless the laws are changed do you argue for a universal basic income like andrew yang democratic socialism like bernie sanders do some of you identify as socialists or communists i guess i just want to know what you guys think the solution to this is i know many people would combat many of these ideas and say that socialism will never actually work i think its interesting although i dont like to take sides in this debate   another question are any of you former supporters of donald trump whether you like it or not he has appealed to the populist movement in the us although maybe youre not from the us i could see someone being angry with the system angry with being given an unlivable wage and turning to donald trump for answers just a question though   last question do any of you enjoy work i find it sad to see this community because i personally believe that fulfillment comes from having a meaningful life and that often comes from ones life work i am not saying that i think you all are sad i am saying i think the conditions that have lead people to become anti work are sad i just want to say that work can be fun it can be the best part of your life so i want to know if any of you enjoy work or maybe you dont enjoy what you call work but you enjoy the art you make on the side  for anyone thats interested my ideas about having a meaningful life come from a book called mans search for meaning by victor frankl the author was a psychologist who survived multiple concentration camps in the holocaust finding a will to live even in the bleakest of situations he talks about the meaning of life the book changed my life and i dont doubt that it could change yours  you can look up a free pdf of it,lirw3r

Its that your wage is per hour and not per work.,this is the real problem most of us are assigned jobs that we go to to work x hours for x wages   for example a lumber mill worker goes into work and works his shift for 8 hours if in that time he creates 100 boards ready for sale the day is done and he goes home   now if he is a boardmaking genius or works super hard and makes 200 boards he receives no extra money   if he likewise makes 100 boards in 4 hours he will be told to continue making boards for another 4 hours   it is established that 100 boards per 8 hours is acceptable yet neither if the other two outcomes is deemed a success   the call center employee making 10 dollars an hour is expected to clear 10 calls an hour making the value of the call 100 a piece yet clearing calls faster or better yields no bonus or benefit for working better 80 calls is the expected workday yet the employee clearing 80 calls doesnt get to wrap it up and say okay i did my part and my job  this is why work is so oppressive because we are designed to never be done with our work and can never be satisfied with the work we have done   the worst statement in the modern world if youve got time to lean youve got time to clean  cleaning isnt my job general labor isnt my job being a miscellaneous task robot isnt job making widgets is i have made my widgets and you have made your profit and why cant that just be that,lgynwy

1016,The obsessiveness with productivity and performance,i feel i am at a new breaking point due to facing another and new highly stressful work environment i am in i always try to comply with my coworkers expectations of how they want me to be as i am afraid of getting into verbal dispute confrontations with colleagues who just dont accept no for an answer and keep on accusing and blaming me for having a different opinion than theirs and threatening me that ill lose my job if i continue to let them down for being assertive  i expect a lot of myself and often feel apathetic and harbor subconscious regrets about waiting long to act in an environment that is very competitive and therefore wish i could confidently present myself instead in such surroundings blend in easily and be quick to respond and answer without hesitation and waiting for turns and just stand up for what i believe in as if its no big deal but the stress of negative looks and responses just gets to me that i can hardly breathe normally  the truth is i can no longer bear being mocked humiliated and rivaled with by other workers and being told that i am slow stuckup even weak too soft too modest lacking vigor and impaired in level of professional skills or even timid for processing stimuli deeply and introvertedly and so i am judged as halfhearted and absentminded and unfit to take center of things fearlessly  i feel hurt and upset by the constant commandings and argumentativeness in the workplace and so i have become adjusted to just tolerate it as if numb from seeing how aggressive coworkers successfully dominate colleagues with a more sensitive nature and i therefore feel no inspiration and added value to go to work anymore as i want to do only good unto others and not feel guilty and ashamed anymore for not being able to always do this hence i feel burned out with all this anger boiling inside of me in response to constant unnecessary conflicts at work just because everyone wants to exceed everyone else  i cannot deny how emotionally trapped and remote i feel within as if i am hiding or walking away from work incidents and positions with the highest resistance and the biggest responsibilities despite knowing that only making efforts to contribute is what matters and not how big or small it is or wanting to be in control i wish i could take the front lead without spurting or stammering and handle negative and unfair criticism hostility and rudeness steadily without going red of embarrassment  i feel despicable because i am an open and easygoing person and talk frankly about my shortcomings and honest views and colleagues just seem to take it as a means to manipulate me on it so i get to serve them in whatever they order me to i just dont want to be condescended on when i set my boundaries while it is selfabsorbed to want to escape the every day hassle of social struggles it doesnt mean i am lazy or irresponsible but to face new episodes of mental anguish for being misjudged and not be approved as an equal member of the so maniest company in my career is frightful and humiliating  i feel hesitant and afraid of how to say no sometimes at this stage knowing exactly how my coworkers will argue bluntly why not and act as if not convinced finding me rather odd until i give up and just tell them that they are right i feel aggravated with myself for opting out last minute at times now instead of to continue giving my full potential i just dont want coworkers to push me to do more until i snap and that i might not be able to handle it as they want me to and so i keep dimmed at the background i am tired of the insolences of getting criticized as unsure not showing myself enough not daring enough to take on new initiatives and for saying too little  all the bullying has led me to become so selfconscious when speaking in front of my coworkers that it is nerve breaking and id rather take the day off or work alone without any supervision which also doesnt help in the long run because the lack of connectivity with other colleagues leads me to become aggravated i try to be amongst the firsts to try something new or offer help but may just stand frozen busy with analyzing everything while i am expected to act on the spot  it pains me how not just i but also other people in the workplace face so much strain on their shoulders to always overperform and not being appreciated as valid and worthy real individuals but rather be treated as objects that are replaceable anytime it is traumatizing how stepping up to the wicked ways of any companys policies only worsens the situation because of the hierarchical order of the senior positioned having all the might to have the last word even if it is so nonsensical what it concludes i dont know and understand where such highly egotistical attitudes are leading the nations of the world to but it is worrisome,lfpfci

1023,"Depression, Anxiety, and Passion",it really is sad that this society based around work actually forces us to look down upon ourselves and tricks us into thinking we arent even worthy for the job that we have to get in order to continue living on this beautiful planet we have to be grateful that someone is letting us work we are conditioned to be depressed and get joy out of pleasing our bosses  we live in a society that places far more value on what you do for a living than who you are as a person the garbage man is written off as stupid whereas the suit and tie sitting in a cube for eternity is praised for killing it   society teaches us that not only do we have to work to live but we live to work we must be passionate about our job we must be passionate and eager to throw away our best years on meaningless tasks that benefit the people at the top of the corporation as if that isnt enough we must feel grateful for the opportunity  there are certain professions that one can be passionate about such as healthcare but for the most part passion for work is a fabricated lie we tell ourselves and our employers due to the fear of being let go   how can we be passionate about a job that constantly degrades us into thinking we arent good enough with performance reviews how can we be passionate about something that scolds us for taking days off for being sick or simply just needing a mental health day how can we be passionate about something that will replace us immediately if we run into hard times outside of work that force us to take time off  if you love what you do youll never work a day in your life   really though,lgsq0r

1027,Working In A Warehouse At -7C Degrees (20 Degrees F),so 5 months i started working at a warehouse in germany for a company selling grills and bbq equipment   for a change management is actually relatively friendly and not a pain in the ass all the time  but just like everywhere they dont actually give a sh  yesterday it was 7 c degrees or 20 f outside and today it feels even colder and we have no heating in the warehouse except for office and kitchen well we do actually have radiators installed but for some reason they are not connected by law it needs to be 12 c or 59 f but they dont care the company grosses 50 million a year but apparently cant afford heating  what drives me even more nuts is that some of my colleagues dont even care when i was complaining to one of my colleagues today he said well you can dramatize everything whats wrong with these people  i used to work in london for 5 years in various white and blue collar jobs and worked a year at an irish bar in prague czech republic under really shitty management and one thing i always had in common with my colleagues is that we could always bitch about how much work sucked  but apparently over here people love their slavery   jesus im annoyed,lgo2xu

1085,You Cannot be Anti-Work and a Consumerist,summary you cannot be antiwork while also buying things that force you to work to pay for them the better solution is to unplug from capitalism so you can work as little as possible   i have been lurking this subreddit for awhile now theres a lot of interesting stuff   i joined the sub because my two favorite books are escape everything by robert wringham and the freedom manifesto by tom hodgkinson if you have not read these books stop what youre doing and get them  i read 23 books a month and these two books are the absolute best at questioning how stupid modern society is theyre also hilarious we wake up get dressed and get into a car to go to a place to pay for the clothes car and also the house we just left its all so stupid   but heres the thing  theres two parts to this work is stupid and boring and futile   but so is all the consumerist crap  and it is that consumerist crap that is making you work   new car new clothes newest iphone 15 subscriptions netflix prime cable hulu unlimited data plan takeout every day   it is all bullshit all of it   money can only buy two things  1 consumerist stuffservices or 2 time do you want your money to buy stuff or time if you are antiwork the answer is time and that means not falling for the consumerist trap   if your monthly expenses are 3000 per month you need 18000 to take a six month vacation but if your monthly expenses are 2000 per month that same 18000 gets you nine months off   extrapolate this further and you eventually get to the fireearly retirement movement but that requires a plan and part of that plan is not falling for all the consumerist bullshit   im not going to pretend to be a visionary because others have said this before me including the authors i mentioned but heres the point  you cant quit work if youre also a consumerist it is definitionally impossible   are there systemic issues worth discussing of course predatory lending systemic racism student loans etc  all of it is worthy of discussion   but while you engage in civic debate to right these wrongs you have to focus on your locus of control that means making a plan to escape the rat race and that requires not falling for the consumerist trap   end rant cheers,lcg2bx

1108,There is nothing wrong with not caring about being an ‚Äúintellectual.‚Äù,humanity has always received value from all areas art science literature sports entertainment and especially straight manual labor there are clearly many valuable traits in humans beyond their iq or studiousness roles that were once accepted as a noble part of society are now condescendingly referred to as dead end jobs by outoftouch middle class assholes stripping away any dignity that working class people may feel for their work so theyre already underappreciated by their employers and now they work hard serving people all day only to have their customers think less of them too there is no reason that you cant appreciate your maid as much as your doctor   did people ridicule all the nonintellectuals before modern society and stem got a chokehold on human perception nope because then they wouldve had to ridicule the majority of society nowadays there seems to be this narrative that once youre deemed one of the dumb ones people can go open season on your character and you dont deserve boundaries its even worse with millennials and gen z imo a race to see whos smartest in every single social interaction i blame the toxic hypercompetitive schoolwork environments and the myth of an intellectbased meritocracy being anything but dehumanizing if we really want to reduce the increasing suffering in this world eq matters way more than iq or creating the latest gadget were getting to a point where science and technology are becoming invasive parts of our lives i felt this way as soon as things like amazon alexa came out and no im not a boomer im 21  whats sad is that people just eat it up and think more technology is good no matter what there is no room for nuance as a society we are willingly giving the keys of the future to a bunch of outoftouch privileged techies and hackers and we rationalize it by saying they are geniuses for inventing this tech they deserve to be the ones driving us forward indefinitely never mind that post2000 tech has arguably created more problems than solutions social media was a mistake and the greatest cause of increasing mental health issues if tech was really as flawless as commonly perceived wed be a lot further along in fighting climate change than where we are just starting to truly care on a global level its time to pump the brakes and see if stagnation might actually be a good thing progress for the sake of progress is a path straight to ai taking everyones jobs and with how religiously many worship capitalism and the illusion of meritocracy its hard to imagine the majority agreeing to a postwork society the point of technology is to reduce the amount of work done by humans while improving their livelihoods and yet here we are more tech than ever minicomputers in all of our pockets still working 40 hour weeks like 100 years ago and wages relative to purchasing power and productivity continuing to decrease   not sure how many here have read the war on stupid people but it was an eyeopener for me on how the world is becoming more and more elitist by default there is a certain level of entitlement people in this era seem to have when it comes to disrespecting flat earthers antivaxxers religious people antinatalists autistics socalled losersunderachievers antiworksupporters and anyone else not perfectly in tune with the values of societys outoftouch leaders or smart people people are allowed to believe what they want and each person has their reasons theyre also allowed to be content with lifestyles deemed unsuccessful by the neoliberal masses as long as theyre not harming anyone the false belief in meritocracy is often used to mistreat those perceived to be on the lower end of it a lot of people have stopped playing the game because they see its pointless and putting in more labor than necessary serves the corrupt capitalist system more than the individual in the end better to live frugally and work less than the strive for more status symbols culture that fuels consumerism screw the arbitrary social hierarchy and people who define others by their place on it   as long as theyre not trying to tell you how to live your life or effect public policy you shouldnt ridicule someone for their beliefs no matter how antiintellectual you perceive them to be being an intrusive nitpicky asshole who wants to suck them into debates and try to make them look stupid doesnt accomplish anything and just makes people want to avoid you,lcbagp

1112,The more I consider what laziness is the less insulting it sounds,for context ive been noticing more and more how lazy and laziness are often used in an insulting way but ive never felt ashamed of being lazy and i dont think anyone really should   a lot of people view laziness as a negative of a persons personality when its just the opposite of the desire to work we cant work forever at all times without literally dying so everyone is inevitably lazy at some point but we cant be lazy forever either for the same reason at some point well have to put in some sort of effort to accomplish some task like making breakfast or reading a book whatever makes us feel good because we want to this obviously doesnt work in a capitalist society though and so in choosing to follow our desires in what work we wish to do it is labeled lazy and unproductive its a demonization of people who dont make money and its an immoral way of disrespecting another persons use of energy and time this is why i just cant see laziness as a negative trait anymore its like putting someone down for their expression of free will   i know in posting here im going to get a biased response but this is just something thats been on my mind for a while and id love to hear from people who feel similarly i also know that opinions like this and this sub in general are often viewed as entitled but if someone sees taking control of their time and energy as entitled then honestly what a miserable life they must live,lces1k

1125,Dear antiwork community: how does a disenfranchised young adult with only a small amount of savings escape the work world?,for context i need to quit my job stat my mental health is deteriorating because of it i cant do this job im having a breakdown right now at work and i want to just walk away   for some context i work at a lumber mill in rural montana i commute 2 hours total in a day to get there and get paid 16 an hour with no benefits yet ive worked here for 3 months  im so pissed the company just went bankrupt two years ago and was bought out by another company to assume all their assets the place is a massive dump dirty disorganized generally chaotic and grimy their equipment doesnt work properly because the boss doesnt prioritize proper maintenance and because machines are falling apart that means orders are way behind so naturally the boss is stressing us out by putting insane amounts of pressure on his two production employees me and another guy to run 4  massive machines that are constantly breaking down with unrealistic deadlines not to mention each machine should have two dedicated employees and a maintenance employee   im not happy here and its deteriorating my mental health significantly   the company is on the verge of going bankrupt again and i want to get out   i feel like i might be in an irrational state right now but its triggered by the shitty conditions here at work   they treat their employees and customers like shit the boss literally told me that im expected to do overtime and stay late frequently hes pressuring me into not taking two 10 minute breaks and a full 30 minute break which im told is just a hard work culture my coworker simply doesnt take breaks if there is too much to do im exhausted mentally and physically at the end of every day   my question to you is how can i immediately leave and opt out of the work world i want to make art grow food and spend time with the people i care about but there is this constant gap between saving and paying bills groceries and gas that i cant seem to save enough to make it for a short season before i can start staying home and making food and starting my own business   what has worked for you is there anything legally i can pursue for compensation for unsafe conditions and pressure to buy into the company dreams idk i just feel stuck in this and would love any and all insight,lbsjq4

1130,Any advice for coping with 50 years of hell?,hi everyone  i started working two months ago and this is my first job apart from a year long training contract which was also a fulltime job but as i now realize much easier as a newcomer to hell i have three particular issues that i cant quite comprehend and need advice on  first things first i am totally antiwork i just want to be free and lazy all day and dont care about the rest like what would happen to world if no one works but i am also a realist so i know that i will spend 45 years of my life as a modern slave  now here are my three issues  1 does anyone have any advice on how to comprehend that life is work its been two monts and i am already burnt out and seriously my mind simply cannot comprehend that i will be working 4060 hours weekly for the next 4550 years i am just not cabaple to digest this i mean i am 25 and now it is expected from me to work nearly twice as more than ive lived so far any advice about this would be appreciated 2 there is nothing to striveexpect for in school or uni you have long breaks which are also the source of motivation you carry on with shitty assignments and allnighters by knowing that there is a longrest at the end however when you are working there is nothing weekends and 2week annual leaves are jokes nothing more it is just time for you to spend more and do some chores so all you have is work for 45 years i cannot become so miserable that i would be passionate about weekends or fake annual leaves but i also need something that i can look forward to any ideas what that could be 3 my job seriously screws me up it is so demanding that you have to be analytical think critically etc all the time i fail all the time i am not smart enough in fact i am fucking stupid and stress about me failing at work even when i am not working  and my parents spend their wealth on providing me good education so i cannot switch to a lessdemanding job any advice on how to cope with this stress  this has become a long post and i am sorry about that but id really appreaciate any comments  thank you all,lcr4a0

1150,Found out my work cancelled the employee rewards program..., more than a fucking year ago without fucking telling me   we used to accrue points at a rate of one point per hour worked per year of service without a serious safety incident lost time injury and redeem them on random stuff from a website rewards included stuff like camping gear golf clubs electronics kitchen gear etc a lot of the cheaper things were just trash but you could get decent stuff after a while  last time id checked i was sitting around 35000 points approaching the bottom end of stuff id actually consider  for context we could also get fire retardant coveralls for about 15000 points and the same ones are available for employees to purchase for about 130 so at the time i wouldve been sitting at a gift worth around 300 and probably closer to 400 today if theyd kept accruing  objectively speaking not really all that significant but still more meaningful than getting an atta boy and a company branded ball cap    and the fuckers took it away as a cost saving measure and did it sneakily to prevent those of us whod been saving up from cashing out,lbyh0m
1151,Capitalism and the automation of the work force. The realistic reasons we will need to tax the rich and implement UBI.,we need to tax the productivity produced by workers or machines heres why  when a worker produces something money goes three places first it goes to the owners who then pay some money to the worker who produced it and finally the worker pays taxes to the government to keep society functioning  the problem with this model is the removal of the worker from the equation through automation we all see it things that should be reducing the workload on all of us and making life better are instead being used to throw workers in the street and put more pressure on everyone when production is automated and the worker is removed the owner gets to pocket all of the money and none goes to the worker or the government  so when the rich dont have to pay taxes thanks to their boughtandpaidfor politicians and the workers arent paying taxes because they have no income who funds the services that keep america alive roads education emergency services the rich from the kindness of their sweatshopowning hearts  as less and less work becomes available to people due to automation which should be a good thing less and less money is going to the citizens and even fuck you got mine people will dislike that because hey gdp relies on citizens spending our money and even after that the government is receiving less in taxes to keep society together  so what do ubi is what do  when people against ubi imagine it they see it as a money in money out problem between citizens and the government  people receive money lazy people stop working income tax dries up and the government has no income   this is not how ubi would be implemented  first its important to understand the money in money out problem is already underway fewer people have income as jobs dry up so less money goes to the government in taxes   ubi would involve the government directly taxing the capital then paying to the citizens what we lose from the elimination of jobs and cutting labor costs  the ubi would likely not be enough to survive on alone however it would provide security and reduce the amount of work needed by one person to survive by reducing the number of work units each person needs to survive we would have enough jobs for everyone because what constitutes one job now could become two under the new system  the same amount of work gets done but everyone gets to eat  whats more elimination of jobs would be good for society because as jobs become fewer the money saved there increases the ubi if we ever reached a point no one had to work the ubi would still deliver to us the same amount of money as if we had been producing by hand and making wages  tldr tax the productivty and distribute ubi to make up for job losses due to automation ensure citizens owners and government each get a slice or it all goes to shit,lbsmpn
1152,Had my first group interview today...,and i could only describe it as the most dystopian thing ive ever had happen to me  so the group interview is what it sounds like there were four applicants and we all sat in the same room and the interviewer would do popcorn questions for each of us group consisted of 3 young guys and a middle aged man  i was a one of the 3 young guys i have experience with public speaking and its no problem for me and i react fairly well to questions im not prepared for so the actual interview wasnt a problem but it freaked me out as we went along and learned more about the other applicants  so the vast majority of people do not react well to being put on the spot in a group of strangers hell im only decent at it because my time in the military forced me to and the middle aged gentleman struggled a bit with it i dont want to give away too much info but the man was asked the question if you could have any super power what would it be he struggled a bit and finally decided on the power to take any pain away from my children if they have any from my divorce  and i realized i absolutely hated this kind of interview i really hope that guy gets the job  tldr  a group of poor downtrodden people have to 1up each other so they can get money for food,lc4dhq

know what must be done and why it must be done we can finally focus on how we can start to do it this society is contingent upon a few axioms  1 the axiom of choicefree association if someone decides to join this society its completely a free choice of theirs  this axiom means that we have to locate this society in a place that has little to no current population this also means that people born in this society must retain the citizenship of the parents and that there will be no native citizens of the society  2 the axiom of explicitness there are no agreements that have not been made explicitly clear  this axiom means that any social contracts are actual contracts signed by all whom they pertain to  3 the axiom of selfreliance all basic necessities for the whole population must be provided by production in the society  were this not to be the case then foreign powers would hold the real power  these axioms when they interact limit the scope of possibilities to several lightly to uninhabited locations because of axiom 1 that are either geothermal active or near a geothermal hotspotbecause of axiom 3 applied to energy when mapping all the remaining locations out this is what

1200,I don't know where else to post this but don't you hate it when people automatically assume that you are a worthless piece of shit because you're down and out on your luck in your late twenties?,i am 29 years old and i made a post in the relationship sub reddit just to vent about how my own family has been treating me and how ive been letting them treat me because i still care about them  i was talking about how my two sisters that i pay rent to to live with treat me like utter crap and some folks said youre almost 30 you are an adult they dont have an obligation to take care of you you should have had your shit together a long time ago i know im an adult tell me something i dont know the point of the post was to talk about the pain i was feeling from mistreatment from my own family but all they could pay attention to was the fact i was almost 30 and living with my sisters who are in their 40s and they dont take care of me i feed and clothe myself and i pay them rent just because they let me sleep on the living room floor doesnt mean im some incompetent child that they take care of  what does age have to do with the fact that most housing these days isnt affordable for most folks regardless of age most folks are one paycheck away from being homeless i live in los angeles ca and 1850 an hour is still not enough to live out here the average rent here is 2700  my own sisters used this if you live under someone elses roof then you are a piece of shit who doesnt deserve respect too but ironically what they are forgetting is that technically they are living under someone elses roof too the landlords so they should show more sympathy because if they were to loose their job tomorrow the landlord wouldnt give a shit and theyd be in the same position im in housing belongs to no one really but to the banks so i hate when people say oh you arent an independent person because you live under my roof so therefore i should treat you like a child but what would truly make someone independent is to have your own shelter without worrying about about loosing it to some corporation because you lost your job or couldnt pay the rent,lb9vm1

typical bullshit where we wear unnecessary masks just to keep everyone else happy in their illusion of freedom i was working at home i have a bullshit office job that is certainly not essential by any means which makes it worse going daybyday and blocking out all of the apocalyptic media about the virus just to cope and enjoy the breakthe clear skies the halt of pollution you know the ideal slower world we probably should live in anyway id crack a white claw at 300pm listen to podcasts while working on spreadsheets or whatever pointless tasks my job wanted me to do which seemed to change weekbyweek as our executive folks tried to keep everyone busy whatever the fuck thats supposed to mean and just relax on the couch doing work while lounging not too bad right  a few months in i realized that every single day during the pandemic i was dying inside a little bit more have you seen office space like when peter gibbons tells the hypnotherapist every day he works is the worst day of his lifewow thats messed up i missed playing shows with my bandthe catharsis the relief of playing something musically intense and extreme that could connect to other people and release the intensity and rage i feel when i think about the extreme inequality of the world injustice and victimization of billions so a couple of pieces of shit who are convinced they are saving the world fuck off can get richer i play in punk and metal bands loud fast pissed and intenseits wonderful and incredibly good for my mental health to get all of my negativity out in performance which in turn essentially turns the seemingly infinite negative energy i have into community and appreciation of one anothers art its a beautiful beautiful weird fucking community and i miss it so much  but it was silent there was no intensity anymore just silence every single day my significant other who is a wonderful woman and incredibly patient with me would watch her endless stream of television shows i couldnt enjoy any of them during the george floyd protests i turned off my social media sickened by all of the wellintentioned but annoying egoistic posturing of white people i actually like but were performing like they were martyrs its not about you people its about justice and ending racismnot posting on social media i was so so so tired of it all a fragmented pandemic response endless police brutality structural racism endless brutal inequality im reminded of every time i go to the gas station to buy beer living in 2020 united states is like living in a god damn developing country despite the fact we have the most wealth in the entire history of the world of course most of that is hoarded in offshore accounts to avoid taxes ugh  my partner and i bought a super nice house in june in the height of the pandemicgreat price and interest rate capitalism rules all fucking apparently due to the viral apocalypse going on around usand we moved in once we were in i found myself just retreating to sitting outside drinking beers smoking cigarettes and listening to podcasts just like i did during the pandemic what else was i going to do i couldnt go to shows i couldnt play shows i couldnt go out of town to watch wrestling my cult obsession dont knock it til you try it aew and njpw are fantastic i couldnt just go to a bar for no reason remember when you could just go to a bar for no reason bars were open but im not trying to become a carrier and kill my dad who essentially has every preexisting risk for covid complications  so this is what i do nowi work a pointless fucking administrative job that is certainly not essential four days in a week in my office one day midweek at home some bizarre semiworkfromhome fantasy that assumes we are somehow reducing everyones risk by doing this one day a week whatever mangoing to enjoy it but sounds like a load of bootlicking administrative bullshit every single day i feel completely dead inside there just feels like theres nothing left i used to love the rush of live musicwhether aggressive fast slow sad happywhateverit made me feel alive the only joy i get is band practice and fortunately i do have two bands and great guys and their partners to socialize with which is probably the only thing keeping me from losing it i drink as much as possible with them and listen to metal and punk to get the negative energy out  while its fun i long for the days where i can share the music we play and energy live with other people i feel like my soul is rotting from the inside out and all thats left is a guy trying to bury his feelings with booze cigarettes endless podcasts so so tired of looking at fucking screens and the occasional pro wrestling event on my tv that gives me a little shot of dopamine to keep me alive enough to wake up tomorrow and do it all over again  i know this isnt a permanent condition fucking hopefully but jesus fucking christ how does anyone want to live in this world whats the fucking point endless exploitation and no time for joy and people have the nerve to tell me to do yoga and meditate what a fucking joke i would never ever do it but i understand why people want to kill

1283,"Anyone else have a ""good"" job that's just... not worth it?",ive been working onoff since i was 14 but for the most part i was always stuck with shit jobs washing dishes sweeping floors cleaning bathrooms all the starter jobs youre expected to take at a young age  now im 19 and on paper i have a charmed life i moved out of my parents house at 17 and have been living on my own since then last year i got my first real job and upgraded from a shoebox studio apartment to a more luxurious 1bedroom  the only reason im able to have all of my freedoms though is because i just never stop working i show up every day sit in front of a computer for 7 hours then go about my merry way even though i rarely do more than the bare minimum i sit there and put in the hours so i can pay rent at the end of the month it sucks  but heres the thing its a good job  like aside from the fact that i have to be there there arent many problems with it the work is simple enough my coworkers are all great i get paid well there are endless reasons for me to keep my job plus i work for a nonprofit organization meaning that i feel rewarded for doing at least some good for my community  but regardless of all the benefits or the friendly atmosphere i dont want to be there because of 2 things  1 i just dont want to work 2 the guilt that results from that  theres just something about the daily grindroutine that exhausts me to no end getting up and doing the same thing every day rarely having enough time or energy to pursue any hobbies outside of tv and video games living paycheck to paycheck because even though you get paid more than enough you spend it all on takeout booze and drugs just to trick your brain into thinking life is worth it at the end of the day  that feeling fucking sucks i hate feeling like im caught in an endless loop and so ive just lost interest in the work i work remotely so its not like my boss can waltz into my apartment to see if im on task so 90 of the time im getting high and browsing twitter or watching a youtube video or making frustrated posts like this  and of course that makes me feel guilty if i were working almost anywhere else it wouldnt be a problem if i slacked off as a frycook or a busboy the worst thing that would happen is my boss would lose some money if i slacked off at a call center the worst thing that would happen is id get yelled at a little  but now its different when i slack off and try to enjoy myself i just cant because i know i could be doing some actual good i could be helping out my teammates who are very clearly overworked all the time i could be volunteering for a more important part of the job that would take up more of my time but no the only thing that feels right to me is sitting on the couch and procrastinating and on top of all of that i know theres some kid down the street who works 1000x harder than me and gets paid less and that makes me feel like shit  so what am i supposed to do i cant quit because ill get evicted and have to move back in with my parents i cant continue to slack off because eventually the guilt will build up too much or ill get fired and i cant actually start working hard because ill probably fucking kill myself after a month of real intense work  why do i even have to be in this position in the first place,laxlol
1284,Intuitively Abolishing Work,hello all since the last time crohns diseasehttpsenwikipediaorgwikicrohn27sdisease nearly killed me in dec 2017 ive been working on a way to abolish work in a stupidly simple way out of necessity sorry for the wallotext abolishing work while easy is still complex  tldr creating a crazy video game via voluntary global collaboration  in 2016 crohns rendered me bedridden had to stop attending helicopter school all my previous work experience became useless with no money being bedridden just returning home from emergency surgery after a week in the hospital on iv antibiotics i needed a way to live a life i could be proud of  thus began project universehttpsshaostoulcoms closed development on 24 dec 2017 on 29 january 2019 freely open community development beganhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvaf6z4puacse  historical context   in 1992 i began gaming on the nes with the marioduck hunt combo cartridge  in 1994 i began teaching myself game developmentmodding with a few different games on my dads amiga 500 amp 4000  in 2006 i began teaching game devmodding as a fun international hobby  in 2014 i began moddingteaching it for space engineershttpssteamcommunitycomidshaostoulmyworkshopfilesappid244850ampp1ampnumperpage30  in 2018 i spoke at emerald city comic con about the benefits of video game modding on individuals communities amp developershttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqpb8ttziia with fellow space engineers modders  essentially im a huge nerd that loves video games more than most with the community knowledge amp resources gained from my history were creating a free spaceready opensource school disguised as a scifi video game through it were preparing humanity for our future as a united interplanetary civilization  from 2017 to late 2019 i couldnt use my computer without crohns symptoms worsening so i spent most of my time rampding the plan from my cellphone in oct 2019 we received a 30000 donation which paid for a powered adjustable bed frame super soft bed amp cheap 55 tv allowing me to safely use my computer in bed in nov 2020 we submitted project universehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjo1ce2vckr0 to the unity for humanity programhttpsunitycomhumanity  today development is going well thanks to a growing team of volunteers from across the globe you can meet most of them in our discordhttpsdiscordgg9xxmmeqnwc every volunteer submits an application as an introduction to the team amp as an agreement to a 2000month salary for 10ish hours of workweek plus benefits as soon as our teamwork makes it happen at least until humanity transitions to a unified decentralized form of selfgovernment without a pyramid scheme leadership  funding comes from multiple sources   crowdfunding via patreonhttpswwwpatreoncomshaostoul until our account system is operational is the best way of accelerating development every penny goes to project universe no  cut for venture capitalistsseed investorsbank loansetc  investors ideally provide at minimum 300000 for 1 year of dev with 10 essential devs every 30000 is another dev for 1 year this is the least preferred method as investors require a  cut which prevents me from hiring more community members  selffunding is our primary method of permanent funding once the game is sufficiently operational amp the community is large enough project universe consists of 3 components the game school amp virtual mall the mall is filled with business affiliateshttpsshaostoulcompartners providing tracking links  the mall is the best method of funding as it indefinitely funds development without having to charge users for access to the gameschoolmall players purchase productsservices from irl businesses ingame at touchscreen kiosks in a centralized area linked to via affiliate tracking links think of it as orgrimmar with irl businesses amp ingame shops  currently we nearly have everything required for development from today to release most of the software is free for the stuff that isnt crowdfunding covers what it can ie the website amp dev tools like substance painter hardware wise we use playfabhttpsplayfabcom for the base account system spatialoshttpswwwimprobableiomultiplayernetworking for mmo stuff a community member is providing a dedicated server amp so forth  all we need now is help increasing global advocacy as it exponentially accelerates development a larger community  more volunteers  faster dev  more funding  more business partners its one hell of a pushtostart infinitely scalable positive feedback loophttpsenwikipediaorgwikipositivefeedback additionally a larger community makes it easier for us to work with governments to get the school accepted globally with starlinkhttpswwwstarlinkcom bringing global internet access were able to bring highquality education to even the most remote places interplanetary latency is a problem until we have a ftl method of communication  but shaostoul how does it abolish work  humanity has a knack for over complicating things amp being frustratingly stubborn when it comes to change ie if it aint broke dont fix it but we can see where that got us  fortunately were not doing it alone ai by itself is ending most jobs some requires streamlining our way of life unifying humanity takes care of a bunch many businesses are creating solutions to problems project universe doesnt need to solve were just connecting it all together through a video game  the school teaches irl skills through gameplay with ai ar amp vr its capable of teaching anyone anything anywhere on amp off earth with an applicable smart device console pc tv etc the account system records what you learn never fill out a resume ever again amp the game keeps that knowledge fresh by forcing you to use it for gameplay ie learn welding ingame to weld doors shut to block hostile aliens once youre good enough ingame you qualify for a drastically shortened irl apprenticeship  with aiarvrrobotics many jobs are permanently disappearing leading to increased permanent unemployment however we still want to teach people amp keep those skills fresh for when humanity begins colonizing space in 2024 amp beyond think of the ai as your best friend doctor guide teacher mentor etc should you find yourself completely isolated because of an accident leaving you trapped on mars with help 6 months away the ai can help you buildfix everything  the game combats cabin fever provides social interaction gives a virtual testing ground for designing irl spacecrafthabitats maintaining maximum morale etc  instead of hiring everyone well be building freetolivein selfsufficient housing complexes with onsite aquaponics hospital 3d printers waste disposal recycling entertainment solarwindhydro gen etc  alright i could continue writing about project universe for a long time any questions so far  im working on new videos to succinctly describe every aspect im still bedridden amp if i use my computer long enough crohns symptoms returnworsen as a result i have to take things slow so i dont almost die again  i live in kitsap county wa usa im in the pacific time zone im typically active from noon to midnight working on project universe in some way youre free to message me any time you never have to ask permission to speak with me ill respond asap
