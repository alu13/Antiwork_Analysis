2,Recently discovered the anti-work ideal. Need some advice and information on viable alternatives to the current capitalist system that is in alignment with anti-work.,"In a nutshell I can list a few reasons why I feel drawn to the anti-work ideal.  
  
1. The majority of work available is meaningless to people and ultimately these jobs serve the interests of already rich capitalists and seek to preserve a failing economy while destroying our planet and unfairly distributing wealth.  
2. Most work is underpaid in comparison to living costs.  
3. Everything is overpriced.
4. I've always believed people work too much anyway and that we should have much, much more leisure time.  
    
So what in your opinion is the best alternative to the current system? Where could we go from here as a society? How does one incorporate the anti-work way of living into their lives?  
    
There will always be work that needs to be done, that is obvious. It's the quality and type of work that is important. I would like it if people were more able to do work which is in alignment with their passions instead of being forced to submit to endless days of drudgery just to survive. I actually want to work, I just don't want a meaningless job.
