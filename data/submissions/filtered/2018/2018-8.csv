1,“Jobs” are just more debt that banks use to profiteer from!,fiat currency and the way the elite banks corporations actually turn profits from debt are relatively well known concepts these days    i m fairly certain at this point that whatever word magic was used to create the whole system also now applies to jobs    even supposed  well paying  jobs  careers tm  as they re referred to in the king s english  don t actually create or produce anything of value and rarely fulfill a purpose with any measurable result     jobs  basically exist nowadays as a column in a spreadsheet that accountants use only as a means to derive profit  think interest  bonds  investments     ,98l95u
2,"I want to quit the corporate life, but feel awful about it.",hi all  as you can see in my post history  i ve written a lot about my unhappiness in my current job  i ve done everything i can the past month or so to look for a new job in a different field  something that would suit me better  yet haven t landed anything    i can t help but feel jaded with the whole process at this point  of dealing with corporations  and being tied to them to be able to survive  i don t want a cushy corporate job anymore  i know this for a fact  however  i d feel awful about quitting it because of my father payed for almost 90  of my college degree  it was a very expensive  degree  too  and i m very lucky he supported me in it  so i feel very conflicted about this issue  i know what kind of a lifestyle i d like to pursue  continuing with my side gig of serving and possibly dancing  as well as starting work as a nanny  and i know i could make good money with these pursuits  but guilt holds me back from doing it    guilt for not adhering to a  business woman  stereotype like my dear father always wanted me to be  guilt because he paid and sacrificed so much to get me through college  guilt because he wants me to be stable but i hate the  stable  9-5 life and i m already disappointing him by not adhering to my former religion  i want to give back to my father and mother and make them happy but i feel this would be taking it a step too far  especially seeing i m from a traditional work-oriented background  does anyone have any advice for me ,98wj7t

10,So what do we do about it?,just found this sub  love it  but all of the posts i see are just propagating discussion over the problem   my question is what do we do about it  everyone's situation and goals are different so i'm not looking for a one size fits all answer  the world is the way it is  i suppose we could start a movement  but don't expect our culture to change in our lifetime  a good amount of jobs out there have to get done or the infrastructure we live in will crumble  i e   someone's got to do it  but that someone can be some other brainwashed worked who thrives on exchanging his best years for a wage   still though - if you have no job  you've got no income  how then do you continue your way of life  or  how do you alter it to be sustainable   there are groups like  r financialindependence and  r simpleliving out there that discuss their own strategies  but financial independence entails hustling and grinding for a good 15  years before you can live off of your savings and simple living may or may not be the answer depending on where you live and your situation  and you could very well not be interested in either as a solution to our  anti-work  predicament   so then  what do you do  let's talk about it ,982jpd

12,The reason why I'm so passionate about separating work from life.,hi guys  i joined this sub a little while ago and have really been loving it so far  i wanted to get a little personal with you all about the reason why i'm even here and why i have the views and attitude that i do towards jobs   just to give you folks a little background  i am a 20 year old junior in college who believes that a job is absolutely nothing more than just a method of making money  it is not your life  it is not what defines you  and it does not set your worth    basically from the time i was born up to when i was 17 years old  i was a very all around joyous guy  i just loved life  ask anybody and they'll tell you   john  my name  you're always smiling    john i love how much you laugh   john everytime i see you  you just make me feel better   john you're always so happy   honestly  i really was just a happy guy  if i ever did get sad about something  i'd get over it in literal minutes  life was just full of light     note  this next section i'm about to share with you all is something i never talk about b c i like to act as if just never happened due to how traumatizing it is  but for the sake of this post  i'll share some of the details    but  when i turned 18 years old  everything started to become dark  everything   the main reason for this is that i got my first  big boy  job  that label is such bullshit btw  a job is a job  and thought this was a huge accomplishment in life  i thought i was on my way to  making it  in life because i got a better paying job  as a result  i based all of my happiness on this job and saw it as who i was  that's the norm in society anyway  i was finally able to  fit in   go me  this job was everything to me i saw my co-workers as my friends  i could  trust them   the supervisor was always right too  nobody should dare to question her  she  cared  about me because i was a  proud employee   well  every single time i went home i let everything that happened at that job get to me  i was no longer john  i was employee      i thankfully forgot that cursed number  my co-workers who i thought were my friends all started to talk behind my back and just see me as another pair of hands  not john   and you know what they were right  whoever that person was  that was not me  i sacrificied my life to a job thinking that this was it and that work always came first  no matter what   and no matter how well i tried to do  the  higher-ups  at that job always found something to scold me about  i became depressed for the first time in my life  the guy who was notorious for constantly smiling and lifting up people around him was now having increasingly darker  amp  darker thoughts until they became suicidal  i felt worthless  at that job i was nothing  and outside of it i had no life  my life was the job  i had stopped loving my passions and the things that used to hold real value  i just felt empty  all of the time  at the time i didn't understand why  i just thought this was  growing up  and i should be proud that i was so devoted to that job    what a fucking fool i was   it wasn't until that same supervisor i  loved  terminated me after i worked there for a year  because i called in due to a severe stomach ache  that i finally opened my eyes  it's a day i'll never forget  july 15th 2017  that's when i started the process of becoming myself again   i used to get terrified at the thought of losing that job  yet when it happened  i felt fine  i felt perfectly fine  as each day passed  i felt happier  and happier  and happier  until i finally realized that feeling i constantly had before july 15th was depression  the real deal   the thing that i thought would never happen to me  when i fully realized what had happened to me  i sat down and just thought very hard  thought about the true cause of it  and how to never lose myself like that again    the biggest revelation i came to was that a job is not my life  it's not who i am  my life is literally everything outside of that place  i rediscovered my passions  my values  and who i am  i became myself again   and stopped letting a place i'm only at to make money actually have any meaningful  control over my life  i stopped putting any real emotions and care into jobs and everybody there  because to them  i'm just a tool  they'd never admit it  but i don't care if they do or not b c i know the truth   it was these realizations that i made that saved my life and allowed me to become myself again  it's been over a year since this has happened and everything is still awesome   the job i've worked since then has had absolutely no effect on me b c of what i just mentioned   i learned to revolve my life around my life  and not some hellhole i don't even be at in the first place   i get my money and go  because i've got a life to live       ,98z8mi
13,What would you do if you really didn't have to work anymore?,i'm asking here because i think that you all have probably thought about this way more than i have  and my life is kind of in a tail spin right now   i'm early forties and i don't have to work  i was let go from my job last year due to the department closing  but i was encouraged to come back as a fill in at the main hospital  i decided that i am too old to be working a mix of nights and days  full time some weeks no time others and at the whim of everyone else   i had always made about 3 times what my husband made  so my working was essential to having a fair to good standard of living  but due to wage stagnant in my profession and a huge raise for him over the past few years he now makes enough to cover the necessities   his job is something that he would do even if he didn't get paid  he just loves it even on the hard days  mine was a sacrifice i made to get the money i wanted  so we decided that i don't have to work if i don't want to   i don't know what to do with myself anymore  i didn't realize how much of my self worth was tied to my job  i see every help wanted sign as a prod to be productive  but the wages offered are an insult   what reading material  podcast  youtube channel or whatever can you recommend to change my perspective  i need a wake up call that says  stop feeling sorry for yourself and take advantage of this rare and wonderful opportunity   sorry if this sounds all humble braggy or insults people still stuck in the struggle  but i did work hard for many years and if i didn't have an equal partner with whom i have always shared everything i would not be in this position  i know how lucky i am  ,983my2

17,Just had a great vacation,seriously  not that i traveled anywhere and stuff  just went home to my folks and my good friends  earlier summers i've had some work days here and there and no uninterrupted vacations  this time my horizon just consisted of time that i could spend doing whatever  for the first time since i was much younger  and that's what i've done--socializing  went to some hikes in my area  helped my friend moving some shit after a social event  fishing in the ocean and just gave it away to people who wanted it  i've been pretty poor due to my vacation but i've been spending very little money   man  vacations are really awesome  i've never felt healthier  more complete  more emotionally secure  i've been sleeping like baby  active  creative  more sure of my identity and had better and more fulfilling connections with people  i've come to realize that capitalism actually robs workers of this natural vitality and turns it into profit  leaving us sick  damaged and miserable  seriously  extracting profit from our health  why should it be considered a vice to demand more leisure  i thought the whole point of technology was to give us more free time to just be human beings  we seriously need to fight for its abolition as soon as possible  so that living  loving  hoping  dreaming  feeling human hearts all over the world don't have to be churned through this alienating grinder   sorry  just found this sub and felt like sharing this rant  i hope it's appropriate ,93zsgj
