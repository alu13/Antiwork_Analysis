0,People just don't understand when you tell them you dont want to work your life away.,from being told you're a lazy freeloader  to  what'll you do if you dont work      i just want to live on a homestead  and not have to work years on end before i can finally have the opportunity to do what i want       it seems this sub is the only place people actually understand ,fbnvmb

5,The boss that pushed me over the edge,hit your bowl and grab a snack  this is lengthy    i've always been vaguely aware of my exploitation  and  until now  have been able to grin and bear it  not anymore    my degree is in the arts  after college  i took a few office admin jobs to pay the bills  and i was good  i was a busy little worker bee that seldom complained  worked diligently  met deadlines  and always took initiative  i was quite proud of my work ethic  but not a fan of the work  it was dull-- and i felt like i was paid too little to do so much nothing  if that makes sense    when i got sick  i had to find an alternative to the office day job  i spent too many breaks puking in the office bathroom   i was able to find remote work through a staffing company that was offering much more than i currently made  it was contract work  but i was sure that the pros of working from home would outweigh the cons of paying self-employment taxes   this is not a story about the horrors of gig work-- s can talk about that later   eventually  after a couple months of working with this staffing company  they offered me a contract with their top client  it was an executive assistant role  and the client had enough money to pay top dollar  they told me  however  i had to complete a few weeks of work at a training rate with this client before we could renegotiate a rate    well  during my first month of working with this client  while i am supposed to be training  he disappeared for a road trip on the other side of the planet  he spent the month traveling by motorbike  staying in expensive hotels and resorts  and eating exotic food   this was all billed as a business expense somehow   i was put through the ringer during this month  he would slack whatsapp me outside of my working hours  on one occasion  he called me  noticeably drunk  on a day i had requested off because i had family visiting  to give me a time sensitive task  when i told him that i would be taking the following day off to make up for the lost time  he proceeded to slack call me on that day as well    he gave me a slew of impossible tasks  and never seemed to be aware of the lengths i had to go to to make them possible    for example  he asked me to order his mother's day flowers for him-- at 9pm the evening before mother's day  to top it all off  he scolded me for not  shopping local  when he found out i had ordered from 1-800-flowers-- the only florist that would take my order with the expectation of same day delivery    ok  fucking ridiculous  i complain to the staffing company  they tell me that sometimes  busy executive types  don't understand the work that has to go into making these things a reality  nice non-answer  despite my better judgement  i forge ahead    he begins to ask crazy tasks of me-- to order flowers for a stranger in switzerland  to call a ferryman in azerbaijan  to check on a rural road closure in turkmenistan  i speak none of these languages  have no contact info provided by him   and have to purchase skype minutes for all of these overseas phone calls  something that was not in my contract  to top it off  i was given about  6-10 hour turnaround times for the bulk of these tasks  and  miraculously  i made them happen    i contact the staffing company again  this is getting out of hand  and i tell them that i'm going to ask for a high hourly rate  don't worry  they say  it will be better when he's not traveling   um  i manage his calendar  i can see that he's nearly always traveling   so he gets back from his trip  and he and the staffing company negotiate my rate  and come back to me with a number that is significantly-- significantly-- lower than i asked for  reasoning that i have proven to be a good personal assistant  but i haven't done anything to establish myself as an executive assistant    again  against my better judgment  and with loved ones begging me to quit  i forged ahead  i put an emphasis on getting involved in my client's business  but the bulk of my portfolio was still personal assistance  and the unwieldy demands with zero appreciation continued    it was during this time that i started to notice my enthusiasm for work slipping dramatically  i quarter-assed everything i did  and i didn't give a single shit  the busy little worker bee was no more  he crushed her    on a particularly bad week  i was loaded up with projects  i wasn't making any headway with these dead-end projects  my client was not completing tasks on time  even after i implemented a new system  and i was getting an earful from project managers and the staffing company    so  fuck it  this job isn't going anywhere  and it's clear to me that the staffing company cares more about keeping this guy as a client than actually offering me any support  my contract doesn't require me to give two weeks notice  but i do anyway   to which the staffing company referred as  dropping a bombshell  excuse me  i've been complaining about this client for months    i explain to the client that i'll finish up the projects i'm working on  but i won't be taking on any new projects  guess what he does right away  yes  gives me another project  i put it on the to-do list  say yessir  and i don't touch it  fuck you   the story ends with me giving him a half-assed  i need medical leave  in my exit interview  it's true  but i don't tell him that the leave is to recuperate from severe depression after months of his abuse  not worth it  fuck you  goodbye forever    months  it takes me literal months to find passion for life again  and i felt completely robbed of any sense of a work ethic  which uses to be a huge part of my personality  i found myself bungling and half-assing jobs i actually did care about  it wasn't until i had the chance to step into a role in the arts-- the job i went to school for-- that i found the person he killed again  aha  my life had purpose once again    i feel forever changed  i'll never be able to look at work or bosses the same way again  and it astounds me that so many americans are living their lives that way  feeling unappreciated and alienated from their labor  and continuing on like that for years  how   when i was debating whether or not to quit  i came up with this metric    a job can offer you three things  compensation  satisfaction  and ease  a job should at least offer you enough of one to compensate for a lack of the other two  if it lacks in all three  it is time to quit   p s  i have it on good authority that his new assistant makes the same complaints i made  some people never learn    tl dr my shitty boss's outrageous demands zapped me of any work ethic i had  the staffing company that placed me only cares about keeping him as a client  work culture fucking sucks  quit your job and smoke more weed ,f9rk8s

7,"Venting, venting, venting...",i am beyond mad  i just drove for over half a day and spent a week working full-time for a fairly well-known animal rights organization  to hell with it  it s peta  and was basically given the boot  it was a  working interview  as they like to call it  they provided me with food  during my stay  and a house to sleep in  but that s it  i had to pay for transportation and anywhere i stayed between travels    i did the assignments they gave me and interviewed with the higher-ups  but i had a bad feeling as soon as i left  i emailed my  boss  in a joking manner  basically explaining how i felt and trying to determine whether or not they were willing to train me for the job in spite of my  shortcomings  and they said it sounded like i was withdrawing my application and that i should continue to support them and to keep looking  and they even had the audacity to say that the application process was an investment for them as much as it was for me  i m not the one who invited me to do the interview and wasted my time and money  i was just stupid enough to think that anything would come of it  i replied back to the  boss  saying that i wasn t withdrawing  but essentially that if they can t see my worth then to hell with them  i wish that they cared about the people that they re supposedly investing in as much as they claim to care for animals  i am a human being and i have worth too  instead  i was treated as if i was trash    i don t care about money  otherwise i wouldn t have applied for the job  but i do care about my time  time is not guaranteed and i applied for this job for that very reason  i want to spend my time on earth doing something to benefit the world  maybe peta isn t the place for that  especially considering their reputation  but i want to do something fulfilling in some way that pays the bills that i m forced to pay  i m fortunate enough that i could go for the whole week without sacrificing another job or income  but think of all of the other people that they ve snubbed  who thought that they had a chance and missed a week of work that they really couldn t afford to miss  and it s not as if i went into this with only a resume  i gave them references and they did a background check and i had a phone interview beforehand  i m pissed at them for leading me on and at myself for being so stupid and naive  i hate people  man,fbl2id

10,I finally quit,it took me forever  i was going to do it last year but i didn't know if i had enough money or a good enough backup plan to save myself  finally  i started a plan to move to another city and work there instead    i picked the perfect time  everyone has been complaining about management lately  the difference is  everyone has to stay because they don't have a plan  well  this project ends eventually and they'll have to find another job then  me  on the other hand  i'm getting out of this shit  no more policing our lunches and our conversations  no more shouting matches over papers  no more subtle insults from assholes  no more gossip  it's done    i don't know if my next job will be good to enjoyable  work is work  but i can hopefully find something better than i had ,faaowx

16,"If anyone tells me I’m not suited for a typical work environment, I don’t think that’s a bad thing. Just because I would prefer a happier environment doesn’t mean I lack talent. Mister Rogers agrees.",in lots of toxic and unhealthy work environments that is thrown around a lot  they put a certain pressure on fitting in  living up to the potential  being perfectly suited for it  and implying that you are a loser if you re not   unfortunately i haven t heard of many nice work environments  out of all the people i know  i can t even tell you one  the problem isn t the job itself  different careers could be really cool and incredibly rewarding  the problem is the work environment that turns a really cool career into a mentally unhealthy work environment where the hours and demand for lack of input could drive anyone insane   so  we studied in college  wrote papers clearly stating our own ideas to join a job where we have to conform and rarely have our own ideas acknowledged  for most of our school life we were constantly asked what our ideas were  shit on school all you want  but they trained us to be bosses not employees  or  in the very least  not employees that only followed orders without truly contributing to our job in a way that mentally satisfies us   of course  there are some exceptions depending on what field you re in  but  you get what i mean   to be honest  i thought i was crazy until i heard that mister rogers felt the same way  i heard mister rogers had a job where people treated him horribly  and he never forgot that    i m sure most of the people who belong to the subreddit have the same feeling   being incredibly happy to be an adult  only to be disappointed with how awful every day work environments are  mister rogers made his dream career happen  sometimes when your preferred environment doesn t exist  you have to create it for yourself  remember that ,fb7fbs

18,Capitalism is created by the rich for the rich,a local restaurant in my neighbor hood that i used to patronize just raised prices for its entire menu by 2 times to cater towards rich customers  it is just sad that it ended up this way  the restaurant had its humble beginnings and initially  started its business by serving tasty meals at an affordable price for the common working class  over the years it has build a solid reputation by earning the trust and loyalty from its customers  it is common to see long queues during breakfast  lunch and dinner  everyone was willing to spend time queuing for the meal and no one is complaining about the waiting time    eventually all the buzz surrounding the restaurant started to attract the attention of people with too much cash to throw around  they started to get their meals from the restaurant and it is obvious that they enjoyed what they ate but apparently these people didn't want to spend their time waiting for a spot in the restaurant  since well  you know they are rich   to solve their issue  they decide to strike a deal with the owner - they are willing to pay twice the amount to avoid the long queue  so now the restaurants serves these rich folks and everyone else is left with nothing  this deal is a betrayal of all the loyal customers that have help built up the restaurant's brand and reputation    this is how capitalism works  businesses catering only to the people with money  can you imagine what will happen essential services such as healthcare gets privatized  they would turn down all everyone who cannot afford to pay  yet somehow capitalist love criticizing how the government shouldn't get involved in businesses  leave the free market and society alone alone  they say  yeah  i wonder what would happen it a 100  free market world  oh that's right  you get class cleansing where the poor are left to fend for themselves while the capitalist class exchange wealth with one another ,f9tmgf
19,I love my job but I’m antiwork,i have a job that i really enjoy  i m a rigging grip for the entertainment industry  i enjoy union protection and absolutely adore my union  i love climbing on shit and driving big machines and playing with power tools  no one tells me what to do or how to act  i don t see any other job where i could make what i do and have as much fun as i do   that being said  it s fucking bullshit that i have to exchange labor for money at all  and i think of all the non-union folks who work harder than me for less and it drives me up the wall  i suffer from multiple injuries and just this past thursday my buddy fell through a set roof about 13 feet onto the concrete  he is going to be okay but his number one concern laying on the ground was the fact that he was going to miss out on work and he needs money  it s so goddamn unfair to him and to everyone else in that position   i am so glad that i like doing my job because doing something i hate for cash would be soul-crushing  but i can t do this forever  my spine is slowly getting fucked and every older guy i know in my position has surgeries and injuries on their record  trading my pain and my health for money feels so fucking dirty  but what else can i do  what else can anyone do   jesus man  no one here should have to work  we are past that point from a a technological standpoint  why aren t robots bringing me cocktails on a beach  why aren t nanobots in my blood fixing my spinal discs  oh well  obviously i need to stay at it  at least i m having fun i suppose  say a prayer for my buddy paulie  the dude who fell  if that s your thing  eat the motherfucking rich brothers and sisters ,f9zrxe
20,Mom kinda realizes she’s anti work, i noticed lately that my mom has been less and less enthusiastic about work  she recently was able to get an office job paying double what she made before and even works in some overtime  after working for over 25 years of low paying menial jobs  i was really excited for her as it meant that she wouldn t have to work as hard as before  kitchen and adult daycare before that  though told me not too long ago that she s tired  of working and doing everything over and over  she definitely did not like her job before and i don t think she hates this one either but she s come to realize that work truly isn t end all be all  she would ve eventually reached this spot  financially  after maybe another half a decade of slaving away but a sprinkle of nepotism and good charisma really was all that was needed instead  she grew up in a country with worse wages and standard of living so maybe those changes were what held her together for so long  or maybe keeping me and my sibling fed  i just think that it s insane and i really respect her for putting up with it for so long  i was truly blinded by her conviction to wake up at 4 30 everyday and go work 8 hours and then pick up us from school and cook and clean and mom  i stupidly never saw her as someone who could get tired down by anything   my dad on the other hand has always been his own boss and even though he stresses about money  more so than my mom  he genuinely likes work  he s a mechanic and a truck driver and the times when he s not interacting with customers or talking to his friends on the phone while driving  he spends doing problem solving and or calling me to ask me about my current views on the subject of the week    two sides of the same coin  both have worked forever with no end in sight  though maybe one better off than the other   i want to talk to her about it more but when i told her jokingly that i didn t want to work ever and that i probably wouldn t have kids she got after me a bit  i m on my third year of college studying for engineering bc i genuinely thought that i could be like like lewis from meet the robinson s  make inventions and live of the profit  but it s more like  be a drone and work and invest into a 401k and then you die like everyone else but maybe your casket is a lil nicer  i love the learning bit of school but when everyone starts going on about career fairs and internships my brain shuts off  that might be the impostor syndrome but i d prefer to work alongside my dad as long as he can stand my fuckups and stay in school forever than anything else  don t know  sorry this was supposed to be about my mom but it just all poured out while i was browsing the reddits instead of working on my solids hw for tomorrow    i like coming on here bc of the human aspect of the posts you guys write  i can relate to a lot of what y all say and i wanted to put a bit of my thoughts into words  helpfully i can convince my mom become anti work and we can help usurp our overlords together lol  tl dr  mom is gonna become anti work  dad uses his skills to not give a fuck about things  i try to decide whether i want a 401k or be happy,faa8vp

23,"Quit, walked all the way home ..",i'm somewhat new to reddit  a little bit older  and love that i found this sub  i plan to post more  but just thought i would relay kind of a funny story    several years ago when i was still trying to do the marketing and communication job thing  i interviewed for a corporate communications consultant position downtown that paid 60 k  i thought the interview was so horrible  i was sweating and uncomfortable and not exactly qualified  i ended up getting the job   they loved me  and i was simply so excited to have gotten a job paying this money  i accepted it  at the time i was working as a health care admin asst  it's a lot easier to say sure i will take this job then to actually do it    so many things about it felt uncomfortable to me   - my boss trying to be so buddy buddy and mentor to me  almost trying to force my passion for the role  i'm kinda just here to work  lady  - i didn't understand care about the actual product  energy electricity   - i had no motivation to contribute to anything actually part of the job description and realized i didn't even have the skills   - i have nothing in common with my desk neighbors and felt socially weird  - uncomfortable one on one meetings and team lunches to meet everyone  - taking the bus downtown  - wearing biz clothes  - working downtown milling around with other corporate people - realizing i am not mentally able to handle this job and i am far under qualified  even tho my resume and interview got me in   - i felt like such a fake  fraud  coming in hating it all   i lasted a week    one day i was riding the bus in and i started to feel nauseous  anxious - i got off a block from the office and i just turned around and walked all the way home  i stopped for a bagel  i felt such a weight off    i emailed my boss and said sorry this won't work out and i never responded back    i didn't mean to screw anyone over but it's not like they invested much time in me  this is one of many many situations i've gone through to try to figure out what i want and what i can handle in the world of work  which i hate  which is why i'm here  i no longer apply for marketing and comm jobs which was my  career  i guess    onward to continue to find my peace ,faokpq
24,on exit strategies, you're going to a place you hate  a place you wouldn't go unless you had a gun to your head  almosy every day you find yourself there  ready to perform mindless tasks set out by someone higher up on the ladder   you are at work   capitalism has dug itself in extremely well and if you want to escape the system  it is going to be difficult  it wouldn't bode well for any system if people could opt out of it easily  if everyone could get out it would set a bad example  more and more would leave and soon the system would become unstable and eventually collapse  the ones at the top can't let that happen  they like eating cake too much   i've seen comments around leaving or quitting the race  an exit strategy  we think of exiting as something that we can do easily  quit our jobs and just say fuck it  i have similar ambitions but as i sit here looking at my notes on quitting and exit strategies this isn't something that happens overnight  it is something that you have to plan for and even then it isn't an easy task   is it possible to leave the system    i did a quick search and most of the exit strategy articles i saw are based upon  not surprisingly  the idea of finding another job  the idea seems to be to go to a lesser evil instead of no evil  perhaps in 2 years time you will once again head to a search engine for another exit strategy   to stop playing the capitalist game is near impossible  not only because we have become accustomed to the comforts it provides us but because the system makes it difficult to function without money  almost everything is tied into you working and by proxy money  we pay rent  we buy food  we pay for health insurance  we pay for gas to drive to work  we buy a ticket for the bus or train  we buy clothes  pay for utilities  living costs money   add to this the idea that your worth in society is tied to what you do and how much material stuff you have  clothes  car  house  cellphone  how many trips you take to exotic places  all of these things have become a more competent indicator of who you are as a person  what you have gives you more gravitas in society   thus we that see it becomes increasingly difficult to leave the system   having a skill to barter with is something to consider when thinking about an exit strategy  it could be used to earn a place to live  food to eat  skills will be a valuable currency as soon as money holds no more power over us  once more people move away from capitalism  skill sharing could be a different form of currency   an alternative that i have given some thought is a farming type community where you would work and earn your keep by means of labour  this is similar to what we have at this point but i feel it carries less risk of exploitation with it  like minded groups of people working towards a similar goal is better than working for a faceless corporation that only cares about bottom lines and quarterly results  in communities like this you get to deal with people instead of ceo's and hr   before the appearance of money this was the type system that people used to survive  returning to it might not be such a bad idea  co-operating instead of serving  people instead of profits ,f9rcqz

31,The system is self reinforcing.,people want to reinforce their beliefs  which is one of the good psychological tricks of society  we want other people to validate our behavior  so we subconsciously search for things which mirror our attitudes  beliefs  and values  this is why a hard worker who has worked their whole life for money cannot agree that no work is a viable idea  it would go against the values that they have spent their entire life slaving away to get    for them to agree that no work is okay would be an instant blow to everything they know  and would immediately compromise their value structure  when a persons fundamental beliefs are compromised  it causes an incredible amount of dissonance  most times  it is far more preferable to abandon the new idea in favor of going with what we already know because adopting a new fundamental value means that we have to restructure our entire internal hierarchy of values    whole lives are built around working for the sole purpose of financial gain    so  for every person who slaves day in day out at work  they become crabs in a bucket  the phrase misery loves company is real in this sense  because while they may hate their jobs  they do not want anti workers to come along and make them aware that they may be doing something they hate for what we claim is no good reason  the system's majority reinforces our cultural traditions  this  to me  is important to know ,fag2cd
32,The last company I worked at,just want to share a story about the last day i ever spent at a company   after i finished university i tried to get a job in the country and city my now wife lives in  god  it was the only time i ever tried to actually get a job  so well  the first month they didn't care about me at all  gave me no tasks  nothing  the second month they let me write guides with no end despite me having applied to be a server admin  then they complained that i am not trying to integrate into the group  yeah  because that's so easy when they leave me alone with a solo task like writing guides  not like the others made attempts to talk with me either  furthermore they complained about me not giving them enough input about how to do tasks better  in my first month   sure  just let me go there and instantly complain about how everybody else is doing their job wrong while   writing guides and having no idea what they want to begin with i guess  the only few times i mentioned something i was shot down anyways   this job was my sole opportunity to stay with my then girlfriend  i needed a visa  so i wanted it  when they told me they wont take me these assholes had the audacity to get me into a conversation where they wanted to  help me  so i dont make the  same mistakes  in the next company   jesus fucking christ  i just wanted to get out of there  i dont need the advice of fucking assholes  the manager there who gave me tasks didnt even have the balls to join that conversation because he had such an important phone call   yeah sure  and thats also the reason why he didnt join half way through after he finished i guess   because they were so  nice  to help me i wasnt able to take it anymore  i burst into tears there  seeing my life ending  incapable of staying in the same country and city as my girlfriend  they even had the balls to tell me that all the companies in this city talk with each other and i probably wont get another chance if i act so  unprofessional  there  jesus  can you be any more of a giant dick   when i handed them back their stupid keycard i told them what they did to me in their hunt for profit and sheer ignorance  the boss daughter who weirdly enough has a managing position in that company just said - in an attempt to justify their actions -  but that's not our fault  i left with a  you tell yourself that   that was the last time i ever dealt with a company  it was the last straw which pushed me over the edge  having had the antiwork mindset ever since middle school  fortunately i was in a position to change things  i expanded a freelance contract i still had from my university time  now i make three times as much as they paid me while working 8 hours less each week and without having to spend 10 hours of my freetime to commute every week  to stay in the country i married my girlfriend   fuck companies  they arent worth it and just leech your skill which you can use to make your own way to expand their profits ,fao8i2

41,The only reason you feel like a loser when you're unemployed is because the system tells you that you are one,people want to find a meaning or purpose in their life  that doesn't mean they live to work    however the system keeps pounding it into your head that your purpose is to work and if you don't you're a loser and that there's something wrong with you   don't be fooled  there are a lot of rich people out there who don't really have a proper job  they hold onto a bunch of assets investments that generates income via interest dividends capital gains etc  maybe they bought it at the right time  maybe they inherited it  who know   however the point is they will get more money passively in one month without having to do anything than you will get wageslaving in a year    do they feel sad they they don't have a 9-5 job  not really  they have a constant flow of income coming in so why would they need to  if they want to do something in life  they easily can because they got the money to do so    a poor unemployed person wasting all his time going to clubs  bars and other places for entertainment is probably called an deadbeat alcohol waste of skin  a rich unemployed person going to social events etc is called a socialite which doesn't have the same negative connotation   so just remember that its the system that pounds in your head that you need to be employed 9-5 to not be a loser  its your duty to wageslave so the guys on top can take all the beenfits  however if you're rich that doesn't apply to you  you can do what you want and somehow still call it a job ,fatped

46,I feel like a loser due to unemployment.,i graduated from high school last year with a certificate instead of a diploma  i decided to take some time off for myself due to severe depression and social anxiety but now i don t think i want to work  i dread the thought of wasting my life with a 9 to 5  it makes me even more depressed and i sometimes cry myself to sleep because of it  my dad thinks i m a failure because i don t have a job  he tells me to go work at a fast food place but that s one of the worst places for someone to work with social anxiety  i would just be a wreck the entire time  other family members and people i know think i m just lazy and dumb  we are all on different paths in life  not everyone goes to college unit and or works  i feel like i m trapped in somebody else s master plan - go to school  get a job  get a mortgage  all we re really do is dying  my sister constantly tells me to just get a job but fuck she works from 7 to 5 monday to friday and honestly  who has the better life  she doesn t even live a life  being cramped up in an office for most of the day only to go home to be too tired to do anything  the thought of going to work for the rest of my days and only enjoying a small amount of my life makes me miserable and want to kill myself  i think suicide is the only option at this point  i d rather be dead than live a boring life that s grey  bland and fake  flavourless  there is no point in life other than school  work then retiring  we only have one life  we should enjoy it to the fullest  not worry about when our next pay check is or whether we ll have enough money to feed ourselves and our children  we are slaves built to distress ourselves over when our next pay check will be to pay off our debts  we are nothing more than products  we live to pay our bills until we die  it s a mundane existence  there s gotta be more to life than this ,fa0zh5

83,Are there any jobs where you can come in casually and not have to wear business clothes or a uniform?,i don't know why but i hate having to wear business clothes or uniforms  i remember back in school i was free to express myself and now i feel limited because most places have a dress code  i honestly don't even hate business clothes or uniforms  it's more the feeling that i have no other choice  to me dressing professional doesn't effect my productivity  i get the job done no matter what i wear  i hate having to wait till after work or the weekends to put on a t-shirt and jeans ,f9s6pp
84,My boss is an evangelical asshole,i live in utah and  as you might already know  most people here are mormons  my husband and i are very much not religious  in fact  we have some negative views on it  but i won't get into those here   anyway  the manager where i work  who is also my husband's dad  loves to go on about some fictional war he thinks is going to happen and he elaborated yesterday that it would be a war between  wicked and riotous  and then went on about god  at this point i laughed because i made the connection that this fuck is talking about rapture  he got mad that i laughed  i said stop fucking preaching to me  and then he said i'm not preaching and i won't be stifled   i was so fucking mad  like yes you are  your thinly veiled threat that my husband and i are going to hell is fucking preaching  i wanted to say so much but walked away instead because guess who has to  stifle  herself so i won't be fired   i absolutely hate this man  i can't stand being anywhere near him but i'm forced to deal with him every day  he talks about his shitty politics  religion  and all sorts of things i would very much like to avoid at work  especially here in utah where everybody is red until they're dead  i started taking like 3 pills for anxiety and depression and i feel like it is all his fault that i feel like shit all the time ,faeihx
85,Having a lot of kids benefit the elite,more kids  more sheep and more slaves  more people available at the bottom to replace you at your job  this creates competition because you are easily replaceable  as such you continue to work in a job you hate only for the money because there are millions and soon there will be billions of people that you can be replaced with ,fau7fx

88,Ways to escape,i'm done with the working life and looking for alternatives  so far i've come up with the list below  i'm curious to see what others have come up with    - live on the road  i live in europe and i could easily jump on my bicycle and just leave  i have supplies to live in the wild and some money to keep me fed etcetera  to keep costs to a minimum so i can spend as much time away as possible  i could do some wwoofing and the like  this would get me away from what's bothering me and it'd offer me useful experience in the process  with funds being limited though  chances are my getaway would be shortlived   - join a commune  i could try and join an intentional commune or the like  this offers a more long term solution that's also fairly risk free compared to other options  downside is  the suspected  lack of individual freedom since there's always the commune counting on me doing my part  also it's probably rather hit or miss when it comes to being able to bond with the people i'd be joining   - homesteading  though i have no knowledge of things like farming and preserving food  i'm charmed by the idea of self sufficiency and the philosohy of permaculture  i'd need money and other people to get this off the ground and basically start a commune myself  i'd also have a lot to learn  this seems rather hard to accomplish   - illegalism  before i let myself get sucked into this wage slavery hell  i made a living operating outside of the law  i enjoyed the sense of freedom  while the tension and uncertainties could be stressful  a risk with this type of crime is that one could easily get preoccupied with money and materialism  also  while it disconnects one from one of the most ugly parts of life as we're expected to lead it  work  it is still embedded in the same society with all its flaws   - join rojava  or something similar  i haven't investegated this that well  mostly because i'm afraid i'd be more of a nuisance than a help  i consoder it an option nevertheless   - career switch  i could look for work that erases the most dreadful aspects of working life  preferably something in nature  or something in line with my views like an organization  or helping others  this would require schooling though  which is a costly matter in money as well as time ,faulmw

106,Seriously needed advice ASAP: quitting vs staying,hi all  i have found myself tangled in a horrid predicament  i hope i can find some advice here from people who could possibly understand how i feel rather than assume i m being lazy   i am a shift runner at a large food delivery franchise  i ve worked there for 1 1 2 years  and i used to love it  used to    started out as a delivery driver  got trained up inside  got promoted august 2019  so i ve been a bottom line manager for 6 months now    i hate it so much    it s horrible  i work 45-55 hours a week  i m tired and the hours are insanely unsociable  i m sad and have no free time  the work sucks  it s stressful and the food prep we use genuinely triggers painful allergic reactions on my hands  my store manager and above keep demanding more and more and more and i can t provide  i m not good enough and it s so stressful i can t even enjoy my free time anymore  i have this overwhelming sense of dread whenever work time looms or is happening    thing is  i m sort of  set there  if i leave  i will owe them  600ish for a training course i took last august  you need to stay at minimum a year for the course to not need repaying   amp  yes  i stupidly signed agreeing to this  i have all my holiday for 2020 booked  which gives me 1 weekend in march off  1 week off in april  1 week of in may  and 11 days off in june  which is an awful lot of holiday i may not be able to score somewhere else  i also earn more money there than i would elsewhere probably  given that being a manager means i earn just under  3 above my age s national minimum wage    additionally  i am planning to actually 100  leave in august  when i became a manager i told the higher ups it was on the condition i could leave for university without owing them a thing  which is what also makes me hesitant  august 2020 is a little over 5 months away  which isn t that far off  my family and most of my friends all thing i should grit my teeth and stick it out until then    thing is  i hate it  so so so so so much  i am stressing so bad  i can t sleep properly  i don t have proper eating habits  i m beginning to have dental problems from teeth clenching grinding  i scratch myself stupid  a bad habit of mine that increases with stress and anxiety  and bite my nails and cut myself occasionally too  i feel sad and depressed and i cry a lot and feel so terrible  but logically i really shouldn t leave  emotionally i should get the fuck outta dodge    my only other option would be to drop down to part time and this job  then work elsewhere i enjoy at the same time  thing is  it s difficult to be a part time manager  and i doubt i d be permitted to do so  i think they d try to persuade me to either take a demotion  not interested  move to a different store location  not interested  or stay full time  fuck    is it worth the risk of being broke for a while  i m not in any debt  and have a small  1-2k or so  in savings  so even if i don t have a job for a month or two  or get a lower paying one  i could stay afloat  the idea of working as i am was to have some money saved up for uni  as i won t be getting much family help when i go away    help  i need to talk to my area manager tomorrow  my plan is to say  essentially  let me cut myself down to part time or i leave in march april  but is that really my best move    i also feel slightly guilty for leaving my store in the lurch  but also  store manager is a bit of a dick  so those feelings of guilt aren t as strong as they were a few months ago   if anyone read this far  you re awesome  ily  help me  please,fa3x2r

112,"Not sure if this is right sub to share my frustrations, but my full time job is wearing on me and I hate it.",at the beginning of the year i accepted a full time position at a community college on the administration side  at almost 30  it's actually my first  full time job  as previously i had worked part time at that college and another one as a writing and math tutor  and was also a musician making some money playing gigs and giving lessons  i was working roughly 30-35 hours a week altogether during semesters  which felt like a lot but i enjoyed it  i'd practically have all summer off from tutoring which was nice  but i didn't get paid - that's the only reason i took the full time job is because i needed to make more money   well  the money is nice  and the job itself isn't bad  but the sheer 40 hour grind week after week is becoming unbearable  i'm trying to maintain my social life  but it's at the expense of my getting gigs and working in music  since i also have a 45ish minute commute  i feel like i only have enough time to get home  have dinner  unwind   maybe  practice for 30 minutes or so  and then go to bed  rinse and repeat  i'm literally sitting in my office now with numerous  busy work  i'm supposed to do but i' burned out on doing it cause i was here all day yesterday and the day before that  this sucks   i often think about other careers i could do get into engineering  information tech  teaching high-school or college but they all lead to the same path of working full time for another 30  years  i wouldn't say i'm  anti-work i enjoy working  but i need a balance in my life  and i believe a 40  hour work week is simply not a balance  little changes in my specific job  could  make things a lot better  like having fridays off  getting off work at 2 00 or 3 00 everyday instead of 5 00  having the summers completely off but that doesn't seem to be possible with this job or the vast majority of others   i'm sure there's a way out of this  and i aim to get there  but right now i'm just frustrated and wanted to vent here ,f9vb6j

119,It's scary how accurate this is. Poor guy offed himself a year later too.,   misery in terms of 40 hour work week by paper in depression  -l-red-ataxia 145 points 1 year ago   you and me  i think we're the exact fucking same   t have an hour long commune  i have to wake up at 5 am  leave at 6 am  and be in by 7  i leave at 3 pm  and make it home at 4  i have to go to bed at 9 pm in order to wake up the next day not feeling like tired shit because the human body is a disgusting efficient thing   the instant i get home at 4 30 pm  my mind goes into time mode  i start counting the hours  the minutes  sometimes even the seconds  i have exactly four and a half hours to do things i want to do before i have to go back to the slow the next day  i need to cream that time with as much of the things i want to do as possible   by weekend are the same  i wake up  and i start counting  saturdays are less of a problem usually because i can wake up when i want and go to sleep whenever i want  but it's still there casting a shadow over everything  i get one day  one day out of seven where i don't feel stressed about waking up when i have to and sleeping when i have to  and when saturday starts  i have twelve or fourteen or sixteen hours before sunday  when sunday starts  i have until 9 pm until my weekend is over   when the forty-hour work week starts to get to you like it does to me  you start feeling stifled for time  and the paycheck you receive starts feeling worthless  because it's not like you can use that money to buy the time back   his is your life  ending one hour  one minute  one second at a time  for forty hours a week  maybe even more   of anyone asks you out  whether it's your of or your friends  your parents  anyone  even if your relationships with them are happy and healthy  your brain can't help but make an automatic calculation  now much of my time will this take  now much will i have left until i have to go back to work  and when even the slightest thing goes wrong--if you forgot to get something at the store  if there's traffic  if someone makes a mistake and costs you more time  you start to resent it  you resent that delay  and the people who caused that delay  for wasting the precious free time you have  and every hour  every minute  every second that slips away is time that you don't get to spend doing the things you want to do   things you used to enjoy no longer provide the same fulfillment  because you can't stop that clock  you can t stop counting the hours  the minutes  the seconds  even if you're enjoying yourself  even if you're having a blast and accomplishing a lot  even if at the end of the day you feel like a champion who is closer to your dream  that shadow is there  telling you that you only have this many hours  this many minutes  this many seconds left until you go back  like a guillotined slowly itching its way towards your neck  and when you're having fun  that realization causes you to get jerked back into the real world   key  pucker  have a good time  i hope you did  because it's another forty hours until you can even start to get it back  now start lifting  jackets  your life doesn't become yours until we say it does   by job doesn't suck  the work is nothing special  if a little firing  but it's not murdering me  i work at a good company  my co workers are good people  my boss is a pretty understanding guy who always tries to be fair and helps out whenever he can  by pay isn't anything cellar but it's liable  and some people would envy having it  20 an hour   but i get the sense that i'd feel like this with the vast majority of work  forty hour work weeks  no matter what  get tedious  become meaningless  burn me out  the only way i can avoid it is to not work a day in my life--to do a job that i love  but how many people get jobs they love  now many people get paid liable wages  enough to have a room and food  doing what they love  now many people even know what it is that they love to even pursue it in the first place   the fact that the starving artist is a running joke in america--someone going hungry trying to do what they love--is the cruel reality  and the fact that we're okay with it and point and laugh with everyone else  even face laughter  is the crudest reality imaginable   you want to do what you love  luck you  that's not how the real fucking world works  shitheel  now hop to it  you've got forty hours of work to do  and if you want to fucking eat  you better fucking do it   i'm reminded of that movie in time  starring austin timberlake  it's a movie about a dystopian future where money has no more meaning  and people trade time  a coffee might cost thirty seconds  a cab fare might cost two minutes  a high quality mountain bicycle might be four months  a new sedan might be nine years   there's a watch everyone has embedded in their arm that tells them how much time they have  and when the number reaches zero  they die  some people have hundreds of years of time  some people live minute to minute   that's what i feel like  that some people have the rest of their lives to look forward to  with their 90 years of time  and here i am  scraping by with only a few hours on my clock every day before the clock hits zero and i die   and in america  you can't talk to anyone about it  nobody at all  not really  because even if some individual people might sympathize and wish they had less working hours alongside you  society will think of you as a lazy piece of shit who just wants to much off of others  all because you're not willing to surrender forty hours a week  one hundred and sixty hours a month  one thousand nine hundred and twenty hours a year for a paycheck  and you have to convince yourself that you need this paycheck  that you need this money in order to not get tucked in the ass by taxes and  bills  you try  you try so hard to justify it  you need this money  you need to give up these forty hours to live  his is necessary  you try   but it doesn't work  not really  not until it's too late   i've been trying to search for a job where i can work from a home office  but for someone like me  there's no option  everything requires more choosing  more experience  and getting choosing or experience requires time and money i don't have and can't get  and even then  i've only been at this job for a few months  i can't quit yet because i need to stay long enough for it to look good on my resume   t know drugs will make it worse  alcohol will make it worse  the most i can do is try to anaesthetise myself with the activities that i used to like  activities that used to give my life meaning and purpose  i used to enjoy these things  but now the most these things can give me--these things i used to love and enjoy--is a distraction  a temporary illusion that i'm not miserable  which wears off at 9 pm every day   there's a light at the end of the tunnel  and i can only hope that it's a train  ,f9z7oz

123,I'm sick of sales and i'm sick of screwing people over.,i goddamn hate my job and it makes me sick to my stomach    i recently got promoted within a paint company and was relocated to a different store from the one i started in  at first  i was excited at the prospect of making more money and having more responsibility  but after working just one week in my new position  i realize what a greedy  scumbag of a company this really is   i understand that this is commonplace and perfectly legal  but it doesn't make it right  it honestly makes me feel guilt ridden what they force me to do for a paycheck  i'll tell you what they want me to do  again  it's all legal and many companies practice this   say a customer walks in and they want a product  they are nice  polite  and they just want a good deal  i smile  showcase our product  and promise them that they are getting the best deal i can offer them  they are happy and they leave the store content  minutes later  a contractor pro comes in and says to me  such and such store across the way sells a product  that they promise is just as good as the one you sell  cheaper than what you sell it  i want that price    what would a good  honorable person say to that contractor  if it were my choice  it would be  i'm sorry  but we sell that price to everyone  it's the same no matter who you are  but  no  i am forced to say  we will match pricing from our competitors no matter what   what kinda bullshit is this  just because this person wants to bitch about his pricing because of the promise he will buy more in the future  i'm supposed to cut him a better deal than other people  again  i know it's common  i know many other companies do this  i know that it's legal  but i fucking hate doing this  customers that come in who don't complain about the competitor price pay more  my company literally plays off of people's ignorance    another thing  i know what these products cost our store  i have the power to look at all the numbers  the  list pricing  on every single thing we sell is pathetically high  if someone comes in with a coupon with the hope that they are getting a great deal  they aren't  our company just list prices things so stupidly high and then once the coupon is applied  we are still getting crazy high margins on the sale  we could have honestly just sold the product at the coupon cost in the first place  but we lie to people by tricking them into thinking they are getting an awesome deal because of the coupon  sometimes  people aren't even aware that there are coupons out there  but they have to print the coupon off from our website  bring it in  we scan it  and then they  surrender  it  it's not even a unique barcode  it's the fucking same and you can just keep printing it off over and over  but yeah  gotta  surrender  it at purchase  what a fucking joke    despite what some people think  we do not sell based on bulk pricing  that is a complete and utter lie  we sell as high as we can until the pros start to bitch and then we lower their price  i've seen pros who buy 20 gallons a month get better pricing than others who buy 100 plus gallons a month all because they threatened to shop somewhere else  because of my company's greed  they literally want every possible fucking sale even if it's at the expense of my honor and personal integrity  am i the only one that feels this way or has this become such common place that everyone is just like  meh  that's how the economy works  i'm sorry  i just felt like i needed to vent and get this off my chest  i can't wait till i find something else to do  i'm so done with this place ,f84wyl

131,"Unemployed, and getting really stressed out and depressed by my peers, parents and random other people pushing me into employment for the sake of it and without regards to quality and happiness",it's so terrible  it's a constant loop    no job - get shit - depressed   have job - job is shit - depressed   only the brief moments after you lose a job because the company is failing and doesn't pay their workers are the ones where i can be myself and enjoy life without the ever-looming stress of having or not having a job  and others behaving like i am not human because i don't have a job    i'm not against working  i love helping people  i love to have a worthwhile goal  sadly  in my area  all the jobs are either too fancy for me and they tell me i'm shit  or the jobs are too shit for me  i made a bad decision once or twice and got shoved into employment where i worked in some factory where it felt like i was in hell  every minute was like an eternity  and after 2 hours  i was already looking at the clock for when it's time to go  it chipped at my soul this job did  it was really like hell in every context of the word  one day  after the second shift  i had a sudden urge to start smoking  getting drunk in a pub  and beat my wife if she gave me shit  obviously i have neither a wife  don't drink  and definitely don't smoke  in that moment i didn't give a shit  i even went away before the alarm for shiftchange sounded  while the other fearful desperate people waited in front of the building   even though the shift already changed people  i got really desperate there  and my parents allowed me to quit     my friends tell me i'm shit  it's like i am not deserving of basic human dignity if i don't have a job  a way of wasting a third of my life away in  exchange for some morcels of money  and a lot of stress  my friends are also desperate in their jobs  and they hate them  but it's like they want everyone to be miserable if they also are  i mean   i understand that the modern capitalist way of life is set up in such a way that you have no other choice than to be a slave for someone and make them money  unless you have money for starting your own business which will inevitably fail  like i would dare to invest in anything when i have nothing    it sucks from all sides  and only gets worse as my unemployment time increases  i've seen it countless times between jobs  at first everyone feels sorry for you  and then as time passes  they grow resentful and more aggressive  and make you feel bad  until you get so stressed that you take literally any job      i had one okay-ish job ever  and it also sucked  but it was one i wasn't forced into  and it was leagues better than the rest  the future is grim and i hate that it has to be like this  why don't my parent have a business  so i can get forced into it  and actualyl have a reason to give more than the bare minimum  why am i not a country lad     some business dude that i know  whom i was choffeuring a few times  talked to me about the mobility of workers and how it is normal in some places to drive 2 hours to and from work  i didn't dare to tell him that i value my free time very highly  and that i would rather take a pay cut just so i don't have to waste 8 hours of my life somewhere i don't want to be  that i think a 5 day work week is plent y and 4-shift and working 6 or 7 days is slavery  didn't dare to lay some math on him and tell him that if you waste 12 hours of your life on work  that you are wasting your life and you are stupid  that commute obviously counts as unproductive work-time where you can't enjoy your life and your hobbies  unless you really enjoy listening to audiobooks in traffic    all in all  it's all shit  i should just kill myself  or go live in a forest  the modern way of life is slavery  we have machines which can extract resources  why can't those be public  and generate income for the universal basic income    bah  i'm so bummed out  don't mind my shitty rant  had some bashing from my friends earlier today  and some asshole yesterday remarked how i have  too much free time  just because i wanted to ride my bike on a saturday,f8fffg

136,How to build a sustainable anti-work life?,is it possible to build a fufilling life that avoids the current system of work-till-you're-dead capitalism  and if so  what are the steps to getting there   i'm pretty young  i'm 21  but already i'm disenchanted  it began with school  which i was originally very interested in  until about middle school  i disliked the idea of being fed information and then being tested on it  only for the information to then never be referenced again  and i felt my worth was diminished to mere numbers  i became very depressed and was told college was better  it wasn't  it was the exact same thing  except this time i was expected to pay  i dropped out of my second year of community college after two years of what seemed like the same thing  with about 2k in student loans  instead i went into a competitive training program  and i am now staying afloat by working freelance in the film production industry as a production assistant  i stand outside for about 12 hours a day  during 12-14 hour shifts  lock down perimeters and get coffee for asshole directors and lighting techs  i make a little above minimum wage  with room to grow  its grueling  and restrictive  with the industry only being viable in ny  california  and georgia    however  i get the feeling continuing on this path with never lead to anything fruitful  so here's the question  how to build a sustainable life focused around living rather than working  instead of focusing on career and building a life from that  how do we focus on life and build a career around it    i believe the first point is freedom of work  freedom to set your hours  freedom to move  and freedom to grow  i believe the best path to this is working remotely  what are the best jobs that one could get working remotely without a college degree  could training in coding and computer software or web design be a viable option to work from home  if not  what are some careers that would allow travel or leave   the second point that comes to mind is detachment from the system  that would be understanding and sacrificing your connection to parts of the system  letting go of the idea of owning things that could chain you down  like taking out loans  buying a house  etc  what are some things to be aware of  what sacrifices would this kind of life entail  and how does one detach from these things  is it sustainable to have a partner  or child  with an anti-work life    and finally  what would an anti-work life look like for you  if it were possible  working and saving and retiring early  working in short periods and traveling  working from your computer and moving around  what do you imagine an anti-work like to be  for me  it would be working as i travel  keeping costs down and having very little possessions or buying land  although taking a loan to buy land is a problem in itself  and living sustainably  working from the computer freelance when money gets tight    i'm interested in hearing other people's ideas  and the steps and sacrifices that would come with this lifestyle as well as the pros to this life  any answers are welcome ,f9j4fo

166,Wage slave nearly killed me (literally),hi  so i'm about as anti-work as they come  im really school smart and active at my college  so when i applied for americorps  i got in even though only 1 in 3 applicants are hired  i dint even get through the orientation  about a month in  before i felt hopelessly overwhelmed  even though this was going to be the best paying job i've ever had  i felt that i couldn't do it  i was already pretty depressed  so this job threw me overboard  i decided to commit suicide  my husband  bf at the time  felt that he couldn't stop me so he did it with me  obviously we failed bc i had posted a goodbye on tumblr  which like reddit no one is supposed to be able to find u irl  but someone did  amp  alerted my sister  so long story short  now i'm thrown right back into the wage slave system ,f7osw9
167,I haven’t even started my “career” and I’m already done with it.,i just got back to the us from traveling for a month  was able to save up enough money to just walk a trail through a country day in and day out  worrying about nothing but food  lodging  and what the weather was going to be like the next day  i lived on the bare minimum  with everything i need just on my back and in my pockets   it was wonderful  and felt like complete freedom   now here i am  job searching to attempt to start my engineering career  and after my first interview i am left completely flabbergasted that i have to do this  i haven t been this stressed out since college just because of one interview  it was terrifying by the way  being interviewed by engineering professionals while i m just a hatched egg  i m not ready to dedicate my life to something that mentally destroys me so much  i thought it would get better after college  but i really don t know how i m going to do this    i guess it was a bad choice experiencing how wonderful some freedom can feel before having to start slaving away at a post-graduate career  because now i m never going to be able to sit still behind a desk and under a boss ever again ,f7no4x

171,Work and money is the main reason I don’t want kids,work and money is the main reason why i don t want kids  it s not that i don t want to be domestic it s that i can t afford to and expecting parents  especially the mother to be superwoman at work and home isn t fair or healthy   a lot of millennial women are choosing not to have kids and many of us say  oh i prefer to choose my career  but that really is a professionally and socially acceptable way of saying  i will never have enough wealth and security to afford the support needed to take care of home and children properly  i will never be able to enjoy a maternity leave without knowing my pregnancy might get me laid off  creatively of course  they ll state another reason  or skipped over for promotions and pay increases   and further more  as a wage slave  i believe whole heartedly it is a sin to create another  i can t see myself working full time to 75 which is when many of us will be working until if not longer  most of the people i know who had kids my age or younger are not properly ensured and won t be able to maintain life insurance after a job lose  if anything happens to one of the parents then the family is really up shit s creek  so many millennials men and women have suicide in the back of their minds  maybe they want to wait until after their own parents pass  maybe they are waiting to see how something career or relationship wise plays out  i think this is also another reason many of us don t want kids  it ruins the exit strategy    our government  u s  doesn t care about our well being or wealth when it comes to abortion laws  they only care about having enough slaves ,f7k7u0

181,Government Jobs,a few times i have seen people bring up switching to government work to get away from making money for someone else  so i thought i'd share my experience being in the public sector   based on what i've read on this sub  there are a few things that government jobs certainly do better   we have a union that regularly increases our wages and protects our benefits insurance   you cannot be asked to stay late or work on days that you are not scheduled   it's a different environment when the goal isn't to make a profit   however  there are still plenty of problems   if you work at a desk  you are given the most uncomfortable workspace you could imagine   they're generic setup can't be adjusted enough to suit anybody  and as a result people are always getting injuries   you can ask to get replacements that fit you better  but not until the pain has already set in   even when you do ask for a replacement  it could be months before you get your new equipment   the schedules are also extremely rigid   you can never leave early  even if you have absolutely nothing to do  because it is  not giving taxpayers what they paid for   some days  you can sit there for 8 hours with nothing to do but watch the clock   in addition to that  you have to constantly keep up your image because it would look bad to the taxpayers   so have fun fake working for a few hours because there isn't anything for you to work on   ranting aside  a government job is still a job   you will be wasting your life away sitting in traffic  sitting in an office  sitting in traffic  sleeping  and repeating ,f8nc7m

207,What happened that made you go from peak performer to just the bare minimum at work?,  this post made me think of several stories i personally know of where a single shitty management decision has pushed out good workers  or turned them from peak performers into bare-minimum performers   one of them at my last job  they paid someone a  40 000 bonus to move his whole family across the country for this very specialized job that paid a salary of  140 000 a year  3 times the average for this region  this guy worked from home his first month while trying to set up his household locally because the company needed him on board asap  then worked for 3 months with no issues  during the week of thanksgiving his wife was traveling for work and his kid s daycare was closed so he asked to work from home for 1 day because he didn t have anyone local who could watch his kids  request denied  this was 1 week after he had worked until 2am from home at his manager s request to prep for a board meeting    this one short-sighted decision was all it took for this guy to realize his new company didn t give a shit about him  so by christmas he had given notice and was preparing to move his family yet again for a different job   so does anyone else have any stories about this situation  seems pretty common ,f7vmse

253,Lost all hope,i'm sorry if this sounds like a rant that does not relate to anti-work ideology  i just wanted to share my thoughts and feelings after 1 5 months of starting my second job  i finally came to the realization that there is really no good  full-time  jobs at all  at least not one that does not cost your mental health   one of my friends who briefly went into the same field told me that  xx field is toxic  i passed the interview and started working in the exact field she had left  the first month was honeymoon phase and everyone was being nice  you can only judge how supportive a team is when things go to shit  or when it's about to   i am always holding back my emotions on my current project team  the manager is nice sometimes but he also has ultra-motives in whatever he does  for example  he wanted to talk to me about my performance over lunch  but he went around prodding about my weekend plans  wanting to know how much time over the weekend i had actually spent on work  i feel that he's on the fence about being nice or being shit to his associates and it sends really mixed signals when you try to be friendly only to be met with a stern comment  yet the same guy asked me why i am not outgoing and why i'm so quiet  the answer is simple  i have given up    today  the dude took another associate  n  in our team to the project meeting   there are only 2 associates including me  he summoned her from our company training event to join this super important meeting  i felt extremely sidelined  i am always the one assigned to do all the very menial tasks  which i am not complaining because it gives me some breathing space to observe and learn  i just feel like i am not part of the team  even the project proposal does not have my name on it  i don't know if it's favoritism or what  all i know is that all these have made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcomed  so these are the multiple subtle ways that people are mean to each other but still nice on the surface   associate n is also super friendly but made back-handed comments to me that made me feel inferior   the horrible thing about open working space  may i add  is that if you get humiliated  it happens in front of everybody  you get exposed under the bright sun  the whole department probably knows about the situation now and it's super embarrassing  but that doesn't really concern me  my only concern is if i am suited to continue working here or that my performance is always never enough for my manager who gets very irritated at mistakes that could be easily edited in 10 mins  maybe he hates me    i'll try to make it to 6 months if the big bosses haven't already terminated my employment at the end of the 3-month probation  i don't think any job is worth the humiliation and bad treatment  we can all be anti-work at heart but reality sometimes demand us to work to sustain ourselves  maybe in a few years' time  i will start exploring other options that don't include a 9-5 job ,f558z5

264,"The magic words to get prescribed antidepressants: ""my work life is being affected"".",so  after 7 months of going to a psychiatrist and telling him about some disturbing personal life stories that are  probably the factors that  led me to a constant dissociative and depressed state  i got prescribed nothing   i didn t want anything to be prescribed anyway  all i was doing was seeking help  i even actively looked for psychiatrists that were specialised in similar disorders to the ones i felt i was struggling with  so i had the best chances at some sort of recovery    anyway  he did nothing  of course  the talking and psychoanalysis helps a little as an emotional outlet  but he couldn t offer any solutions   when i started a part time job  i said to my therapist    gt well  this is going too far now  it is my first month at work and i was already severely late three times and missed it completely also three times - i already got a severe warning from my boss     this was happening because i was severely struggling to get out of bed in the morning due to my depression   the therapist then proceeded almost automatically to prescribe me antidepressants on that very session  huh  almost like that is what they are for   the original idea for this post came to my mind as some sort of ironic  r unethicallifeprotips post  something like   if you are struggling with depression due to personal problems and your therapist refuses to prescribe antidepressants  just say it s affecting your work life severely    it is like too easy to see the function those pills have in society  i feel like a fool and a functioning robot  but at least i don t want to die everyday now and everything is neutral and easier to endure  i never skipped work again  and  by the way  when i said those things that got me my prescription  i didn't have any of this in mind  i was just scared shitless of losing my job in my first month  these realisations came after a few months ,f5u4vr

266,Glad to have found you,there is something comforting in finding a safe haven such as this sub  i understand that most people might not say they necessarily like work  but i have struggled for so long knowing that what i experience goes so far beyond that  even those who don't like it  manage to do it  they might piss and moan occasionally  but  at the end  they are able to trudge along year after year doing the same mindless tasks  accepting the same dehumanizing  juvenile treatment  for the life of me  i can't figure out how   never have i been able to keep a job for more than 1 or 2 years at a time  typically  that range runs closer to the 1 year mark  in a way  this gnaws at me and makes me doubt my worth  i know i'm not a dumb person  i just can't find a point to it  i excel in any position i am in  but take no real pride in excelling in them  why would i  they are menial  with no freedom  responsibility  genuine opportunity for advancement or chance to make change    hell  i even broke down in 2009 and decided to go to college  figuring that would broaden my prospects  even though i did very well and graduated with a near perfect gpa  it has not paid off in the least   if you'll allow me to vent  take my current position  it's not a horrible gig  but it is also a nothing job  every day is the same thing over and over  none of it involves the slightest bit of challenge or critical thinking  since being recruited 7 months ago  i have been the highest performing seller in the department every month  this includes individuals who have somehow done this for 4  11  at 15 years   yet  despite being recruited away from another position  despite having an applicable college degree and management experience  and despite being the top performer since starting  i am micromanaged on a daily basis in regards to the the most inane aspects of the job   it's just not enough that my performance is above and beyond  nor is it enough that i am stuck in this building for 8 hours a day  5 days a week  my only reprieve being 2 measly 10 min breaks and a 30 min lunch day  along with a paltry 40 hours of pto every 6 fucking months  there is always something else that needs to be discussed  focused on  shoved in to fill that free time where i am basically robbing the poor company by not having something to do every minute of every day  because  for a mediocre wage  overpriced healthcare  free coffee  and a cubicle  they own me  every second of every weekday  i am their property   what truly blows my mind is how the others in the department do it  sure  3 of them have been here long enough to be making a decent hourly wage  but i am the only person in the entire department that makes monthly bonus on sales  seriously  the only one  that is really the only thing that even makes the job worth it  i have hit my highest level of bonus every month and that is the only reason i am able to tolerate this  how these others are doing the same job for so long  with no bonus structure  is beyond my understanding ,f6entv

270,Boss got mad at me for not going above and beyond at work, i work a desk job and had my weekly meeting with my boss yesterday  boss was reviewing a task i completed for the week and was upset because i only completed the basic requirements but didn t go above and beyond  suggested i should ve not only completed my task  but fully research it from all angles to fully understand the ins and outs of the task  boss accused me of not taking my work seriously enough and said i need to put in more effort to do extra homework on the tasks i m given  including using my weekends to work on work   ok i tried to be understanding and named improvement steps i could take  i said i ll spend more time and do background research for my next tasks  i even suggested that i could take a small course related to my job to improve my skills which will in turn allow me to perform future tasks better  allowing me to have better context of the work i do  boss flipped out at this suggestion  like i just insulted them  and was all like  you don t need to take a course  just do the work  what you need to do is take more initiative and own your work  you should know this  you should ve not only finished this task  but come ready to talk about and present the findings from background research you did for it  you need to start taking more charge and responsibility  research your tasks and actually do your homework   i m confused  so i got yelled at because i completed the requirements for my tasks which apparently isn t good enough  i m not good enough until i put in extra effort and dedicate my weekends to work  suggesting i take a course related to my skills to help improve my efficiency at work is apparently a terrible idea  even if my boss thought taking a side course wasn t the best idea  approaching it in a civil manner like  that s a good suggestion but at the moment i think it s not the most efficient way to approach your tasks  here s what i suggest  instead of flipping out and accusing me of not owning my work  would ve been appreciated  did i not take charge of my task and complete it  did i not just  do it    i wasn t even asking for a raise  i was just minding my own business and did what was assigned to me  so apparently this is what i get for being professional  respectful  and understanding  i get chewed out for being an obedient employee because i didn t go the extra mile to research my task and sacrifice my weekends to work  apparently  basic requirements  arent even basic anymore  so coming into work on time  doing my 9-6  looking presentable  not causing any trouble  being respectful to my boss and coworkers  suggesting improvements to help further my skills to ultimately improve the company  and completing my tasks isn t enough now ,f70r2j

272,Finally fulfilled a dream,so to pre-face  this is my first post  i ve lurked here for a while and my ideals on life and work pretty much line up with the views shared by all of you   so to the good part  i live in the south in one of these  great  right to work states where unless you are the owners son or have a degree  accounting medical etc  you re going to make  10- 12 an hr  don t matter if you re digging ditches in the 100 degree sun or sitting behind a desk   10- 12 an hr  so  i find myself working at a fancy housing community  where no one has jobs and look down on the working class  but that s a whole other subject we ll go down on a different day  so to the actual job  easy stuff  file paper work  make copies  yano office stuff  but the boss  is a karen to a t  in the 3 months she s been there  she s has gone through two office admins  has to be them  right  so anyways  long story short  boss takes 2 vacations in 2 months  leaves me by myself to run a club house on my second day  and does the schedule to fit her needs and home life but doesn t consult with anyone else about theirs  so  i had enough  i called boss s boss and asked for a private talk  big boss shows up and i go on to explain that little boss is an asshole and they could train a monkey to do her job  big boss looks like she just saw a monkey fucking a football  she then says that i m way too comfortable calling my boss an asshole and she couldn t make me respect her  i agreed that i couldn t respect a boss who wouldn t do what was expected of her workers  i knew what was coming  so i just took their key off my key ring and handed it to her n walked away   it felt great to actually tell a boss how you feel  kind of like a weight off my shoulders   just wanted to share that ,f734pv
273,I have to develope a concept to outsource one of our testing stations,i'm a electrical engineer and i usually just work on our products  we develope them ourselves and build and test most of them ourselves   but slowly and slowly we begin to outsource our assembly line   we always had a part of our products made in a  disabled workshop   a place where disabled people work at   now i got the job to develope a test station to outsource the product that is partially made at the disabled workshop completely    there are two problems about this   - the first one is  our assembly line workers think that they get outsourced as punishment for joining the union  when in reality their only chance to keep their jobs is to be part of the union  our management does a pretty good job with spreading fear about this   - the second one is  the actual reason for outsourcing is because the disabled worker get super unfair  or let's say controversial  payment    and with this full automatic machine i'm building  they won't gain a additional workplace  but we will probably loose one  if this task is not replaced by something else  i actually don't know   so however it works out  under the line  automatisation is again not used the way it should  i have never seen this process in person before  and although im a huge fan of automatisation this feels wrong  because no-one except our boss is going to benefit from it ,f7bof8
274,I don't see the point in working full time in the developed world anymore if you make less than 60k USD.,i have one friend who loses a third of his income in rent  and another who loses a quarter of his income in taxes  the friend who is losing a quarter of his income in taxes would be losing even more if he were moved out and exposed to sales taxes and property taxes  these guys are making above the median income for my city  and they have the same disposable income as someone who works a dead end job and lives with their parents   if two-thirds of your paycheque is gone before you even get to touch it  what's the point  sure  if you're making tons of money  it might be tolerable  but if so much is taken by the bourgeois and their state that you are forced into having the same lifestyle as an adolescent  why lift a finger  why not leave the country  or work part time  or at the very least  live in an intergenerational house to keep taxes and expenses down ,f5sm40

278,The trick society pulled on you.,  modern slavery is understood by understanding that we are slowly being stripped  as a species  from our ability to provide essential resources to ourselves independently from government or outside sources  they used several different means to secure food  water  and land  they don't have it all yet  but it's a big picture game  and they'll play inch by inch until they've accomplished complete control over everything we cannot live without      you don't know how to provide yourself with food  shelter  or water  and you don't want to die  instead of you knowing how to be truly independent  the government monopolizes resources that you cannot live without  their system becomes the middleman to our survival  subconsciously  this lack of understanding leads to a lack of security  which leads us to a position where we have no choice but to become  and remain involved with the game     those who have not woken up are not slaves because they do not wish to leave   they're so dependent on the system for their resources and happiness  that they cannot imagine a life without it  it's not their fault because seeing past the systems tricks require us to really come into acceptance that the system is incapable of fulfilling our true values  so it causes us to abandon old solutions in search of more novel ones  or it causes us to self destruct      most of us are brainwashed  and believe what we desire can be achieved by staying asleep or on the racetrack  cognitive dissonance play's into all of this but is largely out of the scope of this post  how the trick functions on a civilizational scale is very impressive  that was a pretty good trick ,f6w4so

289,Hey all! Independent workers unite!,    i dream  utopianly  of a future with a cohesive unit of countries that can build the most important infrastructural change of the way we see life  housing and work   this change is to give all of us a  platform   i m 21  but i began thinking about this when i was still in high school  2016    i know a lot of you here are like me  non-functioning in professional environments  not fond of routine  soul-crushing work and 40-hour workweeks  or more   we are also creative souls  i d argue there s some burst of creativity in all of us when the platform of ours allows it   i won t go further in depth of all my utopian views on life  although i love talking about them  but i want to talk a little about this platform  and this vague idea of hope i have   so essentially i dream of a collective platform for all human beings  with a package of a functional housing  food rations and other needed utilities  also essentially  how you d imagine a scientist to plan a colony to live and function if they were set to live on mars with sparse utilities   with this collective platform  which we are more or less seeing built already today  to landlords big benefit  hyper-functioning apartments with compact sizes costing a fortune for the ones living there  you d have everything you needed for a humble living   not to go all bernie sanders on ya ll  but if you d do the math  i m sure that the reason the enablement of this collective platform isn t already available is one of greed  and not implausibility   so with your basic essentials covered  it would allow everyone in this future to decide for themselves if they d want to work or not   you don t want to work  no problem  you ll not have an excess of currency that you can use to build on to your platform and your  resume  but you will be granted peace in your pursuit of whatever creative  earthly desires you want   you want to work  let s redefine  work  work is now  eustress  meaning  positive stress  or stress that you are exposed to when working excessively towards a positive dream or desire   this work  this  eustress  is something i d wager that absolutely most of us have  the value of your work is measured in your own enjoyment  and excess  building  towards your own platform is optional  not mandatory to live   this idea is vague  not precise  but it captures the capitalist nature of the world and puts the humbleness of the working class up against the billionaire class   the billionaire class is effectively opposing any worker s utopia by collectively  subconsciously  using their own  eustress  their dreams and workings  against the rest of the world s  eustress    our current system  opposing our utopia  wishes constantly to measure and compare one s work and wealth  this is extremely problematic when building a collective platform with a cohesive unit as it values one person over another  and there s no way to do this consistently without it resulting in pure superficialcy   obviously  this will seem unachievable and utopian  not to mention   it is  possible to achieve a platform of stability and  thus  fight for  eustress  and one s dream  in today s system as well   it is only natural that you d work strongly towards your own well-being and your own dreams  especially when you know there s a possible light at the end of the tunnel  instead of putting down your book and pc screen to fight the system that put the book and pc into your hands in the first place   as said  my idea is vague  but here s my ultimate goal of my idea    with a strong portion of the world sharing my burning desire of an  antiwork society  i want to work one day to build a movement  for optionality    tech automation is taking over the world  we should be able to  as humans  reap the benefits  not lose our source of income   i hope one day i will have more clarity than i do today  in order to create a movement for a better world  i ve learned that i can find happiness in just about any place of the world  as long as i m working for something i believe in ,f6gprx

335,A wonderfully concise breakdown of why you hate working under capitalism (10 min read),the following is a transcript of the 2-part video series titled  what is capitalism  by brendan mccooney   i've taken the time to post them here as i feel this is the best 10-minute pitch of an analysis of capitalism i've come across on the internet   enjoy    barter is a simple system of commodity exchange in which people trade one commodity for another  we can represent this with the diagram  c-c  commodity for commodity   as trading grows  and there are more and more commodities to be traded  societies began to develop money  money can be any universally desired commodity with a stable value  silver  gold  axes  cattle  etc  what makes money different from other commodities is the fact that it can be exchanged for any commodity  for instance  at one point in history the gold commodity could buy anything  but donkey commodities or potato commodities couldn t  thus  money became a way of expressing the value of any commodity a property unique to one commodity which is singled out from all other commodities and given the name  money   so now  instead of c-c we have c-m-c  trading a commodity for money in order to trade for another commodity  both types of exchange existed side by side for a long time before c-m-c began to dominate   the establishment of money as a universal equivalent  a commodity which can buy anything  gives money status as the ultimate form of social power  people then  can be tempted to hoard money  not for the sake of buying commodities  but just for the sake of having more money   not only does money create this temptation  but it also requires some process where money is hoarded sometimes and then injected back into circulation at others  this is because we need to have just the right amount of money in circulation to represent the values of all the commodities that are being traded  c-m-c  at a given time  commodity production is erratic  if we don t have the right amount of money in circulation commodities either can t circulate or circulate at erratic prices  the only way to solve this problem is to take money out of circulation when it s not needed and then to inject it back in when it is   so  with money there is both the possibility and the need for m-c-m  that is some process which circulates money just for the sake of circulating money  but why would someone want to trade money for an equal amount of money  this only makes sense if they are making more money from the trade than what they began with   in c-m-c people are trading  with money  one commodity for another  because they have a use for the other commodity  in simple commodity production  people are exchanging these  uses  or  use values   but the purpose of m-c-m isn t to trade use values at all but to get a greater quantity of the same thing  money  instead of being qualitative it s a quantitative process   now how do you get more money  with c-m-c exchange only happens if people agree to trade things for equal value  people measure the value of commodities with money and exchange them for money  if i sell something i ve made for  10 and then go spend that  10 on stuff i am essentially trading  10 of my labor for  10 of other people s labor  an equal exchange has taken place with the aid of money as a measuring of value  the value that is being measured corresponds to the amount of labor that has gone into making the commodity   but if we are going to do m-c-m we need an unequal exchange  we need to end up with more money than we started with  how is this possible   well  i could sell a commodity for more than its worth  that is for more than its labor value  what happens when i do that  this can only work if i have a monopoly on selling this commodity  because if i m selling for more than something s worth other people can just undersell me  if i do have a monopoly i can count on the fact that i won t have a monopoly forever  when one person profits from an unequal exchange it attracts other people into that industry  soon there are competitors all trying to undersell each other  eating away at the profit margin until the product trades at its value again   so  if there is a tendency for exchange to gravitate toward equal exchange  where do we get the profit we need for m-c-m  exchange equalizes within a closed economic system where buyers and sellers are aware of what the money price is of all commodities  but what if there are were other people somewhere else in a different economic community who valued commodities differently than us maybe it was easier or harder for them to make some commodities and so we could benefit from unequal exchange with them  or maybe commodity exchanged hadn t even become generalized in their culture yet and so they didn t have a good sense of the value of something   this is exactly what the early merchant class was all about  savvy traders traversed the globe looking for  bargains  trying to find cultures willing to part with their pelts  spices  jewels and gold for less so they could return home with commodities and sell them for more  and when they couldn t find unequal exchanges they made them in the form of theft  the early merchant class was rife with pirates who made a living from stealing commodities in order to sell them   the other class that mastered m-c-m early on was the money lending class  by lending money to people and then charging them interest on the loan  the money lending class could turn a profit  this was called usury and it was frowned upon at many times in history  even outlawed at times   it should be pointed out that neither merchant capital or usury actually created more value  they merely took commodities from one place and moved them to another  but this moving of commodities was such a source of wealth that it pushed traders and loans to the farthest corners of the universe in search of profit   and so  the world was slowly brought together by merchants exploring the world looking for unequal exchanges to get rich off of  but whenever merchants pushed to the borders of the economic universe they found that the economic integration they had spawned had gone and created their worst nightmare  equal exchange  as cultures were brought into closer contact  as people began to find out how much things exchanged for in different places  as more and more merchants began traveling the same silk roads  it was harder and harder to find people to rip off   and so those who lived by unequal exchange had to find new ways to make profit  they began to ask   what if there was a magic commodity   a commodity which could produce more value than it cost to buy   they found such a commodity it was human labor       amp x200b   when i sell the products of my own labor on the market i get all the money myself  but what if i am selling my labor to someone else  if i sell my labor to a capitalist for a wage  the capitalist can pay less for my wage than he sells the commodity for  thus  he transfers the inequality of profit in exchange into the production process   let s take a closer look  when i sell something i ve made myself on the open market  i am selling a commodity  when i sell my labor to someone else i am selling my labor power  that is  my capacity to do labor  how much i produce is subject to how hard i work  the quality of the tools and materials i use and the organization of the workplace  i m paid by the hour  so the harder i work the more i can produce per hour  thus   the amount of money i m paid doesn t necessarily correspond to the amount of value i produce  if it did the capitalist wouldn t be making a profit  this is what capitalists do  they profit from inequality in the sphere of production instead of exchange  they are modern day pirates   why are workers willing to work for less than the value of what they produce  wages  instead of being related to the value of the commodities workers produce  are related to the amount of money necessary to  reproduce the worker  this is a fancy term for  what it takes to get the worker to show up for work the next day  this usually means paying a worker enough for rent  food  entertainment and whatever else the general standard of living in a society requires  this cost of  reproducing the worker  varies from place to place over time as the standard of living adjusts to the whims of capitalist development  for instance  the standard of living for most americans has fallen in the last 30 years making labor power cheaper for capitalists to buy   but still this doesn t explain why workers consent to this  after all  they choose to work for a wage rather than simply produce goods themselves  well  many people do choose to work for themselves if they can  in fact  as real wages have fallen in the american economy the percentage of self-employed people has risen  but in order to produce commodities yourself you have to have access to tools  materials  a work area  we call all of these things  means of production   in a capitalist society a small amount of people  capitalists  own the vast majority of the means of production  thus  workers have no choice but to sell their labor power for a wage to a capitalist  this has caused some people to refer to wage labor as  wage slavery   this didn t just happen by accident one day  the process by which simple commodity producers farmers  craftsmen  etc were deprived of their means of production so that they had to work as wage laborers was a long and violent one  it demolished communities  destroyed cultures  eroded feudalism  etc  this process  accomplished by dispossession  outright theft and usury  is often referred to as  primitive accumulation  to differentiate it from the  capitalist accumulation  it made possible   along with the profits of merchant capital  primitive accumulation provided the money and capital needed to deprive most of the world of their means to produce and concentrate these means of production  as private property  in the hands of a relatively small class of people  the capitalist class ,f6w9ak

342,"Why are public companies, that exist by a public charter, not run for the benefit of the public? Spitballing here",it is my contention that public companies that have shares for sale to the public should be run under rules that benefit the public  and their workers  ideas such as   1  no ceo has a salary   bonus structure that exceeds 20x the pay of the lowest worker  2   no stock buybacks allowed using corporate cash or borrowed money 1  3  all employees are stakeholders and as such are entitled to a share of profits not to be less than 25   4  all overseas production is if shipped back and sold in america is taxed at 50  of value   5  stock compensation is disallowed    6  perks are considered earned income for those that enjoy them  private jet  the ceo pays for it or can choose to fly commercial   for privately held companies  you'd be able to do whatever you wanted to do - pay yourself a trillion a year if you're the owner if you can get away with it   the point here is public companies should be run for the benefit and advancement of their workers and the public    any other ideas ,f6muku

395,Can't have peace of mind even after quitting the job,hello everyone  i have a good friend who just experienced a boss with such sense of entitlement that left her speechless and enraged   so basically this friend has worked in this job position for a meager salary many years with just annual inflation adjustment raise  about 2-3  sometimes the adjustment was even held up when the boss claimed  funding problems  she was even cut to pt for quite a while because of another  funding problem  she was taken for granted and belittled for so long that she finally got fed up and found another job   the real drama started after she handed in two-week notice  the boss suddenly claimed her being  irreplaceable  and said  although he didn't have problem with her going for a higher pay position  she should give two months of notice  later on  he even demanded her coming back on weekends to train his new staff on a volunteer basis without any pay or with a gift certificate gesture of  50 per day of work  even this was at the suggestion of hr personnel  after she departs for her new job  she was simply astonished and enraged at such narcissism   she wondered what her soon to be ex-boss would do if she refused such  generous offer  would he just spread the rumor to her new employer or ask hr to list her as  ineligible for re-hire  for the future background check   well  many of you suggested that you just quit the job you hate for your psychological benefit  my poor friend's case make it seems to me nowadays you can't even get rid of toxic behavior after quitting the job  hopefully this said friend can survive and have a better experience in her new job ,f3oafn

398,It looks like a cult or a sick play,when i look for a job  all i see is demands like 'you have to be client-oriented' or 'motivated'  these things are generally vague and it seems most employers know it's all nonsense    so  in the end  you read all these requirements and write in you cv that you actually have these qualities  all the while you know it's absurd and you know nobody cares about this shit anyway  the employer reads your cv and understands that you have all the required qualities  but i guess  fully understands that people write that in their cvs because that's how you're supposed to act if you want to get a job  thus  you know you aren't like that  the employer knows that no one needs most of these qualities  how do you measure it anyway  and yet we all have to pretend like it's all very serious  it's like some experiment with dogs or monkeys  they have to put the ball in the right place  the red ball in one box  the blue ball -- in another  so  you have to read what you have to be like  write it in your cv and the employer will understand that you get the game    talking to people during job interviews is very strange  they look like mostly normal people  but play this stupid game with all the jargon and all the techniques they've learned in those never-ending seminars about 'human resources' management    when i look at what people are doing in those offices and when i learn of all the idiotic requirements  it seems like some cult or some surrealistic play  people must enjoy doing worthless things and be motivated ,f3aa2i

424,Boundaries in the Workplace,i ve noticed a lot of posts by people in this sub talk about being overworked  frustrated and sometimes suicidal because of their jobs  we can arguably chalk a bit of that up to a broken capitalist system that doesn t favor the majority of people  american here  but i m sure this frustration is felt elsewhere  does the system need changed  clearly  but in the meantime  the biggest impact i ve had with general workplace frustrations has been to establish boundaries for myself and to follow them as much as i can    these are things i ve noticed over the years that i d assume to be universally true throughout the workforce  i ll refer to them in this post as  truths  i m going to use them as fact here for the purpose of this argument and these boundaries    there will always be more work     you will be asked or told to take on more tasks than you initially had    you will be asked or told to work more than what you should average    you are responsible for your own actions  thoughts and feelings     you are not responsible for the actions  thoughts and feelings of others     you cannot predict the future with reasonable or realistic accuracy  not necessarily a work thing  but it s important   there s arguably more  your boss is not your friend  but these listed truths feel more universal to me  you can add or subtract as you wish  and if you notice other universal truths that i may have overlooked  i will edit them into this writing and cite your username   i can reasonably adjust my boundaries  but i must have them and i must stick to them  this is the power i have  and i will not give it away  i cannot predict the consequences  but i recognize that there will be some  most of the time  my direct supervisor has respected my boundaries  but i see the struggle every day on these forums and at my own workplace  and having boundaries might help deal with at least some of the listed truths we all face    the starting place for boundaries   proper safety gear regulations  you have the right to be safe at work  if you don t have the right equipment protective gear to perform a task  i ll make sure to provide it if i can  or find someone who will  i won t perform tasks without proper equipment  if it s not safe to do something  i voice that concern through the chain of command  and if i still don t like the answer  i move up with that concern until it s fleshed out enough to show it s not a concern or until something is done about it  if someone comes to me with a safety concern  i ll follow up with a safety rep and get that issue addressed  if someone asks or tells me to do something that s unsafe  i politely refuse  and if possible  i suggest alternate ways to complete the task  i never ask anyone to perform work that s unsafe     proper training  some jobs will wear your body out or just generally be unsafe if you don t have the proper technique  on top of that  if you re not properly trained  you will be at a significant disadvantage in terms of workplace performance  most places i ve worked have subpar training courses  and some have had none at all  it s all tribal on-the-job experience with no direction at all  if i m not sure what s going on  i find out what i m supposed to be responsible for  and make sure i understand that job and what s expected of me     roles and responsibilities  your roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined  during a training at work recently  they mentioned not knowing what s expected of you accounted for the majority of stress in the workplace  personally  when i ve been in that situation  and when i ve seen people in that situation  it gets noticeably more stressful  if your role  responsibilities  goals or deadlines  etc aren t clearly defined  ask for clarification  if that s not clear  persist until it is clear     workplace culture  you have the right and responsibility to create a workplace culture that is fair  inclusive  and generally positive for yourself and others  i ve met some bitter people at every job i ve had  they shit on every single thing that comes up without thought  if it s happening  it s bad  did we get a raise  the raise isn t enough  are we reworking processes to make jobs easier for people  they re doing it wrong  i don t want to be like that  i want to be open to ideas from anyone  even if they aren t necessarily feasible  encouragement requires nothing  and opens doors to everything  i also try to call out elitist behavior  racism  sexism  age discrimination  slurs  and any other bullshit  sometimes it s difficult to do but i always win those battles  there s no reason to denigrate entire groups of people like that  i m not perfect and nobody else is either  but there s a pretty clear line when it comes to those behaviors listed     respect in the workplace  you have the right to be respected  and it s your responsibility to respect those you work with and for as well  demand it in your every action  you re putting in the time like everyone else  working hard doesn t matter  it s a bullshit misnomer to get people riled up about their fellow peers  if you or your coworkers aren t able to complete the tasks as assigned  that s the fault of the business  not the employee  don t argue outliers  jobs should be doable by damn near the entire bell curve of people qualified  in my 8 years at this company  i ve never let anyone yell at me about doing my job  and even when they get heated and make threats or whatever  i make it clear that i m doing my job as assigned  and that s all i m responsible for  if i feel like doing extra  i will  but it s not required and i won t work like it is  my company has clear rules against retaliation that management takes very seriously  but you have the right to be safe from retaliation     hours and days worked  you have the right to know your schedule in a reasonable amount of time before those days or hours arrive  in jobs with flexible schedules  you have the right to set your schedule as needed  and your employer must work with that without retaliation  every job is different here  some places have set schedules  some have flexible ones  some are dependent on business  but realistically  any business should know how many people they need  when they need them  and for how long  there s algorithms for everything  just make a usable schedule  flex people  once you set a schedule  and your employer okays that schedule  they need to stick with that  and when they make a mistake  it s their responsibility to correct it without retaliation    overtime  you have the right to be paid overtime in accordance with state and federal laws  check them out  my employer is badass so i ve never had to question it but there s obviously shysters out there  you are giving a set amount of time in exchange for a wage  when you give more than that  you deserve fair compensation  this applies to any hourly or salary employee  again  check the law  and track your time  and hold your employer accountable for payments owed to you     working from at home  you must be compensated for the time you put in for your employer  in the modern age  working from home is a privilege that is offered to some people so they can handle family situations like children and such  but some people put in their time at work  and then bring their work home  if you are not getting paid for 100  of your time  you should not be working  don t answer emails  don t take calls  nothing  if you re not being paid or you haven t arranged to be compensated for those activities  you should not be doing them     pay or wages and benefits  never work for free  you have the right to a fair and living wage  you have the right to negotiate your wage  you have the right to talk about your wage with other employees or people outside your place of employment  a defined living wage probably depends on your geographical region  it s more expensive to live in new york than alabama  but if you re going in for a job  you should negotiate for the wage you need  and if they don t bite  or just shit on you about it  you don t have to accept that job  again  this is gonna be subjective as hell  but if we want serious wage changes  we have to draw lines in the sand that we will not cross  if benefits are given to you  you have the right to claim them without retaliation  sick days should be used  vacation should be used  since they re given to you specifically to use  they are yours and you use them without shame or guilt    boundaries aren t limited to these alone  but this covers some of the basic things that happen in every workplace  if we draw that line  and stick to it  employers will make changes  they need us  whether they admit it or not  enforce these boundaries  and make sure others see you do it  post them somewhere for people to read  add to them based on your own workplace  if you re an employer  post them in your workplace and follow them  encourage others to follow them as well  change happens when people take individual stands and then unite in an effort to improve conditions and expand opportunities  this is your own personal revolution   full disclosure  i know that i m privileged here  i m a young-ish  white male  college educated  and i work in a white-male-dominated auto factory in a state with a mostly white population  which runs pretty conservative  i didn t start in an office job  but it was clear i had a leg up to get there based on testing  education  skin color and youth  i worked a lot of shit jobs before that  and i ve worked some shit jobs in the plant as well  it hasn t always been a cakewalk but it s much easier now that i m in a position that s more mentally challenging for me  as well as a good wage  so before you take these boundaries as gospel  or bullshit lol  just keep in mind what kind of edge you may have in your own workplace  and what kind of pitfalls might be around the corner without these privileges  only you know what works for you  and while ideals feed our motivation  meals feed our bodies    good luck to everyone struggling out there  hopefully with enough resistance we can make some change happen for the better ,f3dfnd

430,I’m so over the entitlement of employers,saw a job posting that didn t sound too bad and that i m well qualified for and sent my resume  got a nice email inviting me to schedule a phone interview and confirmed for 9 a m  this morning  i spent the evening preparing    today 9a m  came and went and i didn t receive the call  that we confirmed yesterday evening   and instead got an email from the same dude asking when i m available today  umm wtf  so i replied and said something to the effect of  hey sorry i thought we were scheduled for earlier this morning and i was under the impression you d be calling me since your contact number wasn t provided and you have mine  let me know if you d like me to call you instead    the response  oh no worries  so can you do 1 30 pm today   no explanation as to why a reschedule was needed  no apologies for wasting my time  nothing  nope  i m not playing this game  i m not even your employee  i haven t even properly met you people  and you re already acting like you re entitled to treat me like shit  for a job that pays  15- 18 an hour    anyone else have bullshit like this happen during the interview process ,f3es30
431,I was basically fired for not letting my employers treat me like trash.,this might get kinda long  fair warning   i recently took a job at a warehouse for minimum wage  things are pretty rough in unemployment department where i live and the job i had wasn t consistent enough to pay the bills  so i basically had to suck it up and take the job even tho it s way less than i usually get paid  the job is also about a 2 hour bus ride both ways and often i wouldn t get home til very late giving me no time to do anything for myself and too exhausted to look for any better employment   now for minimum wage i expected to just be a cog in the machine and they d give me some menial task to keep me busy all day  to my surprise the boss is introducing me to everyone and telling them i ll be in charge of shipping through the day shift  i just think he means i ll be back there doing shipping things all day or whatever  but after a few days i slowly realize how much responsibility is being shoved in my lap  the training was fucking terrible with nobody wanting to properly explain anything  i like to pride myself on being very quick to learn on the job so i picked it up very quickly and within 2 weeks i was already training new employees  of which there were new ones almost every day do to the high turnover rate  as well as catching shit for stuff that would happen in  my area  since i was in charge of shipping  i ll be honest tho  i was crushing it and was really trying show that i m worth more and deserve a raise  and it seemed like i was actually going to get one  on thursday my boss mentioned wanting to talk to me about taking on even more responsibility at work and i was fully ready to tell him no for unless i got more money  the day was crazy busy and we never got to talk tho  the day was actually so crazy busy that i was having trouble finding time for my breaks all day  i was visibly frustrated when night shift came on and the shift manager basically told me i wasn t allowed to take a break until a bunch of skids were finished and loaded up  this whole job was on my minimum wage shoulders and i had reached my boiling point  i angrily finished the work and loaded it and still was denied my break because for some reason the paperwork and computer stuff was also my job  even tho i d never been shown how to do it  this lead to a screaming match with the shift manager who then sent me home with only 15 mins left on my shift   well i come in yesterday fully ready to quit unless they pay me more  even had a very good conversation with the boss and he was going to go make a case for my raise to the branch manager  instead he comes back with my final pay cheque  they had decided based on the word of the night shift manager  who had of course lied and exaggerated the whole encounter  to just let me go  my boss didn t even get a chance to pitch my case and the person who decided on my firing had never even seen the quality of my work  i had basically put that entire fucked up busy day on my back and carried it to the finish line  but none of it mattered because of what happened in the last 15 mins of my shift after i was treated like a fucking dog with zero rights   and people wonder why i feel like employers are just out to scam me wherever i go  they fucking are   tl dr was mvp for the day in a very underpaid position  worked to my boiling point and fired for not being ok with the measly pay and disrespect  feel like the biggest clown in the fucking universe right now ,f4c45g

441,Coming earlier to work,hello my dear friends   i just wanted to let out some steam  i work at custom support for an online casino  since i've started studying i'm only there 3 times a week so it's bareble although the work is terrible  anyway  honestly i fell like i could write a whole blog about how terrible my job is and how much i hate it despite that the money is not to bad i guess  but that's exactly the point of this post today because what is all the money in the world good for if you're just miserable   so at work we have this policy that they except you to come a little bit earlier before your shift starts  which i  understand  if you don't start on time your co-workers are forced to take call or chats from customers although they might be on break or something like that  so i understand it's only fair to the others  also they pay us extra if get there earlier starting from 20 minutes erlier  but as i have mentioned i started studying now and lately i couldn't make it that early and i even came a few minutes  5 minutes top  to late  i just have been really stressed with a lot of things and i just couldn't make it that early to work   the other day we received a message form work that we should manage our time better since a lot of people have been coming  too late   meaning not twenty minutes early  today i was 3 minutes before my shift starts at work and i alr already got shot on by the shift managers  i told them them that i understand that i should be ready to work when my shift starts but that i'm here and i will be ready and so i was  exactly when my shift started i started taking chats and phone calls  later my boss talked to me to be fair it was a friendly talk  i repeated pretty much what i said before and told him again that i usually do come earlier to work sometimes even 30 minutes  now he said he would mention it to me if it weren't a problem  whatever i smiled it off told him i will try to come earlier again and that's it  but then i checked my clock-in times  well as you can imagine and as i mentioned before i'm actually always on time and start shift as requested earlier  fuck this place  sorry if i wrote this a little bit confusing i'm at work right now i have a  feeling cocktail  of tiredness  anger and anxiety  i was just writing without really thinking ,f3szwj

446,Reasons to work!,why do we work  i am going to list all the reasons i have read and heard from folks who  love  working  i am going refute each and every one of them and you may too in the comments below     - passion for the work i do   - pay my bills and debt   - support my loved ones who may not be able to work themselves  due to numerous genuine reasons    - need a reason to shave  shower  make my hair and groom myself    - not get depressed staying home  passion   ok so  if you re doing it for passion  would you still work if you weren t paid for it   money wins always  what you call passion is actually something else  it s an incentive which is recognition or appreciation leading to money j  pay my bills   ok this is a genuine reason  not refuting this one  but what a life it is to live just to pay bills  rather than work  explore other options in doing some small business or create a plan to get rid of bills forever  other than suicidej   support loved ones   alright so you have kids and you need to support them since they can t work as of yet  genuine reason  period   need a reason to shave and groom  comon man  you can do that even better if you don t work  these nuts   not get depressed   if you don t work  you have 8 hours to do countless shit to not get depressed  go figure  the very idea of working to not get depressed is itself fuckin depressing   so  going through all dis  i guess  supporting loved ones  and those who cannot work  very old good parents  sick wife or husband etc  is a genuine reason  if that s your reason  by all means  continue to work because it s the only thing left in you to make you human    cheers,f2d8ap

492,A short story how I found out that I am anti-work,when i finoshed school with 18  in my country i have to chose between military or civil service for a year  not eager to go to the military i decided on civil service   the job sucked  civil service was simply a means to get people to do stuff nobody else wants to do  so in true corporate fashion you simply go to papa state and make them force people to do it   i didn't even have the worst job  instead of working as a nurse i worked in a christian youth club  had to clean up and make food there  but well  being as anti-social as i am it simply wasn't for me  but as you are forced to do it there's no other choice   my boss there was pissed off by me  because well  me being fresh out of school thought that they tell me what to do and that's it  yeah  she wanted me to find everything which needs doing myself  basically that meant stuff like cleaning floors i never even deemed dirty to begin with  so well   days flew by  i hated them  it stressed me out and i noticed it taking a toll on me  so i went to the doctors  told her about it  how i am stressed  how i think stuff like that is just slavery with extra steps   she looked at me  gave me this disgusted look  acted like i am crazy  and all she told me was basically  duh  that's life  deal with it   time goes by  i tried to do my best at the job  but well  it wasn't me  the most christian thing i did - letting a girl scared to go back home sleep at the club - was heavily punished  boss told me that she could call the police and so on  basically made it clear that she thinks of everybody at the club as possible thieves  jesus christ  and this person was in charge of a christian youth club    anyways  my time there came to an ende  i went back to school to get a university entramce degree  yadda  yadda   shortly before getting it i had to go to the aforementioned doctor again  this time not on my own accord though  i basically went crazy  fear and panic disorder  which  as people at the psychologic hospital told me  can be the result of being stressed for too long  great  so basically maybe the doctor should've taken me serious the first time i visited her  ,f26flc

505,"Rise of fin-tech apps proof of financial services industry scrambling to indoctrinate Millennial/Gen Z into working harder and funneling more money into the ""free"" market for minimal returns?",obviously we all know that apps like robinhood  acorns  stash  etc are growing their user-base rapidly  with the average age of users being somewhere in their mid 30's  anybody else feel like these apps are sort of the last frontier in trying to stop people from waking up to the horrors of capitalism and work culture   my problem with these apps   1  obviously the fact that the only way anybody could conceivably make money off of these apps is by owning stock  ie being complicit in the exploitation of labor and the destruction of our environment all the while funneling money up into financial institutions never to be circulated in the markets in which most people actually participate  whether or not someone is cognizantly aware that value is only created through exploitation under capitalism  it gets young people comfortable with participating in the system in such a removed and seemingly innocuous way as to prevent this realization from occurring  or getting people into a  means justify the ends  mindset   they're breeding grounds for the next generation of morally bankrupt ceos  2  the language and marketing tactics of these companies seem to align a lot with the  self made  or  hustle culture  talk   just the name  robinhood  implies seizing value from the wealthy  lol  or acorns'  mighty oaks grow  slogan  that has conveniently risen with 1099 work and other gig systems  established for no other reason but to further deny workers basic dignities like healthcare  minimum wage  workplace protections  etc  while pushing a narrative of radical individualism   people want to be financially secure  and these apps are exploiting that aspiration  all the while profiting off of money held within these accounts  as well as the transactions taking place on the platforms to  at best  pitch some pennies at their users  who are engaging in a basically unwinnable system for an individual investor   essentially  like capitalism or the lottery  they're selling a conceivably winnable system that they know is set up to extract more value than it can deliver to nearly every person engaging with it  3   the notion that extracting value from public markets is possible positions those markets as  good  things for people   people can see minuscule returns by shifting money between different companies  ipos  mutual funds  etc which undeniably evokes positive associations between one's self as an  owner  of these properties  and the properties themselves  one might buy a share of amazon and flip it for a couple hundred dollars and think  oh man  i love amazon  all the while this company is passing off the cost of its rampant environmental destruction  and the decimation of local markets on to everyone to the tune of inconceivable amounts of money in the long term  4  the concept of longterm investment or retirement investment for middle and working class individuals is predicated on the manufactured reality that selling the majority of your waking hours through laboring for a company does not entitle you  in a civil society  to survival  healthcare  the ability to own a subsistence level of property  like a home  source of transportation  and food  a reasonable degree of postsecondary education  the basic dignity of being able to raise a child or two if one chooses  and the right to retire when you are reasonably unable to work  their existences pose financial failure as a personal failure  and further push the notion that an inability to survive or plan for the future is your fault  not the fault of capitalism  and the only way to overcome the horrors imposed on you by the  free  market  is to pump even more money into it   i don't think that this is a conspiracy or anything- really the same could be said for investment firms generally   but the reason these apps emerged and play so differently on the unique anxieties of young people than do companies like fidelity or schwab  is because research is showing that young people don't trust financial institutions  and are growing increasingly disillusioned with the free market   the financial services industry needed a makeover and these apps filled in that gap   i really hope people see through the narrative that they're pushing and realize that they need to focus that energy on working toward a society in which workers are entitled to a larger slice of the value that they create  not a society in which a person needs to throw their money at the market with the prayer that it will dick over someone else so that they can get a percentage of return that isn't even keeping up with the rate of inflation ,f3ovn1

519,EMT in the ER continued...,i made a post recently where i basically just complained about my job   i know people have it worse than me so i'm sorry for that     anyways  there was an incident recently where the charge nurse sent alot of people home because we were slow   she also sent home the unit secretary  so we effectively had no secretary   she looked at me and said you're gonna be the secretary for the day   now this isn't a kush easy position where you just answer phones   you have to talk to doctors and surgeons at various facilities and know who to transfer where  and also make sure forms and various paperwork is signed correctly and given to the right people   it's alot of work and knowledge that i have no experience in   also the only reason they asked me is because my pay is the lowest in the er so she could save the hospital money by having me cover two positions  i told her no   i said i wasn't hired to be a secretary  i wasn't trained to be a secretary  and you don't pay me more for having crosstrained in two positions   she was mad but there was nothing she could do about it and she had to play secretary for the day   my point is that sometimes you have to stand up for yourself and say no  otherwise they'll walk all over you   we also ended up getting crazy busy so we would have drowned with me trying to learn that position on the fly   thanks for listening  this is strangely cathartic for me to write it all out ,f00qt9

559,I got a promotion,i know lots of these posts are jaded  for good reason  about our toxic work culture and the lies of capitalism  but i am extremely lucky    i believe everyone deserves what i have and i don t buy into the meritocracy  so i hope to use my privilege for good and assert that it was not uniquely  earned  but that it is truly deserved by everyone    i work at a place that allows me time and location flexibility  encourages my autonomy and my manager values me as a person  i previously had about 6 weeks paid vacation and as many work from home day s as i needed  now that i got promotion  i have slightly more than a comfortable living wage to be able to also appropriately save for retirement  there are quiet rooms where you can rest and recharge in the middle of the day - and people are actually encouraged to use them as such  i also now have  flex time  so there is no cap on the paid day s i can take off  typically companies do that and then assign you so much work that you can t take time off  but based on the last six years and the fact that they said they want me to keep doing what i m doing even with the promo- i don t think that s going to happen as of now  we are not punished for making missteps  we are actually coached and people aren t afraid when they mess up   i know this could flip at any moment  and that i could be replaced like it s nothing  but i really feel like i am getting a taste of what work should be  it s sad but true that much of this privilege i have is indirectly at the expense of others based off of wealth and the class system in the us  i am a black woman  and of course there is a disproportionately smaller portion of us in this environment    my life has improved significantly- health and mental health and even relationships  since starting this job  if you re in a bad spot  i encourage you to leave because your next opportunity may be worlds better  i know that s not always the case  but i truly never thought i would have this  i still don t really consider it a  success story  because again  i am lucky and i m just experiencing what we truly all deserve and could give each other if it weren t for income inequality and greed  i am sure people will ask  i work in tech  but not in silicone valley ,f210a3

583,A new shift supervisor started working last week and he only harasses me at least once a day,i dont know what his problem is but he literally has it out for only me i dont know if he's racist but he goes out of his way to find anything to harass me  i work in a warehouse i lift thousands of pounds a day and the second he sees me walking even slightly slow he will call me out and tell me to hustle regardless of how many thousands of pounds ive lifted during the shift  he stares at me constantly all day when i am in range of him and he randomly walks around the warehouse only to see if he can catch me not working for even a second and call me out  today i was doing a order it was 3000 pounds in total so it would naturally take me a few hours to do it  he was walking around saw me and yelled down the isle and asked me what order i had  me not thinking and asking him what order he was looking for i gave him an answer and he told me to hurry up and that a truck was waiting for that order  i quickly hurried and put together the order as fast as possible to find out that there was actually no truck waiting at all and he said that for no reason but to harass me  working there has not become completely intolerable yet but it is starting to irritate me as working there was fine before this new shift supervisor got hired  im thinking of buying a go pro and hiding it in my jacket and recording him and sending it to the higher ups as i don't deserve thia unnecessary bullshit if i lose my job its not the ens of the world for me as other warehouses are paying a few dollars more for the same labour ,f07o6t
584,Has anyone seen the documentary called Gloriavale?,okay please hear me out  and i ll say up front there is a lot wrong with that community  so many things that i can t even begin to explain  but one part of it was very fascinating to me  and it was the way the community worked together to do important tasks    if you have not seen it  it s a documentary about an extremely religious  you could probably use the word cult here  community located in new zealand  they all live in a town they built themselves  very insulated from the outside world  now  it  is  my view that it is a cult of some sort  but the community works together to do important tasks  such as running a factory to bring in money  some farming  from the looks of it  cattle raising  etc  a lot of the things you need to run a community    now  i did have a lot of issues with how this was implemented  there is zero room for any individualism or free time in the cult community  i disagreed with that entirely  but i liked seeing people pull together to produce something for everyone  and it s something i ve been thinking about   of course  i am still very much anti work  i didn t like that people s jobs were picked for them  and that they were forced to work for long hours  all of the single young women were forced into childcare and kitchen duties  whilst the men built the actual communal buildings and worked in their factories  i had a lot of issues with that as well    i think if this kind of community  sans all the insane shit  were to be run by an atheist agnostic anti work  person  it could be run in a way where you only work two out of the five days for the community  or perhaps you dedicate 3 hours of your day 4 days a week  something of that nature  everyone would benefit from the communal work  and you would still be able to pick your job  although some jobs just need to be done i m not sure how to reconcile that  you d still have time to be your individual self  so to work on your hobbies in your ample free time    of course i do not have the logistics for this  this was just a thought experiment i was mulling about in my head  and i was curious to see what others thought of tight-knit communities that pulled together to get things done ,ezm9gg

591,My observations, disclaimer  the word  you  is used in a general sense  so please don t think i m targeting any of you here   developed society is at a point where people work for hours on end for meager pay just to afford basic shelter and enough food to quell hunger pangs  we ve created a system wherein people demand unnecessary things - and things  and things  and iterations of more things - to fill the void left by modern life  yet  when those who are poor and cannot afford the things upon things that consumers are inundated with and hypnotized to  need  they are shamed  they are told to get another job or to pull up their bootstraps and deal with it because that s what everyone else does  they ignore the fact that these people are oftentimes working 40  hours a week and are incapable of missing one day of work in fear of being unable to afford the cost of living  the cost of living  for crying out loud  not the cost of frivolous extras that we re convinced are essential to operate or a 25 room mansion in the hills - just the cost to wake up and breathe every day  we are so enamored by the so called  american dream  that we dismiss anything that even hints at the possibility of our country s societal foundation having faults  you may not deem flipping burgers or waiting tables as actual work  but that doesn t remove the fact that the people working these jobs are dedicating their time to something less-than-pleasant just to be able to afford some semblance of life  then you laugh at them and make a mockery of them in front of a restaurant full of like-minded elitists  all the while utilizing their services  services that without you would likely starve because you re too stupid  too lazy  or too entitled to perform the tasks that you denounce as  not real work  you  on the other hand  do  real  work akin to twiddling your thumbs in your butthole  which affords you a cushy life in which your hardest choice is what tie you re going to put on every morning   and then there are those who have worked their entire lives  dedicating 40 or more years to their chosen career  only to be forced to subsist on ramen noodles and crackers to be able to afford the cost of life at an older age with the limited pension and social security the government doles out  if you re lucky enough to have anything  these people prepared and contributed money like they were told  only to be shafted when they reach the age that they re finally allowed to be  free  some rejoin the workforce because they just cannot cope  effectively relinquishing their  freedom  and literally working themselves to death  now  think about those who never had stable careers and only worked random jobs to afford the necessities  they aren t granted the option of social securities or pensions  if they don t work  they become homeless or die  yet if they choose to rely on the government to afford their basic needs  they are deemed a leech or a drain on the system  people would rather others die at their places of work than to contribute the taxes to help their fellow man  there is no winning here  society will always find a way to condemn the way you live and that needs to change ,f0daw1

604,I spent most of my morning sobbing and feeling trapped within capitalism,i work full time and about 70  of my job consists of sitting idly at a desk while i watch the sunlight dwindle from my office  i'm so sick of feeling like i can't enjoy my life  anytime i'm off work i dread going back and anytime i'm at work i'm counting down the minutes til i can leave   i don't know how to escape  i don't know why i have to do this  it feels like there's no way out and i'm being crushed by the weight of the world's expectations  what is there even to live for if i have to work so much to just afford living ,f0fp9r
605,What antiwork means to me,fair warning  i will most likely delete this in a few days as i am a lurker at heart and leaving behind old posts comments gives me anxiety   my parents both hated their jobs so i went to school and started working in a career that  to others   sounds so fun  well  it s not  my actual work i don t mind  it s all the stupid shit around it i hate  pointless meetings  project requests due asap with insufficient parameters so i have to chase people for details  deadlines i kill myself to meet before finding out they were just arbitrarily chosen  dealing with people who believe their uneducated opinion is just as valuable as my experienced  highly educated opinion  people who will obsess over a pointless detail  making me do extra work all because they can t  pull the trigger  and move forward  and omg the emails i get  asking me to resend the same damn things over and over again because i have 60  people in my current job that refuse to learn how to search their emails or save organize what i send them the first time   people say  work somewhere else  i ve worked in other places and joined professional groups and read blogs and they are all like this  even the  good companies  are riddled with stupid inefficiencies    people say  work for yourself  yeah  so i can spend even less time doing the actual work i spend 7  years training myself to do  because finding jobs  pitching clients  handling all the administrative work myself  or worse hiring people to do it for me  that i must train and manage  all eats into the time i could be spending doing real work   and this is why i am  antiwork  it s not about being lazy or that i m in the wrong career or i need to find a better job  i m doing exactly what i went to college for  i couldn t imagine doing any other job  and yet  this bullshit system of going all through school for a job and then paying for a degree to get a job and then finding a place to live close to a job  or jobs  and buying a car just to get myself to a building i don t want to sit in for 40  hours a week  where i earn 1 4 - 1 10 of what i am actually worth  all so i can pay back the loans for the degree and the house and the car for the job that is sucking the life out of me  it is a fucking rigged game and i am sick of playing    i m also sick of occasionally meeting my boomer parents and their friends for dinner and they all talk politics and complain that universal basic income is a pipe dream  and no one deserves welfare or  15 an hour when they sit on their asses  demanding that below-minimum-wage-slaves scurry to bring them free bread and refill water for  3 an hour plus a  2 tip  and they all have pensions and social security  yes  some earned it and others are using their spouse s benefits because they could afford not to have to work  and they all bought their houses low and sold high and have priced everyone young out of the market   this job  this life just isn t worth the effort i ve already put into it  and i get why people fight so hard against people in this sub  it is fucking terrifying and hopeless to admit that your entire life has been structured around  getting a good job  and even the lucky few who hit that mark are pretty miserable most of the time  it reminds me of that scientific study  or studies maybe  that prompted parents several times a day to notice what emotions mood they were feeling  ask a parent what they think of parenthood and they say it s  so rewarding  and  wonderful  and  the best  and yet while they are actually doing it their emotions say they are  exhausted  and  frustrated  and  bored  work feels exactly like that to me  even my  fun  job ,f0rj2j

611,I have a question about your day to day schedule for those of you currently working 9-5 office jobs.,i just graduated and hope to start grad school later this year  i m not against working  but my interests are pretty niche and i ll need a phd to do what i would enjoy  until i start grad school  i ve been doing various freelance stuff to make ends meet  some of it s manual labor  but overall i m not unhappy  i can get away with working 4-5 hours a day and taking days off when i want  which i feel very fortunate for    my significant other is pressuring me to get an office job  he insists i can get one with my degree and it ll make a lot of extra disposable income  but i m already making enough to pay the bills and don t need extra money or material crap to be happy  my worst nightmare is having a job where i m physically stuck at one place for 8 hours a day whether there s work or not  and when things are slow  pretending to work when managers walk by  he insists that most office jobs aren t like this  but my friends who work in offices are always talking about how bored they are  or how they re just getting paid to browse reddit and chit chat so much of the time  and to be honest  the opposite situation of being worked to death and constantly stressed about having more than i can manage doesn t exactly appeal either    so for those of you who do work the 9-5 desk life  how much of your day is actually spent doing some sort of work  vs getting paid trying to kill time  i m just curious to find out if i m wrong ,f1y7yj

614,Employer's and economic interests above health safety!,i don't know how this is handled in companies you guys work for  but i think mine does a horrible job in protecting their employees against this serious health hazard in form of this new virus spreading  i work for a european company in the aviation business with around 130k employees  so maybe you can guess which company i'm working for  we have customers and employees all over the world including a lot of customers from the chinese mainland  there are still a lot of them coming here and our country and our employer doesn't take any responsibility to protect their people employees e g  there are currently no travel-restrictions for these people so far  but at least our biggest national airline cancelled all flights to the chinese mainland atleast until the end of march  i suspect due to a lot of cancellation by passengers themselves  so it isn't profitable to fly there atm     back to the beginning  although we have lots of travellers here  that might pose a certain risk to our public health  nothing is done  we only got two e-mail within one week  the first was issued on last friday and the 2nd mail was sent last monday to all employees  the first one from friday was stating just to be careful and maybe postpone some business trips and that you should wash your hands ha  the 2nd was sent only 3 days later after the weekend and was not much more helpful  only that you should review travel restrictions issued by china and that you should get to a doctor if you're in china atm and show any symptoms  no  sherlock  we only should maintain good personal hygiene and carry hand sanitizer for use when water  amp  soap are not available and we should just follow advice given by our country or regional health authority  regarding visitors customers  that come here they only stated the following thins      'treat visitors from mainland china no differently to as you would visitors from other affected areas  no  i won't  because it is evident  that there's a rampant spread of the virus in mainland china   welcome colleagues from mainland china or other affected areas with respect and in line with our company values  there is no requirement to impose quarantine on them  i'm sorry   but i don't understand the mentality by the people coming here and imposing the risk on us aswell  please just stay there  until this thing is solved  thanks  that's what web conferences are for   visitors should follow personal hygiene guidelines and monitor their health in a similar way than employees returning from travel  how would they know  we don't have any advisories on how to inform them about such guidelines   yeah  so it is much more important to conduct business and usual and sell as much as possible  maybe they won't be so lax  when employees begin to become sick at our site  apart from the two mails they sent to us  there was nothing communicated by our management  my boss still insists to shake hands and hates me now that i refuse to do so  i am not in panic rn about this new virus  but i don't want to suffer from other disease and the flu either  since i can't stay at home  because i'd lose my job then  i have to come here everyday and atleast have to sit here in the office with my colleagues  there are no precautions  there is no hand sanitizer anywhere to be found and i feel like our employer give zero f  about their employees as long as business is running as usual     amp x200b   can you share similar experiences ,ezsrmc

626,Paralysed by Fear,hello everyone  this is my first post so please forgive any lack of common reddit etiquette   i recently confessed to my mother that i have been unemployed since late november last year  i was working a job in telesales and went 9 days without selling anything  i was expected to make 4-5 sales on average per day  before quitting i had tried everything i could think to do to improve my output  getting up at 5am so that i would be in a work oriented head-space for the 9am start  watching motivational content in and out of work  regular meetings with my superiors to identify and resolve issues with my pitch  nothing was helping me turn things around  i eventually confessed to the boss that  even if i were to make a sale today or tomorrow  i wouldn't be capable of hitting my monthly targets consistently  if at all  he respected my honesty and we mutually agreed to end things there                                                                  i didn't tell my parents that i had quit my job  they put a lot of pressure on me to find work immediately without any emotional support or concern for my emotional health  i do not function well under the veil of shame and pressure that is placed on me so i lie to them whenever i find myself unemployed and try to live off of the money of my final wage for as long as possible  they now know  as stated above  because i was unable to pay them rent  my mother was at least understanding and friendly  to my surprise  my stepfather was neither of those things  since i have been home our only conversations have been about me getting a job  ''job job job '' is something he's chanted at me once i've expressed my frustrations with his confrontational attitude  once  i flat-out explained to him that his methods make me feel depressed and will never be the catalyst for my success  he flashed his anti-depressants at me asking me  ''where's yours ''  he also denied that there is anything wrong with me mentally and that i am ''a lazy twat ''  he has made very little effort to ask anything about my life  outside of work  for years - something i brought up to him  ''need a job '' was his reply  it's a fairly hopeless situation   i'm sure many of you understand how i feel without an explanation  but i would like to share my thoughts and feelings towards work  for the sake of potentially receiving better advice  i am ridiculously hesitant to apply for almost any job because i quite simply despise almost all types of work  i was sent out of my classroom during career day because  ''i'll just work in a shop '' was the honest answer i gave to the question  ''what do you want to do when you grow up ''  i have such a hard time getting work done because it feels absolutely meaningless to me beyond earning the money to survive and that scares the shit out of me  i often find myself in a new job  motivated and ambitious  only to find as the weeks pass that i lose the ability to care and  or motivate myself to work  i find loopholes and exploits to get the work done quicker or to avoid the work entirely until i simply cannot take the feeling of depression i feel the job causes  i quit or am caught out or fired   i'd hate to write myself off as simply 'lazy' because i feel it so strongly that i would be unrealistically productive towards things i enjoy like making youtube content  filming   editing  parkour  freerunning  studying philosophy  amp  refinement of 'the self'  drawing  painting  music etc  as you've more than likely deduced  i am a creative type  i love to make things and expressing myself through artistic means  creating content on youtube is my dream career and is the only career i can confidently say i want to puruse    i don't want to apply for a shitty job at mcdonalds or in a telesales office only to repeat this cycle of ambition and depression  i don't want to have the constant  ignorant pressure of my folks every few months  what i really  do  want is to be earning so i can save for my relationship and my many passion projects  youtube included  i can't seem to utilise these desires as a motivator because the work induced depression always becomes overbearing  i am stuck in a place of fear  i suppose  i feel confused and hopeless with regards to what i should do next    if there is anything any of you could suggest i would be eternally grateful - i have no desire to remain like this forever ,f1ojiw
627,"""Letting your gifts go to waste""?",this will probably be rambling and only semi-coherent  but maybe it'll be thought-provoking or something someone else can relate to       i'm alright at writing  and have been since i was little enough to think that goosebumps were a bold new literary phenomenon  not alright enough to be the next douglas adams or walt whitman  but better than  say  stephanie meyer if she's drunk and has one broken hand  everyone's always told me   you need to write something  your gift shouldn't go to waste       the only problem is that i really   really  don't like writing  excepting occasional short posts here on reddit  which i tolerate to get my message out       i've tried my hand at writing before  and even managed to get something vaguely book length written  a 60k-ish word superhero novel  nothing special  didn't like the process at all  i didn't like the result of the process  and would truthfully compare the finished draft to a soggy shit sandwich       at friend's and family's urging  i've tried writing other stuff too  most of which was abandoned after 10k words or so  a magical noir thriller  a nonfiction collection of essays  and so on  hated doing all of it  despite being supposedly  good at it       it all feels so much like work to me  doing something i don't like to do for the benefit of some nebulous and currently non-existent  readers who would love it  all for the flimsy reason that i'm supposedly good at it  there's this pressure i feel from people that i should love the things i'm good at  especially if those things even tangentially contribute to the world culture the arts whatever        i don't know if i can really get across well the things that i've been feeling  but basically it feels like there's this pressure to commodify your talent  whatever that may be and even if you don't enjoy it  and while  with traditional  flying a desk  style work  some people will recognize that such work isn't fun or fulfilling  no one that i've talked to seems to get the fact that  creative work  can also be unfulfilling  like  i could write the next finnegan's wake and have the literary world set ablaze with discussion for the next thousand years  and it wouldn't matter to me one bit  it would just be some word count i'd have to get through  it would be work with a social pressure as a driver rather than work with an economic driver       anyone else feel this way  where you have some amount of skill or ability deemed  valuable  that  try as you might  you just can't get excited about  anyone else feel the pressure to produce based on your skill or ability  even when you have no interest in production        tl dr  i'm alright at writing  but hate it and find it draining  friends  amp  family think i should love it and make it my career or a career supplement  can't seem to make anyone understand that i don't want to take on a job flexing my creative muscles  because a job is still a job ,f1u7k5

653,How my old job almost drove me insane,i had a job that required shifts that were between 12-48 hours  many of them being night shift  the so called graveyard shift  the pay was good and i have always being a nocturnal person  so originally i didn't mind at all  soon enough though  i realized that there is a huge  bonding in the work environment  culture that was mandatory   my colleagues were major life scripter drones who have been content in slavery all of their lives they have been studying hard at school  then going to college  then getting that job and by the time i met them many were married with small kids  things like hobbies or creativity or friends outside of work were alien infidel ideas  but because they needed something to post on fakebook  they had established this rule where they would all go together for drinks after work to talk about work   i am schizoid  so after 12 hours around neurotypicals  the idea of going out with them again was pure torture  yet i went some times which was met with complaints and digs   then  the weekend bonding started  using seminars as a pretext they would travel together again in other towns or countries  of course for work  they had nothing else going  and i was  expected   demanded  to participate   i was spending a ton of money to essentially endure the company of morons  while i had no time to write my book  or go to the gym or see my actual friends that weren't from work even in the weekends  eventually i decided to set a boundary and say that i will come most weekends but not all weekends and  work sabotage started  important appointments missed be someone told me  accidentally  the wrong hour  documents misplaced etc   i had legit reached a point where i was buying take out bc i had no time to cook  hello 20 extra pounds  and buying  cheap  clothes bc i had no time to do laundry   then one day the final nail in the coffin was when one of the alpha work bullies  an ugly woman  came to my desk to confirm if i was going to the work brunch next saturday  i said no  she demanded to know why  i gave her the death stare and said word by word  because that brunch happens during the only 2 hours i have free in the entire week and i am looking  forward to spend it writing  she had the nerve to tell me that  i shouldn't isolate myself bc it's bad for the work morale and will affect my performance   then i told her extremely calmly that i am done with her and to never talk to me again bc the work culture can go to hell and last time i read a history book slavery has been abolished  she looked at me with her mouth and eyes open like a dead fish and left   i quit that job and have been self employed and it was the best decision i have ever made  if u want to know what happened to them  i check their fakebooks once a year or so  they are fat  miserable look 10 years older at least and still post photos of their schadenfreude get togethers   yea no ,eyoasx
654,Why does this sub focus on CEOs instead of owners?,i'm not saying rhey're not pieces of shit - they are  and have to be to rise to their level  the occassional not-pice-of-shit might make manager but to become ceo you have to have a lot of nepotism  bootlicking and heartlessness no doubt   but ultimately  they are just middle management  another hollowed out shell of a person  replaced by bootlicking and productivity programming  the owners are the ones who sit back and create the trickle-down suffering by demanding infinite growth from everyone  the ones demanding maximum profits at the expense of human suffering  all of middle management  including ceos  are just degrees of separation  buffers to put as many stooges  bootlickers  and impotent despots between the worker and the owner    so unless the ceo is also an owner common  he's once again just another slave to overlords who thinks he's one of them because he has power over someone beneath him  a mega piece of shit who should get the guillotine with the rest  but not the first thing you should think of when coming up with a list ,ey1uks

701,Mental health problems caused by work start at school,we begin by teaching children that pressure  anxiety and worry have to be an integral part of life  we make children take exams and teach them to take work home  children have to be where they are told  they have to complete work in a pressured timescale and have little input about what they learn and when  they are force fed the curriculum   this lack of autonomy continues through to adulthood where the focus is on work and money not people's inherent value as human beings and their personal happiness or desire  people are given distracting trinkets along their journey  netflix  smartphones  fast cars  as a reward for sacrificing their and their family's time to an overwhelming work ethic   people are in a work culture where they are seen as wimps if they expect to have a reasonable work load or even in some cases decent reward for their work or time off   people who self-harm or have suicidal thoughts is increasing  medication is reported as the most common type of treatment for a mental health problems  this totally ignores the cause while treating the symptoms  it is painful to watch society wring their hands and ask the question  why  why is this happening  when it is so blatantly obvious   anxiety and depression are often indicators of a sick society which needs treating rather than a sick individual who needs a temporary sticking plaster to make them feel better   we need to put our resources into changing the way we live ,exjmg7

720,"Anti-intellectualism, antiquated class-warfare-ism, and ideologues",   i think it is clear from the comments that not all r antiwork users are 19th century  class-warfare-minded communists  and there are some  frankly  anti-intellectual and problematic positions espoused in the thread  my goal here is to address some of the major issues that i have seen  both in how leftist strategy is portrayed in this thread  as well as to address the ethical problems and issue of moralization    i approach this as a reader of marx  zizek  laclau and mouffe  antonio negri  and several other contemporary and classic political economists  cultural theorists  and philosophers    i grew up working class and have restored old 1920s rental properties and rent them out at fair market prices to people in my small town  that has led several users to call me a  leech fucking landlord  a  tic  and a  vampire  do i disagree  not entirely  but there is much more nuance to it  do not forget that you indulge in global capitalism  as well  every day    i am not a strategic enemy of the left  if a teacher making  50k in the midwest with a couple of properties is a strategic enemy of the left  then the left is extraordinarily confused about its priorities  luckily  the left is more complex than op has made it out to be  in the linked thread    i wanted to make a couple of points that i think are quite important     laclau and mouffe  in their revered  hegemony and socialist strategy  recognize that an effective strategy for the left will not fall along class lines and must organize a number of autonomous movements  stakeholders  organizations  it's not the 19th century anymore  global  technological capitalism is complex    slavoj zizek  the revered  contemporary slovenian anti-capitalist and philosopher  has stated in many lectures that good leftists will learn to play the game of capitalism to build the necessary wealth that will be needed to bring their strategy into action  in other words  you must  play the game  of capitalism  not only to survive  but to allow a strong leftist movement to arise and function  how else would you organize a movement  if not with capital  within capitalism     contemporary socialist strategy  political economy  and ethics are much more complex than the name-calling class-warfare positions taken up in this thread     ideologues  when challenged  revert to name-calling and the espousing of dogma  this seems to be the case with much of the antiquated marxism in the linked thread  op uses terminology like  crocodile tears   pearl-clutching  and  vampirism  to attack users rather than explain political  economic  or social positions     we are all guilty of exploitation in global capitalism  anyone using reddit on a smartphone  laptop  or pc is using a device that was created with components manufactured in several countries around the world created with materials mined in  likely  horrifying conditions that are extremely exploitative  so i challenge users in this thread to assess their own house and being before attacking others  i e   if any of you is without sin  let him be the first to cast a stone  i mean this seriously  the things you do everyday are indulgences in global capitalism  none of us are guiltless  that does not make us unethical beings     i worry that young users in  r antiwork will miss out on valuable financial information and opportunities to improve their positions in life because of the rhetoric of ideologues like in the above  linked post  working class people have very few methods to obtain wealth  private property and investments are two of the most effective methods  these things can be used carefully and thoughtfully to improve one's position    that is probably it  for now  though there is much more we can discuss  to summarize  19th century class-warfare politics is antiquated and not helpful for most users  and it certainly discourages active discussion that could allow people to envision new political realities    there are many folks who use this sub  and there are many reasons to dislike work or want to abolish work  similarly  there are a limitless number of methods to re-imagine the distribution of resources in a global economy   we should be open to self-education  discussion  and critical and analytical thinking  rather than siding with ideologues  that's my case    and in defense of my self  since i was called out and attacked in the  porky apologia  thread  is that i have restored  by hand  buildings from the early 1900s and converted them to rentals  i grew up working class  i have slept in a car  i know the suffering of life  we live in capitalism  if small-time landlords did not provide rentals to low-income families  families who are starting out and young  or college students  who would  massive real estate investment firms  who would charge much more  exploit much more    i am not the enemy of the left    and even if i were  there are lots of people who use this sub  r antiwork  and i would like to remain here and have intelligent discussions with other users about how they might find a way to live without working  for some that is fire  for some it is leanfire  for some it is vanlife  for some it is communes    for some  unfortunately  it seems that they will clutch to an outmoded fashion of class-warfare ideology  will never invest in anything  never improve their position in the world  and will stay in poverty as a martyr while imagining that they are fighting imaginary enemies who

725,"I’m thankful for my worst boss, because she taught me exactly who I never want to be.",my last boss was my last typical  job  before dedicating myself fully to becoming an independent contractor  to be honest  working for her solidified that if i had to do this  work to survive  thing  i would rather be an independent contractor than be an employee subject to awful treatment    during the interview process  i related to her a lot  she was almost like the more arrogant version of me  there were a lot of points in our conversation that we agreed on  but her ego peaked through during the interview process  if i knew what i know now  i would ve just said no and kept it moving  but  i said yes  and that tiny ego that i experienced in that office only grew to be one of the most arrogant people i have ever met   this was a small start up  the ceos were titans with amazing resumes  to give you an idea of what kind of ego my boss had  she was an executive assistant to someone huge and very frequently on the news  not sure if her former boss is running for president  but he s mentioned it many times in the past   through the small office tour  i should have known i was walking into a shit storm  everyone looked miserable    after working there i realized it was normal for the cfo of the company to go on these venting rants with the other employees because of how awful the ceos were  yes  you read that right  the cfo of the company  apparently it was very normal for the cfo of the company to cry because of how absolutely mean one of the ceos was to her  disgustingly degrading  despite being the cfo  she had no power  and was treated worse than anyone   i felt like i was living in an office version of mean girls    the cfo who was training me for my job kept constantly telling me that if i had any problem i could vent to her  that was the culture of the office   the ceos were so arrogant that if you needed clarification on what they were saying  they wouldn t want to clarify anything  they would say something like i said what i said  it s not so hard  yell   one day when i was calling the cfo to talk about a particularly tough day  and that i was thinking of quitting she said  quit  where would you go  every job is like this   even though i encouraged her to find another job where she may be happy  the cfo told me that since every job is like this  she didn t see the point in leaving  i don t believe that to be true  i think in this really tough world  you need to find a space that makes you happy  it made me sad that she didn t even want to try   in order to keep up with this job  my hours didn t exist  the hours they assured me during my interview did not exist  if i didn t work beyond those hours  i was scrutinized  however  that s what needed to be done to keep up with this job  like  be attached to your computer  and even work on answering emails before bed  that kind of level   one day when the cfo went to a wedding  the ceos were saying that she would probably respond back despite taking a day off   when i said  but  she s at a wedding   their response was  i m sure there s internet access there   how disgusting   to cope one of the other assistants partied hard and drank heavily on the weekend   i also saw how my boss was with her kids  i feel so sorry for them  her son was obviously going through a bad emotional time  he was just a kid that needed to be listened to  but  just like she treated all of us  she ignored any try for a good conversation  and insisted it was her way or nothing else   one day  i realized i couldn t make her happy  when i took one mental health day  the work that piled up was so much that i couldn t catch up  she was furious  but i knew i couldn t make her happy   so  i sat her down and told her i didn t think i could work at the capacity she wanted me to work   she said something to the effect of  i made things so simple for you  i trained you  none of this was hard   she also said something to the effect of  every job is like this  so i don t know what you would be capable of doing   i know i m capable of doing a job where i treat myself kindly  have a life  and if i work well with other people i will pride myself on not acting like an employer version of a bridezilla   i m capable of kindness and listening  i wish she was capable of the same   she made me realize that sometimes in chasing your dreams and aspirations  you could become really full of yourself and ignore all the outside noise  when it gets to that point  you really need to evaluate yourself as a person  if you don t  you could become just like her   she taught me to not admire someone just because of their resume  you know what they have accomplished  but you do not know what kind of person they are   find your peace  people  you do not have to be miserable  life is so much more than that  do not let your job make you into someone that you re not  do not let your insecurities make you

729,Let me tell you how stupid rich my boss is...,let's just say my boss is an exploitative asshole   some of my co workers are  independent contractors  who accept cash tips only for their  services    they have to pay a large portion of this to the owner  if they dont get tipped a certain minimum  policy is  get this bullshit  they still have to pay the owner out of their pocket for service provided  so hypothetically  you could go to work and have a really shitty day  and end up owing money to your employer   that is some fucked up exploitative shit    now  since its cash  and these 'independent contractors' are not on the clock    the owner doesn't necessarily  have  to report that to the gov't    ha  yeah  it gets better   my boss is very very cheap when it comes down to the actual business  i am luckily in a different department than the independent contractors  so i get an hourly that's not much above minimum  but i also accept tips  i can make full time money in about a quarter of the time usually   so the place i work at just had some renovations done  and theres so many other things that need to be done but the owner just refuses to put the money into it    why is it that business owners sometimes dont understand that you really need to maintain your business and that means putting some real money into it in order for it to thrive in the changing generations    so  okay we have  exploiting the employees  and not maintaining the business properly  and yet still raking in serious cash   the other day  i overheard my boss talking to the lead of my department   i couldn't believe my ears  yet at the same time was not all suprised when they said    what's a tesla  i hear that word alot  either way  i want one  so i'm getting one   sm motherfucking h   i'm sorry if i made you want to vomit ,eywp2s
