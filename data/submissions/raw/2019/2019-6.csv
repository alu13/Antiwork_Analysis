11,The death of the 8-hour work day,"How many people even work 8 hours anymore? I've only worked hourly, which seems what most people get nowadays, and it always comes with the asterisk of an extra 30 min to hour of lunch. It's never 9-5 anymore. It's 8-5, or 9-6:30. 
It drives me nuts. It's so negligable, but it's ultimately a slap in the face to the 8 hours to work, 8 hours to sleep, 8 hours to do as we please. Never enough to truly relax, of course. Often not enough to let you even go home. Just enough to fulfill a quota to let your employer off the hook, while you spend that extra 30 min to an hour at the end of your shift so desperately wishing you can go home.

Hourly is supposed to be part-time. 8 hours includes breaks and lunch for salary jobs. It's one more example of employers taking advantage, and it pisses me off the more I think of it. 40 hours a week is a big difference from 45, and when you think about all the overtime and the time it takes to commute, it adds up and you can very easily be working about 50 hours a week.

In reality, they have had their ability to use certain parts of their brain. Those parts have been snuffed out and replaced by the ability to do things against their will daily.

Her book Private Government offers an important reminder that bosses tend to be dictators and that workers’ lives are essentially at the mercy of private government.

I posted this thread yesterday and got some interesting responses. Mostly by ancoms who wish to reform society.

So, how do you do it? What is the ideal society? How do we produce anything? How does anyone learn anything? How is merit decided? Are there laws? How are they enforced?

Inb4 You create your utopia where everyone works collectively for the same cut no matter their job or education and all live ethically without fear of society’s consequences. Unrealistic. In fact, I literally saw a transitioning ancom talk about how he was going to do a murder-suicide if society “oppressed” him any longer. THAT’s why we need consequences. You can’t honestly believe that someone that hopeless would completely change their tune once the guberment decides their job instead of themselves.

Lastly, not all jobs have merit. Maybe I want to have the job of smearing shit on public monuments, ancom society would have to reward me for my dreamjob. Otherwise, it’s capitalist and meritocratic.",False,c5t80a,LittleBigMidget,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/c5t80a/ideal_society/,8,3

64,Can I vent?,"I am a pretty isolated person, and I just need to vent. This may not be an appropriate post or not, but it is about work and self-improvement forums.

I don't know if any of you have ever been in many self-improvement or job-specific forums, but I have spent the last 10-ish years in them since I was a freshman in high school. Even once I became a socialist, I never questioned the advice in these forums, but I am now realizing how toxic these places were for me. 

As I had no one to look up to, I often wanted to emulate the people on these forums. I would hate myself if I didn't live up to their standards, and what's worse is that they often attacked me if I ever looked for sympathy. These places often have a libertarian outlook on life even if they are not libertarian. They believe in complete self-control and free will, we control out destiny, etc. And, a massive amount of the advice is geared towards ambition and careers. It's built to make you a ""productive"" member of society and shames anyone who doesn't meet their concept of success.

I noticed it's particularly bad in IT related fields. I made a post (since deleted it) on an IT forum here on Reddit. I asked them how can I do IT when I don't want to dedicate my entire life to it. This is because these forums push an image of ""if you want to get past entry level help desk positions, you need to CONSTANTLY improve your skills after work."" If I am not running a homelab, learning a new language, reading tomes like Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming, then I am a failure. I like IT, and I want to do all of that to some extent. But I have a thousand other interests, and I refuse to sacrifice them for a singular one like IT. Well, when I informed them of this, they mostly told me I would fail and never get anywhere. ""Owners like to see passion and a good work ethic"". Fuck the bosses you CTO fuck. I already dedicate at least 40 hours a week to them.

I wish I could lower my expectations, but I still have high goals (financial stability or buying land). Sadly, those are incompatible with enjoying my life right now. What's even worse is that I am painfully average. These forums are built around the top 10%, but I went to a subpar high school and college. I hold myself to the standards of MIT grads and they do the same to me.",False,c6bl1x,20190505,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/c6bl1x/can_i_vent/,6,20
65,"The pressure on me to succeed is at an all time high, my motivation is not","I'm going back to school soon for a degree I don't really give a shit about because it seems like the only one that I could actually complete and make money with. It feels very wrong to be doing this but I can't just sit at home or work shitty jobs forever. I have to do something. Waiting for motivation isn't going to work. The longer I stay in this miserable place the worse I'll probably get. Yet I have little confidence in my willpower. I don't know if or when I'll just say fuck it and not care and let myself fail again. 

I've already dropped out of college twice with medical cause. I remember taking classes as an undeclared freshman and just being so damn unmotivated it was impossible. Long ass reading assignments like half a fucking novel in a week with notes to go with it. Computer related shit that I could not for the life of me understand and was unable to ask for help. Staring at a blank page for hours because I can't think of a single sentence to form. In the computer lab working on precal assignments for hours but getting barely anything done. Being hopelessly lost in chemistry class. The curriculum I'm planning on doing now seems like the type of classes I could actually excel at, but who fucking knows when I'll just fucking fail. 

I don't want to go. It's common wisdom to do whatever you have to do to make yourself happy. I WANT to not be beholden to some miserable scheduled career that I have to show up for in the early ass morning and work like a slave while keeping up appearances and social obligations. I don't even think I am capable of such a thing. But uni is the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""safe"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""easy"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" path compared to the utter lawlessness of entrepreneurship. People like to tell you that if you aren't happy it's your fucking fault for not working to correct what it is making you unhappy. WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DOOOO?!?!??!?

My financial aid will run out if I take to long to complete college. Then what the fuck will I do? How will I make it in this country without a degree? I'll be fucked.

67,"Antiwork journey, and frugality","Great subreddit btw. What was your antiwork journey, what caused you to become antiwork? Did it or does it now involve frugality? If so, how does that cause others to react to you? 

First off, I recognize that poverty and frugality are often overlapping and there is only so much spending that can be reduced; and that sometimes people get into situations that make it hard or impossible to be frugal. So in this post, I’m talking about limiting spending to the maximum degree possible, as a matter of antiwork even though it may also be by necessity. 

I realized that minimizing costs is a main factor in minimizing the amount of work that one has to partake in. I refuse to engage in major consumer purchases, or really any consumer purchases other than cheapest rent possible, food and drink, and thrift store clothing only when needed. My ultimate goal would be to work towards vandwelling or stable communal living (high amount of roommates to minimize cost). 

No kids, adamantly childfree. I realized my childfree ideology is mainly an antiwork ideology, witnessing many coworkers and friends seriously struggle financially and be absolutely chained to working jobs (unable to quit) or have multiple jobs to pay the absurd child raising costs. As well as constant stress. 

I really want to drop out of society. I’m trying to drop out by proxy of spending as little as possible in order to minimize work needed to cover living costs. Honestly, so many “working people” will look at you like you’re batshit crazy if you simply say that you believe society and by proxy, work, is a scam and a trap. People always shame if you don’t want kids, a mortgage or “a career”. They also look at you weird if you are pinching pennies in order to avoid work having so much power and control over your life. My antiwork ideology was born when I witnessed others be so stressed and trapped/chained because of high costs to pay in their life. Freedom is the motivation. 

For me antiwork is mainly about avoiding ever being trapped in toxic or soul crushing  workplaces. I want the freedom to just walk off the job if needed. I want the freedom not to give a shit if I get fired. Ironically, despite being antiwork, I’m actually a pretty decent worker in my field(s) and scored top 20% of the company by KPIs, and have actually been named employee of the month before. I assume many of you are the same. But I have no desire to move up and deal with more stress, more hours, and more bullshit.

I did enjoy my jobs to some degree, actually, but for me it’s been an absolute nightmare to deal with any instances of workplace bullying and getting up early for work which is debilitating (why do so many jobs start 8am? Fuck that). 

I’ve built some savings and follow various antiwork and anti life script subreddits but to be honest just one major financial crisis or illness would screw me over. So it’s not like I’m rich or have some great strategy worked out for never working again but I’ve certainly become frugal in an antiwork spirit. And a societal dropout (associate with other frugal, anti lifescripters).

74,Feel great after telling my manager “no”,"So last Friday I woke up at 5am to be at a site by 9am, I get to the site a few minutes late, nobody cares, and do an inspection. Afterwards I chill in the city for a few hours. I’m not supposed to do this, I’m supposed to go straight to the office, but chilling in the city when I’m not supposed to is my favorite “part” of the job. I get a call saying I have to finish a part of the report tonight, so I work until 6pm on Friday, it sucks but this happens often.

Fast forward to today when my 6am alarm goes off and I say my daily f-bomb as I lift my head up. Do my usual 1.5 hour commute, I’m like 10 min late, and the HR person does her daily sigh when I’m late. I work all day, boring as hell, and a waste of time. 5pm comes, it’s go time. As I’m leaving the HR person tells me I should wake up earlier, I say “no, I waste most of my day at work, and I won’t be wasting any more time”. She becomes furious and says I’m having a talk with the manager tomorrow morning. 

Crazy thing is that I’ve planned an interview for tomorrow morning and was planning on calling in sick. This interaction I had earlier got me super hyped because I actually stood up for myself.

On top of that, the workforce comprises almost 70% of junior employees (23-30 years old) since they’d rather pay low wages than hire a few seniors to do the job. The end result is senior management nagging that junior employees are underperforming (no shit sherlock?) and are not aligned with the interests of the company (who would have thought overworking your employees for no extra pay does not sit well with people..)
Moreover, certain departments have to do night shifts for shitty pay. This means once your regular shift is over, you can go home but you have to be near a PC 24/7 in case anything happens (and like 50% of the time it does happen).
I honestly don’t get the legal framework behind this... How can a company legally require you to work extra from home just because they call it a “night shift” and you get like $60 for the whole week? How are people not entitled to days off after night shifts?

100,We are forgetting the power of everybody in a society having Fuck-You money. Why Yang proposal would work.,"Let's star from this: It's 12K$ a year, it0s **per person**, so families actually get 24K and more. What does this mean? It means **fuck-you money** for everybody. Yes, in case of unemployment it might require some sacrifice (for example relocating) but all of us will at least be safe and able to live on it alone.

Do you understand what fuck-you money means? It means that you are going to work with a completely different attitude. If you are fired, well, it's not the end of the world. So, your boss screams at you? You just smile benevolently. He asks you to do crappy tasks and requires you too many overtimes? **FUCK YOU! I'm out!**. The job is dangerous? The colleagues are bullies and crooks? You were never give you that raise? **FUCK YOU! I'm out!**

So a shitty employer do these kind of things, but now this is not just that one  rare guy that can give the fuck-you treatment, this is potentially all of them. Guess what? He either loses all his workers and goes out of job or well, he is pretty much forced to improves the working conditions and raise the salaries.

The scaremongering of working conditions falling apart and salaries plummeting is just that, scaremongering. It's actually the complete opposite.

This is what we don't get. **Under the guise of being just a small and simple adjustment, UBI has big, far reaching repercussions*****. The reality is that UBI is revolutionary.***

People inclined for political activism but are now too stressed and with no time might decide to spend more or all their time fighting for their issues. People would volunteer, organize, join strikes and protests. Under this new energy the government will be forced to change to reflect the needs of the people.

So, Listen anti-worker friends, we risk missing such a huge opportunity here. Even if you don't like some of Yang other policies or think that Yang cannot win, and I disagree, because you never know what can happen in this crazy world, We have now and incredible opportunity to raise awareness to UBI through a campaign that is already gaining huge momentum. Please, don't just throw this gift away and let's try to get the most out of this lucky opportunity.",False,c73u5t,retroflexc,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/c73u5t/we_are_forgetting_the_power_of_everybody_in_a/,40,13

111,Just wanted to say I appreciate this sub :),"On this sub, I can actually say my beliefs without being downvoted to hell or worry about arguments or incoming hate. The common, “all you guys are just lazy,” or “you just need to grow up.” The usual bullshit you hear among the common folk when you question today’s society.

Ironically, I don’t even care about working. If I was out in the wild, id still have to labor and survive. My problem is the standards and atmosphere of work in modern society. Living your life for the weekend to make someone else rich? Fuck that noise. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. 

My other common complaint is there is no option to exit society and go do your own thing, because you need money to buy land in the first place. And so many people love to assume, “oh trust me, you wouldn’t want to do physical labor or grow a garden or blah blah.” Even though they know nothing about you or your history. They project their own issues and opinions onto you, and think that makes your wants or needs invalid. Not everyone finds comfort or feels accomplishment in a cubicle staring at a computer, all while knowing you’re easily replaceable and no one actually gives a fuck about you. And all the while, the guy at the top profits off you while laughing their ass off at you being one of the replaceable sheep.

Anyway, so I just wanted to say this sub is freeing and I appreciate being able to say how I’ve felt for a long time without judgement.

140,Idea for starting a socialist company (initially for Software/Web Developers),"None of us here love work - mainly due to the constant pressure from the top down.  It would be great to work for a company where that didn't exist.  It's great to bitch and vent now and again, but it's not great if that's all we do, and just wallow in this misery.  I think we should all collectively take a hard look at what we can do now, that will move society to where we want it to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering, what the interest in here would be for starting firms which are workers co-operatives, and focus on removing all the BS from work, that makes us hate it.  I'm talking about a company with socialist values.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't quite figured out the dynamics of how it would work yet, but the benefits would be something like this:-

&amp;#x200B;

* I'm a Software Developer so this would be the industry of this particular firm
* We work 100% remotely.
* Members of the firm are required to put in a minimum amount of days work in to enable us to draw something from this capitalist system - but this will be an extremely sensible figure.  I'm thinking something in the range of 6 months work per year, and 6 months off per year.  This is in contrast to the current average amount of days off people get, which in the UK for example, is only 28 days.
* All members of the firm receive an equal, and generous, base pay
* All profits are allocated to salary and ensuring the company has what it needs to operate well.  No crazy bonuses to directors - no $$$ to shareholders.
* If you work more than the minimum, you will be compensated for it.
* You are encouraged to only work 3 days per week.
* Have values which focus on minimizing stress - i.e. ensure we don't agree to insane deadlines, and give ourselves plenty of breathing space.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm mostly just throwing this shit out there to see if there are any like-minded Software Devs out there, but I think a company operated in this way could definitely work if the $$$ are spread through the employees rather than being hoarded at the top.

&amp;#x200B;

For the ambitious ones out there, I'd encourage you to perhaps think about drawing up similar plans, for whatever industry you work in.  I don't think we can rely on politicians to make this shift towards a more socialist society, so I think we should be focusing on the things we can do now that will have a real impact.

&amp;#x200B;

If even a handful of people begin to start successful companies like these, it won't be long before natural competition between firms means that other companies will have to start offering the same benefits.  It's already happening with remote work.  I work remotely and have done for 2 years now, and I absolutely would not settle for an office job again.  I've noticed more and more companies, slowly but surely, begin to offer remote working as an option.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend is currently getting her Master's degree in Social work. A requirement of this degree is 1200 hours of internship hours. I appreciated the fact that they were ensuring that she gain experience in her field. Today she got an interview for a full-time job in her field making $16.50 an hour as a peer counselor. She said that this would conflict with her internship. I said that it would stand to reason that your internship could be done in the place your working. She said the school won't allow it. Why? *It has to be unpaid. 1200 hours of unpaid labor.* So she's gonna have to play a bunch of games with a job that is AMAZING for a 22 year old undergrad because higher education likes to acclimate young people to not being worth anything more than the time of a supervisor. Is the university that is mandating unpaid ahours paying her a living stipend? No.

One of my professors told the class that only recently she began to truly know her own father.

She said he worked for decades at a metallurgical industry and was fired when the company broke. When he went home, he started to cry because he didn't know what to do. Then my professor said that her father was so sad because his work was his life, he worked almost everyday and he didn't know what else he could do if he was not working. And that's when they started to hang out and get to know each other, they could finally spend time together.

Her father story hit me so hard. I don't want to spend a lifetime working, barely spending time with loved ones, being so alienated that I don't know what else to do with my time. And I felt like everyone in class took it normally, just another story, that's life, like we only live to be able to work our asses off. It's so infuriating.

168,People at work are treating me like some kind of contagious leper for searching for new employment.,"Several places contacted me for interviews and I decided to be honest about the reason I’m leaving work early. 

My husband made the mistake of feigning illness to attend an interview. His old boss found out after the potential new employer contacted his current job as a reference check and it backfired on him. Hence, honesty.

Anyhoo, since then, people here have been cold. These are coworkers who I would normally chat with or joke around with. 

For instance, I had a Spinal Fusion surgery in March. While I’m somewhat improved, (no sciatica - yay!) I'm still in intense pain from scar tissue in my back. What does this have to do with my post? My job evolved to me being an occasional driver by taking teens to the local college two blocks away.

This was never in my original job description but I did it because well, two blocks away. Recently, being summer, the local campus closed. The next closest one is over 45 minutes away (one way). This was a huge concern due to my back still having bad spasms. I emailed my surgeon and asked her opinion because a.) I would be in the car for several hours between regular commute and driving to campus b.) I would have a teen in the vehicle with me. I would feel awful if my back locked up and I got into an accident.

Surgeon was appalled that I would even ask; it was an absolute no. She wrote me a note to limit my driving; I was covered. Big Brother (boss) lost it. I was sent an angry email. BB was puzzled. Wasn’t I cleared to drive? Didn’t I tell coworkers I could start biking or kayaking? 

\*Record scratch\* Wait, coworkers ran to BB to tell what I did on my own time. Alone. Not responsible for another human during work. I felt betrayed by these people I thought were my work friends. 

I felt like I had to explain why I was able to do these things on my own time. I could bike or kayak for five minutes at a time. I could stop if fatigued. There was no stopping on the Interstate. Explain I did. Then I felt mad that I needed to justify myself. 

Since my interviews, people have been distant or downright unfriendly.

170,Best careers for people who majored in languages/liberal arts NOT good at maths/IT,"I am a mid20 Italian girl with a bachelor's degree in foreign languages and communication (English and Japanese). 
I chose this major because I love studying foreign languages (I have previously studied French and German), I have strong linguistic skills (I learn languages easily) and I am a big Japan nerd.
I have advanced English skills (Ielts 8.0) and intermediate Japanese level (N3, plan to do N2). I did study abroad in Tokyo during my bachelor. Also, I have done 2 free interships needed to acquire credits before graduation. One of them was related to teaching Italian to exchange students.

Still with a bachelor's degree I did not find any decent job neither in Italy neither in Japan.

In Italy because most post graduate paid internships are for people with a masters. Also I can not teach as teaching is only for people with a masters. Same for translating, they do not want someone with just a bachelor's. I was unaware of that as our professors said that a bachelor's was enough if we did not want to become academics at uni.

In Japan either because my Japanese level is still too low, visa problems and because I got discrimination due to not being native English speaker. Italian is much less popular than it used to be so I never got the chance to teach Italian in Japan, unfortunately.

I got offered just free internships which required 60+ work hours or waiting tables with night shift. I said no.

I therefore decided to enroll to master's in order to improve my chances both in Italy and Japan and globally.

My masters has some optional economic classes and exams. Lately I see some job adds for people as accountants or finance like jobs, but...
Sadly I checked the mock exam and the textbook and it looks quite advanced and complicated.
I was never good in maths. I was good in anatomy and biology... but never in maths or physics.

I also do not have IT/programming skills (only computer graphic or blogging skills) and I am worried I might not find any decent career/salary because of that

I so wonder: what other careers can people with a humanities degree can follow which does not involve maths/economics? Aside teaching? Do I really need to work on my maths skills not to be doomed to poverty?
In my situation what do you recommend me to do?

Basically the system stole the few months I should have gotten off in my youth. I didn't even got those few summers all rave about before working starts...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I started applying to part-time jobs (in Euroe they usually come with full benefits) where I only have to work 4 days. And I freaking got one! 

And you know what? I negotiated the salary so high, that I earn the same amount of money like before. Actually even more as I also get more vacation days.

You shout conspiracies about corporations and the guberment enforcing slave labor, but you make no attempt to increase your employment value. You just whine and bitch about your “dead-end job”, believing fully that this must be your life. It’s pathetic.

There is clearly a correlation between those who fail to succeed in capitalist society and those who subscribe to anti-social and welfare state beliefs.

Guess what? Society doesn’t give a fuck about you either. Go live a god damn tent if you want, just don’t blame society for your shortcomings.

You relentlessly attack public education, and call universities useless, but you fail to account for your own accountability in actually fucking learning anything.

Lastly, I’m not pro-corporate, and I think you should fight business profiteering whenever it is excessive, but none of you seem to have the ability to take responsibility for your own choices. It’s always “society’s fault”.

183,Renting out property for a work-free life? thoughts?,"I know being a landlord is inherently unethical, as is our entire capitalist system, but does that mean we should still moralize the economic decisions individuals make? I've seen a lot of posts recently against landlords (yes I agree they're generally parasites) but the same leftists contend that one should ""go get a real job"" and not live off the rent of others (kind of reminds me of conservative arguments against people on welfare tbh, which is also what a UBI would be, i.e. making rent from others production, but that's a different story)

But if one was to seek avoiding a life time of drudgery and misery from slaving away at 40+ hours per week through say,  making investments in a property and renting it out (with the goal of cutting away hours at your normal job, or retiring early, and using that time to pursue passions and do something socially beneficial), would you folks see it as inherently evil and to be completely avoided?

This is my hypothetical: buying out a small apartment building (not a house someone could buy and live in), renting it out below market, signing a good contract that legally obligates you to be a decent landlord (like being prompt with repairs, no harsh rules, etc.),  not evicting people for being late with rent, and donating the apartments/equity to the tenants until I'm comfortable without the rent, or when I die, whichever comes first. (I kind of see it like being a manager, a position that shouldn't exist, but if you have it, you can try to be a good one, otherwise someone else will just do it and may end up being shitty to workers and super exploitative)

I definitely wouldn't wanna be a landlord, but in this capitalist shithole, it seems like one of the few ways to a work-free life (if we go beyond good and evil), albeit a temporary solution until the utopia is ushered in.

I'm scared for my future (Did I throw away my one chance at a high salary?) and I'm scared for the future of my generation (are depressed wages and inhumane work weeks all we have to look forward to?). 

&amp;#x200B;

Reading this subreddit has been a source of comfort for me. Has anyone been in a similar situation? In a way I feel like I don't have the right to complain since the job was ""high paying"" but mentally deadly.

189,Andrew Yang is not antiwork.,"I’ve noticed a surprising number of Yang Gang posts on this sub in the past 24 hours, so I felt that someone should set the record straight on who this guy actually is and what he believes.

Andrew Yang is a Silicon Valley robber baron- excuse me, I mean, “entrepreneur” - whose fan base mostly includes meme-obsessed 4chan denizens. His chief philanthropic accomplishment was creating [fewer than 4,000 jobs](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/6/13/18637853/andrew-yang-venture-for-america-jobs-record) from a venture that promised to create 100,000. 

Yang’s signature policy proposal is a “Freedom Dividend” - basically a $1,000.00 handout to every single American. However, this UBI-like proposal would be funded through [a 10% value-added tax](https://thebaffler.com/latest/andrew-yangs-war-on-normal-people-simpson) on goods and services. [This tax would be regressive](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/who-would-bear-burden-vat), hitting poor people far harder than the wealthy. Under this scheme - and it *is* a scheme in the most nefarious sense - poor people would essentially be paying money to themselves. 

Additionally, there is no evidence that a Yang-style UBI would reduce the proliferation of bullshit work. Indeed, [Daniel Zamora’s comprehensive analysis of UBI](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/12/universal-basic-income-inequality-work) in *Jacobin* suggests a scenario where the *exact opposite* would occur:

&gt;	Martinelli highlights “the danger that basic income ‘would aggravate the problem of low pay and subsidize inefficient employers,’ leading to a proliferation of ‘lousy’ jobs.” In this scenario, those with good jobs will continue to lead fulfilling lives, now supplemented by universal income, while others will have to combine their UBI with one or more “lousy” jobs, with little gain in income. The proposal makes no attempt to help those without a job today get one tomorrow or improve the job they have. **Indeed, everything suggests that the opposite will happen: the UBI will function like a war machine for lowering wages and spreading precarious work.**

(Emphasis mine)

There are more socialist/anarchist arguments against UBI that I won’t get into in this post - the major ones are that it would deflate class consciousness and act as a gigantic handout to the landlord class - but the point is, dont fall for Andrew Yang and his army of 4chan memelords.

194,"I'm gonna push back on a BS ""skills assessment"" for a job","So I applied to this job a while back and today I got an email asking me to come in for a technical skills test as a first step.  The information is VERY vague.  I'm supposed to just show up and *then* find out what the test will cover.

In my field, it's completely normal on a job to consult resources to problem-solve your way through technical issues.  It's not possible to memorize everything that *might* come up.  Actual experts in the field openly discuss how they use Google to solve problems.

However, HR gatekeepers who have no clue about the job think the best way to assess skills is to throw whatever at you and expect you to figure it out on the spot totally from memory.  You could easily ""fail"" such a test simply because you didn't happen to memorize the things that happened to be on that test (and god only knows where it came from).  And you don't get paid for your time.  I've been burned like this before, and now one of my dealbreakers is that I don't do these tests *before* an interview (and maybe not after, either).

I've tried discussing this with HR gatekeepers but they just do not get it.  Their response is usually along the lines of ""that's our process, take it or leave it"".

But THIS time, the actual hiring manager emailed me about the test.  I'm thinking of emailing him back with my misgivings about these tests.  I anticipate I'll get the typical response, but who knows?  Maybe he'll see my point.  His field (not exactly the same as mine but related) is very much the same.  He may not be able to change the process though.

I guess this is a way of resisting.  If I don't care about getting the job or know I won't get it anyway, there is no risk in challenging their bullshit.",False,bzduep,candleflame3,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bzduep/im_gonna_push_back_on_a_bs_skills_assessment_for/,10,13

While this offer is game changing with respect to opening a door in the country I would love to stay in, the thought of accepting it made me highly anxious the moment it was offered. If the organisation was willing to pay additional cost of holding me they might as well expect me to put in more than the minimum standard hours I have so comfortably been doing.

My spouse is cross with me and is angry as to how I can leave such an opportunity and basically tell the organisation to fuck off (I am on a contract with an end date , ironically because of the end date I am able to put up a fake show and go to office every morning)

But my gut feeling says I cannot tie myself for hopes of better future because I know how the cycle is, initially it's five years to work in order to apply for citizenship then take a mortgage so another five years then try for a family and get tied to a lifetime of work. I am in my 30s with no plans of kids, good savings and good skills to secure another job if need be but I need the option of resigning any day I feel like and not get controlled by someone else determining how I live my life.

Am I overthinking? Am I taking big risks here in subjecting myself to a life of poverty?? I have left jobs and managed to secure new jobs in an average of six months.

So I'm 29. I've spent the past decade or so since high school as a full time failson, living with my parents (still do) and fucking up in various ways, developing a drug problem, fucking up school, etc. About seven or eight years ago I got my shit sort-of together and finished my college degree. Last year I finished my master's degree in the same field after finally seeking treatment for my drug stuff in late 2017f, got into rehab and haven't relapsed or used once in the year and a half since I started. I'm lucky enough that I was a Graduate Teacher's Aide while doing my MA and my parents paid for both my brother and I's undergrad degrees, so I'm incredibly privileged in the sense that I'm debt free - so I'm broke but at least I don't have a negative net worth or anything.

Anyway, the last year I've been a legit NEET, living in my parents house and persisting on money they gave me, savings from grad school, and little part-time contract jobs I got here and there, but it was never much money at all. Basically I've been flat broke my whole adult life, working retail jobs part time, or doing college stuff, or just being an unemployed piece of shit. Obviously I've spent this year hunting for jobs and it was rough, I applied for a lot of garbage, including a few retail positions and adjunct professorships with no chance for advancement.

anyway, to make a long story short, I got one of the jobs I applied for that was actually decent. it's in an institution I like and want to work at, there's room for advancement, lots of benefits including the regular ones like insurance and paid vacation (shit I've never had before), and it starts in the high thirties where most of the stuff I applied for was like the mid twenties. so its objectively great for me, everyone I know congratulated me, I'm supposed to be super stoked I can be an independent normal person now, and I definitely am. 

so while I'm glad I've got an opportunity to do something less soul-crushing and better compensated than so many people, who work incredibly hard (harder than I'll ever work, I'm sure) for fucking peanuts, I still feel terrible right now. being a NEET sucks in a lot of ways. people think you're pathetic. you can't really go out much. you can't date. it's hard to live a normal life. but, simultaneously, you can really indulge in the things you actually enjoy, if you're the right type of person. i've spent the last year exercising, smoking weed all day, playing videogames, reading, and just generally pursuing my many interests. before that, I did my own thing in college, and it was fun being academically successful without having to spend all my time at it.

this post has gotten far too long, but I'm sort of mourning my NEEThood right now, if that makes any sense. it's supposed to be a fantastic development for me that i have to wake up at six and haul my ass into a fluorescent office to do something basically unimportant, but it just isn't - i'm gonna spend the next thirty five years doing this, and that's incredibly difficult to really face.

I got a 2.5 acres for 8k and have 5k now. 

I lived in my van for 2 years before this, on basically $50 cash and $190 food stamps per month. I adapted to the poverty once, I can do it again. Freedom is more valuable. I just need to exist long enough to see if yang wins and we get UBI or not. I was never going to be able to work for long enough to exist for very long anyhow. Only sticking around now because of that. All these years I've been talking about UBI, if I died right before we got it it'd be hilariously ironic. Not that I'm very hopeful.

It kinda sucks because if I didn't have mental health issues I might be able to have a normal life and be a trucker for a decade and save up and retire to a comfortable life. There's a lot of things about it I enjoy. But when you hate existing to begin with, having the demand to endure 60+ hours of more torture is just not doable for very long.

I get regular episodes of feeling paralyzed and spending 2 or 3 days in bed in the truck without going outside. It's time to quit. 

I almost bought weed yesterday since I was in Colorado and a weed store was like 100 feet from my delivery. One time use would dirty my pee for about a week. We're liable to get drug tested randomly at any time. Failing a drug test doesn't just get you fired, it gets added to your DAC which is basically a credit report for your driving record for truckers. With a failed drug test you're basically black balled from the industry for years. It's not because I ever particularly loved weed and really want to get high. It often dried my eyes and mouth and nose out too much and was unpleasant, and when I had regular access I would irregularly smoke like once a week. It's just, who are they to say what I can or can't do in my free time? I really hate arbitrary rules and obedience to an authority who would make arbitrary rules. Freedom is the most important thing and having it stifled makes work even more intolerable. I bring it up because it's another symptom of it being time to quit, that I'd consider taking such a risk. 

I'm an anxious and neurotic person, I've been agonizing over the decision to quit or not for the past 3 weeks. If I was sure I was going to then I might not have posted this. Just venting my anxiety in a long meaningless post, don't mind me. It wouldn't even matter much if I were normal because there's so many trucking jobs you could get a job same day very easily. But my anxiety means once I quit I'm not easily going to start a new job.",False,c20wxg,ezopen,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/c20wxg/think_im_gonna_quit/,3,22
227,My reply to a rejection email. Didn’t go through so need to post somewhere.,"Dear Permanent Mission of Australia to the United Nations, New York

I doubt this will ever reach anyone, but I need to express my surprise and annoyance with the outcome. 

In return for your ‘general’ feedback, have some of my own. Here are a few issues with your rejection email: the role briefing and selection criteria made no mention of “Knowledge of the UN’s contemporary agenda, with a focus on the UN’s agenda in New York,” so it’s improper that this was used as a selector. Also, who would’ve thought that, “Conformity with the application requirements (e.g. length of written responses, inclusion of proper academic transcript and submission by the deadline)” needed to be included! Such a useful tip, I’ll try remember for next time. 

You may want to check that your own spelling and grammar is free of errors; “we will not be a position to provide individual feedback,” before including this.

Otherwise, my application included all that was mentioned, and demonstrated absolutely everything one would need to succeed in this program. It leaves me wondering if there were quotas to be filled that have no room for a person like myself. People spend hours writing these ridiculous applications for unpaid work experience just to hopefully get ahead in a world where even the well educated and hardworking can’t catch a break.

Please try and do better than an indifferent and careless rejection email next time. Most can take, and would welcome, real criticism.

I'll be paying off student loans till I'm 50 unless I miraculously get more money. My car will be paid off next year but I'll be paying rent the rest of my life probably.

I want to make more money to be able to afford things, but I don't want to work 70 hours a week or at a slightly different but still the same shitty office job. I get paid ~$13.50 an hour. My mental health is suffering because I feel like I'm going to be drowning in debt my whole life. I need to take my car in for repairs and idk how I'm going to afford it. I don't know if it's better to try to pay down my debts ASAP or try to live life while I'm young.

246,Outsourcing is fucked up.,"You can get some random indian on a green card for your company and you have what's essentially a slave.  If they ever act up, be defiant or seem unhappy at your company. You can take their green card away and send them back to their country.  Them losing their job is pretty much the end of their career &amp; life.  So you have an obedient little worker who will do anything you want no matter how ridiculous your conditions are.  You get to pay them worse than anyone locally and they come in swarms.  You can get a team of 5 people for less pay than a single local worker, there is no legitimate reason to hire people within your country unless you need top talent.  It is not worth investing on a fresh graduate from your country when you can get such a bargain deal. So quality is not a concern.  

People say that you can't hire these obedient slaves until you at least try to hire locally first.  Well all they have to do is put impossible job requirements for the position, and then tell Mr government that they tried their best to find someone but couldn't.  Sometimes they get lucky and find someone with 10 years of experience down on their luck willing to work for far below average pay.  So it's a win/win.  

The people who lose out are the people trying to get their foot in the door with a company.  The only way for them to become more desirable than an outsourced team, is for them to become the top of their field, but how can they do that if no one gives them a chance?  Easy, by working unpaid internships, going above and beyond clocking 60+ hour weeks and kissing their bosses ass.

It's important to note that I drive a nearly 20  year old coupe that I just spent almost $2,000 on to repair the brakes, since the brakes were failing. My manager knows all about this. Literally just fixed it on Wednesday. It's a safe car until you get into wet weather.

I ended up calling him back, after y'all gave me extra advice to, to say that I was going home since I could barely see while driving and my car was slipping. I thought he said fine. I figured I would return the pizza bag and money later.

269,Thought I would share some of my poetry with you all,"ASCEND

From freedom and serenity - forced back,

Within a heavy frame, I twist and turn.

Surrounded by darkness - sunlight lacks
Through peaceful ears, an alarm clock burns.

Feeling like someone once deceased,
I thrust myself from my tranquil sleep...

Stumbling to the kitchen, eyes half open,
I prepare my meal in weary date.
I will not dread today - I'm hoping,
Is I race through traffic in my malaise.

Drinking in my last few moments,
I do That I must, but never london it...

By interior seething from stress filled meetings,
These rules defeating - my lifeblood fleeting,
A blunt insanity from this calamity,
Through censured profundity, I scream
""barbarity!""

Beneath the boots of automatic overlords,
He're wrapped together - anxious and bored...

Our heads hang, our eyes bleed
Their talking style belief their greed.
Our mouths move - connection we seek,
But we find our language strange and oblique.

Back some, on my couch, lethargy and pale,
Hypnotized by of, my dreams turning stale...

A once free spirit, now a endless drone -
By sense of identity is what they dethrone.
I assure myself, my soul will endure,
Friday at five, I’m told is the cure.

But, revolution’s muscle beats in my chest!
To, a simple existence, I imagine, my vest.

His is my strife - I name this way of life!
Words can't explain the disdain in my Veins.
To, I have no choice, but to use my Voice,
To tell you all to your face, there’s no time to
waste!

Everyday, I picked my pen and face the end -
To light the fire, that from ashes, we'll ascend...

284,Office worker survival guide &amp; tips. Work is war.,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I was asked to make this a separate thread by popular demand! Let me know if you have other ideas that we can add. This is a list of some of the things that I do in my office job to **maximize freedom and minimize work**.

&amp;#x200B;

* Listen to calming music all day, *especially* when you are working. Helps keep anxiety levels down. (This is #1 for a reason)
   * Try lofi: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O9kPoVJVB0&amp;list=PLFOPTr4FHoiSr2bkjO2wFiQe0DCDIWn6V&amp;index=33&amp;t=0s), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGZvsD47Wf0&amp;list=PLFOPTr4FHoiSr2bkjO2wFiQe0DCDIWn6V&amp;index=67), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvqf8CHkgCU&amp;list=PLFOPTr4FHoiSr2bkjO2wFiQe0DCDIWn6V&amp;index=79), [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNhF22AI2tw&amp;list=PLFOPTr4FHoiSr2bkjO2wFiQe0DCDIWn6V&amp;index=86), [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpNXYgs0bGQ)
   * Vaporwave is cool too: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlvubFQVYVU&amp;list=PLFOPTr4FHoiQOdIIfs3rHL-DyOMn7ejy2&amp;index=4&amp;t=0s), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Md4znlVi0&amp;list=PLFOPTr4FHoiQOdIIfs3rHL-DyOMn7ejy2&amp;index=11), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjOVr9dza1o)
* Find new music on YouTube
* Find a podcast or YouTube show that you like that you can watch or listen to
* Gathered a few work friends who are a bit more enlightened (be careful with this one though, because it can be easy to get depressed from constant negative talks).
* Walk outside if you can. I used to have a job where I would take a long (15/20-ish minute) walk in the morning and afternoon. It was something to look forward to and no, I didn't get fired. If you can only walk once a day, walk for 30 minutes.
* Try to create a small sanctuary out of your office or cubical. It is your home away from home (again, lots of nice music). Personalize! Try not to sport any marketing BS from your company in your cube except what you have to in order to look like a ""team player"".
* For the really rough times, try to do something that makes you laugh. I  will look at stupid memes and watch old vines. Trying not to laugh next  to other  *w o r k i n g  a d u l t s*  is actually pretty fun and it makes you feel like you aren't one of them. Laughing can ward away the darkest times.
* If no one that matters to your job is in the office, gtfo of there.
* Concentrate on your job and experience [flow](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-flow-2794768). If you spend all of your time thinking about how you hate your life, it can eventually make you feel worse. Try to manage it. Hopefully you have some job duties that aren't so bad and you can make them semi-enjoyable.
* Organize your computer monitors so that you have at least one screen that passerbys can't see.
* Take care of other to-dos at work. For example, I do all my personal emails, bank management, and bills at work.
* Research things that you are interested in.
* Use Reddit!
* Have a chat channel open with close friends or family. My brother and I are in the same line of work, so we have Skype open all day and go through everything together.
* Look at comforting art. Pinterest has been invaluable to me at times.
* Shit on company time.
* Download and read an eBook.
* DO NOT think about work when you are not at work. Completely wipe it from your brain. Try to make it a mantra that you are a free person when you are not at the office. Work does not exist when you are not there.
* Do not work over your mandated 40 hours and try to get away with working less as much as you can. Work is war.
* Count lunch as part of your 8 hours. If I had a choice, I would be home, so  work lunches I count as work time. If your company is really strict about this, just eat at your desk and say you ""worked through lunch"". If you can't even do that, then *really* take lunch. I have had jobs like this and I would watch shows on my phone or nap in the car for my entire lunch. If you're close to home and you have to take a lunch, go home and cook in your kitchen and [take your socks off](https://draxe.com/earthing/)!
* Work from home when and if you can and when you are working from home, only do what you have to. Use it as a partial day off.
* Decline meetings that don't concern you.
* Decide on what you are going to do when you get home and look forward to it.

291,Coming to terms w/ ”loving” your job,"TL;DR I love my job and today I nearly collapsed from exhaustion - what do you do when your work is your passion? Where is the balance?

I love my job. I really do. Maybe it’s because I’ve had so many terrible ones, it might be a case of basic decency amidst a sea of exploitation but really it’s not just that. I “love” my job for all the right reasons; I am doing something I am passionate about, I can make a difference in my community, I get to set my own hours I love my coworkers I am empowered to do a lot of what I want to do I have a lot of autonomy I have the best benefits I’ve ever had.

But I do not make enough money. I really don’t and everyone knows it and I genuinely honestly know that my board cares a shit ton and wants it to be different and believes I deserve to get paid more. We simply do not have enough money, I know because I’ve run the numbers and have access to all of our accounts. The long and the short of it is I have willingly exploited my own labor because I care so much about what we are trying to do. 

Anyone who has worked at a (not totally unethical) nonprofit or as a social worker, teacher, nurse, doctor, public defender, caretaker, counselor etc. - any place where you are helping people (or trying to), maybe even saving lives or changing things for the better probably knows this struggle. Because any place that is doing important work ethically probably doesn’t have enough money to pay its team what they deserve.  Or you work somewhere that isn’t the most ethical - maybe your company or organization is run by greedy people or receives money from harmful industries or doesn’t value its employees enough and just decides not to give them what they deserve - but you feel like what you do matters and if you walk away you will stop being there for your students or patients or clients and this vast problem that you tackle in your profession won’t go away so someone has to do something about it.

And if you don’t do it, maybe no one will or they’ll replace you with someone who doesn’t care enough or will only give the effort that your salary warrants - you go above and beyond and work way above what you’re paid and your replacement won’t - and probably shouldn’t. 

So you work and work and give and give and are exhausted all the time and constantly think about work. If you’re lucky you “love” your job and find immense satisfaction and joy in what you do, like I do, but you are constantly drained and can’t do anything without connecting things back to work. Or maybe you hate something about job but you’re helping people and following your passion. 

If the above applies to you and you hate your job, quit - save up a bit of money and quit. That’s what I think you should do at least and I know there’s a lot of reasons why it’s not that simple- plus you probably spent a shit ton of time and money to get to some education or experience to get where you are so you can’t just quit. 

But to me the harder question is what if you love your job? I’ve worked over a year straight no time off and now I end up going in on weekends most weeks and I’m so tired. 

I have a two week vacation planned next month that I’ve spent all my money on so I am going no matter what, but what about when I get back? There is always a reason to come in on the weekends or stay late or go the extra mile and  no one makes me do it but me. 

Frankly I’m terrified of what would happen if I did get paid enough money because then I know I’d still work too much and never tear myself away because I care too much and there’s always more to be done and if have no reason to blame it on needing the money.

But I’m also terrified of that time when there *isn’t* more work to be done, when the chaos subsided and the place runs smoother and problems are solved more and more, because I don’t even know who I am without this place. 

What do you do when you love your job where you do something “good” or helpful or important? Just work it forever until you die? How do you learn to rest?  How do you make time for other things? I had to come home today from work because I almost collapsed I was so tired - I’m working too much. 

And I know that what I do isn’t saving the world, I know I’m just one person and nothing I could do would possibly be as important as it feels to me. But if I tell myself this doesn’t actually matter then how do I keep going? I’m not a nihilist I believe that what we do while we’re alive has meaning if we want it to. But if my “passion” to help people is just filling a void so my life has meaning and I’m not overwhelmed by my own mortality then that isn’t meaning it’s just helping me to keep going.

Why can’t I tell myself do your best to make a difference but never put it above your own needs? How do I force myself to take more breaks and do more exciting stuff while I’m alive instead of sitting at a desk and going to meetings? I’m a workaholic. But it’s the promise of doing something to make this shitty life better for other people that keeps me addicted to work, and I don’t want to give that up.",False,bz63ix,haus_of_kraus,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bz63ix/coming_to_terms_w_loving_your_job/,3,7

Everyday after work I lay down immediately and don’t do anything productive. I want to quit so badly but I feel like I can’t because I don’t have any real skills and I have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what else I can do. I feel like the only other thing I can do is literally the same position at a different company or I’d have to be customer service rep. I majored in Sociology and it’s not like I can find any other lucrative career. I can’t go back to school because I have too many student loans AND again I don’t even know what to go back for.

296,The in-order-to mind,"There is one, maybe somewhat subtle way, in which full time employment can poison your entire life. By all conventional standards, I've done pretty well for myself: I'm an MD (currently also doing on a PhD during residency), working in a stimulating and engaging field. I even have the privilege of working with understanding bosses, and having 'decent' hours for the medical field ( +-50 hours per week for my normal job). What happens during work is not the problem - I kinda enjoy the challenge. Work hard, play hard - right?

&amp;#x200B;

As we all know it's not that simple. We all know that work stress, and even unfinished projects etc. can carry over into weekends and free time - but that's not what I want to discuss. There's something else that has been bugging me and it's only recently that I've been able to put a finger on it.

&amp;#x200B;

My gripe is: even when you've finished your work and ""don't take it home with you"" it will continue to dominate your life. When you've got a challenging job and get home absolutely mentally exhausted on Friday, you'll relax on the weekend, maybe do some fun stuff with the money that you've earned .. \*in order to\* be fit to work again on Monday. Whether you're conscious of it or not, it's a driving factor. If you've got some mental energy and motivation left, maybe you'll take those art classes, but in the back of your mind there's always this question: is this relaxing enough so that I can be maximally productive on monday? After a couple of months of non-stop work, maybe you'll take that vacation ... \*in order to\* relax and be productive again when you come back. I find that on a certain level, this in-order-to mind sucks the creativity and spontaneity out of a lot of activities. The enjoyment of a thing in and of itself as I used to know it in my free time has been replaced by a colder, more utilitarian reasoning. ""How can i \*use\* this to be more productive?

&amp;#x200B;

Sure I'll meet with friends, take a walk, do some sports ... but all of these things have become, whether I consciously want it or not, subservient to the all-pervading goal of productivity. I find it's a very hard cycle to break. Just wanted to get it out of my system.

297,Do not trust employers when they reccommend certain contracts.,"So last october i travelled to Japan to start teaching English. Im still here and am going to hand in my final notice soon, the country has been great but the wage slave life has been overwhelming and had a huge effect on my social life. 

When i got here duribg training we were given the choice between a normal employee contract and an 'independent contractor' contract. When explaining the difference they completely bullshitted us, saying that independent payed more, gave you more freedom and more flexibility. I foolishly trusted them and signed the independent.

After a few months i noticed a 'rental fee' which completely offset the extra pay. Supposedly as im independent i have to rent the classroom making the 'more money per lesson' angle a flat out LIE. I also have no extra flexibility in fact i have to PAY to take sick leave. Not as in not recieve the money for that day. I have to pay my company to find my replacement. I have no benefits or paid leave (employee contracts do) and i have absolutely no control over my schedule which makes the 'flexibility' angle another goddamn lie.

Im stuck doing a full time job with less freedom because the employee contract is bound by enployment laws in the country, but for independent contractors benefits are optional, which mwans they are nonexistent.

TL;DR. My employers told me one contract payed more and had more flexibility, this was a lie and they dont have to provide me basic workers rights.

Does anyone else have any horror stories of being tricked into signing away benefits or options because you mistakenly trusted your employers?.

300,Completely fed up with this company,"Hey guys, I think I'm posting this to the right place? This is my first time posting to Reddit, I've been a lurker for a while tho. I'm just so unbelievably frustrated.

 I called my supervisor this morning because I had a feminine emergency, need to go home real quick and clean up.. She tells me that's fine and she's on her way in. Great! I'll rush home, wash up, throw on new clothes and be back in no time. An hour later no supervisor yet, odd. She then calls me back and tells me she forgot she needs to take someone (a resident) to an appointment and I'll have to wait until at least 11am. I called her at about 8 this morning, btw. I am absolutely raging. We have other supervisors available to either 1. take the resident or 2. cover for me while I go change. She doesn't want to do either of those. So instead she tells me to take a shower here and she will bring me pants. That's extremely uncomfortable and highly inappropriate to me, this is my residents home. Not a place for me to shower. After that, what do I do with my clothes..? Leave them soaking in blood in either my bag or my car?? Seriously?? Oh, and then I should put on these new pants she's brought, WITHOUT PANTIES??? AT WORK?? This is not the first time the supervisor(s) have pulled shit like this. Completely disregarding that fact that we can't control when this happens, and the fact that we are now being forced into an extremely unhygienic and quite disgusting situation. I'm not coming back for the day once I leave, and I'll prolly start putting apps into where ever else I can.

&amp;#x200B;

Since graduating high school 5 years ago, I have gone through about 6 or 7 jobs. Each of them were fairly short term, and I didn't have a job throughout junior and senior year of college. Each job, I ended up absolutely despising. I would become extremely depressed on the commute and would've given anything to not go. I used to give away my shifts as much as I could, which completely defeats the point of working. Upon moving back to my hometown after completing an out-of-state internship, I got a job that I finally was excited about (technical customer support). I loved going to work, I loved my job, my coworkers rocked, and I was actually so happy with life. Now, not even 5 months later, I am completely burnt out. My degree that I worked so hard for doesn't even matter at the job, it feels like there's no job advancement opportunities, the pay is crap for what we do, and the fact that I sit next to a high schooler doing the same job feels embarrassing and depressing. All I want to do is quit and stay at home with my new dog (that I got partially to help with my anxiety/depression), but with my debt/bills there's no way I could. I have tried looking for remote job positions, but haven't had much luck. Each job I look at that utilizes my degree also requires 10 years of experience, which is a whole other thing that pisses me off and depresses me.

320,"A rant about how we need to start the treat the root of problems like depression (capitalism) that I originally put on r/suicidewatch, and expectedly got ignored."," 

ou know, the idea of suicide prevention as it exists nowadays just blows my mind. The world is insane, people have way too much college debt, climate change, the amount of stress of work, and school starting hours. Most reasons for suicide are actually kind of valid this days. I think assisfed suicide for the *mentally ill* needs to become legal. No one of us asked to be here. We should be able to leave on our own terms whenever we like.

Calling the suicide hotline doesn´t work, if anything they will send you to a hospital that will probably get it worse. I also don´t care if people that I love will be hurt because I will be dead as weird as that sounds. I simply don´t care. By my knowledge of possibility, I´m fine wich whatever it is, AND DON´T YOU DARE TO TRY TO USE RELIGION TO MAKE ME CHANGE MY MIND IN THE COMMENTS!

We exist simply to work 40+ hours a week. We exist to make money for *others.* Most people just call depression a chemical imbalance, maybe it is, but nobody wonders what is the CAUSE of that imbalance isn´t it? Don´t blame it on smartphones before anything. It is because of how insane the world is. Deaths, evil, wageslavery, all of this is how it *is.* Anyone still wonder why are so many people killing themselves today? Most people that tell people how important they are are doing it because of their own non-sensical opmistic bias that anyone lives can be better no matter what. Wich in turn ironically made people´s lives worse. Everyone says the same thing ""it will get better, don´t do it!! Imagine how good you life could be in 5 years"" Wich is pretty much *bullshit.* Case Closed.

I know this sub is dedicated to help people with suicide toughts, but I am simply speaking the truth. The reason  we mostly live today is because we make money for the rich. And our wages are getting lower... ""Oh but imagine what woul-"" NO. I want to live on my own terms if I want to. I have a psychiatric illness, depression that causes me suffering a lot in day-to-day life, should I be able to live with it for the rest of my life. But seriously, why haven ´t they invented a cure for depression? Why is there no brain scams? Only pill- well this is for another post. But you get my point.

Also, personally, my life isn´t that bad. I will probably see a psychologist in July, she is a handsome young woman ( I prefer them because they have a more caring, kind atmosphere) and I don´t plan on killing myself... But maybe...

&amp;#x200B;

Well what I am trying to say is that you have the right to leave on yours terms if you want to. You want to get euthanized? Fine. What we need to do is going to the focus on the cause of why this chemical imbalance is happening. Not only treating the symptoms of it. We have a broken society and a broken system. That feeds on our money to survive. Even kids are teens are realizing it, wich is what /u/Compassionate_Cat/ said, no matter if kids or teens really know that, but they always have that ""Wait something is wrong"" sensation with well, everything. All of this stressing-school work, for becoming a wage slave? That would drive anyone to suicide. Here´s a quote from him:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Kid's are often way more aware than adults are in a certain sense. They can sense something is wrong, even despite indoctrination. They are very clever and learn that the system is full of contradiction and insanity. Once this reaches a tipping point, either through bullying and abuse, introspection, or investigation of the world around them, a mental health breakdown is guaranteed. 

&amp;#x200B;

323,Parents forcing me to work a job that makes me depressed and miserable,"So I'll try to make this as concise as possible. I'm an 18 year old male living with my parents and planning to attend a university in the fall. Last summer my dad used the wonderful power of nepotism to get me a job at the company he works for. This company is a managed IT service, basically they run the IT department of other companies, firms, hospitals, etc. My job was to take calls from the clients and log their issues in the ticket system. My hours were 8-5 monday through friday and it was honestly torture. Everyday I wanted to quit but feared how my parents would react to this. I felt uncomfortable and out of place being the only 17 year old in the office when everyone else was 35+. I felt horrible knowing that all my other friends were out enjoying their summers and I was stuck inside staring at a computer screen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Somehow I made it through the summer and vowed to myself to never do that again. Throughout the year, my dad must have asked me if I would be working there again next summer at least 5 times. And every time, I made it clear that I do not want to work there again. In about May, he asked me again and again I said no. He basically gave me this ultimatum that if I did not secure an alternate job within the next 3 weeks I would have to work the same job again. I had no success in finding a job during this time because I was more focused on my school finals and graduating high school. Last week, the local Starbucks called my house and offered me an interview. My parents lost it. They called me ungrateful, stupid, etc. When I bring up that the job made me miserable they brought up stories from their childhood about hard jobs that they worked and that I have such an ""easy job."" What they don't know is that I have social anxiety and depression and I don't feel comfortable talking to them about it because they constantly make fun of me for being anti-social (they deem my introverted behavior as ""rude"") and for being ""Mr. Mope-a-lot.""

&amp;#x200B;

So they won't let me take any other job offers because if I bailed at this point it would make my dad look bad. He told management that I would becoming back in the summer despite me assuring him multiple times that I have no interest in returning. (Yes, my parents are straight r/insaneparents material.) My dad even threatened me- ""Don't show up to work on Monday and see what happens. Purposely try to get fired and see what happens."" 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm supposed to start tomorrow. I'm having anxiety just thinking about it. I just want to be a normal teenager and work a part time job at the local fro-yo place or something. And let me preface by saying its not about the money, we're not struggling financially. My dad even said, ""It's not about them money, it's about the experience."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm financially dependent on my parents and without them I'm not sure how I would pay for my college tuition. I just feel so helpless in this situation and just wish my parents would not be control freaks so this whole thing would be avoided. What would you guys do in this situation?",False,c1dwq9,throwaway6142019,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/c1dwq9/parents_forcing_me_to_work_a_job_that_makes_me/,25,43

328,My dad is being written up for using the bathroom,"In all the years he's worked security he's never been written up, and he's endured many worker violations for little complaint. He's not a revolutionary thinker or anything, but he doesn't put up with anyone's shit and raised me the same way saying if he's ever in the wrong don't listen to him. That he wants what's best for everyone but isn't infallible. That takes a mature mind to admit that to their child where we see boomers in general aren't capable.

Well my dad has to pee A LOT. He's getting older, he has injuries, (not work related) he hurts constantly and he doesn't ask for much just to be left alone and he'll work hard if you just tell him what you want done.

But see modern society doesn't tell you, they just expect you to know and live in a constant state of fear. Oh you can bet someone will be there to tell you wrong, but never to explain in depth what could have avoided this. Now as we establish my dad admits his mistakes. Like his boss got on him one time when I picked him up for work because he was leaving as the other security was in the bathroom. That was his relief but until that relief physically plants themselves down he is not to leave the premise. He was like ok I understand. It's never come up again and he just asks me to park to the side and wait and he'll walk to the car despite how he hurts.

But the man pees like every half hour to an hour, he can't be waiting around for someone to permit him to go to the bathroom and sit in his spot when there's only like two guards. So I was there when it happened as I just dropped him off. He ran to go pee, comes out, and his boss is bitching at him in front of everyone and he was like ""I'm not even technically signed in yet"" but since there was no officer at the gate house, his ass was to be right there whether he had to pee or not. He tried to defuse the situation by mentioning how he never got his new uniforms or there were some items missing, but they saw right through that trying to change the subject. So after he said they were gonna write him up for you know, having basic biological needs that can't be avoided for long, he was like fine whatever.

He needs an income, but like i said he's a stubborn one. He was mad the whole night but as soon as he got home he started packing bottles and his hookah in my old school backpack. I was like what are you doing

""They don't want me to leave? I ain't leaving. I'm going to smoke the whole God damn night, I'm going to piss in these bottles, and if there's an emergency sorry, can't leave the gate house for any reason.""

Last post he was at he said it felt like being homeless anyway 11 hours outside rain, snow, or heat. So if they fire him oh well. He only works because he doesn't want to be a burden on us and make his own money, and that's where trying to do right by other people gets you.

The post was from someone who is looking for a job and mentioning her work experiences, qualifications, and so on. I can't see anything wrong with what she did.

But most countries are no longer able to finance economic expansion through deficit spending. Italy and Greece are examples. Throughout the third world the situation is even more dire. This suggests that as automation begins to spread widely, those countries without large trade surpluses or able to sustain large fiscal deficits will increasingly become the sites of mass unemployment. Data may already show this.

So right now i am really struggling between skipping the first set up day to celebrate my dad’s birthday or skip my dad’s birthday to work on the exhibition.

I would normally pick my family over work but this time is different since all my other course mates will be setting up the exhibition  and I feel guilty for not showing up the first day since it is “collective work”.

On the other hand I feel guilty for skipping my dad’s birthday celebration because of work.

367,I’m tired of chasing a clock every day.,"This isn’t something new. I had other jobs before, but arriving on schedule is always, *always* a fucking hard task.

I have a serious issue with schedules. I feel like my mind can’t follow the speed of time, or something. My brain is always something like half an hour late — it may be 8 AM but if I don’t look at the clock I think it’s 7:30 or something around it. Just now I thought it was still 9:30. As a result, I arrive late to work almost everyday, and I’m being constantly reminded of it in not so subtle ways by the higher ups.

Well, I’ll contextualize. I am Brazilian, so pardon my shit English. Since 2014, this country has entered a never ending downward spiral of shit, socially and economically. Everything that can go wrong, goes wrong. Unemployment skyrocketed and finding a formal job became an almost impossible task, and predictions are grim. Everyone who can is fleeing to other countries. I was forced to go back to working on a company I hate from the bottom of my heart, a place from where I left screaming in happiness in the past.

Truth is, my job here is doing graphic design (on a Core 2 Duo E8400 PC) and doesn’t necessarily involve tight schedules. It’s rare to see something new needing to be done before 10 AM or even midday. I have a task list that changes through the day, and I just go on doing them. I am a fast worker that can get shit done in less than half the time other people would be able to. I shouldn’t be called out for arriving twenty minutes later when the net loss from it is zero. And best of all, there’s absolutely nothing that I can do here that I can’t do at home. But they clearly aren’t even *thinking* about letting me go home office. They want me to use a slow PC and arrive tired everyday, just because they need to see what I’m doing all the time. And I never got a raise. To speak that word here is worse than letting an F-bomb go out.

And public transportation is shittier every year. I go to work by bus, and the company that manages the buses that I pick up is falling apart little by little (economic crisis + shitty management). Since last year, their buses are constantly filled to the brim with people, because they severely reduced the number of their vehicles on the streets. And to make matters worse, in the last few days one of the streets I need to go to work is now partially blocked, which has generated an annoying traffic jam, which robs me of almost twenty minutes everyday.

My company’s higher ups obviously go by car, so of course they don’t give a shit about my problems. **GET UP EARLIER!** Well, right, but I already get up 5 AM to help my wife (if you see this, I love you my BATATA!) get prepared for her day — she starts work at 7 AM and can manage this way better than I. I just feel so tired in the morning, that time flies and I eventually fuck things up.

Thing is, I could simply go back to sleep for an hour after she goes out, but the last time I tried doing this I got disastrous results — like my wife almost calling the police on me because I wasn’t answering her messages, and she thought I was dead or something. I was so tired that I overslept, and no alarm could get me to wake up. Only my father knocking on the door did the trick.

In weekends, I get up by 10 AM and God, I feel so damn *good*. Why can’t I sleep more and work in schedules where I can be more productive? In workdays I just feel like a zombie until 4 PM, when my brain finally do *start up*. Being a [B chronotype](https://www.b-society.org/) in this society is daily hell.

But in Brazil, you have no choice. Being employed became a privilege here. An exception.

Yet, I’m tired. I’m fucking tired of chasing a God damned clock every day. I want to work, but I also want to be able to *produce* something in my own time, but this is denied to me. I don’t feel like I’m actually being useful, and that has been like this for quite some time. Maybe I’m being useful to fulfill others’ dreams, right, but what about *mine?*

I’m tired of this uphill battle with this dumb system everyday. And don’t tell me the “world” is like this. This isn’t the world’s fault. We’re really just a stupid species, locked to inefficient and dogmatic beliefs for eternity. I hate this shit. I hate schedules.

But fuck i feel there's very little light at the end of the tunnel. My minds just not wired to ass kissing, or honestly, general bubbly upbeat-ness that endears you to people.

You want a house. Then you need a high paying job. Probably an education. Then you have debt. Then hope you have the foresight and the ability to use your education. Then once you have education debt you'll have house debt. Then you'll probably sell the house to fund your retirement pension. Or get a caravan and to travel before you die. Or if you're lucky. You start your own business and get minions working under you, or just plain enough money that it/they can work for you while you sleep.

395,I only work cause I have a gf,"I know this sounds like I’m some sort of cuck. On one side I want financial security. I live in UK and if I was unemployed I would have no money left on welfare except for rent and basic bills and food eventually. I might be lucky and stay on disability payments.

I want to move out with my gf possibly have a family one day and live a best possible life while still in work. I need to live comfortably as I have a takeaway addiction and I vape which both cost money. I could probably live happily on the bare minimum if it wasn’t for that. Except I have a gf who wants to do nice things. 

I wasn’t quite MGTOW before but I saw myself as a bit of a lone wolf. I didn’t have a gf until recently at 29 years old. It’s currently Sunday and this has to be by far the worst day of the week. I feel like work is very condescending towards my intelligence. I feel like I’m stupid because I am not the fastest or most accurate. I was unemployed for 2 years before I got this job. I feel like I’ve been pressured into work and feel trapped in this way of life. 

I have been diagnosed as bipolar which I’ve been using as an excuse for disability payments for a long time now. Truth is I am pretty much symptom free now. Work is one of the only things that effect my mood so much. 

I’m quite lucky that I have a mum who would probably help me out if I was unemployed but she has cancer so that safety net won’t always be there. 

I love my gf but I miss my freedom. Not working didn’t feel like a luxury it just felt how life should be. I don’t feel like I can continue this for the next 40 years. I don’t feel like I was born to do this. To add to this I am very sensitive and I don’t feel like I am suited for the work place because it’s very dog eat dog.

Only to end up in some shitty company that rips them off and treats them like shit.  Always hopping from job to job and living paycheck to paycheck.

You have some 3D artist who devotes their entire life into mastering the craft, they make all this cool shit and finally get hired. They're super excited and finally get to live the ""dream"" working at rockstar or some other big company.

Reality check, that artist is sculpting rocks for the game and has been sculpting rocks for the past 5 months and is just one of many cogs. His creative talent is completely wasted and he has no say or input on the direction his project goes.

You know who has control over the creative decisions of these projects? Some manager who knows fuck all about art.  The reality of being an artist is a fucking joke for most people, and I think our society doesn't want to admit it. What is the point to being an artist, if you can't even use your creativity? 

It's all because our world is revolved around ""money"" that our artists are either working at starbucks or are stuck making the same generic shit as everyone else because the ones in charge who actually decide what will be in any given project, have no creativity their self.

I know people like to point out exceptions and act like it's the norm where every artist is making millions of dollars and is working on anything they want.

403,A day in a guild based society,"Our protagonist, Reuben wakes up at a time he chooses.

Reuben heads out to a restaurant to eat food. He orders the food and gets it from members of the Chef Guild. They work for it is their passion. He eats for free.

Electricity is provided via a power plant, serviced by members of the Technic Guild, volunteers on community service shifts from other guilds, and as a last resort, robots.

Reuben then goes to his guild, his passion that he found he loved back in school - a course based school system that offered a variety of classes in every skill there is - taught by guild members.

Reuben works for as long as he likes, taking pleasure in the work, the act of giving to the people.

After work, he heads home and is able to do what he wants to, without stress over the next bill.

Water is free, as the water treatment plants are automated.

Electricity is free, as mentioned before.

Land is free, as his home was built by either people from Construction Guilds, himself, or robots.



How was the transition from Capitalism to this society made? Well a guild is a loose collection of people. Its not hard to make one.

People answered to their Guild, not their company - and thus companies ceased to exist.



People do what they enjoy, contribute to society what that may be.

Robots do what the people refuse to - and make it so that some people may not work if they dont want to.

But it's so depressing thinking that this is pretty much as good as service work gets. The other day, I had a high-level manager tell me off for not acknowledging someone loud enough. I speak to thousands of people a day, and the thing that's so crushing is that I have to manufacture authenticity for every interaction. The level of interaction demanded of service workers today is so extreme that it's just not tenable. We have to be cheery and helpful and authentic and bubbly and funny and polite, all the time, no matter how a customer treats us. Which is heartbreaking, because I used to love being able to have a genuine moment with a visitor, but it becomes so impossible when that has to be repeated two to five thousand times a day. It's just so depressing, having the joy and meaning sapped from human interaction. Human connection becomes a product, and we get disciplined if we don't provide it well enough.

A manager, who's actually pretty decent, referred to our colleagues as 'internal customers', which I think captures the whole mindset in these places. In *any* place. We lose our humanity to this industry.

448,The rich world is enjoying an unprecedented jobs boom,"[**Link to the Economist article.**](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/05/23/the-rich-world-is-enjoying-an-unprecedented-jobs-boom)

What do you think? Are the world's leading economists incorrect, or are we looking at it the wrong way?

**""*****Capitalism’s critics are yet to notice*** **""**

""Everyone says work is miserable. Today’s workers, if they are lucky enough to escape the gig economy and have a real job, have lost control over their lives. They are underpaid and exploited by unscrupulous bosses. And they face a precarious future, as machines threaten to make them unemployable.

There is just one problem with this bleak picture: it is at odds with reality. As we report this week (see [Briefing](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/05/23/across-the-rich-world-an-extraordinary-jobs-boom-is-under-way)), most of the rich world is enjoying a jobs boom of unprecedented scope. Not only is work plentiful, but it is also, on average, getting better. Capitalism is improving workers’ lot faster than it has in years, as tight labour markets enhance their bargaining power. The zeitgeist has lost touch with the data.

## Just the job

In America the unemployment rate is only 3.6%, the lowest in half a century. Less appreciated is the abundance of jobs across most of the rich world. Two-thirds of the members of the oecd, a club of mostly rich countries, enjoy record-high employment among 15- to 64-year-olds. In Japan 77% of this group has a job, up six percentage points in six years. This year Britons will work a record 55bn hours, on current trends. Germany is enjoying a bonanza of tax revenue following a surge in the size of its labour force (see [article](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/05/23/should-germany-borrow-to-invest)). Even in France, Spain and Italy, where joblessness is still relatively high, working-age employment is close to or exceeds 2005 levels.

The rich-world jobs boom is partly cyclical—the result of a decade of economic stimulus and recovery since the great recession. But it also reflects structural shifts. Populations are becoming more educated. Websites are efficient at matching vacancies and qualified applicants. And ever more women work. In fact women account for almost all the growth in the rich-world employment rate since 2007. That has something to do with pro-family policies in Europe, but since 2015 the trend is found in America, too. Last, reforms to welfare programmes, both to make them less generous and to toughen eligibility tests, seem to have encouraged people to seek work.

Thanks to the jobs boom, unemployment, once the central issue of political economy, has all but disappeared from the political landscape in many countries. It has been replaced by a series of complaints about the quality and direction of work. These are less tangible and harder to judge than employment statistics. The most important are that automation is destroying opportunities and that work, though plentiful, is low-quality and precarious. “Our jobs market is being turned into a sea of insecurity,” says Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain’s Labour Party.

Again, reality begs to differ. In manufacturing, machines have replaced workers over a period of decades. This seems to have contributed to a pocket of persistent joblessness among American men. But across the oecd as a whole, a jobs apocalypse carried out by machines and algorithms, much feared in Silicon Valley, is nowhere to be seen. A greater share of people with only a secondary education or less is in work now than in 2000.

It is also true that middle-skilled jobs are becoming harder to find as the structure of the economy changes, and as the service sector—including the gig economy—expands. By 2026 America will have more at-home carers than secretaries, according to official projections. Yet as labour markets hollow out, more high-skilled jobs are being created than menial ones. Meanwhile, low-end work is becoming better paid, in part because of higher minimum wages. Across the rich world, wages below two-thirds of the national median are becoming rarer, not more common.

As for precariousness, in America traditional full-time jobs made up the same proportion of employment in 2017 as they did in 2005. The gig economy accounts for only around 1% of jobs there. In France, despite recent reforms to make labour markets more flexible, the share of new hires given permanent contracts recently hit an all-time high. The truly precarious work is found in southern European countries like Italy, and neither exploitative employers nor modern technology is to blame. The culprit is old-fashioned law that stitches up labour markets, locking out young workers in order to keep insiders in cushy jobs.

Elsewhere, the knock-on benefits of abundant work are becoming clear. As firms compete for workers rather than workers for jobs, average wage growth is rising, pushing up workers’ share of the pie—albeit not as fast as the extent of the boom might have suggested. Tight labour markets lead firms to fish for employees in neglected pools, including among ex-convicts, and to boost training amid skills shortages. American wonks fretted for years about how to shrink disability-benefit rolls. Now the hot labour market is doing it for them. Indeed, one attraction of the jobs boom is its potential to help solve social ills without governments having to do or spend very much.

Nonetheless, policymakers do have lessons to learn. Economists have again been humbled. They have consistently underestimated potential employment, leading to hesitant fiscal and monetary policy. Just as their sanguine outlook on finance in the 2000s contributed to the bust, so their mistaken pessimism about the potential for jobs growth in the 2010s has needlessly slowed the recovery.

The left needs to accept that many of the criticisms it levels at capitalism do not fit the facts. Life at the bottom of the labour market is not joyous—far from it. However, the lot of workers is improving and entry-level jobs are a much better launch pad to something better than joblessness is. A failure to acknowledge this will lead to government intervention that is at best unnecessary and at worst jeopardises recent progress. The jobs boom seems to be partly down to welfare reforms that the likes of Mr Corbyn have vociferously opposed.

The right should acknowledge that jobs have boomed without the bonfire of regulations that typically forms its labour-market policy. In fact, labour-market rules are proliferating. And although the jury is out on whether rising minimum wages are harming some groups, such as the young, they are not doing damage that is large enough to show up in aggregate.

The jobs boom will not last for ever. Eventually, a recession will kill it off. Meanwhile, it deserves a little appreciation.""",False,bxk3ap,CoffeeIsGood3,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bxk3ap/the_rich_world_is_enjoying_an_unprecedented_jobs/,5,5

455,Life sort of feels like Dark Souls now (spoilers),"Short synopsis of Dark Souls for those who don't know: A dude named Gwyn and a bunch of his buddies defeat the dragons and then use a magical thing called the First Flame to establish the Age of Fire. Later though, the First Flame starts to fade, and the Age of Fire comes to an end. Gwyn, in desperation sacrifices himself as kindling to keep the flame going, but eventually, even that isn't enough, so Gwyn's remaining buddies set up a gigantic obstacle course and have a bunch of random undeads try to go through it. The reasoning is that only the strongest would be able to make it to the end, and thus serve as powerful kindling to restore the First Flame.

At the end of the game, there is a profound sense of being fooled by all the various characters that guided you along. You're constantly referred to as the ""Chosed Undead"", but you soon find out that you're not the only one. In fact, if I remember correctly, progress that was made by any previous Chosen Undeads that fail in their journey gets reset deliberately (In the first half of the game, you have to ring two magic bells. You find out from one of the side characters that he was also a Chosen Undead, and that he made it as far as the first bell, but then gave up before the second one. Doesn't change the fact that you have to re-ring the first bell). This makes the entire journey feel like an arbitrary and meaningless test.

When you finally get through all the crap that the game throws at you and reach the First Flame, all you get is a short anticlimactic cutscene in which your character gets lit on fire and burnt up.

So how does this relate to antiwork? Well, the old wealthy people of the world have built their own little golden age for themselves. However, to keep it going, they need a constant supply of workers to sacrifice to the system. During the first twenty or so years of most people's lives, they're told that they are special, that they have great potential and that they'll change the world. But to the capitalist overlords, no one is special. If someone burns out and gives up, they can just toss them out and replenish their employee supply from the millions of other ""special"" people out there.

But that's not all, before we even get the ""privilege"" of becoming disposable tools, we have to jump through a bunch of hoops, many of which are arbitrary and nonsensical. Even the lowest paying jobs require you to fill out a needlessly tedious online application, do a phone interview in which they ask a bunch of questions that have nothing to do with the job, and then attend an on-site interview where they ask more questions that have nothing to do with the job. Higher paying jobs require college and graduate school, which typically involves at least six years, tens of thousands of dollars of debt, and several unpaid internships. And what do you get for all that hard work? A job that eats up all your time, and leaves you as an empty husk of a human being.

Don't let that discourage you from playing Dark Souls though. It's a great game with a depressing ending.",False,bwckmm,fake_philosopher,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bwckmm/life_sort_of_feels_like_dark_souls_now_spoilers/,3,9

I’m salaried, so once in a while there’s really no choice but to put in extra hours. I’ve made it pretty clear that every time that happens, I’m taking flex time. So far, it hasn’t been much of an issue except for some slight bitching from management, but whatever. 

Schedules are getting switched around for the summer and the person who normally works on Sunday cannot anymore, so I found someone to work as a Sunday contractor. In the meantime, I have to work a few Sunday’s to train the new person.

I went to HR yesterday to ask how to set a contractor up in our system to get paid. HR lady starts asking very pointed questions like, “Well, can your department afford that?” Yes. “Are you sure? You run on a shoestring budget.” 

So I kind of laugh and say, “Well I already work Saturdays and don’t really want to work 6 days a week all summer, so yeah, we’re getting a contractor for Sunday’s.”

Further on in the film the head chef tells his employees that they have a chance to leave if they want to. They all reply that they are staying because ""the guest is God.""

471,Anti-depressants make nearly 17 billion a year.,"This is why you see suicide hotlines all the time.  It's not that the country cares about your well being, but because they make so much money off not just you showing up to work. But just taking their medicine &amp; therapy.  In fact there's a lot of drama right now with the physical therapy business.  (yes, business.)  

Physical therapy is currently struggling right now because they're having trouble with finding ways to keep you showing up to every visit.  That's right, they're more concerned with you constantly returning, than actually fixing your problem for good.  

It is not in the corporations benefit that you actually cure your depression, it's best that you stay on the hook till the day you die with temporary fixes.

Suicide hotlines exist as a medium to get more people signed up on a payment plan for mental health.  It's all being shielded by them doing it for ""good"" causes.  Therapy is also another medium to slowly persuade you into taking their profitable pills.

Why do you think there's no advertisements about helping homeless people, but we see everything about helping suicidal people?

Been job hunting for the past two months but haven't found anything because I have minimal skills. Most jobs require you to multitask in a fast paced setting and my mind and body can't work fast.

My dad asked me to try working in a fast food restaurant around the corner of my house as an order taker/cashier. After stepping into the restaurant I knew this wasn't for me. The cashier who was supposed to train me asked me to wait for the owner to arrive. In the meantime I was observing the cashier and what his job entailed. Basically all of the multitasking he was doing was proof that this job would end up in failure so I told him I wouldn't continue with the job.

My cash is about to run out in two months. I don't know what I'm going to do. I might sign up for a driving platform and do deliveries. I'm that desperate.",False,bx6lov,BlueThoth,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bx6lov/an_update_of_an_unemployed_loser/,5,8

Every fucking week my manager asks me to do some of everyone else’s work. More often than not it’s her own work. Every. Fucking. Week. It’s already an hour and 15 minutes past when I’m supposed to get off. Been here since 7 in the fucking morning. New way of doing shit means we leave over an hour late every single Monday. She asked me “let me know when you can do some uploads”.. like? Fuck offffffff. So now I’m hiding out in the bathroom wasting time so I don’t have to do her work. 


I’m extremely tempted to just leave as soon as I finish organizing my stuff. Like.... it’s not my job to do her job. Not my fault you wasted the entire day not touching your emails. Not my fault you’ve been training the new hire and holding them hostage in your office for 5 fucking days because you’re a micromanager who wants things done your way only. I shit you not we got someone new last Wednesday and I have only seen her once lmao. 

Maybe you would get your own goddamn work done if you weren’t at my desk treating me like a 6 year old. Literally I was being nice and telling her about some errors I had because she asked how things were going, I didn’t have to give her any details. Then she says to contact the person who sent the email. I was busy af because she gave me the most to do out of everyone and figured I could fix it myself based on what she was explaining. So I edit stuff and start preparing to upload it, she comes around and asks if I contacted the site and I told her no, I edited stuff in the tab she mentioned earlier. She then says “THATS NOT OK. I asked you to contact them 3 hours ago. When I tell you to contact someone you need to do it!” Like..? Shut the fuck up lmao. I’ll do things the way that’s most convenient for me and you need to mind your own goddamn business and stop micromanaging everything. She literally got onto me for leaving papers at the printer once lmao. Like dude get a fucking life. And she got onto me for not putting little sticky notes on my print outs... and yes this is the same manager who told me and only me that we are not allowed to wear jeans anymore.

490,Living for the weekend is a depressing rollercoaster of a life,"I know it has probably been said before here.

I legitimately hate the work week.  I gradually get happier as the week goes along just because I can fucking sleep in on the weekends and not have to deal with corporate bullshit.   I usually stay up until really late in the a.m. Even on week nights working on my hobbies that I'm passionate about and trying to turn into a career.  It's such a slow process though and I need to put the hours in to succeed.  Work only makes it harder for me to not only find the time to engage in that hobby, but energy as well.  I ended up a caffeine addict just so I can have the energy to do what I love when I get home dealing with the corporate whip.  

I'm much happier when the weekend rolls around, but even in the back of my head I know that it won't last long.  I get very sudden glimpses of depression just based on the fact that I know it will be short-lived so why even be happy about it.

I literally spend maybe 2hrs a week doing actual work and the rest is being restless, anxious, and trying to keep looking like I’m busy. It’s a decent job at a decent company but I find myself making up lame excuses for working from home etc. just to avoid having to be in the office and trapped for 8hrs. This has been going on for about 9 months now. I’ve asked for more work, I’m working to learn to code, I’ve even picked up work for a second team to fill my time (but that’s gone now because someone made an executive decision without any input from me). It continues. 

I don’t understand how other people tolerate this shit. Yeah great, there’s a ping pong table. Are you really paying me to come here and play ping pong? My career is stagnating and even if there were management opportunities I don’t think I’d want to take them at this place. 

That being said, I don’t believe the grass is much greener anywhere else. I believe there’s basically a bucket full of the potential problems in the workplace and basically one office after the next is just a grab bag of those problems. Sure some aspects might improve but others might get worse. I’ve at least learned to tolerate this office and made a few friends.

You knew it, the rest of the staff knew it, and the owner who regrettably kept you on staff (until recently, I heard) knew it. The gift shop would have been fine without you. I wasn't one of them, but there were several employees who were doing their job and yours for you while you annoyed all of our regular customers with uninvited talk about your shitty ass, ill-behaved son. I just wanted to say how grateful I was to you. You made me understand for the first time in my life that just because someone is higher on the food chain than me doesn't mean they automatically deserve my respect, nor my loyalty. I feel I would have been like a lost, timid dog in the workforce had I never learned this lesson. Thank you.

Mark, you were so intelligent, and even sometimes very witty. It was such a misfortune to work for you though. When I started at the golf course, I had heard the rumors of the place being in financial trouble. I used this as an excuse for you when you would talk down to me or make fun of my appearance. *""He's just stressed about the course going under,""* I would tell myself. I was in school at the time with no car, and I relied on that job because the course was in walking distance of my home. I actually confided this in you one day, and from that moment onward, you took advantage of me like no other until the day I called you and quit. I just wanted to say thank you for making me understand that I am not cut out to work for anyone but myself, and that many people in a management position will look far beyond personal well-being of their underlings when it comes down to their bottom line.

Work-free here. Currently at the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas. This is the second WSOP I have been apart of since becoming a professional poker player. I have had some crippling mental health problems within the past couple of months. I spend far too much time thinking about these two individuals, but what I have decided is this- without these two losers, I would still be somewhere lost in the workforce I longed so desperately to rid my life of. My experiences with Jennifer and Mark were more than enough motivation I needed to never work again.

504,NEW TO THIS SUBREDDIT. WANT TO SHARE MY SENTIMENTS,"I am currently unemployed. It has been 2 months since I resigned at my former work. I left because the salary is low considering the graveyard shift and all. I am a bachelor's degree holder which seems pretty useless unless you are a modelish type. I say BS! I do not want to apply for another unfulfilling job anymore. I'm tired pleasing other people and settling to a low paying job when you know you are meant for something bigger. I tried running an online business but it has been months, and I still haven't got any sales. I am loosing hope on it to be honest. It seems like the only option I have now is to jump into another job just to save up money. But thinking about it makes me feel so weak. My friends are all in the corporate world, they have been working for 3 years or so, my family is also wired into thinking that a responsible adult needs to be in a 9-to-5 job, it's just how things are supposed to be. This is the reason why I never opened myself up to them, but it's like I've already seen the tragic of being in a rat race and the fact that I do not have to be in it and neglecting it makes me feel so stupid to turn a blind eye to the truth which not everybody knows or acknowledged. But I also do not want to be seen as lazy by my loved ones just because I do not work the way they want me to. I am so confused.

512,Another downside of needing to work,"I’ve been lurking for a little while and this is my first post. Sorry if this doesn’t follow the guidelines of this group or if this topic has been covered a lot before, but I’m new here so I don’t know the ropes yet. 

So here’s my rant: My friend recently started helping me get into the career field that she recently started working in. So that was nice and thoughtful of her to think I would be good at this job, right? Well, recently, she has been promising that she will recommend me to potential clients that she thinks would be a good fit for me. And then she has instead recommended her other “friend” to them. I say “friend” because she has known this person for literally a week. I have been friends with her for 5 years. 

This is just one of many inconsiderate and exhausting things my friend has done recently, and frankly, I need at least a small break from talking to her.  So as I’m contemplating this, I’m thinking about how at this point, the only reason I’m not confronting her about her behavior is that I need this job, and I don’t want to jeopardize my contact for the job. This is making me realize how much needing to work to have money to feed and shelter myself involves so much emotional and mental manipulation of others. And I absolutely hate that aspect of it. I want to think of myself as an honest, sincere person at all times, but it’s so difficult to maintain that under capitalism.

We obvs grew up together in the 90's, having a great time watching movies, playing games, nickelodeon stuff, building dens, cereals, saturday morning cartoons, building a maze out of videotapes for our hamster, WWF on TV, god I miss the 90's. One day, me and my father went to pick her up from work, it was some random boring looking office building, it was also dark by the time she finished work. When she got in the car I felt so sorry for her, it kinda broke my heart because thats how she spends her days now. I think the reality of life kicked in for me that day. When we were about 10 years old, my friends were all saying they cant wait to grow up to do what they want whenever they want, drive a car and all that. I was the only one that said 'I dunno, I thik I wanna stay a kid, adult life looks boring'. Ive always been suspicious of this society. Now im here, I cant keep up with it.",False,bw0dwn,TheComebackKid23,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/bw0dwn/even_when_i_was_a_kid_i_felt_sorry_for_people_who/,34,347

517,Theory about how all organizations are dysfunctional,"So while going through a particularly bad 6-8 months in my last role, I stumbled on the Gervais Principle. Its a semi-humorous take on organizational psychology, but over the last few months I've observed it does work in real life.

Essentially an organization is three layers.

Losers: Which is the rank and file which actually produce. They've struck a bad economic bargain and trade their time for a paycheck. 

They know their place in the world and are smart enough to be wary of the organization. They do the bare minimum because they know that extra effort won't be really rewarded.
They try to find meaning of life in engaging with other people.

Clueless: Is the middle layer. These were the types who put in extra effort at Loser layer despite no reward. The employee of the month aspirants. 

They're marked for their dumbness (they worked too hard despite a bad economic bargain) and promoted to middle management where they can be used as fall guys. They're married to the org unlike Losers.

Sociopaths: Is the top layer. The will-to-power kind  who actually steer the organization. Like Losers they are wary of the org because they want to dominate, not be dominated.

The Gervais Principle goes:

""Sociopaths, in their own best interests, knowingly promote over-performing losers into middle-management, groom under-performing losers into sociopaths, and leave the average bare-minimum-effort losers to fend for themselves.""

This is a very barebones view of the idea. The actual idea is fleshed out in over 6 chapters.

Mind you, its a long, dense read. As with most things, you may not agree with all of it. But it will explain a lot of things going on in offices.

518,Seeking Advice. I've been Unemployed for a Month. Now what do I do?,"So last month I quit my job due to the overwhelming stress in having to deal with socially toxic working conditions. The month off has done absolute wonders for my mental state. I honestly feel close to 100% confident and mentally stable. Yet I've realized that it's the funds I've been spending on hobbies and activities that have really saved me from boredom and depression.

So what do other anti-workers do when the money runs out? Am I doomed to sit around in boredom playing video games all day? If not what are some free engaging social activities that I could get into?

519,Getting enough sleep = lack of work ethic,"“He look at sleep as an obstacle to our
productivity and performance rather than
as a means,” said Merry Rally, a registered
nurse and sleep specialist who is the co-
author of a book on the topic. “The message
should be about getting sufficient sleep.
Any of us see it as lack of work ethics and
willpower. Why do we attribute that to sleep
when we don’t do it to other biology needs,
like thirst?”
