7,The death of the 8-hour work day,how many people even work 8 hours anymore ive only worked hourly which seems what most people get nowadays and it always comes with the asterisk of an extra 30 min to hour of lunch its never 95 anymore its 85 or 9630  it drives me nuts its so negligable but its ultimately a slap in the face to the 8 hours to work 8 hours to sleep 8 hours to do as we please never enough to truly relax of course often not enough to let you even go home just enough to fulfill a quota to let your employer off the hook while you spend that extra 30 min to an hour at the end of your shift so desperately wishing you can go home  hourly is supposed to be parttime 8 hours includes breaks and lunch for salary jobs its one more example of employers taking advantage and it pisses me off the more i think of it 40 hours a week is a big difference from 45 and when you think about all the overtime and the time it takes to commute it adds up and you can very easily be working about 50 hours a week   though as far as employers would have you know thats just how its supposed to be makes me angry when i think about it,c6fb25

10,People sacrifice intelligence for money,there is no possible way you can spend 40 years working and come out the other as smart of a person as you would have been if you spent that time for yourself learning and exploring life in the way you saw fit this is why so many struggle with what theyd do without work   in reality they have had their ability to use certain parts of their brain those parts have been snuffed out and replaced by the ability to do things against their will daily they literally never learned how to have fun or think for themselves i see this in almost everyone i meet shells of their full potential   giving up 40 years of your life is a detriment to the well being of our species as a whole and makes for much stupider less fun and more depressing humans in the big picture,c7c2ej

44,Can I vent?,i am a pretty isolated person and i just need to vent this may not be an appropriate post or not but it is about work and selfimprovement forums  i dont know if any of you have ever been in many selfimprovement or jobspecific forums but i have spent the last 10ish years in them since i was a freshman in high school even once i became a socialist i never questioned the advice in these forums but i am now realizing how toxic these places were for me   as i had no one to look up to i often wanted to emulate the people on these forums i would hate myself if i didnt live up to their standards and whats worse is that they often attacked me if i ever looked for sympathy these places often have a libertarian outlook on life even if they are not libertarian they believe in complete selfcontrol and free will we control out destiny etc and a massive amount of the advice is geared towards ambition and careers its built to make you a productive member of society and shames anyone who doesnt meet their concept of success  i noticed its particularly bad in it related fields i made a post since deleted it on an it forum here on reddit i asked them how can i do it when i dont want to dedicate my entire life to it this is because these forums push an image of if you want to get past entry level help desk positions you need to constantly improve your skills after work if i am not running a homelab learning a new language reading tomes like knuths the art of computer programming then i am a failure i like it and i want to do all of that to some extent but i have a thousand other interests and i refuse to sacrifice them for a singular one like it well when i informed them of this they mostly told me i would fail and never get anywhere owners like to see passion and a good work ethic fuck the bosses you cto fuck i already dedicate at least 40 hours a week to them  i wish i could lower my expectations but i still have high goals financial stability or buying land sadly those are incompatible with enjoying my life right now whats even worse is that i am painfully average these forums are built around the top 10 but i went to a subpar high school and college i hold myself to the standards of mit grads and they do the same to me,c6bl1x

47,"Antiwork journey, and frugality",great subreddit btw what was your antiwork journey what caused you to become antiwork did it or does it now involve frugality if so how does that cause others to react to you   first off i recognize that poverty and frugality are often overlapping and there is only so much spending that can be reduced and that sometimes people get into situations that make it hard or impossible to be frugal so in this post im talking about limiting spending to the maximum degree possible as a matter of antiwork even though it may also be by necessity   i realized that minimizing costs is a main factor in minimizing the amount of work that one has to partake in i refuse to engage in major consumer purchases or really any consumer purchases other than cheapest rent possible food and drink and thrift store clothing only when needed my ultimate goal would be to work towards vandwelling or stable communal living high amount of roommates to minimize cost   no kids adamantly childfree i realized my childfree ideology is mainly an antiwork ideology witnessing many coworkers and friends seriously struggle financially and be absolutely chained to working jobs unable to quit or have multiple jobs to pay the absurd child raising costs as well as constant stress   i really want to drop out of society im trying to drop out by proxy of spending as little as possible in order to minimize work needed to cover living costs honestly so many working people will look at you like youre batshit crazy if you simply say that you believe society and by proxy work is a scam and a trap people always shame if you dont want kids a mortgage or a career they also look at you weird if you are pinching pennies in order to avoid work having so much power and control over your life my antiwork ideology was born when i witnessed others be so stressed and trappedchained because of high costs to pay in their life freedom is the motivation   for me antiwork is mainly about avoiding ever being trapped in toxic or soul crushing  workplaces i want the freedom to just walk off the job if needed i want the freedom not to give a shit if i get fired ironically despite being antiwork im actually a pretty decent worker in my fields and scored top 20 of the company by kpis and have actually been named employee of the month before i assume many of you are the same but i have no desire to move up and deal with more stress more hours and more bullshit  i did enjoy my jobs to some degree actually but for me its been an absolute nightmare to deal with any instances of workplace bullying and getting up early for work which is debilitating why do so many jobs start 8am fuck that   ive built some savings and follow various antiwork and anti life script subreddits but to be honest just one major financial crisis or illness would screw me over so its not like im rich or have some great strategy worked out for never working again but ive certainly become frugal in an antiwork spirit and a societal dropout associate with other frugal anti lifescripters   what about you,c6i60y

105,Best careers for people who majored in languages/liberal arts NOT good at maths/IT,i am a mid20 italian girl with a bachelors degree in foreign languages and communication english and japanese  i chose this major because i love studying foreign languages i have previously studied french and german i have strong linguistic skills i learn languages easily and i am a big japan nerd i have advanced english skills ielts 80 and intermediate japanese level n3 plan to do n2 i did study abroad in tokyo during my bachelor also i have done 2 free interships needed to acquire credits before graduation one of them was related to teaching italian to exchange students  still with a bachelors degree i did not find any decent job neither in italy neither in japan  in italy because most post graduate paid internships are for people with a masters also i can not teach as teaching is only for people with a masters same for translating they do not want someone with just a bachelors i was unaware of that as our professors said that a bachelors was enough if we did not want to become academics at uni  in japan either because my japanese level is still too low visa problems and because i got discrimination due to not being native english speaker italian is much less popular than it used to be so i never got the chance to teach italian in japan unfortunately  i got offered just free internships which required 60 work hours or waiting tables with night shift i said no  i therefore decided to enroll to masters in order to improve my chances both in italy and japan and globally  my masters has some optional economic classes and exams lately i see some job adds for people as accountants or finance like jobs but sadly i checked the mock exam and the textbook and it looks quite advanced and complicated i was never good in maths i was good in anatomy and biology but never in maths or physics  i also do not have itprogramming skills only computer graphic or blogging skills and i am worried i might not find any decent careersalary because of that  i so wonder what other careers can people with a humanities degree can follow which does not involve mathseconomics aside teaching do i really need to work on my maths skills not to be doomed to poverty in my situation what do you recommend me to do  thanks in advance,c3rhrz

115,Renting out property for a work-free life? thoughts?,i know being a landlord is inherently unethical as is our entire capitalist system but does that mean we should still moralize the economic decisions individuals make ive seen a lot of posts recently against landlords yes i agree theyre generally parasites but the same leftists contend that one should go get a real job and not live off the rent of others kind of reminds me of conservative arguments against people on welfare tbh which is also what a ubi would be ie making rent from others production but thats a different story  but if one was to seek avoiding a life time of drudgery and misery from slaving away at 40 hours per week through say  making investments in a property and renting it out with the goal of cutting away hours at your normal job or retiring early and using that time to pursue passions and do something socially beneficial would you folks see it as inherently evil and to be completely avoided  this is my hypothetical buying out a small apartment building not a house someone could buy and live in renting it out below market signing a good contract that legally obligates you to be a decent landlord like being prompt with repairs no harsh rules etc  not evicting people for being late with rent and donating the apartmentsequity to the tenants until im comfortable without the rent or when i die whichever comes first i kind of see it like being a manager a position that shouldnt exist but if you have it you can try to be a good one otherwise someone else will just do it and may end up being shitty to workers and super exploitative  i definitely wouldnt wanna be a landlord but in this capitalist shithole it seems like one of the few ways to a workfree life if we go beyond good and evil albeit a temporary solution until the utopia is ushered in  thoughts,c5trij

146,Think I'm gonna quit,ive been a trucker for 10 months now was kind of aiming for a year since thats a requirement for other places oh well another soft goal was to save 12k and then i could either live in a cheap apartment with basic comfort for a year or get land and back to living in my van but this time with land to park it on instead of having to move every night and be hassled by cops etc etc and i basically reached that i got a 25 acres for 8k and have 5k now   i lived in my van for 2 years before this on basically 50 cash and 190 food stamps per month i adapted to the poverty once i can do it again freedom is more valuable i just need to exist long enough to see if yang wins and we get ubi or not i was never going to be able to work for long enough to exist for very long anyhow only sticking around now because of that all these years ive been talking about ubi if i died right before we got it itd be hilariously ironic not that im very hopeful  it kinda sucks because if i didnt have mental health issues i might be able to have a normal life and be a trucker for a decade and save up and retire to a comfortable life theres a lot of things about it i enjoy but when you hate existing to begin with having the demand to endure 60 hours of more torture is just not doable for very long its like having one hand on a hot stove and then someone demanding you place your other hand and your face on the stove too ive tied my bedsheet to the top bunk and around my neck a dozen times by now but it always seems too painful i get regular episodes of feeling paralyzed and spending 2 or 3 days in bed in the truck without going outside its time to quit   i almost bought weed yesterday since i was in colorado and a weed store was like 100 feet from my delivery one time use would dirty my pee for about a week were liable to get drug tested randomly at any time failing a drug test doesnt just get you fired it gets added to your dac which is basically a credit report for your driving record for truckers with a failed drug test youre basically black balled from the industry for years its not because i ever particularly loved weed and really want to get high it often dried my eyes and mouth and nose out too much and was unpleasant and when i had regular access i would irregularly smoke like once a week its just who are they to say what i can or cant do in my free time i really hate arbitrary rules and obedience to an authority who would make arbitrary rules freedom is the most important thing and having it stifled makes work even more intolerable i bring it up because its another symptom of it being time to quit that id consider taking such a risk   im an anxious and neurotic person ive been agonizing over the decision to quit or not for the past 3 weeks if i was sure i was going to then i might not have posted this just venting my anxiety in a long meaningless post dont mind me it wouldnt even matter much if i were normal because theres so many trucking jobs you could get a job same day very easily but my anxiety means once i quit im not easily going to start a new job,c20wxg
147,My reply to a rejection email.

154,Have a job with technically unlimited paid sick days,heres my job all annual national holidays a special 10 day break around summer and 20 paid vacation days a year  the interesting part is whenever im sick all i have to do is phone in to the supervisor for a minute and thats it days off paid get well soon no where in the contract does it state how many sick days i can take  so im sitting here with a cold and sore throat feeling kinda guilty because me and another coworker have taken off plenty of sick days over the past year to the point where the supervisor i think knows that we cant really be so sick as to not be able to work thats the norm here it seems like people will only take sick days if theyre bedridden so its obviously very strange for me to take so many   i still feel like work sucks but in reality how lucky am i compared to the rest of the world,c1iiie

160,Outsourcing is fucked up.,you can get some random indian on a green card for your company and you have whats essentially a slave  if they ever act up be defiant or seem unhappy at your company you can take their green card away and send them back to their country  them losing their job is pretty much the end of their career amp life  so you have an obedient little worker who will do anything you want no matter how ridiculous your conditions are  you get to pay them worse than anyone locally and they come in swarms  you can get a team of 5 people for less pay than a single local worker there is no legitimate reason to hire people within your country unless you need top talent  it is not worth investing on a fresh graduate from your country when you can get such a bargain deal so quality is not a concern    people say that you cant hire these obedient slaves until you at least try to hire locally first  well all they have to do is put impossible job requirements for the position and then tell mr government that they tried their best to find someone but couldnt  sometimes they get lucky and find someone with 10 years of experience down on their luck willing to work for far below average pay  so its a winwin    the people who lose out are the people trying to get their foot in the door with a company  the only way for them to become more desirable than an outsourced team is for them to become the top of their field but how can they do that if no one gives them a chance  easy by working unpaid internships going above and beyond clocking 60 hour weeks and kissing their bosses ass    everyone loses except the employer,c189ix

191,Coming to terms w/ ”loving” your job,tldr i love my job and today i nearly collapsed from exhaustion  what do you do when your work is your passion where is the balance  i love my job i really do maybe its because ive had so many terrible ones it might be a case of basic decency amidst a sea of exploitation but really its not just that i love my job for all the right reasons i am doing something i am passionate about i can make a difference in my community i get to set my own hours i love my coworkers i am empowered to do a lot of what i want to do i have a lot of autonomy i have the best benefits ive ever had  but i do not make enough money i really dont and everyone knows it and i genuinely honestly know that my board cares a shit ton and wants it to be different and believes i deserve to get paid more we simply do not have enough money i know because ive run the numbers and have access to all of our accounts the long and the short of it is i have willingly exploited my own labor because i care so much about what we are trying to do   anyone who has worked at a not totally unethical nonprofit or as a social worker teacher nurse doctor public defender caretaker counselor etc  any place where you are helping people or trying to maybe even saving lives or changing things for the better probably knows this struggle because any place that is doing important work ethically probably doesnt have enough money to pay its team what they deserve  or you work somewhere that isnt the most ethical  maybe your company or organization is run by greedy people or receives money from harmful industries or doesnt value its employees enough and just decides not to give them what they deserve  but you feel like what you do matters and if you walk away you will stop being there for your students or patients or clients and this vast problem that you tackle in your profession wont go away so someone has to do something about it  and if you dont do it maybe no one will or theyll replace you with someone who doesnt care enough or will only give the effort that your salary warrants  you go above and beyond and work way above what youre paid and your replacement wont  and probably shouldnt   so you work and work and give and give and are exhausted all the time and constantly think about work if youre lucky you love your job and find immense satisfaction and joy in what you do like i do but you are constantly drained and cant do anything without connecting things back to work or maybe you hate something about job but youre helping people and following your passion   if the above applies to you and you hate your job quit  save up a bit of money and quit thats what i think you should do at least and i know theres a lot of reasons why its not that simple plus you probably spent a shit ton of time and money to get to some education or experience to get where you are so you cant just quit   but to me the harder question is what if you love your job ive worked over a year straight no time off and now i end up going in on weekends most weeks and im so tired   i have a two week vacation planned next month that ive spent all my money on so i am going no matter what but what about when i get back there is always a reason to come in on the weekends or stay late or go the extra mile and  no one makes me do it but me   frankly im terrified of what would happen if i did get paid enough money because then i know id still work too much and never tear myself away because i care too much and theres always more to be done and if have no reason to blame it on needing the money  but im also terrified of that time when there isnt more work to be done when the chaos subsided and the place runs smoother and problems are solved more and more because i dont even know who i am without this place   what do you do when you love your job where you do something good or helpful or important just work it forever until you die how do you learn to rest  how do you make time for other things i had to come home today from work because i almost collapsed i was so tired  im working too much   and i know that what i do isnt saving the world i know im just one person and nothing i could do would possibly be as important as it feels to me but if i tell myself this doesnt actually matter then how do i keep going im not a nihilist i believe that what we do while were alive has meaning if we want it to but if my passion to help people is just filling a void so my life has meaning and im not overwhelmed by my own mortality then that isnt meaning its just helping me to keep going  why cant i tell myself do your best to make a difference but never put it above your own needs how do i force myself to take more breaks and do more exciting stuff while im alive instead of sitting at a desk and going to meetings im a workaholic but its the promise of doing something to make this shitty life better for other people that keeps me addicted to work and i dont want to give that up,bz63ix
192,I hate my job so much!!,im 25 f and i hate my job so fucking much i literally get there 15 mins late everyday because its so draining going to a place that i hate everyday after work i lay down immediately and dont do anything productive i want to quit so badly but i feel like i cant because i dont have any real skills and i have absolutely no idea what else i can do i feel like the only other thing i can do is literally the same position at a different company or id have to be customer service rep i majored in sociology and its not like i can find any other lucrative career i cant go back to school because i have too many student loans and again i dont even know what to go back for   all of this is making me really depressed and i just dont know how to get out of this ,bzzjc8
193,The in-order-to mind,there is one maybe somewhat subtle way in which full time employment can poison your entire life by all conventional standards ive done pretty well for myself im an md currently also doing on a phd during residency working in a stimulating and engaging field i even have the privilege of working with understanding bosses and having decent hours for the medical field  50 hours per week for my normal job what happens during work is not the problem  i kinda enjoy the challenge work hard play hard  right  ampx200b  as we all know its not that simple we all know that work stress and even unfinished projects etc can carry over into weekends and free time  but thats not what i want to discuss theres something else that has been bugging me and its only recently that ive been able to put a finger on it  ampx200b  my gripe is even when youve finished your work and dont take it home with you it will continue to dominate your life when youve got a challenging job and get home absolutely mentally exhausted on friday youll relax on the weekend maybe do some fun stuff with the money that youve earned  in order to be fit to work again on monday whether youre conscious of it or not its a driving factor if youve got some mental energy and motivation left maybe youll take those art classes but in the back of your mind theres always this question is this relaxing enough so that i can be maximally productive on monday after a couple of months of nonstop work maybe youll take that vacation  in order to relax and be productive again when you come back i find that on a certain level this inorderto mind sucks the creativity and spontaneity out of a lot of activities the enjoyment of a thing in and of itself as i used to know it in my free time has been replaced by a colder more utilitarian reasoning how can i use this to be more productive  ampx200b  sure ill meet with friends take a walk do some sports  but all of these things have become whether i consciously want it or not subservient to the allpervading goal of productivity i find its a very hard cycle to break just wanted to get it out of my system thanks for reading,bzub3g
194,Do not trust employers when they reccommend certain contracts.,so last october i travelled to japan to start teaching english im still here and am going to hand in my final notice soon the country has been great but the wage slave life has been overwhelming and had a huge effect on my social life   when i got here duribg training we were given the choice between a normal employee contract and an independent contractor contract when explaining the difference they completely bullshitted us saying that independent payed more gave you more freedom and more flexibility i foolishly trusted them and signed the independent  after a few months i noticed a rental fee which completely offset the extra pay supposedly as im independent i have to rent the classroom making the more money per lesson angle a flat out lie i also have no extra flexibility in fact i have to pay to take sick leave not as in not recieve the money for that day i have to pay my company to find my replacement i have no benefits or paid leave employee contracts do and i have absolutely no control over my schedule which makes the flexibility angle another goddamn lie  im stuck doing a full time job with less freedom because the employee contract is bound by enployment laws in the country but for independent contractors benefits are optional which mwans they are nonexistent  tldr my employers told me one contract payed more and had more flexibility this was a lie and they dont have to provide me basic workers rights  does anyone else have any horror stories of being tricked into signing away benefits or options because you mistakenly trusted your employers  i wont even be making that mistake again,c0y47h

196,I'm not applying twice,so i use indeed to basically right swipe equivalent employer ads all the info you really need is right there so theres no reason for me to get my ass up unless you want to finalize things or set up an interview  but when i get messages saying to come down there physically to apply i get legitimately pissed as thats why i have indeed so i dont have to do that you literally are just baiting people at that point unless you wanna eat my pubic hair you best apologize for even thinking im stupid enough to have you or anyone waste my time like this  its almost as bad as those websites that link you to their website to apply so you obviously have someone working for you to take time to post ads on indeed and link them to the website you couldnt just you knowactually use indeed and get a stack of applicants that way  see the problem is the average norm norm doesnt know what crippling pain looks like i dont need to explain all my problems here but suffice to say i think very hard about how i can move and do as little as possible while still getting everything i need to get done if something only takes one movement to do and you expect me to do three youre wrong and owe me two extra moves if i do it your way so youre gonna make it up to me somehow with or without your consent  this is an example of do three moves when only one is necessary and that just burns me up,c114jb

199,The whole career thing,do some of you think you were never made for a career ive chased entry into 2 different careers based on what i had an actual aptitude for visual effects and academia and have failed utterly at the former and probably at the latter based on my track record so far i feel incredibly envious of people who are far ahead of me at my age however at the same time i have always utterly detested 95 and the bs socialising that goes on at workplaces i have been an outsider and patronised with good reason probably and though i thought in my 20s that i could possibly conform in my own way i think im always going to be an outsider i will never relate to other humans i would like a career only insofar as it provides a layer of security but i think im doomed to menial working for others even though i did my fucking damndest but not enough compared to others not to be in that position this isnt to slate anyone btw who does menial work as 99 of work is bs anyway and the most worthless are the ceos and execs who are parasites,c1f9sd

210,Parents forcing me to work a job that makes me depressed and miserable,so ill try to make this as concise as possible im an 18 year old male living with my parents and planning to attend a university in the fall last summer my dad used the wonderful power of nepotism to get me a job at the company he works for this company is a managed it service basically they run the it department of other companies firms hospitals etc my job was to take calls from the clients and log their issues in the ticket system my hours were 85 monday through friday and it was honestly torture everyday i wanted to quit but feared how my parents would react to this i felt uncomfortable and out of place being the only 17 year old in the office when everyone else was 35 i felt horrible knowing that all my other friends were out enjoying their summers and i was stuck inside staring at a computer screen   ampx200b  somehow i made it through the summer and vowed to myself to never do that again throughout the year my dad must have asked me if i would be working there again next summer at least 5 times and every time i made it clear that i do not want to work there again in about may he asked me again and again i said no he basically gave me this ultimatum that if i did not secure an alternate job within the next 3 weeks i would have to work the same job again i had no success in finding a job during this time because i was more focused on my school finals and graduating high school last week the local starbucks called my house and offered me an interview my parents lost it they called me ungrateful stupid etc when i bring up that the job made me miserable they brought up stories from their childhood about hard jobs that they worked and that i have such an easy job what they dont know is that i have social anxiety and depression and i dont feel comfortable talking to them about it because they constantly make fun of me for being antisocial they deem my introverted behavior as rude and for being mr mopealot  ampx200b  so they wont let me take any other job offers because if i bailed at this point it would make my dad look bad he told management that i would becoming back in the summer despite me assuring him multiple times that i have no interest in returning yes my parents are straight rinsaneparents material my dad even threatened me dont show up to work on monday and see what happens purposely try to get fired and see what happens   ampx200b  so now im supposed to start tomorrow im having anxiety just thinking about it i just want to be a normal teenager and work a part time job at the local froyo place or something and let me preface by saying its not about the money were not struggling financially my dad even said its not about them money its about the experience   ampx200b  im financially dependent on my parents and without them im not sure how i would pay for my college tuition i just feel so helpless in this situation and just wish my parents would not be control freaks so this whole thing would be avoided what would you guys do in this situation,c1dwq9

223,SHOWER THOUGHT: Automation will create mass unemployment in those countries that cannot artificially stimulate jobs growth,the usual retort to the prediction that automation creates mass unemployment is the fallacy that new technologies can create new demand for workers economists who make this argument typically ignore how dependent jobs growth is on government deficit financed stimulus   but most countries are no longer able to finance economic expansion through deficit spending italy and greece are examples throughout the third world the situation is even more dire this suggests that as automation begins to spread widely those countries without large trade surpluses or able to sustain large fiscal deficits will increasingly become the sites of mass unemployment data may already show this   am i missing something here,c1nj9y

237,I’m tired of chasing a clock every day.,this isnt something new i had other jobs before but arriving on schedule is always always a fucking hard task  i have a serious issue with schedules i feel like my mind cant follow the speed of time or something my brain is always something like half an hour late  it may be 8 am but if i dont look at the clock i think its 730 or something around it just now i thought it was still 930 as a result i arrive late to work almost everyday and im being constantly reminded of it in not so subtle ways by the higher ups  well ill contextualize i am brazilian so pardon my shit english since 2014 this country has entered a never ending downward spiral of shit socially and economically everything that can go wrong goes wrong unemployment skyrocketed and finding a formal job became an almost impossible task and predictions are grim everyone who can is fleeing to other countries i was forced to go back to working on a company i hate from the bottom of my heart a place from where i left screaming in happiness in the past  truth is my job here is doing graphic design on a core 2 duo e8400 pc and doesnt necessarily involve tight schedules its rare to see something new needing to be done before 10 am or even midday i have a task list that changes through the day and i just go on doing them i am a fast worker that can get shit done in less than half the time other people would be able to i shouldnt be called out for arriving twenty minutes later when the net loss from it is zero and best of all theres absolutely nothing that i can do here that i cant do at home but they clearly arent even thinking about letting me go home office they want me to use a slow pc and arrive tired everyday just because they need to see what im doing all the time and i never got a raise to speak that word here is worse than letting an fbomb go out  and public transportation is shittier every year i go to work by bus and the company that manages the buses that i pick up is falling apart little by little economic crisis  shitty management since last year their buses are constantly filled to the brim with people because they severely reduced the number of their vehicles on the streets and to make matters worse in the last few days one of the streets i need to go to work is now partially blocked which has generated an annoying traffic jam which robs me of almost twenty minutes everyday  my companys higher ups obviously go by car so of course they dont give a shit about my problems get up earlier well right but i already get up 5 am to help my wife if you see this i love you my batata get prepared for her day  she starts work at 7 am and can manage this way better than i i just feel so tired in the morning that time flies and i eventually fuck things up  thing is i could simply go back to sleep for an hour after she goes out but the last time i tried doing this i got disastrous results  like my wife almost calling the police on me because i wasnt answering her messages and she thought i was dead or something i was so tired that i overslept and no alarm could get me to wake up only my father knocking on the door did the trick  in weekends i get up by 10 am and god i feel so damn good why cant i sleep more and work in schedules where i can be more productive in workdays i just feel like a zombie until 4 pm when my brain finally do start up being a b chronotypehttpswwwbsocietyorg in this society is daily hell  but in brazil you have no choice being employed became a privilege here an exception  yet im tired im fucking tired of chasing a god damned clock every day i want to work but i also want to be able to produce something in my own time but this is denied to me i dont feel like im actually being useful and that has been like this for quite some time maybe im being useful to fulfill others dreams right but what about mine  im tired of this uphill battle with this dumb system everyday and dont tell me the world is like this this isnt the worlds fault were really just a stupid species locked to inefficient and dogmatic beliefs for eternity i hate this shit i hate schedules  end of rant have a good day yall  ill keep chasing the clock since i have no choice,bzr9al

292,The rich world is enjoying an unprecedented jobs boom,link to the economist articlehttpswwweconomistcomleaders20190523therichworldisenjoyinganunprecedentedjobsboom  what do you think are the worlds leading economists incorrect or are we looking at it the wrong way  capitalisms critics are yet to notice   everyone says work is miserable todays workers if they are lucky enough to escape the gig economy and have a real job have lost control over their lives they are underpaid and exploited by unscrupulous bosses and they face a precarious future as machines threaten to make them unemployable  there is just one problem with this bleak picture it is at odds with reality as we report this week see briefinghttpswwweconomistcombriefing20190523acrosstherichworldanextraordinaryjobsboomisunderway most of the rich world is enjoying a jobs boom of unprecedented scope not only is work plentiful but it is also on average getting better capitalism is improving workers lot faster than it has in years as tight labour markets enhance their bargaining power the zeitgeist has lost touch with the data   just the job  in america the unemployment rate is only 36 the lowest in half a century less appreciated is the abundance of jobs across most of the rich world twothirds of the members of the oecd a club of mostly rich countries enjoy recordhigh employment among 15 to 64yearolds in japan 77 of this group has a job up six percentage points in six years this year britons will work a record 55bn hours on current trends germany is enjoying a bonanza of tax revenue following a surge in the size of its labour force see articlehttpswwweconomistcomfinanceandeconomics20190523shouldgermanyborrowtoinvest even in france spain and italy where joblessness is still relatively high workingage employment is close to or exceeds 2005 levels  the richworld jobs boom is partly cyclicalthe result of a decade of economic stimulus and recovery since the great recession but it also reflects structural shifts populations are becoming more educated websites are efficient at matching vacancies and qualified applicants and ever more women work in fact women account for almost all the growth in the richworld employment rate since 2007 that has something to do with profamily policies in europe but since 2015 the trend is found in america too last reforms to welfare programmes both to make them less generous and to toughen eligibility tests seem to have encouraged people to seek work  thanks to the jobs boom unemployment once the central issue of political economy has all but disappeared from the political landscape in many countries it has been replaced by a series of complaints about the quality and direction of work these are less tangible and harder to judge than employment statistics the most important are that automation is destroying opportunities and that work though plentiful is lowquality and precarious our jobs market is being turned into a sea of insecurity says jeremy corbyn leader of britains labour party  again reality begs to differ in manufacturing machines have replaced workers over a period of decades this seems to have contributed to a pocket of persistent joblessness among american men but across the oecd as a whole a jobs apocalypse carried out by machines and algorithms much feared in silicon valley is nowhere to be seen a greater share of people with only a secondary education or less is in work now than in 2000  it is also true that middleskilled jobs are becoming harder to find as the structure of the economy changes and as the service sectorincluding the gig economyexpands by 2026 america will have more athome carers than secretaries according to official projections yet as labour markets hollow out more highskilled jobs are being created than menial ones meanwhile lowend work is becoming better paid in part because of higher minimum wages across the rich world wages below twothirds of the national median are becoming rarer not more common  as for precariousness in america traditional fulltime jobs made up the same proportion of employment in 2017 as they did in 2005 the gig economy accounts for only around 1 of jobs there in france despite recent reforms to make labour markets more flexible the share of new hires given permanent contracts recently hit an alltime high the truly precarious work is found in southern european countries like italy and neither exploitative employers nor modern technology is to blame the culprit is oldfashioned law that stitches up labour markets locking out young workers in order to keep insiders in cushy jobs  elsewhere the knockon benefits of abundant work are becoming clear as firms compete for workers rather than workers for jobs average wage growth is rising pushing up workers share of the piealbeit not as fast as the extent of the boom might have suggested tight labour markets lead firms to fish for employees in neglected pools including among exconvicts and to boost training amid skills shortages american wonks fretted for years about how to shrink disabilitybenefit rolls now the hot labour market is doing it for them indeed one attraction of the jobs boom is its potential to help solve social ills without governments having to do or spend very much  nonetheless policymakers do have lessons to learn economists have again been humbled they have consistently underestimated potential employment leading to hesitant fiscal and monetary policy just as their sanguine outlook on finance in the 2000s contributed to the bust so their mistaken pessimism about the potential for jobs growth in the 2010s has needlessly slowed the recovery  the left needs to accept that many of the criticisms it levels at capitalism do not fit the facts life at the bottom of the labour market is not joyousfar from it however the lot of workers is improving and entrylevel jobs are a much better launch pad to something better than joblessness is a failure to acknowledge this will lead to government intervention that is at best unnecessary and at worst jeopardises recent progress the jobs boom seems to be partly down to welfare reforms that the likes of mr corbyn have vociferously opposed  the right should acknowledge that jobs have boomed without the bonfire of regulations that typically forms its labourmarket policy in fact labourmarket rules are proliferating and although the jury is out on whether rising minimum wages are harming some groups such as the young they are not doing damage that is large enough to show up in aggregate  the jobs boom will not last for ever eventually a recession will kill it off meanwhile it deserves a little appreciation,bxk3ap

298,Life sort of feels like Dark Souls now (spoilers),short synopsis of dark souls for those who dont know a dude named gwyn and a bunch of his buddies defeat the dragons and then use a magical thing called the first flame to establish the age of fire later though the first flame starts to fade and the age of fire comes to an end gwyn in desperation sacrifices himself as kindling to keep the flame going but eventually even that isnt enough so gwyns remaining buddies set up a gigantic obstacle course and have a bunch of random undeads try to go through it the reasoning is that only the strongest would be able to make it to the end and thus serve as powerful kindling to restore the first flame  at the end of the game there is a profound sense of being fooled by all the various characters that guided you along youre constantly referred to as the chosed undead but you soon find out that youre not the only one in fact if i remember correctly progress that was made by any previous chosen undeads that fail in their journey gets reset deliberately in the first half of the game you have to ring two magic bells you find out from one of the side characters that he was also a chosen undead and that he made it as far as the first bell but then gave up before the second one doesnt change the fact that you have to rering the first bell this makes the entire journey feel like an arbitrary and meaningless test  when you finally get through all the crap that the game throws at you and reach the first flame all you get is a short anticlimactic cutscene in which your character gets lit on fire and burnt up  so how does this relate to antiwork well the old wealthy people of the world have built their own little golden age for themselves however to keep it going they need a constant supply of workers to sacrifice to the system during the first twenty or so years of most peoples lives theyre told that they are special that they have great potential and that theyll change the world but to the capitalist overlords no one is special if someone burns out and gives up they can just toss them out and replenish their employee supply from the millions of other special people out there  but thats not all before we even get the privilege of becoming disposable tools we have to jump through a bunch of hoops many of which are arbitrary and nonsensical even the lowest paying jobs require you to fill out a needlessly tedious online application do a phone interview in which they ask a bunch of questions that have nothing to do with the job and then attend an onsite interview where they ask more questions that have nothing to do with the job higher paying jobs require college and graduate school which typically involves at least six years tens of thousands of dollars of debt and several unpaid internships and what do you get for all that hard work a job that eats up all your time and leaves you as an empty husk of a human being  dont let that discourage you from playing dark souls though its a great game with a depressing ending,bwckmm

322,Living for the weekend is a depressing rollercoaster of a life,i know it has probably been said before here  i legitimately hate the work week  i gradually get happier as the week goes along just because i can fucking sleep in on the weekends and not have to deal with corporate bullshit   i usually stay up until really late in the am even on week nights working on my hobbies that im passionate about and trying to turn into a career  its such a slow process though and i need to put the hours in to succeed  work only makes it harder for me to not only find the time to engage in that hobby but energy as well  i ended up a caffeine addict just so i can have the energy to do what i love when i get home dealing with the corporate whip    im much happier when the weekend rolls around but even in the back of my head i know that it wont last long  i get very sudden glimpses of depression just based on the fact that i know it will be shortlived so why even be happy about it  sunday night is one of the most depressing nights of the week for me going from fun mode to having to wake up early and miserable once again  i just shove my fucking face with legal drugs to keep me going which is horrible but its the american way,byc6md

324,"I’m reaching a breaking point at work, might tell my boss",i am bored out of my mind at work i literally spend maybe 2hrs a week doing actual work and the rest is being restless anxious and trying to keep looking like im busy its a decent job at a decent company but i find myself making up lame excuses for working from home etc just to avoid having to be in the office and trapped for 8hrs this has been going on for about 9 months now ive asked for more work im working to learn to code ive even picked up work for a second team to fill my time but thats gone now because someone made an executive decision without any input from me it continues   i dont understand how other people tolerate this shit yeah great theres a ping pong table are you really paying me to come here and play ping pong my career is stagnating and even if there were management opportunities i dont think id want to take them at this place   that being said i dont believe the grass is much greener anywhere else i believe theres basically a bucket full of the potential problems in the workplace and basically one office after the next is just a grab bag of those problems sure some aspects might improve but others might get worse ive at least learned to tolerate this office and made a few friends its easier to keep doing what im doing but at some point is this just gonna drive me further into my depression i know that im not alone what do people like me do,bwwohq

328,"Thank You, Jennifer and Mark, For Being The Worst Fucking Managers Possible.",jennifer you were such an awful manager and not even awful in the cruel sense you were just bad at your job you knew it the rest of the staff knew it and the owner who regrettably kept you on staff until recently i heard knew it the gift shop would have been fine without you i wasnt one of them but there were several employees who were doing their job and yours for you while you annoyed all of our regular customers with uninvited talk about your shitty ass illbehaved son i just wanted to say how grateful i was to you you made me understand for the first time in my life that just because someone is higher on the food chain than me doesnt mean they automatically deserve my respect nor my loyalty i feel i would have been like a lost timid dog in the workforce had i never learned this lesson thank you  mark you were so intelligent and even sometimes very witty it was such a misfortune to work for you though when i started at the golf course i had heard the rumors of the place being in financial trouble i used this as an excuse for you when you would talk down to me or make fun of my appearance hes just stressed about the course going under i would tell myself i was in school at the time with no car and i relied on that job because the course was in walking distance of my home i actually confided this in you one day and from that moment onward you took advantage of me like no other until the day i called you and quit i just wanted to say thank you for making me understand that i am not cut out to work for anyone but myself and that many people in a management position will look far beyond personal wellbeing of their underlings when it comes down to their bottom line  workfree here currently at the world series of poker in las vegas this is the second wsop i have been apart of since becoming a professional poker player i have had some crippling mental health problems within the past couple of months i spend far too much time thinking about these two individuals but what i have decided is this without these two losers i would still be somewhere lost in the workforce i longed so desperately to rid my life of my experiences with jennifer and mark were more than enough motivation i needed to never work again  professional gambling isnt an amazing path for everyone but it was my way out and im so grateful these two helped me find the door heres hoping you all find your doors soon,bx66vs

332,NEW TO THIS SUBREDDIT. WANT TO SHARE MY SENTIMENTS,i am currently unemployed it has been 2 months since i resigned at my former work i left because the salary is low considering the graveyard shift and all i am a bachelors degree holder which seems pretty useless unless you are a modelish type i say bs i do not want to apply for another unfulfilling job anymore im tired pleasing other people and settling to a low paying job when you know you are meant for something bigger i tried running an online business but it has been months and i still havent got any sales i am loosing hope on it to be honest it seems like the only option i have now is to jump into another job just to save up money but thinking about it makes me feel so weak my friends are all in the corporate world they have been working for 3 years or so my family is also wired into thinking that a responsible adult needs to be in a 9to5 job its just how things are supposed to be this is the reason why i never opened myself up to them but its like ive already seen the tragic of being in a rat race and the fact that i do not have to be in it and neglecting it makes me feel so stupid to turn a blind eye to the truth which not everybody knows or acknowledged but i also do not want to be seen as lazy by my loved ones just because i do not work the way they want me to i am so confused its like i know the right thing to do which is to not be a part of the societys rat race but i do not know any other option to survive or save up money other than being a part of the rat race  again do you guys have any suggestions,bxtebx

336,Another downside of needing to work,ive been lurking for a little while and this is my first post sorry if this doesnt follow the guidelines of this group or if this topic has been covered a lot before but im new here so i dont know the ropes yet   so heres my rant my friend recently started helping me get into the career field that she recently started working in so that was nice and thoughtful of her to think i would be good at this job right well recently she has been promising that she will recommend me to potential clients that she thinks would be a good fit for me and then she has instead recommended her other friend to them i say friend because she has known this person for literally a week i have been friends with her for 5 years   this is just one of many inconsiderate and exhausting things my friend has done recently and frankly i need at least a small break from talking to her  so as im contemplating this im thinking about how at this point the only reason im not confronting her about her behavior is that i need this job and i dont want to jeopardize my contact for the job this is making me realize how much needing to work to have money to feed and shelter myself involves so much emotional and mental manipulation of others and i absolutely hate that aspect of it i want to think of myself as an honest sincere person at all times but its so difficult to maintain that under capitalism has anyone else here experienced something like this or thought about this conundrum,bvug7j

340,Theory about how all organizations are dysfunctional,so while going through a particularly bad 68 months in my last role i stumbled on the gervais principle its a semihumorous take on organizational psychology but over the last few months ive observed it does work in real life  essentially an organization is three layers  losers which is the rank and file which actually produce theyve struck a bad economic bargain and trade their time for a paycheck   they know their place in the world and are smart enough to be wary of the organization they do the bare minimum because they know that extra effort wont be really rewarded they try to find meaning of life in engaging with other people  clueless is the middle layer these were the types who put in extra effort at loser layer despite no reward the employee of the month aspirants   theyre marked for their dumbness they worked too hard despite a bad economic bargain and promoted to middle management where they can be used as fall guys theyre married to the org unlike losers  sociopaths is the top layer the willtopower kind  who actually steer the organization like losers they are wary of the org because they want to dominate not be dominated  the gervais principle goes  sociopaths in their own best interests knowingly promote overperforming losers into middlemanagement groom underperforming losers into sociopaths and leave the average bareminimumeffort losers to fend for themselves  this is a very barebones view of the idea the actual idea is fleshed out in over 6 chapters  mind you its a long dense read as with most things you may not agree with all of it but it will explain a lot of things going on in offices  link httpswwwribbonfarmcom20091007thegervaisprincipleortheofficeaccordingtotheoffice,bybwoa
