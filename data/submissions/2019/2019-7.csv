1,Complaints from a Walmart Cashier (rant),"I’m an 18 year old cashier who works at Walmart. I’m taking a year off between high school and college and was originally going to work this year, but after recently going full-time, I’m having doubts. Sorry if this comes off as entitled/petty, but here are the things I’m struggling with:

1. Walmart is a shit company. After learning more about their business practices, I’m no longer naive to their horrible ideals and can’t claim ignorance. Working for this company makes me feel guilty as I am enabling and helping them. (watch the documentary “the high cost of low price” on YouTube)

2. My fucking feet hurt. Even with my “comfort mat” under my register it is painful. Once I wore flat-soled shoes instead of tennis shoes and my feet hurt so bad that I had to buy a new pair of tennis shoes half way through my shift.

3. Baby boomers. I’m tired of being screamed at over expired coupons. It shouldn’t piss me off but when 5 customers in a row don’t say “hello” or “thank you” back, I get a little irritable. It’s like I’m barely human.

4. Social anxiety. Before I got this job, I rarely talked to anyone. I’ve become more social and I’m able to hold conversations now, so I’m grateful I’ve tried cashiering. But I’m just an introverted person and it’s exhausting to hold conversations all day.

5. They won’t let me take off the three days I want next week for a trip. This one is petty but it’s inconvenient as I told them about it nearly two months ago and I spent money on my ticket. They usually let me have whatever day I want off but this time it’s different, I guess.

6. We’re chronically understaffed. Some days I’m the only cashier with lines of 10+ people while management dicks around and pretends not to see.

7. I have to work holidays. Maybe I’m coming off as entitled but last year was the first year I ever had to miss thanksgiving with my family because of “brown Thursday” We ate at 5, so I had 15 minutes to eat, and then went off for my shift at 5;30. 

8. Stress. I know I have one of the easiest jobs out there, but I just can’t take it. I’m just bad at social interaction and I get stressed out by all the weird demands and complaints, especially after standing around for 8+ hours.

9. I miss being outside. My days off are spent recharging. I want to go on trips with my family (I will have to miss out on ours this year because they won’t let me take it off) and I want to get back into the gym more often. I want some peace  and relaxation before I kick myself into college and a career.

10. They’re probably firing my favorite manager because??? They can and it’s convenient for them at this time. It’s all bullshit. It’s not my business to share so I won’t give info.

11. Brian is a douchebag.

Reasons I want to keep my job:

1. Money. I want to be able to go to college. Yesterday a very kind man came through my checkout and asked me what my plans were since I’d just graduated. I told him I’m taking the year off before school and he told me “the reason they pay you like this here is to encourage you to get a degree” and I just couldn’t stop thinking about how ass-backwards and absolutely untrue that was. I am a human machine. I do nothing but monotonous, simple-minded scanning day in and day out. They pay me this way because I am the human version of a self-checkout machine.

Anyways, sorry for my rant. I’m not having a good time.",False,chbws2,800goat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/chbws2/complaints_from_a_walmart_cashier_rant/,14,28

3,"Boss cut my hours in half and made promises she couldn't keep, keeps pushing off talking to me about it","I'm at a loss for what to do. I started working in a PR position about 3 months ago and my I'm fed up with my boss. In my interview she hired me to work a minimum of 20 hours a week, and said I could work as many extra hours as I wanted up to 40 a week. I was very excited to work that many hours and had big plans for what I was going to do for the company.

Since then she's cut my hours to 30 a week and then 20, despite my putting in massive amounts of work during that time. She cited lack of funds to pay me and said that she hired me to work 20 hours initially. I lost almost all of my motivation after this, all that hard work was rewarded with my hours and pay being chopped in half. I am now back to living in poverty after a few short weeks of making a livable income for the first time in my life. 

She promised my coworker a comission for any investment money she earned, but didn't give me the same deal. When I asked her about it, she said that my coworker was not receiving any comission money. I asked her if my coworker knew that she wasn't receiving comission, and she wouldn't answer the question.

I had to promote our company at an event and my coworker got there over an hour late, my boss told us she wasn't coming at the last minute. My boss didn't reserve a table and I had to borrow a table and chairs from the venue, it was lucky they had extra supplies for us or we would have been fucked. I carried several boxes of heavy supplies in the 100 degree heat as a 120lb girl, hunted for a table and chairs, set up the entire booth and deconstructed it solo, and carried the supplies back to the car in the rain at the end of the day. My boss asked me to drive to the office and return the supplies today--we are under a severe thunderstorm warning and I told her there was no way I'd carry the supplies by myself in the pouring rain. She was clearly unhappy with this. 

I am looking for a new job but I have a disability where I can't stand for long periods of time, which limits my options. I had a meeting to talk with my boss today, but she cancelled on me and is flying out of the state tomorrow for 2 weeks. I have no idea where to go from here and I dread working for a company that doesn't respect me or my time.

10,Forced Overtime (The joy of cutting labor),"I already feel like I’m always at work. I do seven 8 hour days in a row and then get a few days off.

Recently someone at my company has figured out they can make spreadsheets look good by not hiring people and cutting labor.

So for a few weeks everyone was getting forced into 16 hour shifts randomly and hitting around 64-72 hours a week.

Now I walk in and find out we have been scheduled 7 days in a row WITH NO OFF DAYS for the indefinite future.

What is the motherfucking point of even being alive on a schedule like this? I guess I don’t have that “Protestant work ethic” or I am a bad worker bee.

So now I am on permanent night shift and will not see my wife except for maybe a few minutes if she stays up late or I get up super early. 

What kills me is half the employees just smile and take it like good little worker bees. “Bigger checks.”

I guess I’m just a lazy piece of shit.",False,chxpko,KittehKittehKat,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/chxpko/forced_overtime_the_joy_of_cutting_labor/,10,12

16,Long post ahead. Need serious advice.,"Hopefully this post doesn’t get too long, but here it goes, I’ll be transparent as possible. For the past 3 years I have done absolutely nothing, I was in a masters program and things kind of fell threw right at the end, and now 3 years have past of me leeching off my aunt and mother playing video games, sleeping, and staying inside. 

I am 27 now and for the past 3 months I have been moving forward quite a bit, I’ve lost a lot of weight, got back into my masters program and will be able to finish it within 4 months. 

Here’s the fun part and why I am on this sub, I’m completing an internship to finish my degree and I hate this shit more than I should. My drive is long, the pay sucks, and the work is all bullshit, but all things are pointing positive and I’ve  technically haven’t been in a better spot. And yes I understand that my options will be better once this shit is over with, but knowing that doesn’t help me get through the day. So why the fuck am I so miserable, that shit doesn’t make sense. Everyone is telling me to get on medication and frankly I’m against it since I already was on two pills for 7 months. I dropped them cold turkey when I got off my ass 3 months ago. I never thought the medicine helped personally and neither did my family, which is funny since they think it’s a good idea again. 

No matter what happens, I’m finishing this internship, but the question I want answered is if you guys think I should go back to living with my mom and leeching off of her. I get it. I’m a lazy piece of shit, I think about this everyday and honestly this might be my true nature, and not just the typical lazy bullshit like everyone thinks they have, like, this is the I sat around for 3 years and it didn’t bother me lazy. The truth is when I sat around for so long, I probably wasn’t “happy” but I know damn well I wasn’t unhappy either, and now, now I know I am unhappy. 

So yeah, I’m going to have a MS soon, and it doesn’t excite me, I don’t feel motivated and I really don’t give a shit. I was so excited to put everything back into place and full of energy, but now that I’m doing this shit, fuck all of it. So yeah, if I have the opportunity to leech off my mom should I just do it? Give me any kind of advice, please. I don’t think I’m suicidal, but the thought of driving off the road one day and trying to cripple myself does put a smile on my face and brightens my day.",False,cjd9nj,PussyLunch,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cjd9nj/long_post_ahead_need_serious_advice/,5,6
17,Just thought back to an amusing experience I had in my first job review.,"I was 22 years old, a new engineer who graduated into the recession.  I knew I was underpaid.  They knew I was underpaid.  But I only ever heard good things about my ""performance"" (ugh, hate that word).  

It was the end of the fiscal year, raise time, and they gave us a self evaluation.  Which is a dumb idea out the gate.  One of the questions was ""How would you like to be rewarded for good work""?  I kind of blinked at the page.  What the fuck, other than not sucking up 8+ hours of my day?  I wrote down ""Other than the traditional form of higher pay, not much else comes to mind"".

A few weeks later I get called to the HR office, like I'm getting called to principal in school.  She goes over my pitiful raise (um...""salary adjustment""), and goes through my review.  She asks ""What do you mean by 'traditional form of higher pay'""?  I had to look blankly at her.  I honestly didn't know if she was fucking with me or not.  ""A higher raise.  More money.""  She still stared at me.  What was I gonna say?  ""This shit is boring and the more money you give me the more I can enjoy my shrinking non-work hours and the faster I can finally leave this institution of wage labor?""  I just stared her down until she said ""ok"", and I went back to my desk.

Are these people for fucking real?  Later, when I left, she asked me why I was going to a new job.  I said it was because it was more interesting to me, more in a field I wanted to work in.  She asks me why I took this first job then.  I couldn't believe it.  ""Because we were in a fucking recession, and I applied to 80 jobs and you were one of the only 3 that got back to me?  Being a new graduate I couldn't exactly be picky?""

19,Have you ever had a workplace try to force beliefs onto people or intimidate you into pretending to agree with them? How have you dealt with it?,"I had a mandatory training that amounted to requirement to abide by strict and narrow beliefs, and worse than that, wanted us to push it on our clients who are often really vulnerable and in need of help with basic life activities. They don't need this wish-wash religious stuff pushed on them. I don't mind if other people believe this, I'm often the philosophical minority and am used to it. But it's amazing to me there are widespread ""discrimination laws"" in the United States (and I'm presuming many other countries) yet something like this continues to march on. I don't like to involve the law at all, it's not my values. But it is really telling if a company can get away with this in a world where people usually sue or quit over this. At first I thought I was alone in diverging from the narrow beliefs, but having looked back on it repeatedly and gotten support from a friend in the same industry, I now question how many people were also silent dissenters.

22,The Orwellian Workplace,"I've seen this complaint on here many times but I'm sure many people aren't aware to the extent that this tends to happen. I'd like to point out what exactly qualifies a workplace as ""Orwellian"" and what you cab do about it. 

Now, the actual practices of the Orwellian workplace might seem, at first, like basic, integral parts of a safe work environment, but as with all things you experience in work, it's something that should be questioned.

Your general Orwellian workplace involves a *lot* of monitoring, more than could ever be reasonably expected in your general workplace. While in retail your occasional camera may be used to record and retroactively watch employees in the case of a lawsuit or similar legal issue, an Orwellian workplace *directly* and presently monitors your actions, ensuring you are not breaking any of the multitude rules of the workplace. 

I will give as an example two workplaces, one I previously experienced and another I am currently in. 

The first of these two was perhaps the greatest example of resource waste and complete employee mistrust. I worked for a security firm that had installed cameras across the facility for dual purposes: for the officers to monitor the site, and for headquarters to monitor the officers. 

You see, the company I worked for didn't trust the officers despite the fact that there had been no unattended or poorly-handled on-site incidents at that particular location, and when they learned officers were doing things other than staring at a monitor for 8 hours, they set up an out of state monitoring office with a second set of officers watching us for even the most minor infractions, and random inspections would see every aspect of our entire shift torn apart with a fine-tooth comb to catch us and write us up for something as sinful as taking a minute to respond to a text message. These offsite personnel were themselves monitored by a separate set of offsite personnel.

You might be saying at this point that such a stringent oversight is necessary in the security industry and that so much shouldn't be classified as Orwellian despite the obvious comparisons, and are simply safety measures. 

In which case, I offer you the second workplace. 

In this job I work for a junkyard. We have dozens of people scavenging up parts and it's my job to catalogue them and prepare them for sale. While we usually get in 10-20 of these parts a day, I have been able to finish my work within two or so hours. This leaves me with very very little to do and as a result, I find myself simply sitting there refreshing pages. Recently, however, I was reprimanded for a ""drop in work output"", and after some poking around I learned how they believed this. They were not looking at the number of parts left to list, nor the number of parts listed. No, they were watching two factors: bathroom breaks and keystrokes.

Now, the issue of bathroom breaks is due to a medical problem, but the state of health in the workplace is another issue for another day. What I want to focus on is the keystrokes comment. 

This is a common tactic of companies, particularly in desk jobs. The question is not if the work is being done, or if it is being done well. The question is if we are ""wasting their time"" and breaking the unspoken law of workplaces: workers are assets, not people, and an asset not utilized to its full efficiency is useless, regardless of the health of the asset. And so they watch us, monitor us, and reprimand us on the basis that we are not to waste any of the time they they view as theirs, for this sin is cardinal amongst employers and bosses. 

So why am I telling all of this? Just to complain about my own experiences? Just to make a post begging for pity? No. My reasons are twofold. 

1. To help others understand what their bosses are no doubt doing to them at this very moment, no matter the industry and no matter the work, *they are watching you*, make no mistake. They may tell you this is because they are protecting themselves legally, but that is only what they say and they certainly believe you to be a danger to their fragile superiority. You may think U.S law protects you, but you are wrong. 

2. To drive home the point that **this is not okay**. It may not be illegal, but law is not the moral arbiter. To be treated like an automation, a robot at risk of going off programming at any time, is cruel and dehumanizing. 

So what can you do if this is happening to you?

There are two things, but both are unfortunately long shots. 

1. Join a union. Especially if you're in retail, the IWW can help you organize your workplace quickly and demand lighter monitoring before your employer can catch on. Ultimately, all you'll need is for the rest of your coworkers to feel the same as you do. This is, however, dangerous, as many larger chains would rather close down than allow unionization. When doing so, use a fake name in correspondences, do not conduct business on company grounds, and make certain you choose your allies well, many other workers may be lying in wait to solidify a position by selling you out.

2. Stand firm. This works best if an employer relies on you or your position is difficult to fill. If they pull you aside to reprimand you for ""wasting time"" or for a low workload, be certain to remind them that they hired you to do a certain job, and that the job is getting done efficiently and effectively. Most employers are well aware that workers are their base, and that important ones are vital. If you stand up to them, it's likely they won't push harder so long as everything they ask you to do is being done.

That said, I was wondering: this subreddit is called 'antiwork' and I see a lot of 'anti-work' mentions, but it implies/is criticism on something that already exists.. and criticizing something is easy. 'Anti' generally also has a negative sound to it. I personally always prefer to present alternatives to something I'm criticizing.

So my question is: is there a general consensus on what the alternative(s) would be? Is there a name for that, so I can read up on it and I could put in a more positive light by calling it 'pro-whatever' when talking to people that may be easily offended by opposing ideas?",False,cjf2tt,SIG-ILL,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cjf2tt/is_there_a_pro_alternative_to_antiwork/,27,12

I thought to myself ""oh I could start playing an instrument, read some more books, learn something new"" but nah lads, it's not happening. I drive 50 minutes in the morning to arrive at 8am. I'm fairly idle at work I admit, and it's not stressful. I do basic tasks, excel shite. It's not even that bad. But it's the time! Stay there until 4:30pm. Get home by 5:30pm. I'm exhausted. Eat, shower, watch Netflix, maybe cycle. Fall asleep by 8:30pm. Up by 6:30am. Do it again.

Why don't I move there? Well the rent for a single bedroom is prohibitive. I estimate about 75% of my wage would go to bills. And why the fuck would I tie myself into a lease and cement myself to this. My parents are accommodating, and are allowing me to live effectively rent and bill free. I appreciate this greatly.

Well this is it really, my hard work and dedication to get a good degree, or rather a degree that people told me was good and 'marketable' and this is the reward I get. Little time to myself. Little finance. It's just sad. 

I've said this to others. The shock and horror that I would think of leaving a job that I have worked hard for. And gasp! What would a future employer think of this! He certainly is not a sticker!

38,Interesting article on CNBC,"CNBC: The Fed is about to cut rates to protect the economy, even though most signs are strong.
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/26/fed-to-cut-rates-for-first-time-since-2008-jobs-data-should-be-strong.html

Strong economy should be in quotes. The economy is basically in the same shape it was in 2013 when former Obama economic adviser Larry Summers said we were suffering from ""secular stagnation"", a term he recycled from the 1930s.

Unemployment is low, officially, but only because labor force participation fell after 2001 until 2009 and never recovered. Wages have been stagnant by official reckoning since the 1970s and collapsing by the more accurate gold measure. Income has been concentrated in the hands of the very wealthiest magnates of capital. Growth has slowed to a negligible 2 percent per year, even with interest rates held near zero and massive deficit spending of a trillion dollars a year. 

If this is a strong economy, what does a weak one look like? And can the environment survive an economy that lives up to the CNBC hype? We have to begin now to drive the debate away from economic growth and toward less work.

request a reasonable workplace accommodation for their lactation need. The Company will
provide this break time for up to three years following the birth of a child. The Company may
also engage an associate in a cooperative dialogue to determine whether a reasonable
lactation workplace accommodation is needed and addressing the difficulties that a requested
lactation accommodation may pose,

Nursing mothers can elect to take time to express breast milk during their regularly schedule
meal and rest breaks. Of the break time cannot run concurrently with the meal and rest breaks
already provided to the employee, the break time will be unpaid for nonexempt employees.
There additional breaks are required, employees should work with their supervisor regarding
schelling. A nonexempt employee can elect to work before or after her normal shift to make
up the amount of time used during unpaid break time for expression of breast milk, so long as
Sees One He requested falls within The Company's normal work hours. Employees are
required to provide reasonable notice to The Company that they intend to take breaks for
expressing breast milk upon returning to work. f

Employees have the right to request a lactation room for purposes of expressing breast milk.
The lactation room will be a sanitary place, other than a restroom, that is yielded from view,
free from intrusion and in reasonable proximity to the employee’s work area. The lactation
room will include an electrical outlet, a chair, a surface on which to place a breast pump and
other personal items and nearby access to running water. A refrigerator suitable for breast milk
_ storage will also be available in reasonable proximity to the employee's work area. A room
identified for use as a lactation room may also be used for other purposes, However, during
times when an employee is using the room as a lactation room, that will be its sole function.
When two or more employees need to use the room for lactation purposes or in connection
with other accommodations, they should work with their supervisor to schedule room usage
comparatively and in a way that accommodate all affected employees. Of providing the
requested lactation room will place an undue hardship on The Company’s operations, The
Company will engage in good faith in a cooperative dialogue with the employee conceding the
employee's accommodation needs. In the event this situation arises, please contact your

It’s also in part to the lack of benefits they give everyone who works here. No sick time. No PTO. No raises. And the actual Personal Care Aids (PCAs) get it even worse making poverty wages. 

Do the owners of the company care? NOPE. The owner came in last week to complain we weren’t bringing in enough money. And to also use us as guinea pigs for a new business he’s starting by making us do a group activity “for fun”. 

So now the chickens have come home to roost. We’ve lost so many people and we are having to train two new people this week. Pretty sure one of them isn’t going to last and I’m not too sure about the other one.

However, we’ve had two more people resign last week and they’ll have to be replaced and their replacements have to be trained up which is a long process. So that’s four people they’ll be training now.

So management is shitting themselves. The abusive director is screaming at the head of the company. It’s wild. Meanwhile I’m just sitting here watching this chaos unfold.

66,Little steps for remembering to enjoy my life.,"I've (thankfully) been a long-time lurker here and am glad to now join in the discussion. I don't want to lie to myself when it comes to my personal anti-work attitude. I am a lazy man who prefers to take interest in things without anything to do with money or gain beyond the ability to think about what I want to think about. I don't want to work. I would like to keep a garden and tend to that. Just surviving should be all I have to do, and really when I think about it, it's all I want to do. The next step is to start feeling how I want to feel, and pursuing it.

I work in the hospitality industry; been at it for about 7 months now. This is my 11th(?) job since 2012 when I graduated from community college. I ghost every employer because they don't own me and I don't owe them anything. I've made it clear by my actions and demeanor at this job that I want nothing to do with ""work family."" I really only respect the housekeeping women because they bust ass for no respect or wage. I do what I can to lighten the mood for them and encourage them when any of them speak amongst themselves about organizing to collectively not show up. They have been growing more and more disgruntled and I can only say to that: ""Good!""

Anyway, ballpark it at every couple of months when I will have this reoccurring ""moment of clarity:"" when it completely shocks me -as if learning about it for the first time- that people slave it for 30+ years (just isolate that without thinking of the decline in health, etc afterwords. 30+ years!) and that out of ALL THE POSSIBILITIES for living we went ahead and played along with this demeaning and environmentally and mentally/emotionally destructive game. It still is unbelievable to me!

Well, if you combine this state with being down the Anthropocene / Climate Change rabbithole, you have where I am. And really, maybe I am right where I need to be. As in, why should I bother with this nonsense? And how have I forgotten that I am alive and living instead of droning around in habit?

I feel ready to invite a little chaos into my life, in a healthy way. I started by ending my day Friday with reading a book for the last two hours. I'm calling in sick tomorrow so I can meet up with a woman at the beach. And I'm gonna be riding bare minimum at this job until the wheels fall off. And after that, maybe I'll swing some contracting jobs painting or laboring. Crash on a couch or two. Maybe I'll take a greyhound again and hit it some place with just a backpack. I have a couple thousand dollars saved; that's more than enough for a while for me, and I don't see much point in having it to begin with. It's as pointless and destructive as the jobs and industries it creates.

67,Is 6 weeks of paid vacation truly an outrageous request for a salaried employee in the U.S.?,"Healthcare aside, I wanted to talk about vacation culture in the U.S.. In the U.S. there isn't a set of laws governing mandatory (paid) vacation unlike in several European countries. Vacation packages vary per country in Europe; 4 weeks seems to be the average amount granted per person (note: this excludes paid sick time which varies) regardless of type of job/career.

Some context: I work in a small office (12 people total) and am salary  exempt employee. This means I don't get overtime at all (even though I frequently work 45 hours per week). I work very hard and am profitable for the company. My boss occasionally scoffs when I leave right on time (even though I show up early).

I know in the U.S. I should be fortunate and grateful to have 2 weeks of paid vacation (including 1 week off during Christmas/End of the Year), but I can't help but feel shafted as a human from getting a real break from Corporate America... I even feel guilty when I speak to others about wanting more paid time off like its some kind of insane request (I know I probably shouldn't have spoken about antiwork in public or even with family, or SO - lesson learned). I was planning to ask for a raise soon but ask for an increase in paid vacation time instead of a salary raise.

70,Why are most people unaware?,"Could you recommend any interesting books or papers about why most people are unaware of the exploitation they are subjected to? I refer here mostly to developed countries, not people in Africa or India living below the poverty line.

What made me think about this. My employer (a very large one - few thousands employees) carries out a survey each year (a Census). It's a public office so I guess they have to do it. You can view results more generally and by branch/office once completed. 

It's anonymous. 

Most of the results show people are content with their jobs. They are content with their manager, opportunities, conditions. They are happy, happy, happy, across 50 questions. I mean really shocking 70-80 percent happy.

Facts show people haven't had a real pay rise in many years with purchasing power rapidly decreasing. The work itself is utterly depressing working in cubicles-like desks, with very little to none daylight, no plants (strictly against the policy), recycled air, no intellectual challenge, no creativity whatsoever. I mean 0.
 I am not exaggerating. Management is abusive, worst kind of low lives with low intelligence and excellent ass kissing abilities.

Why do the surveys show such a high percentage of content in an environment that is utterly soul crushing? There are few people around me who are aware what an absolute garbage the work is, but most seem genuinely content. When I think about the society in large, there seem to be too many people almost happy to be exploited or at least they find it completely normal spending your entire day 5 days per week in a basement like environment under neon lights, no windows or daylight anywhere near, doing the worst type of paper pushing jobs. 

I understand, you have to. I am in the same position. There's no one else to pay the bills. But I'm also certainly aware of how extremely dissatisfied I am in a soul crushing office job. I want to cry most days. I feel the best years of my life have gone to waste.

So are people basically stupid sheep by nature? Or am I being an arrogant prick for thinking that I am more aware compared to most people that a fundamental system change on a global scale is needed or I can't survive this for much longer. What am I missing? 

I often think that if the majority of people were like me, we would have had a revolution, redistribution of wealth and a new world order long time ago. We would be working 20 to 30 hours per week at most in meaningful jobs.

Long-time lurker, first post. American male nearing 21. This is a a bit of a rant rant, forgive me if I sound like a p*ssy.

I swear, I hated everything about it. I just liked the social status it gave me to be able to talk about my job. Every coworker, every plant and flower I hated. Everyone acted so fake. Every customer. They were all snooty boomers, eager to shell out their disposable income on overpriced botanical and household accessories. I survived seven weeks at 24 hours, and I feel like such a loser for not sticking it out. But the summer heat of Alabama made it terrible. And watering, you would get drenched no matter how careful you were. We couldn't be ourselves. We had to act like salesman and exaggerate how good the products were. Every shift it was like I could feel someone else imposing their will on me. Today, I just couldn't take it. My mental health was in a bad state, and when it gets to the point of suicidal thoughts I figure I might as well quit.

Now there is the anxiety of ruining that employment relationship. A reference I could have had is gone. My mom is infuriated with me. I know all the ""relationship"" stuff is fake. But if one is not working, he is judged.

You can never be good enough just to be who you are. It is survival of the fittest. If you are a misfit, it seems like not a whole lot of people have compassion for you. You have to do something ""marketable."" No one cares to see your inherent worth as a human being.

I hardly know what to do now. I am relieved to have quit my job now, but I wish I had been able to have the discipline to work out a notice. Two weeks, one week, three days. Anything. Idk why I get where I just don't show up. I had to escape. I had to get into the woods and get away from society this morning. I feel like a f*ck up. No one else I know does this - they all have stable part-time jobs. It is so hard to get away from. No matter where you go, you will see people working. And you (meaning I) will feel guilty that I'm not working right then. Even if you are near the top of the ladder, you can still see those people suffering, and it just makes you feel miserable for them, and miserable about the whole world one you realize and internalize it.

I know I got to learn to stick it out if I'm going to make it in the world. I'm trying to push through college, but I don't like CS (though I know the potential benefits) and would like to go into education if my mother weren't so opposed.

81,Living in a van,"Warning : absolutely no formatting

Tldr: living in a van sounds good to me and you should probably check it out if it sounds good to you

I think living in a van would be incredibly freeing. You can go anywhere without being tethered to a house or apartment. You don't have to pay rent at all. If you get an electric van you barely have to pay for transport. With some optimization of the space, with a folding bed and stuff that can move out of the way, you can have a very compact little house with enough open area to move around in the privacy of your own van.  You will still need a job (preferably one you can work online for) unless you have money saved up, but there isn't really much need to work a lot of hours unless you want extra money, because really the only expense is food. You don't have to pay any bills, all of the money you make is yours . It is good to have an emergency fund in case of break downs, or a medical emergency (just drive somewhere where you can get cheap healthcare i guess.) With a pretty small investment of a couple thousand dollars. you can usually get vans pretty cheaply from people. If you are buying a cheap used van, have a mechanic take a look at it so you can fix it and find any problems before you go out and break down in the middle of nowhere or something. Minus the cost of the van, you can make a van to live in for around 2000-4000 dollars (I don't really know, this is just a guess.) Van life is not for everyone, but if you don't want to work all day everyday just to be able to have a place to live and food to eat, and you don't mind being in a pretty small space, this is a good option.",False,cheyoo,SubatomicMc,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cheyoo/living_in_a_van/,8,10

93,I hope soon I will be free. Here is my plan.,"Hello everyone.

It's a great community of people who can really understand me and I want to share my story and my dreams with you. 

Please read my story and say what you think, I have no one else to share this with. This is the first time I am sharing this with someone.

**So here's my story:**

I am 26 old and I fucking hate this system. Fucking job, towns with shitty small apartments. I hated it even before I started working. I hate that I am forced to earn money and to live in my poor country.

I hated every working day, no matter how good or simple job was, or how much I get paid. It doesn't matter. I am a slave and I live among assholes who pretend that everything is ok. 

Every fucking day is a torture. Every day I have to suffer and tolerate the shit I live in. Every day I have to sell my live for money and what for? 

In my country there is just one big city with good paying jobs. I've never wanted to live here, I've never wanted to buy an apartment here. 

But here I am, I am working and living in this city, I bought an apartment here and now I have big mortgage.

**Then why did I bought it and why did I do this?**

**Well, here is my plan:**

All I ever wanted is freedom. Just to wake up when you want and do what you want and nothing more. It's that simple. I've never wanted to work.  

Read books all day long, play games, watch movies as long as you want to. I think last time when I had this opportunity I was a 10-12 years child, and it was summer.

I am an introvert. All my independent live I live alone and I like it very much. I don't need family, girls, don't need anyone.

I don't need and don't want to talk to anybody often. 

I don't see any sense in living in a big city. I don't go to cinema, theatres, bars or restaurants because I feel myself comfortable only at home.

I don't want to live is small apartment. It's just a concrete box. I can't call this piece of shit my home. 

A city can offer nothing to me. 

I am from poor family, and I have limited resources and capabilities.

**I think this is the best solution considering my opportunities and finances:**

1.  I want to buy a house in a small village, as far as possible from other people, rent out my city apartment and live on those money.
2. When I get older I will sell my apartment and will spend all money on my expensive dreams. 
3. Painless suicide - because pension in this country is a joke, it's very small. Medical care is also bad.

**What I am going to do when I am free?**

1. Play games
2. Watch movies
3. Read books. I really love sci-fi and fantasy. 
4. Will try to write my own own book.
5. Will create some crazy and violent games / project in Unreal Engine 4 
6. learn to cook 
7. meditation - I want to try dark retreat
8. grow my own food
9. plant many fruit trees
10. grow weed
11. grow psychedelics mushrooms
12. smoke weed for months - I want to try to smoke week and watch all Harry Potter for 1-3 weeks. Just imagine this - You are in altered state of consciousness and you watch some movie all day long? in total darkness. **Will it become your reality for a little bit?**
13. will learn how to work with wood and how to create furniture. Or how to create something with my hands.

This is a life I want to live! This is freedom!

Not some fucking office job, when you are chained to a PC, in some fucking ugly post-soviet city and society.  

\----------------------------------------

**At this moment my mortgage debt is 10 000 dollars.** 

I will pay it out and will have money for village house in 1-2 years if I don't get fired from my current job. 

And then I will finally be free. And only then I will start to live for real. 

\----------------------------------------

What are your dreams? How do you want to live your live?

What do you think about my plan? I am really interested. 

\----------------------------------------

Though this would be degrading and a ""down-grade"" from my current role, I'm considering the possibility of doing it part-time just for the time being so that I can work on personal projects for a little while. I have no time to do that with my full-time job. I also heard that on the bright side (""bright side,"" lol), some admin assistants gain useful experience that can lead to more serious HR roles in the future (this would be useful in case my personal projects don't translate to sufficient, reliable income).

106,"Does anyone else feel like work is just ""every man for themselves""?","First time poster! I hope I am abiding by the appropriate rules for this sub. I wanted to share a story that happened a few years back when I was working at a restaurant.  


When I was 20, I worked as a hostess at a restaurant. During this time, my boyfriend passed away and it was very traumatizing. Everyone in the restaurant knew about it, but still, I was never ever the type to call out and hated being perceived as lazy or unreliable (I now realize this mindset was pointless).   


During one of my shifts, I was beginning to emotionally crumble. I was working a double, dealing with inconsiderate customers, and was so close to just quitting on the spot. This was only a few days after my boyfriend passed away so I was incredibly emotional and obviously grieving. I contacted all of my other coworkers to see if they could cover my remaining shift and I explained my situation. None of them even responded. It's one thing if you don't want to cover my shift (after all, it's my responsibility, not yours) and to let me know, but to not even respond after I explain why? Keep in mind, these are people I would occasionally spend time with outside of work and felt like I was at least KIND OF close to?   


I ended up having an emotional breakdown during my shift and walked out on the spot sobbing. I am not proud of my actions, but I could no longer keep up the ""act"" and knowing none of my coworkers gave a shit just sent me spiraling (especially because I covered for them a lot, even when they called out just to go to the beach).   


I told many people about this incident and none of them had kind things to say, some even blamed me for expecting my coworkers to care and cover my shift as its ""not their responsibility"". On one hand, I know they are right, but I still think it's sad, especially given the whole ""family mentality"" that companies try to spew onto their employees. It really made me realize that coworkers and management do not care about you at all and only pretend to be nice when it benefits them. At the end of the day, it's every man for themselves. Does anyone else feel naive  for thinking it should only be right for your coworkers and management to care about you? It seems as if a lot of people consider this treatment ""normal"" and don't give it a second thought.",False,cha2jd,flowersforbreakfast,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cha2jd/does_anyone_else_feel_like_work_is_just_every_man/,12,37

109,I've never worked as part of a team.,"Every job I start off that way, and then I get moved to man accounts by myself. This is my fifth.

At first, I thought it was something I was doing wrong - like I was a problem child that could only be dealt with through isolation. So I made a bigger effort to be more social, nice, do that water cooler talk, attend stupid functions (hell, even help plan them). Still, I never got additional help. I saw new hires go to fully-staffed teams while I killed myself trying to meet deadlines for multiple clients. At one point, I was managing six different clients at an agency solo.

When I brought up my concerns, I was met with compliments about how hard of a worker I am, how dependable, how I always managed to get things done. They are always ""looking to fill the positions, but applications are slow."" Or it's not in the budget to hire additional staff for those accounts. 

I ask for a raise, get denied. So I start letting a few things slip. And then a bunch. And now my managers get pissy, say they see I'm not performing up to snuff. That I need to get my stuff together and power through.

Why?

There's nothing in it for me.

Just because I'm introverted, doesn't mean I don't want any social interaction. I am still a human being - I need to feel included in some way, shape, or form. 

Doing the work for 3-4 people is so exhausting. I'm burnt out. I don't care anymore. You know how much it takes for an organized, punctual person to not give a shit anymore? It's a lot.

112,I've come to understand something about American capitalism by using social media.,"When an American goes to work, he's working next to people who are there to survive, not to live independently in their own place, or save for something, or give their child a good future, but to just survive, and make sure their hand to mouth existence continues. 

I never used to understand this. In the rest of the G7, we joke around, we have our good days and bad days, but fundamentally, if you're fed up you can quit, go on welfare, and move into mom's basement or a friend's couch, all without having to worry about your healthcare or making student loan payments that your government gave you instead of just subsidizing your tuition directly with tax money. 

I've come to understand how and why so many American redditors hate work. It's not a game down there, it's real. They're playing for keeps in a game of 19th century capitalism, and the penalty for losing the game isn't a temporarily empty bank account, but destitution, loss of healthcare, and eventually, imprisonment.",False,ci882q,Aristarchus_ofSamos,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ci882q/ive_come_to_understand_something_about_american/,26,58
113,No motivation,"Recently I saw a post that reflected how even the most basic activities like taking a bath, cooking, etc. just change 180º when you are time-deprived by wage slavery. Something that should be natural, like cooking a good meal, shaving, exercising becomes a time drain on your (in my case) two hours of actual free time. This makes any activity really hard to pull off, because it seems like the countdown to the next day or until Monday gets shorter.

The worst part is that these are things I really want to do, or that I need (like a good shave and haircut) but when Friday arrives I just eat something and lie in my bed, incapable of any action, and Saturday morning is spent sleeping, so then, at 2PM, when everything is closed, it's already midday, and things get harder. I could go for say a haircut on Monday, but then my free time would feel even shorter. Do you see the problem? It's ridiculous. Maybe I'm just a neglectful person, lazy, lethargic, but all of this ""countdown"" thing never happened to me before work... maybe during school projects, but even so it was different, it was a responsibility and something I wanted to do.

I have no motivation to engage in things because it seems to be a competition between relaxation, mental health and time in my head. My mind thinks about movement and going outside or doing chores as ""losing time"" that could be spent lying in bed, or watching movies all day, alienated from the world, the harsh world.

Sometimes I hate myself for this, I think I'm just a pathetic person that can't deal with anything while others can do a lot of things even when tired or stressed; or that I'm disfunctional in this modern world., and it really scares me. I'm not disciplined outside work, I'm surprised on how I can manage to wake up at 6:30AM each day, but then on weekends I can't get myself to go for a walk in the mornings or cook healthy foods. I'm lucky to have a job and to live on my own (renting a room), when all my mind does is try to screw me up. I'm very anxious, I have a lot of nervous ticks, I have some episodes of depression here and there... Why can't I function properly when I need it the most? Don't get me started on creative activities... which are non-existent, buried in the sands of 40 hours workweeks and mental stress. It's like I'm a corpse... just existing and enjoying little things not to totally collapse, trying to remain positive and controlling my addictions.

Imagine what the world would look like tomorrow if we all stood up and said no. Claimed ownership of our lives and took control. Imagine the world in five years, ten years, if we stopped taking part in it. How we could change the job market, the housing market, policy.

My family thinks I'm still just young and naive, that it's a silly thing for me to say that a career is not an option for me. This community makes me know that I'm not just some over-principled child. The system is broken, and it has to change.

120,Solutions in Late-stage Capitalism,"Someone in this sub used the phrase 'late-stage capitalism' and, while I've seen this term being used elsewhere, I think it's perfect. You don't even need a definition to understand what this means; just look around you.

Late-stage capitalism, without even looking up the term, describes to me the situation that we find ourselves in: rampant wealth inequality, sky-high asset prices and rents, flat or falling real wages, the financialization of business and creativity (e.g. zero or below-zero interest rates in many regions, venture capitalists, private equity, passive exchange-traded fund-fueled asset bubbles), some of the lowest percentages of corporate profits going to workers since the early 20th century, longer work hours, more bullshit jobs, and on the more depressing end: opioid addictions, substance abusers, suicides, etc.

I've contemplated suicide myself, even with a comfortable BS job of my own. I can afford to rent a room out with other people, and I have my basic essentials covered. However: I can't justify having a car on my income; I've never had a girlfriend (not enough money); declining ambition and disinterest in life (I used to love taking care of myself/bodybuilding; now I have to force myself to eat right and exercise); and generally feeling trapped.

This is no way to live. My happiest days are when I'm able to take time off from work. What do I do? I read interesting books, I write, I might take an online course, I love to research and learn things and develop new skills, I workout, I go for walks in nature, I eat healthy food, and I don't miss sitting under artificial lighting for all daylight hours, in a humid office, listening to the jarring sound of my boomer colleague smashing his keyboard like a typewriter for eight hours straight (sorry) while listening to my boss explain how intelligent he is.

I fucking hate being alive at this point. Even though I live very comfortably, I would still rather die than live like this for the next 20-40-60 years.

The only solution I see then, among some other lower-probability options, is this. And please, while this might sound difficult, there must be *some* solution, or I'll lose all hope. I'm thinking: what if I muster the energy to learn a high-tech skill of some sort? Classic entrepreneurship is not as richly rewarded in late-stage capitalism. The only ways I see of freeing oneself is: participate in corporatism/private equity (gearing up existing assets or businesses), OR learning a tech skill (coding) and generating a high income on a consulting basis.

The latter seems most accessible to people like us. And with that high income, you can then live frugally while allocating almost all your earnings to dividend-yielding assets like real estate investment trusts. Sure, you might need a couple of million, but if you work flat out on a high income and live frugally, it could be possible to achieve in a few years if it became your life's mission and purpose. Afterwards, you could effectively say goodbye to any BS work.

I'm hypothesizing here. I need a damn solution or I'll become another suicide case. Right now though I have too much energy to kill myself.",False,cihlsk,ToAntiWork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cihlsk/solutions_in_latestage_capitalism/,26,19

127,i wanted to be an entrepreneur....,"I got fired from the job i've been at for 5 years.  I kind of took it for granted and was no selling and focused on my other hobbies much more (which cost a lot of money but didn't make me any money).  When I got fired, I was convinced that I can just take my clients from that company to my own business.  All of my clients love me after all.  The thing is, finding a place to operate out of is extremely costly around here and i am flat out broke and trying to afford rent at the moment which makes me kind of regret not saving and spending money on my hobbies.  Not only that, but the company I was previously working for has a great location and of course much more money and my clients were just used to going there.  


I guess familiarity of the location &gt; familiarity of me, because none of them wanted to join up with me.  I made a website, logo, and everything.  I'm currently unemployed and thought i could grind it out and get on my entrepreneur shit, but at this rate I'm not gonna be able to afford my bedroom in the house i'm sharing with 4 other people.  I did make lots of bad decisions in my lifetime, so I take complete fault.

It makes me question whether i'll even be able to run my own business if i'm already giving up.

129,Don't be afraid to speak your mind on here. How can you be for the abolition of work while also be for the micromanagement of what people say?,"Hello everyone on the antiwork subreddit. I know there are lots of leftists on here which is not my personal belief but that's okay. But please do not be afraid to actually speak your mind. I am so sick and tired of people changing how they talk or being scared of going against the grain. 


I was banned for a month (I forget for what, I think I called someone a leftist yuppie or something) but now im off of the ban but still not afraid to speak my mind. Anti work thought can not be controlled. The moderators here are leftists and are not in favor of the true abolition of work. To abolish work, the state will also be abolished. They don't understand why they both go together. Democracy is a form of government by the way. 

Just like they banned me, if they had any real power in life (they probably don't) they would be the same people who would do write ups at work, manage the schedules, and manage the government extortion enforcement bureaus. 

I want discussion. But what I really want is people to be free and speak their mind. I was once a leftist and dealing with being politically correct is tiring and annoying.

133,My employer is being acquired by a massive corporation. It's highly likely that I'm going to be let go once the deal is done. I have no idea what to do.,"I'm new here, I'm gonna ramble a lil bit about what I'm going through - sorry if this isn't typical antiwork fare but I like the cut of y'alls jib.

I've been working in the enterprise IT field for the past 10 years, the last 3+ years with a startup. As far as employers go, I have to admit this startup is pretty good. My director is very much a ""life first"" type of person and doesn't give folks a hard time for taking time off when they need it, late nights/weekend work is usually made up for with time off, it's encouraged that folks seek out training opportunities and are given time for them, stuff like that. Working for this startup has also presented me with travel opportunities and other perks that I ordinarily wouldn't have in my role. That said, if I've learned one thing in the past 10 years working in this field, it's that I am deeply unhappy and will not last doing this until retirement age. These feelings were exacerbated a couple of weeks ago when we arrived to work one morning to learn that the board had agreed to be acquired by one of the largest corporations in the industry, whom I have zero interest in working for. And of course now my work feels completely pointless because once the acquisition is done all the existing IT systems are just going to be ripped out and replaced, which isn't very good for my day-to-day morale.

These corporate acquisitions take a while to complete so I know things aren't going to change too drastically around here for at least a year. Execs are saying the typical ""we're going to try to find a place for everyone moving forward"" bullshit, and that may be true for the engineers who design the products but IT is a support group and it's very likely that most of our team will be let go. HR has already outlined how any current or future equity will be dealt with but that's all we have in writing so far. Basically, on the date the acquisition is finalized, vested shares will be paid out for the agreed buyout price, and unvested shares will be paid out according to the employee's existing vesting schedule (meaning periodic payouts for the next X number of years). As for what kind of severance package (if any) could be expected beyond that, it's still entirely up in the air.

I'm trying to look at this optimistically but there are so many variables. The way I see it, the best case scenario is that the severance package is good enough so I can use that + my equity to go back to school because I really need to change careers. I'm fortunate enough to have kept my debts under control and I'm still in my early 30s, not married/no kids leaning on me, so this seems like it could be a real opportunity to find a new direction. At the same time, I really don't know what I would even study if I were to go back to school. Since this announcement I just feel like I'm living on borrowed time. I'm resolved to save as much money as I can while it's still coming in, but everything after that is a giant question mark. I've never felt more expendable or uncertain about my future. Has anyone else gone through this sort of thing or attempted a career change after working in one field for a decade? Am I a spoiled d-bag who should check his privilege?

There's some things I can do to get my payment down to $400. Then, it'll just take even longer, and I'll pay the government more interest so they can fund their wars and fund the rich fucks. And what gets me is that I got off 'easy' with the amount of student debt I have. I have less than many other people.

As a bonus, I just found out my license was suspended. I had no idea for EIGHT MONTHS. I never got mail, phone call, nothing. And yes, my info is updated. So now, I get to go through 8 layers of hell to fix it because it's a complicated situation due to involving two states. Oh, and I also get to pay them lots of money for never telling me, so yay.

The kicker is, I'm supposed to move back to my home state in two weeks. So if I can't get it handled through mail, then I get to pay thousands more for them to haul my car to my home state. 

And all this moving is for a new job. And THANK GOD I will be making a livable wage and eventually able to pay all these things. But at my old/current job, I would have been entirely fucked. I thank my lucky stars for this new job, and that's how they get you to be grateful of your new job and worship it. At my old job, my life would have taken an ugly turn.

137,"I don't know what to put as a title, sorry.","Hello, I'm new to this sub. Been reading a lot about other people's hard times about working and receiving advice so I think I should do the same, just to seek some comfort from the stress I've been through recently. This is my first post being here.  So if certain parts of my post are deemed immature, inconsiderate , offensive or just simply not suitable for this sub, please let me know and i will correct myself.

I wanna ask you guys something, any of you who has experience of overthinking a lot? Especially during work? 

I don't know whats gotten into me, but I keep having worries about things that I'm doing, Worries like how will other coworkers look at me when I made a mistake, or how will the boss scold me for no doing things the way he does. No matter how much I try, I just can't shake away this fear of constant worry of judgement from others, now matter how confident I am in doing it. That had led me to quitting my second and last job, combine the fact that both of those jobs had me deal with shitty coworkers and bosses, it's just making me slowly losing my sanity.

Now I am currently unemployed, but my parents had been forcing me to go find a job, simply because I haven't finish my work study college (currently studying Culinary Arts) and those typical ""this is how life works, you work or you die"" reasons. 

It hurts to see all my interests are either useless or not profitable that i have to ditch them just to stay in this society. I wanted to write and animate, but years of studying other subjects and working had rendered my vocabulary and creativity deteriorating. I wanted find jobs related to the things i like such as light novel writer, or animator in the video game industry, but realized that they are all not that profitable, or just generally doesn't exist in my country. Last time i know,  Japan publishers doesn't really accept light novel submissions from foreigners, let alone fan fictions from existing creations due to copyright, even if they do, considering my luck, I would rather use my scripts to set up a campfire to keep me warm if I ever get homeless. 

I regret for being smart when I was young, so smart that I actually though that i could be a good person with a bright future like all those adults told me, only to be trampled onto the ground by reality. I don't know what to do, spending every night thinking about what will I become if i continue this way, being myself instead of being a work slave like other people. I don't know where to seek advice until I stumble upon this sub, and now I'm typing this, so that I can at least make myself feel better from all these negative thoughts because I know that there are other people at the other side of the world like me, struggling.

Sorry about the long post, but thank you if you reached this far, to think that I am still be able to write a long paragraph like this after giving up on writing for so long really brings back the memories of young me dreaming about writing a novel and submitting it to be published, if only I can go back to that time when things are simpler, so I don't have to worry about everything from the present to the future.",False,ci1556,AxionEdge,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ci1556/i_dont_know_what_to_put_as_a_title_sorry/,2,8
138,Medical field stories,"I haven’t personally worked in, but have heard the most horrific stories from the American “healthcare” field. Doctors and nurses being forced to work 12-36 hour shifts on their feet, no breaks, have to go hundreds of thousands in debt and then work a multi year unpaid residency under abusive senior doctors or surgeons. Then, when in practice, you basically have to pander to the pharmaceutical industry and over-prescribe and over-order testing because you get 15 mins with each patient. 

I’ve heard countless terrible stories about gossip, workplace bullying and mobbing as well. It seems to be an industry that *particularly* caters to being an abusive workaholic sociopath. And has multiple types of hazing rituals for new professionals such as extreme work hours, near-slave labor during education, and more extreme workplace bullying. It seems worse than just the typical work culture issues we have here. 

And it seems even more scary that people’s lives are literally in the hands of these workers. People’s health is on the line, often urgently, concurrently as these workers are using work time to bully each other. 

Has anyone else noticed this? I’ve completely ruled out working in any kind of healthcare field because of how bad the stories I’ve heard are.

They explained that it made it worth it and when they came back they felt refreshed and could continue on with the remainder of the year’s work. I’ve seen this type of thinking in a lot of jobs and it is so problematic. 

First, a vacation doesn’t fix the system that is perpetually exploiting you and demanding more and more. 

Second, this type of mentally is dangerous. For some it pacifies them, and they continue on for he one break they get a year. 

Also, most people are checking e-mails and getting calls from their bosses while on vacation. I’ve even seen some people who were just staying home get called in to work because the bosses knew they were still in town. 

I remember telling one coworker, who had been at the company for six years and had recently gotten her own office so she was extra pro company, about my dream of teaching English in Thailand. And she said “why? You could just take a vacation there and still work here.” 

And another reason it doesn’t work is because most Americans don’t take their full vacations. I was withholding taking it cause I wanted to get the monetary equivalent when I left, and some bosses guilt their employees about leaving and it’s never a good time. 

Don’t be pacified by 10 days off. Can someone do the math and tell me what the percentage is for days off and worked? It can’t even be more than 5%.",False,ch8fm7,Wantsahusky,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ch8fm7/vacations_dont_fix_the_problem/,51,91

155,I have a great opportunity and want to throw it the hell away.,"Bloody hell this got long quick. I spent a while writing it. I don't know if this is where it belongs, but it seemed the right place at the time. TLDR: I have an interview coming up for a ""good job"" and I fucking hate myself for considering showing up for it, mostly because of the fact that the interview process reveals a lot about how the company doesn't genuinely value the time or talents of their applicants.

I dropped out of graduate school recently, with six figures in debt. There just aren't any jobs that require a PhD in my field that I would ever last in. My ""work ethic"" (a phrase I've always found off-putting) fluctuates too much over the course of a year for me to credibly promise 30+ years of loyal service without reverting back to the pathological lying I engaged in as a small child as as a desperate (failing) attempt to gain peer respect in a world I found, and still find, incomprehensible.

I've applied to exactly one job so far, as I currently live in a city that doesn't have the size to maintain a huge corporate economy with jobs whose HR managers wouldn't be former business students who barely passed courses I once taught for a stipend roughly 70% below the median salary for someone my age, and who by that fact alone know that I don't have many talents that are really necessary in said jobs. I clicked ""Submit"" (how apropos) over a month ago. I aced the phone screening over two weeks ago and have an interview coming up this Friday. I'm certain that I gained this interview thanks to the extraordinarily ambitious cover letter I included with my resume, my energetic go-getter demeanor during the phone screening, and the friendly ""reminder"" I sent the Monday following the phone screen, featuring a reiteration of what I think I can contribute to the company.

The in-person interview is a typical panel interview for an analyst position in middle management for a techy company with a few hundred employees. The first half will feature a presentation I'd put together over the next couple days, in which I'd outline my responses to a few questions they gave me regarding a data set of their customers and the services they've contracted from the company. The second half will feature ""behavioral questions"" (describe a specific, actual situation at your past job where &lt;&lt;challenging scenario&gt;&gt; occurred, describe in detail how you responded to it, and describe what you learned).

Despite my graduate training in an academic field that is naturally cynical about agents' motivations, I totally overlooked the fact that I basically agreed to complete a spec assignment for the right to have them consider hiring me for pay. This is, in and of itself, not remarkable, as anybody who can read nonfiction and chooses to exercise that ability knows that the ""unpaid internship"" (working for free for months) is becoming so normalized that it's no longer unheard of to hear of people paying for said unpaid internships. I've gone from feeling somewhat hopeful that I won't be homeless a month from now to feeling angry and bitter that I've agreed to a glorified American Idol audition in which I'll be desperately attempting to impress strangers for really nothing more than a chance to not be homeless. I actually think I'd get the job if I put the requisite effort into it. I'm just sick of working for free just for a chance to not be garbage.

I discovered this sub after seeing it linked in a post elsewhere. It's where I've belonged since my first day of working for free at the age of 6 (don't give me any shit about how school isn't ""working for free"" but rather an ""investment in one's self"" -- I did just fine learning new skills before attending school, and beginning school was far more akin to driving a Ferrari into a tar pit than the ""journey of self-improvement"" school is aggressively advertised as). Looking back, even when I aspired to be rich, it was only insofar as I'd never have to do the song and dance again, and had nothing to do with a chance to own cool toys or live in a ridiculously large house or cover myself in finely woven, meticulously cut cloth.

While the company I'll be interviewing at does something of value (at least if their backend infrastructure is as well-designed and maintained as their shiny client interfaces, which I'm sure it isn't), I can't help but feel like I'm ""selling out."" What's worse is that I can't complain about it to anyone I actually know. Family and former classmates are either apathetic or downright antipathetic toward the disposable poor, and my low-income friends resent me for not being grateful for the opportunity. Would I be good at it? Yeah, I bet I'd be better at it than the hundred other applicants this company must have lined up to be taking so long and raising so many barriers. I'm just better trained than almost anybody else who would consider applying for it, and the phone screener implied as much with some of the questions. I asked for enough money to live well in this town, even after loan payments, so I'd be throwing away a lot of potential security if I canceled.

Yet my top ""ambition"" (if you can call it that) in life has nothing to do with spending 9 hours a day in a building across town, analyzing the rate of return on sales agent expenditures. I'd much rather get on a bus down to Mexico and get to a low-cost town where I could live cheaply enough not to worry about money, write niche rants like this, and in the meantime teach those who I rely on a few things about computer programming and applied statistics, or maybe teach their kids. I believe that the beauty of computers is that, employed in the right way, they could make work as we know it obsolete, or at least something that takes up little enough time that few resent it as I do now. Instead they've somehow made opportunity even more scarce for those who can't keep up with them and increased the workload for those who can. It's perverse, and people like you called it years ago.

I spent many a year of my adult life as a ""libertarian."" I still think I am one, but it doesn't mean to me what it did once, and certainly doesn't mean to me anymore what it means to other self-styled ""libertarians."" If there's anything November 2016 taught me, it's that a libertarian is more often than not somebody who wants the government to leave him alone but still wants the option to call the cops when someone inconveniences him. It's someone who spews bullshit about the ""non-aggression principle"" but will vote for the first pussy-grabbing sociopath who promises him a tax break that amounts to his cable bill. It's someone who talks trash about government public works projects and a bloated military-industrial complex, but still wants a 1000+ mile scar to be built across the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts to protect us from people who probably wouldn't want to come here if the past century of foreign political intervention and domestic drug policy hadn't made a bad situation worse where they came from.

I hate working, even for wealth, unless I can see the benefits accrue to those whose quality of life meaningfully depends on it. I hate myself for even considering another three days of working for free, even if it's for a chance to not be tossed in the garbage with 6 billion other people who would probably take my opportunity if they could. I hate myself for vocally supporting the amoral value system that makes irresponsible opportunism the only option for so many.

156,My experience taking on the powers that be...Organizing my workplace,"Sorry if this is to long. TLDR at bottom. 

I found this sub and have been lurking for a while now. So I wanted to share my story dealing with corporate power and the struggle to successfully organize a union in these tough times. I really feel the employers have everything going for them these days with technology and tracking software, as the pinned post here mentions. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Organizing my workplace   
  	Hi guys I want to share my story with you about the time I organized my hotel job (holiday inn express franchise) with a national business union (UFCW local). I was successful in getting the union certified however eventually due to heavy turnover (myself included) and a sale of the business to another owner, and brown nosing,  the union was eventually decertified before ever signing a Collective bargaining agreement.  I live in Ontario Canada, it's been  just a little over 3 years since this took place. I was the Night Auditor for this hotel for 8 months when I began to organize my coworkers. It was a small shop, I organized my coworkers in housekeeping with the my front desk coworkers, there was about 29 people in the bargaining unit. The employer was heavily resistant to unionization and broke several laws, however they got off Scot free as the labour laws in Canada heavily favour capital and have very little teeth. UFCW also in my opinion kind of shit the bed. However I also was very naive and made plenty of mistakes myself and learned a lot from this experience which I will attempt to articulate in the following.   	

The reason I began to organize my coworkers was due to heavy turnover, including coworkers being fired. The General Manager(also the owner of the Franchise) began to give me trainees and giving me as little as 2 nights to train them on the job before leaving them alone for their own shift. It was ridiculous, and these people quit as they were ill prepared to be working alone and responsible for the hotel after 2 days on the job. This meant I was stuck working 6 nights a week.  I began to resent my boss and sent him a fairly militant email, complaining to him how things were being run. He responded by offering me a supervisor position and a 50 cent raise. 50 cents.... I guess he thought I would just be excited at the prospect of supervisor I would be okay with 50 cents more for a huge responsibility and the privilege of working even closer with my boss that I hated. Yet I did agree to become supervisor, and this is what put me in a great position to begin to organize my coworkers.   	

However the plan to organize was still  just an impulsive decision on my part. I was feeling very suspicious of my bosses plan for me, and one morning when I got off work very frustrated I emailed the organizing department of UFCW and asked them for advice.  A Organizer got in touch with me shorty after and off we were. I had no idea what I was signing up for, I really thought that the union organizer would do the majority of the work. That was false, I 100% became the main organizer with little idea of what to do. I was just firing from the hip at this point forward. I should also mention now I have a alcohol problem and still do, so I was drunk a lot of the time. I'm not use at all to putting myself in the spotlight like I did here, and my social anxiety made for a ton of sleepless nights.   	I started small, brought two coworkers to the first meeting with the organizer and from there it snowballed. We had a majority of the cards signed within 2 weeks. I believe we went into the vote with 19/29 authorization cards signed. One of my favourite memories; Being introduced by my manager in the break room as the new front office supervisor to my coworkers who I had just signed up for the union. It was awkward and fucking awesome at the same time, and by far the peak of the experience for me. A poor man like myself pulling the wool over the bosses eyes, I loved it. I forget exactly how many I got signed but it was almost all of them. My coworkers struggled to get people signed up so I took over and as a more senior employee who was being promoted to supervisor it was fairly easy for me to get people signed.   	

I remember only two people that I asked (I didn't ask the obviously pro management employees) refusing to sign a union card for me. One of them snitched on me for sure fairly early on, ironically she was a very weak employee and likely would've been fired had not been for the union drive. Once the employer found out about the union drive they quickly fired one of my coworkers and union supporter with made up bullshit reason, as a chilling effect. Luckily it was too late by this point and we already had enough support for the vote. The union made an agreement with the employer to reinstate her before the vote. This is also where I made one of my first mistakes and I challenged the owner and management and became militant with them after this firing.  This is while I was being “trained” by them for the supervisor position, so this screwed me up as they realized from there on I was pro union 100% and not one of them. Pretty sure they knew this already anyways but this gave them the excuse to treat me badly. They gave me the silent treatment from this point forward. I suppose I became to arrogant and proud, and thought i had much more power than I did. I didn't really think about the fact that even once we won the vote we would have long drawn out negotiations and I would still have to work there. I was just so focused on winning the vote and thought the union would take it over from there. I was wrong. 	

The day before the vote the organizer and I were guessing what we thought the vote would be and we thought it would be a lot closer than it turned out to be. The vote came and the union won it 20 yes to 3 nays. It was a great outcome and I was ecstatic, however it would all come crashing down fairly quickly after this. Firstly the union was awesome during the union drive, my organizer replied to my questions fast and I felt I had a ton of support behind me in the UFCW. This quickly changed after we won and I felt UFCW left me to fend for myself against a very hostile employer.. Secondly the employer stopped giving a fuck and became extremely bitter. Again partly my fault as I did antagonize the shit out of them once I realized i had the union. I would call in sick and force the owner to work overnights for instance as no one else would cover nights.   	 

Was maybe three days after we won certification the first supporter quit after talking to management and being discouraged. Than they began to fuck with more supporters hours and schedule  and they to quit. Blaming the fact their “hands are tied by the union” or just straight up not giving a shit. I didn't know it at the time but they were going to sell the hotel anyways. I quickly realized their plan was to be huge ass holes to everyone except their allies and  force turnover and frustration among the bargaining unit. It worked and people were dropping like flies. The union seemed to care less and barely replied to my concerns if at all. I became suspicious of the union around this time and no longer felt their support like i did in the union drive. I'm a pretty sensitive person and it really hurt me and caused me great distress to see the people who supported me becoming stressed and quitting. I didn't help in this regard as I myself was very stressed and probably caused them to become even more stressed. In short I was overwhelmed and drinking to heavily, and just not being a very good leader. 	

The nail in the coffin for me was when a coworker whom i never met before came back from maternity leave and was clearly out to get me. She of course supported the union while on maternity leave but than sought to capitalize once she returned. I don't know if she was trained by the employer to be the perfect brown nose worker or if they just lucked out in having her in their wings. She made my life very difficult and was getting the supervisor position that was originally offered to me. The first day i met her was at our very first union meeting with our new union rep. She was conveniently recalled back from maternity leave 3 weeks early and showed up and sat with management (technically supervisors, as the employer included them in the bargaining unit and the union allowed it to my dismay).  At the union meeting she was clearly very hostile towards me. The union rep noticed this as well but just brushed me off. I was not a big fan of our union rep and the original organizer I felt abandoned by. Once the new coworker came back she began to belittle me and suck up to management causing me great distress. They treated her awesome and would leave emails for me to read all about how much they were getting along. All this while I was losing my own support and drinking heavily. I still feel immense shame to this day for letting them push me out and win. My mental health was rapidly deteriorating and I was becoming very paranoid believing I was hacked and being watched. Which I probably was but most people thought I was just being crazy.  This furthered managements agenda and made me look weak and deluded. I began to look for a way out.   	

This is when the UFCW did do some great work for me and made an agreement with the employer to allow me to quit and collect EI(employment insurance), I would also receive a reference letter from them. So I did quit. It was before any bargaining ever took place. I still feel great regret to this day as I wanted to help bargain for a good contract and knew when I left that the union was pretty much done without me. No other supporters were really stepping up to take the mantel from me, as they were all to timid and scared. I probably didn't  help by being the poster child to how you get treated by management if you support the union. I was the 10th person to quit and this was 3 months after union was certified. 9 of these workers signed union cards.   

	My brown nose  coworker who came back from maternity leave would go on to become the supervisor and eventually would be the one who decertified the union a little over a year after it was certified. The original owner sold the hotel 5 months after I left which I am sure was apart of their long term plan to ensure the union would be busted. The union did have success winning the first decertification application put forward by the employer. The labour board weakly ruled the employer violated the Labour Relations act but basically faced no consequence for this. I will link the ruling to this in case anyone is interested in reading it. This is the ruling the union “won”. However shortly after this ruling they were decertified anyways. All the events in the ruling regard just what the new owners did and didn't include any of the events that i faced from the original owner. So I had no part in it as i quit by that point. This is very long I  apologize, i feel like I'm even missing more information but I could go on and on and  on. I'm not the best storyteller.

186,Everything feels like a chore lately.,"I've been so stressed and short on time lately that everything, including things I once used to enjoy, feels like another task.

&amp;#x200B;

Some examples:

\- **Eating**: this has become another thing to knock off of the to-do list. I feel as though I just need to scarf down my food as quickly as possible so that it doesn't rob me of the little free time I have, just to survive. No matter how good the food is, it always feels this way.

\- **Bathing**: looking back, I used to enjoy a nice, warm shower in my middle school and high school days. It slowly shifted into a task during college and now, it's just another task on the to-do list to maintain my hygiene. I hate it because again, it's another thing that robs me of my free time outside of work. It feels like another thing that stands between me and my time to pursue my passions or sit and relax.

\- **Grocery shopping**: this used to be a relaxing thing to do when I was younger. Strolling around, choosing what I'd like to consume without any pressure or worries. Now, again, it's a time-drainer. I race through the aisles grabbing everything on my monotonous list as quickly as I can to spare some time. Every slow walker or person in the way infuriates me, I'm very short-tempered because of my lack of free time and the stress from my job,

\- **Working out**: back when I was in high school, I truly enjoyed lifting weights. I would take my time, push myself beyond my limits with high energy levels and motivation. Now, I rush through each exercise like it's a checklist; again, *to save time.* 

*-* **Urinating**: you may be wondering how in the world this made it onto my list. This used to be a relieving, simple pleasure in life. Now, I view it more so as ""fuck, I need to use the bathroom again. Now I won't be able to finish this Netflix episode in time to get exactly 8 hours of sleep, I'll be just under at around 7:57."" Or, I watch my coworkers subtly judge me for using the bathroom too often because I'm the only one in the office who drinks a sufficient amount of water. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are just a few examples. The point is, I used to enjoy the simple things in life. The world has taken that away from me. Everything is making its way onto my checklist of things I need to do before I can have a fucking minute of free time, and I hate that. I am very disappointed in society for establishing and strictly upholding a system that has such an effect on people. Each day I browse this sub, it increasingly perplexes me as to why people just take this.

201,A rant about work and my guilt and life and stuff,"This summer, I have been working a decent amount. It is not as much as some people, of course, but it is more than I’ve consistently done in the past. Personally I have found this to be more and more difficult as time went on. In the beginning, I was working ~40 hours a week, sometimes over, but this was eventually reduced to 30 for a bit. As of writing this, though, I have put my two weeks in, and am working 40 hours for these last two once again. Once again, many people have worked much more for much longer, and I commend them for being able to do so. I, however, have struggled in this position, and have also struggled to elaborate why, to justify my ‘need’ to work less even though others work so much more than this. In writing this I hope to both figure out for myself what the issue is, potentially giving me the ability then to explain it to others. 

The work itself is not bad. Sometimes, even, when I’m in the zone and listening to some good music, the time passes by fairly quickly. The ambivalence or enjoyment of these times, however does not subtract from the time itself or the energy it takes from me.
Compared to last summer, things have felt different. Back then, my life outside work felt less affected and still existed as the ‘focus’ of my life at the time. I would see friends, play games, do housework, and, centrally to my recent introspection, work on music. In a way, working on music in this time felt like my ‘real’ job, the wage work was just an outside activity through which I could earn some money to prepare for the school year ahead. I spent long hours composing, recording, and producing, the goal of this ‘work’ being the creation of albums and the honing of my craft and passion overall. It went along very well; though I was tired sometimes I was able to push through and create many things that I am
proud of to this day. So why, then, am I so much more tired today? 

First, let me explain how things are different. These days I seem to have lost the motivation to work on music. It may not even be motivation, as I have spent a lot of time on my computer, on my gameboy, and at the piano trying my best to compose and develop ideas. This time spent, however, has generally born little fruit; I end up frustrated with myself and even more tired than before, eventually giving up for the day because I know trying harder would only tire me out more. This frustration has bled into other things, and, though I try to keep a positive attitude about it all, it proves difficult. 

I have talked with my family and friends about this, and have not found any decisive conclusions for the sources of these feelings and issues, but I will try my best to explain my ‘working theories.’ I recently looked back at my scheduled hours from last summer and found that I worked an average of 23 hours per week, adding a new variable to the mix. This leads me to believe that the extra time this summer is part of what has weighed on me. Every day I feel the tiredness, and I know that it comes from all the time spent at work. It is not even strenuous activity, but still has this sort of effect on me, and this is what I cannot pinpoint the exact reason for. As I said before, sometimes I can find myself enjoying what I do at work. I do not think the work itself is much of the issue (though I have complained about it a lot in some sort of attempt to feel better, which hasn’t worked very well). Instead, I think it is the sheer time. I do not believe I am cut out for working 40 hours a week. Some people may say I’m not trying hard enough or that I am entitled. I don’t believe that, as I would be fine with and earning less. Money is not the issue. I only know that, when I have worked this much, I have struggled. I am weaker than those who tell me ‘everyone does it,’ I am weaker than those around me; I see these things, but I do not know if I care. I am weak.

There is a general societal expectation that people will work like this for their whole lives. I don’t want to do this, to deal with that, it drains me and prevents me from doing the things I love. I don’t know if this is the case for others, but it is taking up so much of my life, though both the time itself and then the energy removed from the time outside. I know that I must work, but if it must be like this I would rather not. I don’t know what to say beyond that. If it is ‘selfish’ or ‘entitled’ of me to want to be happy doing the thing I love, then sue me. Call me those things. I don’t care, because I know inside that that is not what it is. I am willing to work, but I need something outside to live for and to cope with it all. Music has always been my refuge, and in taking away my ability to go that place, these ‘standard’ work weeks are something I do not want to live with in the future, for the sake of my mental and spiritual health. This has been a rant that sort of moved away from its goal, but hopefully it can help others to understand what i’m feeling.

221,Our employees live in poverty while the owner has a beach house,"Hi everyone. I work for a small company in the healthcare field. I’m the HR person and I spend most of my time hiring Personal Care Assistants (PCAs) who take care of the elderly.

We don’t get a lot of funding but we are a for-profit. We pay the PCAs is $9.55 USD/hr for some jobs. The highest we pay is $13.25 an hour and most people don’t get that much.

However, per hour, the amount of funding they get for some of this is ridiculous. The company is taking in even up to $17-18 an hour to go towards costs and profits. The PCAs are the one actually working the job and bringing in the money. 

Meanwhile the owner has a beach house, drives a nice car and has multiple nice cars and doesn’t come in to do any work. His children have also worked for the company and they’re still getting paid but they also don’t do anything either. His son updates the social media accounts which he hasn’t done in over two months.

The PCAs only get the federally required benefits. So health insurance after 90 days if working full time hours. No PTO, no sick days. The same benefits apply to me as well. I don’t have PTO or sick days either though I make a little more an hour than the PCAs. A living wage for the area. 

Most of our employees are on food stamps and working multiple jobs. As you can imagine, the turnover is obscene. These people are busting their asses for mere pennies while the owners don’t do shit. Hell, I’m busting my ass too.

237,Golden Handcuffs,"Currently downtrodden by work and looking for some advice. 

After working the same delivery job for the past three years, I recently injured myself and have been on light duty around the warehouse for the past two weeks. This small break has given me time to think about my current life situation: to put it simply, I hate my job and I hate work. This job sees me clocking in at 3:00 am most days and clocking out whenever the deliveries are done. Most of my co-workers are much older than myself and could care less that they work from 3:00 am to 5:00 pm on occasion. I, however, hate this uncertain schedule as it has basically sentenced my non-work related life to death. I barely sleep, my depression is the worst it’s ever been, and my body is just beaten down from the work. 

Unfortunately (?) my pay has been able to afford me my cushy apartment in a local downtown area shared between a close friend and myself. Herein lies my problem: this job I loathe is the only thing helping me afford the life I love outside of work. The free time I do have outside of work is spent with my friends or my long-term girlfriend, but those moments of free time are few and far between. If I could quit on the spot, I would. But I have a $860+ rent payment to cover my half of the apartment plus utilities, internet, etc. I’ve been searching endlessly for a new job, but most require experience I don’t have or simply can’t pay enough. 

Sorry for the rambling post, but I just feel lost. I’m stuck between affording the life I love and working the job I hate. Any advice would be appreciated.",False,cgip7v,cammyd19,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cgip7v/golden_handcuffs/,0,2

252,Society's blackmail tactic keeps us locked in,"I just wanted to rant about a tactic society/organizations use to keep us chained down to the world of professional, full-time, boring jobs: blackmail.

By blackmail, I mean the resume gap phenomenon. When an individual puts in job applications with a gap on their resume that does not contain professional experience, he/she is ridiculed and shamed to smithereens. Anyone you speak of your resume gap as if you've committed some terrible, malicious sin.

I once had a recruiter tell me ""you should really find a job soon, every week that adds on to your gap will significantly decrease your chances of landing a job."" That is correct. 

EVERY employer will shame you for your gap. It doesn't matter if you were working on art, personal projects, traveling, healing from mental illness, etc. 

All of your friends will shame you for the duration of your unemployment. I took a year off to work on my art after college and all of my friends and family constantly inundated our dialogue with ""so when are you going to get a job?"" I would respond, ""I have a job. I'm working on art full-time."" They would then ask, ""no, but like, a real job."" They would judge and berate me as if I'm some sort of degenerate piece of trash; and would never let this topic go. I had to cut ties with many of them for a while just to avoid their attempts to humiliate me.

The point is, everyone is programmed to believe a gap in professional experience is a deadly sin. They freak out at the thought of it, and put on these terribly concerned faces as if you are dying. They are all programmed to think that way. 

*If you take a break, you will be punished.* You will be shunned, belittled, ridiculed, and border-line harassed. Once you try to re-enter the professional world, they will reject you as part of the punishment. You will have to put in enormous amounts of applications to get the masters to accept you back into their system. This is how they lock down their slaves. You are not allowed to take breaks, and if you do, these are the implications. Of course, people will not take breaks knowing this would be the response.",False,ce6ew7,EffectiveEgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ce6ew7/societys_blackmail_tactic_keeps_us_locked_in/,45,82

I'm currently doing work on mturk but really, you cant make a full time income there.

I’m not a janitor, but it’s comparable to a maintenance/cleaning position where I technically could have an excuse to be almost anywhere in the building, even parts that close at night, and there’s no one that can hold me accountable because the actual work I need to complete only takes like an hour and a shift change occurs in between when I leave the “office” so no one is actually expecting me back.",False,ceambg,ExHardeesEmployee,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ceambg/apathetic_management_is_a_blessing/,9,44
276,I'm not going in tomorrow,"I work at a job with high stress, unsteady hours, no PTO, sick days or benefits. I have never once received a raise. Our old director played favorites quite often as he is best friends and roommates with a coworker; I struggle with my mental health, and taking time off was like pulling teeth. I found it hard to stand up for myself. 


Our owner recently hired a new director and the old one was transferred. Around the same time I decided to get sober, which is both good and bad. Good because I'm taking control of my life, bad because withdrawal sucks and comes and goes. A few hours ago I wrote my boss and asked if someone could cover my shift because I am ill (fatigue, insomnia, nausea, rapid heartbeat, close to vomiting, etc.). She basically told me no because it's a field trip day and they need me to drive one of the vans. My alarm was set for 6 am. I almost kept it that way. I thought about it, cancelled the alarm, and wrote her back. I told her that I am experiencing withdrawal symptoms (she knows about my substance abuse disorder and my sobriety) and am ill, and that I cannot come in but I do apologize for the challenge that may present for her. She wrote back and said she understood and to take care of myself. 


It is so important for us to take care of ourselves, physically and mentally. I have an hour and a half long drive to work, then more driving, with a van full of kids, to the pool in the hotass sun. I could not do it and will not push myself beyond my own limitations. I need to sleep, drink some water, take a shower and get better. It's unfortunate and we are expected to put our health last in favor of these halfass jobs that don't serve us.

281,Working as an intern at a corporation this summer. Kinda bullshit that people willingly work for these fuckers,"As if that wasn't obvious enough. It's very sad that an Internet forum is the only place where I can share this information because the people in the bible belt suck ass.

Just got out of an 90 minute seminar filled with boomer humor, elitism, and attempts at making sure the bottom line isn't being explicitly discussed. This was done by giving a disingenuous explanation about how you need to make sure you care about the customer and form a genuine connection (because you are being completely sincere). Made me question my existence thinking about how people go to work at this company, day in and day out, just to ensure that their boss grows exponentially more rich. I couldn't help thinking about how we didn't start this way as a species, but now we work bullshit jobs until we die because everything costs money

Worst part of it all: In the bathroom afterwards, I heard some guys talking about how glad they are it's almost the weekend and how much they could use a break. Think about that. These people go through the same motions for 50+ years while admitting they hate what they're doing. Once the weekend ends, without fail, they're back to hating their life 8-5, Monday-Friday. 
I honestly would not care nearly as much if I was working a job that was meaningful and contributing to the greater good of society. Selling people overpriced shit is not that.

Now I am not sure where I am going to work after I graduate college because the thought of enduring a corporate lifestyle makes me lose the will to live. But I can't live off minimum wage so I'll probably think about moving to an actual first-world country that allows its citizens to get healthcare and housing without going broke.

Bold claim, but people who say working is their purpose in life are in denial. I really believe the only reason anyone would believe that is because they have done their job for so long that they cannot conceive of a reality where that sort of lifestyle doesn't exist. Go ask a kid if they want to do something they hate for the rest of their life. 

TL;DR fuck corporations, fuck complacency and fuck the people who allow this bullshit to continue",False,cf24ff,kellyanneconartist,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cf24ff/working_as_an_intern_at_a_corporation_this_summer/,5,14
282,My perspective on work,"The sun heats up the earth and fills it with energy. That causes the wind to blow, the rain to fall, flowers to bloom, and causes us creatures down here on earth to move around and do the silly/complex dance called life.

So is there no free will? Is there only the illusion of free will?

Are rich people rich because they can harness more of the energy, and are poor people poor because they are not so lucky or not so talented at accessing the energy that is freely available?

Final thoughts- yeah every day sucks but somehow we manage to stay alive by pure biological instinct. We don’t work because we want to, we work because we have to.

Here’s a bible verse - Please don’t take this as proselytizing, I am not religious BY ANY MEANS, only that I have heard this quote and it seems to resonate with r/antiwork 

Matthew 6:25-34 American Standard Version (ASV)

25 Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than the raiment? 26 Behold the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much more value than they? 27 And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto [a]the measure of his life? 28 And why are ye anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: 29 yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 30 But if God doth so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? 31 Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 32 For after all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. 33 But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. 34 Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself.

I wanna highlight and address a handful of comments:

&gt; I don't actually believe in this, I just find your viewpoint interesting because it's very unlike mine. I never post, I just observe. I'm hoping the results of this survey will be posted because I'm really interested to see what the general feelings on the sub are to the above questions. 

Well, here you go ;)

&gt;\[...\]  Great place to vent and read others experiences in terrible work environments, terrible bosses, etc. But PLEASE dont turn this place into a Communist/Socialist indoctrination camp. I dont consider it so, or else I wouldnt be here.    
&gt;  
&gt;I understand many posters on this sub are very socialist leaning and I dont mind a good discussion on the pro's and cons from time to time, but if it gets to the point that the general consensus is we must jump into full blown communism in order to not work ourselves to death, I'm outta here. 

Don't worry, we're not gonna turn it into a ""Communist/Socialist indoctrination camp"". We welcome anyone who doesn't like work to post content and hang out with us. That being said, I wanna point out that anti-work is a radical left-wing idea. That's why we link to essays written by radical leftist thinkers in the sidebar. The subreddit was created by an Anarchist and is still run by (all kinds of) Anarchists.

&gt;If possible, maybe don’t use Google surveys. \[...\]

Noted. I'll try to find an alternative before we do the next survey.

&gt; The reason I said “no, the moderators are not doing a good job” is because of inconsistent and arbitrary “enforcement”, including warnings. 

Moderators can use discretion on a case-by-case basis, even for things that are not black and white on the list of rules. I guess this can lead to some inconsistencies and ""arbitrary"" enforcement of the rules? We spend lots of time in the mod-chat discussing individual post removals and user bans, and we try our best to be as fair as possible.

308,I can't get over the fact that my time is someone else's property.,"A few months ago, we had this training that taught us about fraud in a federal government setting. Obviously, falsifying your timesheets when not working the hours you are contractually obliged to is fraud. But a phrase from this training stuck with me - we were talking about the subject of employees arriving late to work, and they called it:

""*Misuse of government resources*."" They went on to elaborate that the employee's time is a ""government resource."" Therefore, the employee is stealing from the government.

Is is just me, or does that sound utterly bizarre in a dystopian kind of way? I used to simply accept these things, but with an increasingly cynical mind it all sounds surreal to me. 

""Stealing"" **your** time from the federal government is ""fraud.""

But of course, overworking us is not fraud because of the good old ""non-exempt employees are to work additional hours as needed to fulfill their responsibilities.""

It's so difficult for me to accept this. Does anyone have any tips on hanging in there other than working out, meditation, hobbies, healthy eating, etc.? Have any of you had luck with psychotherapy?

313,What is your alternative to work?,"Greetings, 

I'm not an anti-work'ist but I've already seen your sub and get the whole ""work sucks"" thingy. Now I wanna ask you guys, what exactly your alternative?

Work needn't necessarily be shitty, unlike what most post-work ideals state. So far, most of these regimes like Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communism state that work is merely for profit, while many people can find meaning in their work. Lawyers, doctors, teachers, and so on can all find meaning in what they do (if they don't then... why bother?). Hell, I even know janitors who enjoy what they do. How do you make sure people are being fulfilled if there was no ""work""? the main alternatives I hear are things like arts, research, sports, cooking, gardening... This is all very pretty, however... You are the first to say you HATE work and defend unemployment for all.

314,My new job just cut a whole week of my hours...,"I started a job at a convenience store. Naturally, it sucks. Too much busywork, too few people, etc.

I was hired on along with three or four other people under the pretenses of being closers. Since then, I have been both closer and mid shift, and my hours have slowly been whittled away. First I worked 1/9pm four days a week. Pretty sweet.  Then I started to get 9/5pm thrown in. Then they started to fiddle with the schedule, switching my off days around, breaking them up, and then switched my 1/9s to 3/9s. 

Last night, I was told that the schedule for last week stood for this next week. Today I came in and found that the schedule had been reworked! I now have no hours for next week. We are paid every two weeks. My paycheck is going to be halved ya’ll, and I normally don’t even clear $400 bc minimum wage. Also, no one told any of the new hires about the schedule change, so that is just some stellar management. 

I talked to the scheduler, one of our senior employees, to see what the hell was going on. She said, and I quote, “boss told me to do it, the store isn’t seeing enough summer business, things are slow, so everyone had their hours cut.”

The curious thing though, is the employees who have worked at the store the longest didn’t have their hours cut at all. Hmmmm 🤔

I'm 26 years old and still live with my parents. Its humiliating I know. I will own up to dicking around for a few years, but now I have just had enough. I do have loan debt that is shrinking, so that's a positive. Next goal is to get my own place.

I am giving the IT technician career one more wack. I find it incredibly hard to make a dollar worth a shit. Even with several certifications, its still McDonald's money.

My parents are wealthy, I'm just going to leave it at that. They are more absorbed in their material things than human interaction and relationships. My aunt and uncle have been that way for 30 years, and now my parents have become like them. I have seen what money does to people, most people in my family are poor and we have a few rich family members. I am disgusted I even spawned from my mother, it angers me.

I digress. So I am doing this for extra money, what little there will be since I have the 9 to 5 wage cage. I am doing this mainly to avoid my parents.

Here’s the not so unexpected twist: I basically have no choice in this. I carry no ill will toward my managers, as they have it a lot worse than me and are having their work visas taken advantage of. As a result they almost never take days off and are always working ridiculous shifts. They’ve been logging me in for many, many hours (for a part timer at least; I pretty much work full time now) because pretty much everyone on my team is leaving around the same time because corporate pulled some slimy strings. Because of this chronic understaffing and them struggling to find new workers to fill in, everyone has to take up ridiculous hours. This job has already crossed so many of my boundaries in terms of hours working that I tried setting up prior because of this issue... I don’t want to stress out my team because everyone is under pressure right now, but I literally cannot do this many hours they’re trying to force me to do because I need to pack and leave by the time my lease expires. I also can’t afford to lose this job since I need to save up. How should I take this other than the fact that corporations are disgusting, cheap, and screws my coworkers over? How do I say no? Is it ethical to? Am I just being entitled?

332,Universal basic income. Silicone Valley's new tool to keep everyone just poor enough and quiet.,"I was a huge proponent of Universal Basic Income (UBI), having written [an article](https://www.minds.com/tothet/blog/want-to-end-poverty-give-people-money-989939378733637632) about it a few months ago. Today I came across a polar opposite point of view, kept reading, and have switched my stance on the issue.

Douglas Rushkoff's main argument is that the motif behind Silicone Valley's UBI projects is to keep people complacently consuming so the tech industry can continue to extract as much value as possible. When 4[0% of Americans are one paycheck away from poverty](https://fortune.com/2019/01/29/americans-liquid-asset-poor-propserity-now-report/), it is a solution that might just work.

334,Most employers discriminate on disability despite claiming not to,"The main reason I’m antiwork is because of the way that employers (especially office jobs) purposely make working there incompatible with actual disability even ones supposedly protected by ADA. It would be actually pretty easy to accommodate those of us with serious  trauma and chronic illness but they just won’t. I have had PTSD and an autoimmune condition for all of my working life, it used to be extreme but now it’s just kind of vaguely and chronically debilitating without accommodation in the workplace.

Dealing with PTSD has been years of slow healing and I’m still working on it, I don’t need advice as it’s not an overnight process and I’m already doing what helps. The main thing is I can’t sleep right. And my body becomes physically ill under too much ongoing stress which causes autoimmune and CFS symptoms.  

I simply cannot work a job without “significant” disability accommodation. For me this is later start time, flex hours, minimizing interruption, listen to music at work, work from home option, days off spaced apart instead of two in a row, and an abuse free and emotionally healthy work environment... 

I filed a disability accommodation at my last job for an as-needed late start with flex or at home makeup hours due to PTSD related insomnia  and my last job freaking DENIED IT because “our hours of operation are 9-5:30”. They said if I missed any time I had to use PTO to cover the gap. Of course I ran out of the years’ PTO in 4 months. And then I needed more time off due to accumulated debilitation, I had a crying breakdown at work where I told my bosses I needed either to quit or take a medical leave and they told me they were accepting my verbal resignation. My medical leave was denied (I wasn’t FMLA eligible). 

Most of my work was non urgent reconciliation of accounts and files as well as replying to emails from other departments and arranging  enrolling new accounts into the system, and researching queries into databases and files. What is so urgent that it can’t be done at 11am rather than 9am? I mostly serviced internal departments. My own coworkers want me to show up on 5 hours of sleep with a bad flareup? My actual work rarely received negative reviews.

The sleep debt that accumulates doing first shift 5 day week office work is unbearable for my body. The typical handful of office bullies that are in every office also tend to target me, slowly wear me down and negatively affect me. I just can’t be around environments that allow bullies to run rampant after so much past emotional abuse. 

Work environments are also often inherently triggering to people with psychological trauma and it’s debilitating. Yelling, fake urgency about bullshit, backstabbing, gossip, zero schedule flexibility—- unable to nap, visit therapists, or cook during the day, forbidden to turn off work email and work phone to de-stress during a flareup and just clock back in when I’m ready to finish my 8 hours. It has to be all 8 hours at once (why?).

Employers DO discriminate on disability. Especially mental health and chronic illness. They really do. Unwoke people will say “just file an accommodation and sue them if they don’t uphold the ADA”. We shouldn’t have to threaten them and pay for legal action to sleep in sometimes and take breaks from office work as needed, or to have bullies dealt with. Also with what money?!

I’ve never worked anywhere that actually made it possible for me to really stay and thrive. Unwoke people also say “just apply for a different job”. Which job? Most offices I’ve been in were actively aggravating and unaccomodating to chronic disability. Unwoke people also don’t recognize the degree to which employers will subtly retaliate on people by finding “business reasons” to try and get you to leave because they see a serious disability with a need to change the entire work culture to accomodate as a legal liability threat. And HR exists to flush people who are legal liability threats even if you have zero intention of suing the company and are just asking for it to be possible to work your job without damaging your health more than it already is. 

It’s actually the entire work culture that is inaccessible for those of us with chronic mental and physical handicaps no matter how stellar our actual work abilities are. In my experience almost every work environment I’ve been in protects office bullies and demands that the seat be warm daily 9-5:30pm or else you’re never getting ahead. I can’t do that.

357,I got my coworker a raise by arguing with my boss about wages. In front of everyone.,"I was talking to a coworker about over time. She said how she liked it because of how much she got paid. Then asked her,""Wait, how much do you get paid? I make x amount."" 

&amp;#x200B;

To which she looked irritated and said, ""Really? I make (less than me) amount.""

&amp;#x200B;

And I said, ""Man that's some bullshit. Store down the corner is hiring for more than I make. How long have you been here?""

&amp;#x200B;

I found out literally twice as long as I have.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I turned to another co worker as boss was walking past, ""How much do you make?""

&amp;#x200B;

He said same amount as first co worker even though he been there longer than me.

&amp;#x200B;

And then my boss went on about how we don't talk about stuff like that and how it's not appropriate.

&amp;#x200B;

I replied how there is a law saying that I absolutely can talk about this in front of everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

He got really mad and told me to show him the law. So I quick looked it up. It's the National Relation Labor Act. It forbids employers from punishing employees for talking about their salaries. Employees are absolutely allowed to talk about their wages anywhere even on the clock during work. 

&amp;#x200B;

So he looked it over and said I was right but why would I want to do that as it would cause negative emotions amongst the workplace. I wasn't very well prepared to defend my stance so he was winning the debate. And I say debate because he was very civil with me and let me speak.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically my defense was that employers should pay fair wages in the first place and be loyal to their employees.

&amp;#x200B;

His was that if people know others wages then they'll be upset and leave.

&amp;#x200B;

\*We\* know that employers should just pay their employees for wages if they don't want them to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

But I couldn't articulate that very well.

&amp;#x200B;

And then I had to go back to my work so our debate was cut in half. By the way, all my coworkers around us were clearly uncomfortable since people generally don't talk back to their bosses about wages. But part of the law is if I'm punished for it then I can take their asses to court. So I was honestly hoping they would try some shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I said to him stuck with him because like an hour later my co worker comes up to me all happy and said, ""Thank you so much for earlier!""

&amp;#x200B;

""What about causing a scene?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah! I just got a raise!""

&amp;#x200B;

Ya'll. She now makes as much as me. I'm so fucking happy. Now the other co worker heard this and said he's gonna go ask for a raise. It literally pays to know your employee rights.

&amp;#x200B;

It's such bullshit that there had to be law passed saying you can talk about this stuff. Why can't I? Why is it such an issue when everyone knows how much I make? Oh, that's right, cause then they'll get mad at their employers and demand a fair wage.",False,cdpfxt,Glttrnthclb,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cdpfxt/i_got_my_coworker_a_raise_by_arguing_with_my_boss/,29,250
358,Not only do you have to work. Most of us can't even really choose what dream job we want.,"The jobs have bullshit requirements, nepotism and more going on that rigs the system for an average Joe.

Look at the game development industry, look at the applications. You need 5-10+ years of experience, and the experience required is so disgustingly specific, that unless you luck out straight out of grad school I don't know how you can get in.  

I know someone who has shipped over 8 games (2 were a huge success) and he told me that game companies won't hire him because they are looking for someone who has experience working in an AAA company.

The craziest part is, I'm so concerned I'll get in trouble for reading three days off while I have a stomach virus. Three days. My coworker found out today she has a partially collapsed lung, and she had been coming in for a week and ""waiting it out."" Our workplace doesn't treat us as poorly as others, but we don't even get sick days. How crazy do we have to be to feel this amount of loyalty to our office?

Then I have to make sure I log out of all apps such as outlook , Skype and Office one notes to take a mental break on my official day off which steals about ten minutes of my time. However if I haven't written an out of office , there are always a couple of assholes who cannot tolerate seeing my status as offline and after a couple of reminder emails will definitely call me on my mobile. Imagine having to hear the same shit while recovering from a bad day.

By afternoon my day has already felt like a waste and I dread about the emails I have missed and work being piled up ( I am sure no matter what, that work won't get transferred to anyone else no matter how urgent it is and will be picked up by ME AND ONLY ME)

And if I take the next day off as well, that will be the beginning of a big showdown with my boss and immediately serve as an entry in my APR. With the horribly inefficient way the department is being run they cannot afford to lose their overworked resources and even a day or two away is counted as a criminal offence.

Still No Schedule.,"*I* reached out for three weeks to get a shyte, entry level-management job working for minimum wage so that I could pay a little bit of my debt off before I check out for basic training in the next few months. But all it's been is phone tag and broken promises, thus far. Like.. ok. For example, I was told Monday that I would have my schedule on Tuesday, because our GM said there was something wrong our systems that caused my name to not show up when schedules were being made (unlikely, but whatever) but I'd have to call back in the morning since the GM had already taken the night off. Tuesday morning called, our one douchey coworker answered and told me the GM was elsewhere but would call me back. Apparently, he never did, or the GM never cared to take 5 fucking minutes to call me back. Fucking, 4 HOURS LATER, I called AGAIN. GM told me that they'd have my hours ready shortly and would call me back. They never called back. So now I don't know when I'm working, and am heading out to funeral in a few hours not knowing when/if they're going to call me back.

373,What boomers really mean when they say do what you love.,"I have considered leaving my job for something more related to my hobbies, it's entirely possible. But really there's a reason most don't talk about it though it's been mentioned here a few times

1: It has to be something you're practically in love with. Not just a pass time. Because spending eight hours a day several days a week doing anything becomes your whole life. Even when not physically there, people ask about work, most of the people you talk too come from work, sometimes you even dream about work. If it's something you like doing, you better really like doing it. Alternatively you could hate what you do but just get paid really well or do practically nothing, but for the first world those are options anyway. Really the only difference between us and a peasant is while the third world farmer has to choose total poverty of commitment, while we often lack commitment (gee what a shocker) we do have the option of just not doing anything for the most part and living off the scraps. Some of us more than others ofcourse as all things considered, America is basically a third world country larping as a first world when you look at say Sweden or Norway.


2: As said if you don't absolutely love this thing there's no way dealing with shit head bosses, being tired all the time, and doing the same routine every day forever is going to make you wanna kill yourself any less. The only thing that will happen is eventually you'll feel bad because not only was this not quite the passion you thought it was, but people will criticize you for somehow being ungrateful that you're living out ""your dream job"" and you're in the same predicament you were before. As so many in game design experience. Because when people think game design they think inventing the new Super Mario World, not writing seven hundred lines of code for the next Fortnite update on a deadline which amounts to little more than some money in your name and being able to say on your resume you worked on Fortnite. Maybe you can do a floss dance for big money gaming tech and then get treated like shit at Blizzard or something.

Look at the way they treat their consumers: that's only a fraction of how they're obviously going to treat you working for them. If the customer is just a clown to be parted with their money then banned or ignored, you're outright a slave to be abused and tormented to extract as much benefit as possible. I don't give a fuck how many Monsters you drink, you're not gamer enough to love that life.


3: The same issues will happen no matter where you work because it's not a personal problem it's a systemic one. The same way I say all mods are evil, all mods should be shot, isn't a testament to reddit itself but mods in general and despite their pissing and moaning about mu'h violent content moderators aren't a protected class but I am and they still harass me... You will experience the same sorts of evil working for the 4chan or Twitter equivalent in wagie cagie.

Sure there might be some variety here and there of HOW you're mistreated, and certainly they'll draw from different pages of their big book of bullshit reasons, but ultimately it amounts to pretty much the same thing. Boss is a twat, doesn't pay attention to the real problems making these projects and expectations implode, co-workers are all either completely numb and just don't do their job right on purpose, or are so impassioned with making a name for themselves will act like they're in a fucking gangster movie just to be supervisor. You get all sorts. But really does it matter if there's cultural, racial, and gender diversity when it all amounts too ""I really don't wanna see or interact with any of these people?""

You'll probably need to find one you like though. You don't wanna be the 40 something single guy or girl whose entire life revolves around cats and this shit job. Because as much as employers say they don't wanna drama in the work place, unless they're gonna arrange you a marriage like some Arab prince, giving the vast majority of your life is spent at this specific location with these specific people, you better find someone to breed with or you won't be breeding at all. Thus only making the experience more unbearable and grueling. Cause i dont know about you, but I wasn't born on this earth just to die alone.

&gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/narcsinthewild/comments/c3w638/im_not_sure_if_my_neighbour_is_a_narc_or_what_but/

&gt;Earlier tonight we had another balcony chat.

&gt;Unusually for him, he asked how things are going with me, particularly my job search. I'm currently unemployed and having a tough time finding something in my field. I told him about a couple prospects and then we moved on to other topics.

&gt;Then he comes back to it, and starts by saying sort of laughingly ""It's funny, since I've known you I've had so many jobs, I keep getting hired..."" (He's a part-time dishwasher in a restaurant.) I didn't like the direction it was taking so I started asking him about his current job.

&gt;He circled back and said ""I just worry about you. I worry that you'll run out of money and get evicted. Not what we'd be able to help you with money.""

&gt;I said ""I'm tired, so I'm going to bed. Talk to you next time.""

&gt;He was absolutely having a go at me and he can fuck right off with that.

It's still bothering me a bit.  It's creepy when someone goes out of their way to hurt you.  I haven't had any contact with him since.

I'm posting here because another angle on it is our toxic culture of work.  That's how you get people who believe even having one of the shittiest jobs around makes you superior to someone who has no job.  It's also how you get people who are so insecure that they need to punch ""down"".  This guy probably bullies the immigrant dishwashers at his job and similar.

So in addition to the toxicity of having to do jobs that are largely pointless to begin with, we also have to contend with petty status games.

Telling humans that they have no value by default is disgusting. People can try to make all the political/economic arguments they want against this simple truth, but at the end of the day all they prove is that humans have yet to create a system that is worth defending.

411,Receptionist at new job told my boss I was rude because I was trying to explain something to her,"Anyone have problems with people at work being hostile and trying to force polite fakeness on others? I've noticed that I don't do anything that would be out of the ordinary, barely interact with a person and they derail quickly. This receptionist kept saying ""we can't help you"" and I was saying ""I'm not asking for your help I'm asking for my boss to call me back"". She talked the same way I did. If something needs to be communicated, why derail communication and understanding because it sounds ""rude"" ?  
I don't care about gossip, drama or people's opinions of me at all. What I am sick of is people actually trying to cause me harm and ruin my life over nothing. They also often create problems out of nothing I notice. Polite manipulation is the worst at office jobs as well, now that I have worked both that and a variety of labor jobs. I can't do the hard labor and people think I'm lazy when I worked as hard as I possibly could to do it right. Now this is the first job I've got in economic empowerment working with adults in transitional housing, dual-diagnosis.   


But if my job is gonna constantly be threatened and I can't communicate without hostility, I can't help the people I want to help. I attained my self-determination as a teenager from an abusive household. It was actually profound. I survived many toxic jobs because at least they PAID me while my abusive family did not. And I got to leave, eventually I lifted myself beyond it. But it's clear there are people everywhere who take out their suffering on others and are too hooked by revenge. It is especially damaging at the workplace and it keeps us disempowered. I'm not going to be part of the problem.

So, I am being forced to wake up early in the morning, 7:30 to do the same tasks, again and again and again until I do it for four more years, and then I get a lot of debt in my back, become a wageslave to feed the rich, and die... sounds pretty fun right?\\s. But now seriously, I am being forced to do mindless repetitive tasks with no value on the real world (contrary to popular belief) until I become a wageslave, and die, while millions, if not *billions* of people, children and teenagers are suffering with murder, evil, death, depression, mental illness, schizophrenia, war crimes, hate, racism, death and... etc. I could write a damn book about what´s wrong with this world!

We are forced to deal with asshole teachers, bullies, forced to do tests that don´t have anything to do with ACTUAL effort in life, like finding your passion, paying bills, mental health, cleaning, cooking food, murdering your asshole boss, mortgage and other things, and they *still* wonder why our youth doesn´t end up right?

They make a lot of lectures about depression, suicide prevention, bullying... BUT THEY NEVER SEEM TO ACTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEM! All they do is just talk about how ""oh talk to your teacher"", but they don´t do anything. They talk about how depression must be taken care of but they don´t know that the school environment, w*ay too much*homework, climate change, and the e*ntire* system overall is the cause for it! They also forcefully send suicidal high school, middle school and even elementary school students to psych wards, and put a bunch of bills on their family, because hey let´s help suicidal people by giving them MORE reasons to kill themselves right buddy?\\s.

&amp;#x200B;

  

But you know what´s *really* wrong about this? The way they sell it as a good thing! They say that you need the school system to become good in life... wich is a lie! I have a kid in my class wich pretty much doesn´t pay attention to class and just draws in his notebook, and his drawings are... pretty good actually. I think it would be HILARIOUS if he ended up being a famour artist while the other people that were the ""nice students"" ended up being wageslaves that drank down lots of alcohol in order to cope with the regret of their degree. Oh the irony! Just wait about the crushing college bills!

Talking about bills, college is being pushed so much on today´s youth because universities need more money. The amount of crippling debt that always tortures you while you work at your 12 hours job for 1 cent an hour is to give more money to the rich, and universities. This is why capitalism is in its *late stage,* and shall collapse soon... Wich I don´t really see as an problem really.

But people still send their children towards this? They still send children towards this world, that they will know will not get any better soon? How could someone, in their right mind, think that having kids in this world is worth it? It´s insane! I still will not get over this insane, corrupt system, that is brainwashing more and more people worldwide, all for their profit!

445,Having trouble coming to terms with reality,"I'm approaching my final year of college. I'm working at a coffee shop while I hang around my home town, enjoy the summer, make the most of my days off. I'm buying a lot of books at library book sales, thinking a weekly book table when I'm back in the city for school mighy be a fun way to make some cash. Since I've been home I have been having lots of conversations related to work already this summer. Plenty of questions about my plans for graduation, my financially insecure and anxious parents reminding me every few days that they can't help me out with money and pleading with me to consider the long-term implications of taking on credit card debt, etc. 

I'm starting to think my personality and the pace I'm most comfortable living my life at is simply incompatible with the material demands of capitalism and a work culture that values efficiency and mindless dedication above all else. I'm sick of hearing about jobs, internships, opportunities from well meaning family members and friends when I'm quite confident that the important things in life have nothing to do with productivity or work, and are in fact often looked at either as trivial or taken for granted. Time spent with family, spent reading and thinking, spent alone, this time is regarded as excessive, you'll be lucky to carve it out of the demands of working life. 

I'm not naive - I'm from a low income family, I've been working since I was a young teenager, I've watched my family struggle throughout my life. I know work is ultimately necessary to some extent, and perhaps I should be more grateful for the chance to attend college and earn better paid white collar positions, but I can't stomach the thought that this is what life has led me to. Summer jobs, work-study jobs, jobs I took with a secret expiration date only I knew, these were frustrating at times, it has been difficult to keep a straight face and focus through the utterly pointless bullshit that accompanies menial labor... But I'm staring the rest of my life in the face now and I'm feeling pretty awful about it, quite honestly. I don't see the point in dedicating 40+ hours of the weeks I have left on earth to create profit for someone else. It pains me to imagine all the things I won't have the time or energy to pursue. I've seen it happen to everyone I know, I'm sure I will not be an exception. I just want to figure out a way to opt out. Subsistence farming and part time work maybe?

If they were then I was going to try to go to work today anyway despite my stomach giving me hell.

475,"On fire ""drills"" and one whole hour of sweet, sweet silence: a call center story","I might have a 6-figure paying role and a fancy  (yet meaningless) title in a big-tech giant now, but once upon a time I worked in a call center.

I moved here with a useless degree and no real relevant work experience. Years ago, when I first started in IT, I got an entry-level job in a call center for an internet service provider. It was the easiest gig to get, probably due to the scary-high turnover rate these places have. 

A friend warned me: *""call centers are only one rank above living on Centrelink (my country's unemployment payments - the lowest of the low)""*. She said her call center was full of people shooting heroin on lunch breaks, and then selling cable TV plans on the phone to elderly people who couldn't figure out how to order them through a browser. But I tried everything, 7Eleven cashier, supermarket jobs, admin, receptionist - but that's the only job I could get.

Back then I had hope though. I got lucky and managed to climb up the ranks of the technical ladder on the very last chance to do so. A couple of months after  I got promoted, the entire call center got offshored to a cheaper third-world country. The vague hope that if I survive this, I'd have a career in IT - that's what kept me going. 

\*\*\*

**If there's anything call center people love is FIRE DRILLS**. Fire drills are great, because they get your to leave your seat and not take calls, for about an hour, till the building is evacuated in an organized fashion. Health and safety regulations compelled us to do them regularly, and it was never made public  in advance, so it was a pleasant surprise: an entire hour of freedom. 

Whenever there isn't a fire drill, you're supposed to be on the phone. There are always calls coming in and there is 0 downtime. The ""break"" you get between calls was 60 seconds, so you were supposed to document the call on the company's systems DURING, when you were supposed to listen to the customer. They meter the exact amount of time you spend on the phone, and if you idle for more than 10% of the time, a ""performance improvement plan"" (PIP) is quick to come. So yeah, a gulag, only with phones except hoes. 

There was a lunch break and two 10 minute break, but they were booked for exact times. If you got stuck on a call with a demanding customer, and couldn't get off - you'd miss your break, and you wouldn't get another one. My workaround was to get the customer to hold the line while I ""go consult with an expert"", or ""test their password on our test-bench"" - but in reality I'd make coffee or go to the bathroom, with them waiting on the phone.

We did all kinds of stuff like that to survive. One time, out of stress, I deleted a feedback survey off the customer's inbox, knowing he was upset and is likely to 'ding' me with a 1/10 score. **I never got caught, but I would have been fired instantly if they did.** The guy who sat next to me got fired for making outbound calls to his mobile phone, so his corporate phone would be busy and customer calls won't flow in. He just sat there, taking long breaks like that, in utter, blissful silence.

\*\*\*

At some point, myself and a few colleagues noticed that the frequency of these fire drills has increased. The alarm was sound and we had to leave the building twice in one week. This gave us some time to stand and chat in the company's parking lot. We asked around, and were told the truth: these weren't drills.

The alarm was really triggered by the smoke detectors. Yet, no smoke was ever seen, and the building was not at all on fire. Nobody was sure as to why it was happening. The company had to pay a heavy fine for a false callout to the fire department every time this happened. 

**These false fire alarm events turned into mini company-picnics.** The entire hour was marked as an ""exception"" in our calendars, so it won't affect our metrics. We got to sit on the lawn across the street, talk to our coworkers, get to know them. Have a proper, relaxed snack. In order for the phones to be always manned, they had our breaks booked on different times, so we rarely got to sit and talk to one another.

\*\*\*

One day, the cause for the fire alarms was revealed: someone from the other team, a call center agent like me, found a smoke detector in a hidden spot where the security cameras did not reach, and lit a cigarette next to it, to trigger the alarm. He wasn't even a smoker: he bought this little freedom-kit, a pack of cigs and a lighter, for the sole purpose of stealing one-hour of sweet, sweet silence.

He got fired, of course. 

These blessed fire ""drills"" stopped altogether, unfortunately.

I met him on the train a few weeks later, and dared to ask, ""hey man, what were you thinking?""

He shrugged casually, and said a sentence that goes with me to this day: **""when you're in a call center, you'd rather go clean the toilets than take another single call"".**

I think I get it now, in a way. At least the person cleaning the toilets is making a visible, small-yet-meaningful contribution to society, whereas call center work is a complete waste of time for everyone involved, a display of fake-niceties and customer ""care"".

I don't know where he is now. I hope for him that he's unemployed.",False,cc3omc,Moonpixx,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cc3omc/on_fire_drills_and_one_whole_hour_of_sweet_sweet/,11,26

I’m a banquet server and work about 30 to 45 hours a week. My weeks can be jammed and sometimes I can work 15 hours Saturday and Sunday. I have anxiety and depression so the physical exhaustion from the job makes me more tired and depressed. It’s also a ridiculous amount of pressure and mental work. I live a very relaxed (not want any stress kinda of life) with my mental issues I can only take so much without crying and breaking down to degrees where I can end up in a mental hospital. I live alone with my sister and we struggle to live happy lives due to bills and living in New Jersey. I cry mostly because I hate working but also because it’s the only job I can have right now in my life due to other reasons. I’m tired and sad, and sick of having no money and joy being able to sage for anything because it all goes to bills anyway! I’m extremely sad today. I am ubering to work since I don’t have a car and just wanna send the uber back home and cry in bed all night. But then I won’t have job because I’ll get fired for a no show.

484,Working for Myself At Last,"There's great joy in doing what I want to do, when I want to do it. Although I am still poor, I have been enjoying developing a video game and writing books for money. I can stop myself in the middle and eat watermelon. I don't have to wear pants. I enjoy video conferencing with my publisher. I can sleep as much as I want, when I want. I can take walks, or do something else. As long as the work gets done, that's what is important.

Reflecting on this has only confirmed what I already knew: when human beings get to use their effort and exertion how they choose, they are happy. When they don't have a choice, they are unhappy. I don't know that I'm looking forward to going back to a normal job at some point this year...not even sure how I would get there in the first place.

So here I am alone in a room on my phone. Now there is a camera, but he said there wasn't because things went missing before. So I guess it doesn't work?

I don't think anyone cares what I do though, it's not like I do anything time sensitive. I have no degree and it's minimum wage.

497,My modern life of misery,"I work from 7:00 am-3:00 pm in an office. Here's what my average day looks like:

&amp;#x200B;

I wake up at 5:45 with a mere 30 minutes to get ready. Brush teeth, wash face, use blepharitis [eye](https://eye.id)lid scrubs, get dressed, pack my stuff and leave at lightning speed. Then, I drive to work through rush hour traffic despite leaving so early as I eat my breakfast on the go, wishing a massive vehicle would hit me just so that I could be in the hospital for some time rather than in this fucking office. 

&amp;#x200B;

I arrive. I do soul-crushing, repetitive, robotic tasks through the entire day. I take a 30 minute lunch break at my desk and that’s just enough time to eat, then I get back to work. My manager occasionally sneaks up to me from behind my desk to ensure I'm being productive, she has very swift foot steps.

&amp;#x200B;

I get off at 3:00 and inch through traffic with serious road rage to get home despite leaving so early. Again, I wish I could just suffer some auto injury to be hospitalized for a few weeks, away from work. Then, I get home. 

&amp;#x200B;

I change clothes and immediately go to the gym. I take 1.5-2 hours to finish my workout because of the excess volume of people occupying every other machine I need. Chest flies? 7 minute wait, buddy. Ask him if I can work in? There are already three guys rotating on the machine. I constantly check the time on my phone, calculating “I have X hours and X minutes to to Y,  Y, and Y before I have to sleep to recharge for my slave labor shift.” 

&amp;#x200B;

I leave the gym and either buy fast casual dinner or make dinner at home. I do the dishes, laundry, clean, take out trash, go grocery shopping, or whatever else needs to be done. Whatever I can do in order to ensure my weekend actually involves “free time” rather than than life administration tasks, which are also work. I then prepare lunch and breakfast for my slave labor shift the next day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I shower, do my health/hygiene routine. The clock is always ticking, I’m racing from one thing to the next. Tick tock, tick tock. The list of things to do is endless with such a limited amount of time. If I’m lucky I squeeze in one episode of a Netflix series before going to bed, but this almost always comes at the cost of sleep deprivation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I go to bed with 7 hours to sleep and struggle to fall asleep because of all the stress and dreading the idea repeating this routine the next day. Repeat 4 more days. I am sick this whole time, with a perpetual sinus infection I can’t shake due to stress compromising my immune system. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, the weekend comes around. I oversleep until 11 or 12 (sometimes even 1) due to over-exhaustion from my job. Half my day is wasted. I’m tired. I’m drained. I’m highly irritable, the small things get to me - that long traffic light, those kids blocking my way, that lag on my iPhone. I can’t stop thinking about that project back at work. Also, I didn’t get around to Y errands during the week so I have to do that now.

&amp;#x200B;

At night, I relax a bit and write a song that I won’t even have time to record. It goes into my never-ending archive of beautiful songs I’ve written that I don’t have the time, energy, or motivation to record because my soul has been sucked dry. Vacation? As I wrote, my soul has been sucked dry. So my vacations are ""stay-cations"" used to rest and heal from the mental exhaustion that has accumulated.

&amp;#x200B;

On Sunday, I spend the entire day anxious about the work week to come. I feel a flaming resentment toward this system, but I am powerless. All my peers around me dismiss me as lazy and entitled if I dare speak a word against their sacred system. They boast about how they are overworked and how much they enjoy it. They shun me if a dare forsake their masters’ system. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is modern life. This is my life. And there is not a thing I can do about it at the moment. Yeah, maybe I could find a slightly less soul-crushing job. Yeah, maybe I could see a therapist to learn “coping strategies.” But the fact is, that’s like putting a piece of scotch-tape on severe structural housing damage. You need to fix the house to make for actual change. 

&amp;#x200B;

Society, and the government, will never fix the house that is our labor system. Individuals are brainwashed to the point of no return, ardently defending their masters. There is no individualism. The US is one massive case of groupthink. It’s like a cult. The corporations are thrilled that their slaves are not only serving to please their every need, but doing so eagerly.

&amp;#x200B;

All I can do for now is save aggressively and ultimately try to build a tiny house in one of the few freedom-friendly states that actually allow that. It’s illegal mostly everywhere. Living your life the way you want is criminal activity, right? Hopefully I won’t kill my self before then.

&amp;#x200B;

508,I just can't manage this,"I work a typical 8-5 office job and it's slowly killing me. I'm trying to live healthier but its exhausting. Always having to buy fresh groceries costs more than $1 frozen pizzas and the fact that WE have to spend hours from our already small weekends just to meal prep for the whole week, instead of our rich companies helping us with things like fruit salads or nuts, and not tons of cheap snacks or junk food. 

Our obsession with time is concerning. Earth is 4,5 billions of years old and the average human has a life expectancy of 80yo. We are not even 2% of this timeline yet we act like we're 200%. You have to clock in on specific times, not a minute more. Your breaks are exactly 60min, you have to work 8 hours even if 6 of them are empty sitting around. If you don't follow these rules, you lose your job and risk being homeless. I'm not saying ""lets abolish time!!"" but why is it taken that ridiculously serious?!

It's so clear that we live in a disturbed world. Sure, you could say ""find a job you like blah blah"" but that doesn't erase the fact, that theres still millions of people working minimum wage, medical bills having ABSURD prices, increasing suicide rates, I could name more but it's obvious. 

I struggle to find happiness, I have no time for emotions or spiritual growth. Work has taken over my life like a lethal parasite or maybe I'm just a weak human being. My ideology has changed to anti consumerism &amp; anti natalism so I'm gonna start donating money, to give someone else in need a chance of a better life (If you know any helpful sites, let me know). Realising that anti natalism was the right way for me, made me sad since my life goal, ever since I can think, was to have a family but it's for the better. Kids don't deserve to be fooled into having a great life just to end up in a brutal cycle of deadly capitalism, war &amp; meaningless competiton. I wasn't asked to be born but now I have to be a part of this since I have to help me and my family to survive. I want our voices to be heard by others but I have no idea where to start.

509,Modern day jobs = slavery,"Our society forces people to exchange time/labor for income. This is even lauded as good. Consider ""an honest day's work for an honest wage."" Also consider, that people take huge amounts of pride in what they do, and this typically comprises a major element of a person's identity. Notice how if someone has a high paying job, they brag about their title or circumstances. The opposite is also true, someone is ashamed often to admit that they work in a low skill position. 

&amp;#x200B;

We use the income we obtain from selling our time/labor in order to obtain necessities for existence. This is often framed as ""freedom,"" meaning you choose what you eat or where you live. The opposite is actually true. If you choose not to go to work, you cannot obtain the resources you need by proxy, because you lose your income. This assumes you are not passively generating income and you don't have a huge pile of cash or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

Slavery is when you are forced to do something against your will and you are punished when you opt out of doing whatever it is. The punishment in this case comes from losing access to resources. A couple of ways to push back on this is to argue that if someone enjoys their job, they cannot be a slave because they are not doing anything against their will. There are probably instances where that is true, however, the fact that before any other consideration is engaged in, you must calculate income due to resource necessity, is delimiting to freedom. So when someone chooses to become a lawyer because of the income they can earn, they are by definition, exchanging their freedom for income. Maybe they really wanted to spend their life researching something, but because of the way our economic system prioritizes certain activity through compensation variation, causes them to do something all other things being equal, they may not have done.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course this brings up the question of how would people gain resources otherwise. Is this not the best set of circumstances that we currently know of? This is a good question, and I will not go in to it in this post, because that brings up many different subjects.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

1. Labor/time is exchanged for money
2. Money is required to obtain resources
3. Unless you just want to die, you are driven to obtain resources
4. Choosing not to exchange your labor/time for money results in punishment, by not having access to resources
5. Being punished for not doing something you do not want to do is a form of coercion
6. Being coerced to work is no different than slavery

513,Money and/or a career is required to be part of society,"You're either born into money or you work your ass off for it, that's the story we've all been told. There is another option that many people don't like to mention though, for fear of hurting your friends and loved ones, and that is to remove yourself from the equation. I've worked the last 7 years in Software Development, building a little career for myself, I have a wife, a dog, and the makings of what looks like a 'happy' life, but I've recently found myself unemployed as of this March. Since that time I have searched and literally chased after the jobs I thought I could excel at, for companies that I admired and knew my skills would be useful with. I must have went wrong somewhere because those last 7 years have meant nothing in the eyes of the people who glanced over my resume. I've experienced rejection after rejection from the lowest IT work I could find, to the most suitable job for my skills, i'm a polyglot, and although not the absolute BEST at one language, I'm full stack and I certainly know well more than one and have a specialty for 3D graphics.. None of this matters though.  


I've come to accept this reality, and recently began applying for unskilled labor, retail, and food positions. Those positions scoff at my career resume because I must be overqualified right? I'm the only one showing up to these interviews in a three-piece suit, I have had managers say to my face that they won't hire me because they already assume I won't take their job seriously if I'm getting paid $10/hour. I try my best to wear a happy face and let them know I'm OK with minimum wage, it's all I can get right now. At this point I'm finding it hard to care about living, my wife hates me for losing my job, my parents think I'm lazy (""Just hit the bricks, it's time to man up""), my friends will think i'm a loser once they know i'm working in these kind of jobs after being a Software developer for 7 years, where did my worth go?  


The only thing I have left is my self-worth, I know I'm good, I know what I deserve, but that doesn't get you where you want to be - Am I a victim of circumstance? I don't worry anymore because I know there is another option I haven't been considering: Remove myself from the equation. When society doesn't want you, you don't have to be apart of it, you can remove yourself from living in this morbid reality.   


Thanks for reading and if you're like me, just know that suicide is always an option no matter how bad things get. Your life shouldn't be subjected to depression like this, and when people in your life (AND RANDOM STRANGERS) try to convince you not to kill yourself, then remember that you are living FOR YOU and that your pain is meaningful- people trying to convince you otherwise are trying to continue that pain.  


The only thing I've worried about today is who I will let take care of my dog after i'm gone and it hurts me to know he will miss me, it just doesn't outweigh the pain I already feel for myself. I've contemplated a myriad of ways to commit suicide and decided upon a painless one, albeit gruesome. Death by train, laying your neck over a track at night, let it ride over you, it will be instant and painless. I'm not sorry for whoever witnesses it or has to clean it up because this is the morbid reality we live in and it's time to accept it.",False,c8fttm,wdkkmpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/c8fttm/money_andor_a_career_is_required_to_be_part_of/,32,51

520,"Thinking of selling house, getting off grid and quitting job","Sorry if this is a bit of a rant/ramble.  Just wanna get this off my chest because it is all-consuming.

&amp;#x200B;

I bought a house in 2010.  It was a buyer's market then and the banks offered first time home buyers incentives, so I guess I was lucky in that regard. Bought it for $181,000 and I've chipped away at it to bring it down to roughly $112,000 still owing.  It's going to take me another 10+ years to pay it off in full and there have been so many other financial burdens and things that have popped up during that time frame.  I've never been able to get ahead of it all.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last couple of years, I've been enamoured with the idea of off-grid, self-sustaining, tiny home living.  I want to sell my house, buy a used coach RV or build a tiny home, purchase land, a couple of acres maybe, preferably with lots of trees, start growing crops, get everything off-grid and reduce my cost of living so that even a minimum wage, part-time job could easily cover the cost of living and other expenses.  However, everyone around me, including my wife, is telling me that it's unrealistic.  I don't see why.  I can sell my house right now and the way the market is and with my location, I'd make around $200,000 easily.  If I buy the land outright, the home outright, and have little or no utility bills, then what's the perceived problem(s)?

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the idea of slaving for 45 years for a soulless, psychopathic corporation that can dangle your livelihood over your head and terminate you at any time, for any reason, while squirreling away whatever money you can manage until you're a senior citizen, is really ingrained into our psyches.  It's playing it safe, it's stability.  But I don't think it's playing it safe or stable at all.  Until recently, my wife and I worked together at a small company.  We both put in 8 and 9 years, respectively, of our lives there.  However, with a change in ownership and management, the place became a living hell - the kind of place where the new manager would walk around watching over your shoulder while you worked, with a ""time to lean, time to clean - there's no down time"" mentality.  This place isn't an assembly line, there isn't always work to do and that was always one of the ""perks"" of the job.  Anyway, the place became unbearable, I stopped caring, I even started becoming hostile towards management.  I quit and went to work for another company in the same field.  As a result, they fired my wife.  She did care, she worked hard, she contributed to that company and they eliminated her without a care, for a petty reason.  How are we supposed to continue paying for a house and car and bills and our pets when all of these things were acquired based on us both working full-time jobs at the wages that the company provided?

&amp;#x200B;

Things are better at the new company I'm with, but I'm slowly losing my mind and spirit and will to live regardless.  I'm still a slave.  I think about offing myself quite often, usually while I'm imprisoned at work.  That's not healthy.  ***THAT'S what's not realistic***.  I've been working since I was 17, full-time since 19 and I'm 36 now.  I can't do this for another 30 - 40 goddamn years until retirement and quite frankly ***I don't want to nor should I have to***.  Who wants to slave away until they're too old and broken to do or enjoy anything?

&amp;#x200B;

I want to take the risk, take the leap and get the fuck out of this system and society as much as is possible.  I don't care how hard I have to work, how unstable it could be, I have to try.

I dealt with pretty severe workplace bullying on two different jobs and trust me I did everything I knew how to, to fight it, stop it, document it and all that. But when my health got too poor as a result of the bullying I simply packed up my personal belongings, turned in my badge quietly to the facilities guy with no warning and walked off the job and never returned. I did send email to the HR letting them know that for health reasons caused by a hostile work environment I was resigning effective immediately and that I was “sorry for any inconvenience but had no other choice”. From a health standpoint this was true. Recognize that the power to walk away at any time is the only real power you have as an employee if you can’t afford a lawyer. 

The real power move is to have absenteeism issues on purpose for health reasons (anytime you feel too poorly to go due to the abusive environment, just don’t go), until they fire you for maximum damage to their productivity while you continue to get maximum pay. Also if you get fired, you can apply for unemployment benefits whereas if you resign, I don’t think you can qualify. 

Fuck abusive employers who allow employees to be bullied. I like to shaft them best I can by leaving them unprepared for an entire workload suddenly going undone (with nobody to cover it) if I can. It typically also gives them an attitude adjustment when they realize that I was quietly doing decent work and keeping things running without recognition and because of that I’ve not had my references ever be affected. 

I’ve never had any issues getting another job because of this either. It happens more than you think and I think walk-offs from abusive jobs should happen as much as possible in fact. We should all walk off abusive jobs with no notice. It apparently costs thousands mimimim to recruit, hire and train a new employee for many companies.

583,"[Rant] You know those comments here that recommend on the Fi/RE movement, as an escape route from the hell that is full-time work? Here is what they're neglecting to tell you","(I am not an expert. I'm the exact opposite, actually. Please don't rely on this and go see a professional before making any decisions).

Whenever someone starts a thread here and shares the frustrations of the modern imprisonment system called ""work"", there's usually at least 1 comment that says *""look into the FI/RE movement"".*

**Well, I finally did.** 

I had to: my savings started amounting to a decent enough amount of money, so that I had to start thinking about it. I'm not a big spender type - just minor conveniences here and there, to take solace in the fact I'm wasting my life away in a boring office role. 

I've been saving \~50% of my take-home pay easily, and the interest I get for a savings account at the bank is pathetic - about 1%, less than the rise in the cost of life. A financial advisor warned me that by letting the money just sit there, it effectively depreciates as cost of life grows. To put it simply, I'm losing money by stalling.

**The idea of FI/RE is that every dollar you don't-spend matters, thanks to compound interest.** There are compound interest calculators online, that show you, for example, that $10,000 today, with a standard interest of 5%, would equate to $16,500 in a decade. Some investors can supposedly get more than the basic %5-6, if they play their cards right, perform research etc.

**But where does the 5%-or-higher interest come from exactly?** 

Your bank is not likely to pay you that much for your savings account. Here, the larger baks pay a LOT less.

Some smaller banks I found, which may be somewhat risky, pay as much as %3.5, which is also somewhat low (and perhaps a bit riskier - I've seen one bank collapse in my days as a teenager).

Then, what is considered a 'safe investment', which also pays the a significant enough interest to allow one to dream of early retirement?

\*\*\*

The answer most FI/RE types quote is **ETFs**.

I'm not an expert, but from what I read - an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund, traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. Instead of picking a stock one by one, investors can pick a fund that tracks multiple companies at once. The popular ones, which are considered ""safe"" (and often have lower management fees) track the performance of financial market indexes. You don't have to be an expert, and you don't have to hire professionals to manage your investments, which would offset all the profit if you're just an average Joe with a few grands.

Here in Australia, there are a few that track the top 200-300 ASX (Australian Stock Exchange) companies. Investors that rather put their money in the global market often choose ETFs that track Standard &amp; Poor's index (S&amp;P 500).

 Those are just two examples, and there are many other options out there - but those are very common suggestions to people who have no financial background, can't manage the money by themselves, are risk averse etc.

And the problem?

**Once you check which companies those funds track exactly, you see what exactly you're investing in. From my perspective, they're the axis of evil. You're essentially betting on companies that do bad things.**

Here are some examples from the list of companies in the S&amp;P 500 index:

1. **Accenture** \- an IT company that hires bad-yet-cheap software developers in countries like India, as contractors; which in turn allows other companies to offshore their IT services and fire staff. I've seen that before.
2. **Activision Blizzard** \- we've had a few links on this sub around their latest shenanigans. Around Christmas, they fired 800 employees, to make up for its losses - while their CEO was paid 28 million for his supposedly-stellar performance.
3. **Alphabet Class A and C** \- those are the guys that gather obscene amount of information on us all, track our every online move, in order to brainwash us with ads and perpetuate consumerism. 
4. **Amazon** \- their founder is the richest man on the planet, yet Bernie Sanders had to win a long battle in order to convince him to pay his warehouse staff $15 an hour. In U.K. an investigative journalist revealed that picker-packers in Amazon warehouses, whose every move are under constant surveillance lest they slack a little on the clock, pee in BOTTLES to save time and keep their metrics up.
5. **Apple** \- produces iPhones in Foxconn factories in China, where staff are paid very little and have a high suicide rate. 

That's just the letter A. The list is FULL of corporations that are famous for doing **nasty things for profit**.

Here are some more examples, after I scrolled down the whole thing:

* **Phrama companies** that pushed opioids and hid the fact they're addictive from the public.
* **Oil companies**. I spotted multiple fossil fuel names.
* **Health care** providers in U.S., who lobby hard against public health care, inflate the cost of health services and fight every patient's claim.
* Some of the **banks and financial institutes** that caused the GFC are in the list. The guys who got bailed out by the U.S. government, then took the bailout money and paid HUGE bonuses to their execs. 

\*\*\*

Let's assume you're just about the money, and don't have a conscience. Not judging.

You have to do what you can to survive in a capitalist economy, and you can't afford to reject the safest path to early retirement.

But whose to say these companies are going to not just last, but grow, in 10, 20, 30 years? Especially the petroleum names in the list. Whose to say the banking system and the U.S. health care system will be the same by then? 

I almost hope it won't. **In order to be optimistic about the success of your investment, you have to be quite pessimistic about the direction that the world is heading to**, and assume that our society won't improve; that we won't kick the bad, destructive habit of fossil fuel. Even Amazon's Bezos recently held a presentation about manning Mars; since he thinks we'll consume the resources here eventually, because we don't want to turn to ""rationing"" (his bleak interpretation on the degrowth movement, perhaps).

There are some alternatives, and you can probably build an ""ethical"" investment portfolio and choose less-horrible companies or indexes etc. The management fee will be far higher, and it's considered a less-safe path. Most investors don't. I see the same 3-letter acronyms on FI/RE forums, the same funds people discuss. 

And they're all cancer. Lucrative cancer, at least for the time being. 

\*\*\*

I'm still doing it, don't get me wrong. Billy Corgan said, ""despite of my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage"". If that's my ticket out of work, I can't afford to be ethical. 

I would have bought real estate instead, but I don't have enough money to buy a tiny studio within less than an hour of my workplace (one of the axis-of-evil companies in the S&amp;P 500 index, btw). I don't think I never will, lest I sink in debt and work for 30 years. And the majority of the population here earns less than me.

I guess I'm just venting here. But the next time someone posts that if you skip that one cappuccino or Spotify subscription, I'd be able to retire early - please be aware that they're not telling you the whole story. They're not telling you that you'd have to embrace a sickly capitalistic system, and hope for the best.

590,"I just learned how unimportant I am to workers compensation insurance, and others.","I hope this fits in this sub.  It was either going here, or r/latestagecapitalism.

It was Friday of last week, and I was looking forward to finishing up my lab work early.  One of my many responsibilities at the asphalt emulsions plant is to test our products to ensure they meet the states' specifications in which they are used.  I had just finished one round of tests, and was getting set to do another, and while replacing a cork, I accidentally shattered a glass pipe into my right (dominant) hand.  It was 0900, and after I controlled the bleeding, my supervisor took me to the nearest hospital.  Long story short, I was at the hospital until 14:00 while the ER doc tried his damnedest to remove all the glass from my hand, but was unsuccessful.  He recommended I follow up with a hand specialist on Monday (today) to remove the rest of the glass of need be.

This is where I made my first mistake: I didn't demand my employer to get my worker's comp claim started right away.  Our day ends at 3:30, and it being a Friday, everyone at a desk wanted out early.  I was told by my manager that our corporate office would get the claim started on Monday.  I called the recommended hand specialist, and they told me without a workers comp claim, they couldn't even schedule me for an appointment. Fuck.  I went the whole weekend worried about what kind of damage could be going on in my hand with that glass still in there.

Now it's Monday morning, when I made my second mistake: I went back to work.  My manager has been a family friend (him and my dad go way back), so originally he seemed pretty understanding, telling me to come in Monday just to get the paperwork sorted out.  Well, I came in, and started the paperwork, and while I was waiting for our HR person to contact our worker's comp insurance agency, my manager decided he didn't want me sitting around doing nothing, so he put me to work.  I should mention that the ER doc told me I could still use my right hand, but I should refrain from gripping anything tightly.  So I tried to do my work left handed.  It was a pain, but I managed to get another round of tests done.

Finally, our HR person gets me in touch with an insurance agent, with whom I get my claim number from and other insurance info.  Now I get to work getting my prescriptions and setting up my specialists appointment.  It was roughly 09:30.  I get through with the hand specialist's receptionist on the phone, who tells me she needs to get in contact with my insurance agent before she can confirm the appointment.  I get the same deal from the pharmacy when dropping off my scripts.  Hours go by and neither calls me back. I get worried and call my agent, and it goes to voicemail.
