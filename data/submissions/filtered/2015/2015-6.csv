0,Homo Faber or Homo Ludens?,if we want to supersede the notion of productivism  and this seems essential to free our imagination from the deadbolt culture of scarcity and sacrifice  then maybe we need to explore the notion of homo ludens as a pivotal concept  httprighttobelazycomblog201506homofaberorhomeludens,3bln3w
1,Reworking the antiwork subreddit! (User feedback appreciated!),so user waldyrious and i have been going back and forth for a little over a few weeks very leisurely dont worry p and were trying to come up with a better sidebar for this forum and in general wed like to see the forum improved  tldr we want this subreddit to have a great sidebar thatll include the best selections of antiwork stuff be nice looking and anything else you guys think should be in there  we also want to work on a wiki and a faq built into it i may incorporate some of the questions that i got in my ama thread from a few months ago but if you think of any yourself dont hesitate to add them  and although as an anarchist i dont agree with the idea of a basic income thats a topic for another thread i like how the sidebar for rbasicincome looks a lot so maybe something modeled read not an exact copy per se of that  im very new to reddit and dont often go to other subreddits so if you know of other places that have awesome sidebars feel free to mention it  the wiki would also be opensource and always open to modifications if folks are abusive or misleading stuff gets on there it may be deleted by yours truly or another mod or and this is much more likely will be brought up to the individual who did the edit first to see whats what hope that sounds fair,39z2a2
