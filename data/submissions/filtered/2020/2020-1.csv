9,Being 23 and in an Office Sucks,i just need to rant   i work at a small firm as an office manager temp and i think it has crushed me  hopefully won't be here through the next year  but who knows  since it's so small  i see my bosses credit card statements and the invoices form the two other independent contractors that work as a financial director and analyst  they all have a lot more money than me  that  in and of itself  is not the problem  my boss is constantly working  the financial director is constantly working  whatever   the fucking analyst  who by the way is already well known to be completely socially inept  crashed the computer the firm got him and is going to be given a new one  now you may be thinking  oh he just works that hard at his job  fucking no  he runs starcraft and shit on his work computer  this computer  that cost thousands of dollars  that he's had for a year  is breaking down because he's a dumb ass who made as much as i make in a year as his bonus  and to top that off  he's such a greedy fucker that we can't even get snacks for the office anymore because he steals them and takes them home and we go through them way to fast  he constantly asks for them so i don't know if he's just too stupid to put it together that we don't get them anymore because of him or if he really just doesn't care  and as i'm listening to a conference call saying they are waiting on files from him  i walk in on him taking a fucking nap in the back of the office  he makes at lease 5x more than me and is an incompetent  sexist  oblivious  condescending ass  his area of the office  i think  actually smells because it's such a mess and leaves coffee cups out constantly  i'm not his fucking assistant  really  i shouldn't be doing assistant work for anyone except the partners  but it's such a small office i can't say no   the financial director works hard  but she treats me like i'm an idiot  she is the most baby boomer of baby boomer people that refuses to call herself a baby boomer because at least she's smart enough to know what that connotation is  i literally heard her say the phrases  if it'll affect profits  they will not implement more environmentally friendly options  and  i would not sacrifice convenience for sustainability  and  billionaires being that rich gives me hope for myself  i'm a musician and was telling her about the evil practices towards composers discovery was trying to implement  they backed off btw  and she says to my face she's thinking of investing in them and that if discovery can get these horrible new contracts pushed through there's nothing wrong with what they were doing  i honestly thought all those things about baby boomers being so out of touch and only caring about profits and having no concern for the long term effects was exaggerated for memes  but it's all fucking true and i'm at a loss  and to top that all off  she thinks we're the same because she's been taking classes over at a music school in the city  while i've been playing and studying for 12 years  over half my life  but no  she knows exactly how the music industry should work and how to play amazingly because how could there be anything i know more about than her  it's just made me convinced people over 50 like that need to be phased out of the economy if we have any chance of surviving  they're so sure their way of doing things is the only possible way  but their way is what got us into the mess we're in today   i'm sick of being the catch all for work people don't want to do  i feel like my fucking brain is rotting away and not being used  i'm sick of being around people that are ok with the way things are  i'm sick of being around so many people who are so out of touch with the way things are  i'm sick of this job and i'm sick of feeling stuck in it because it pay  3 better an hour than anything else i can even find on the internet  i just want it to stop ,evabd4

28,A thought that occurred to me,so  a big talking point against life essentials  food  shelter  healthcare  clothing  etc  being considered human rights is  if people don t need to sell their labor to survive  society will collapse   but basic life essentials aren t the only things that cost money  i m willing to bet everyone in this sub has a hobby  or at least something they d like to have as a hobby if work wasn t so demanding  everyone would love to travel  or to learn  or to spend time with their loved ones  so if it was just  essentials are free  people would still work to afford things they don t technically  need  but that would make their lives happier   what would really change  though  is who holds the power  bosses wouldn t get to just treat their employees like dogshit anymore  because if they try  their employees aren t just going to think  well  this sucks  but without this job i ll starve  they ll speak up  or they ll quit   and competition for jobs wouldn t be so stiff  because instead of one person working long hours  it d probably be closer to a bunch of people working short shifts after all  if money is just for  nice to haves  instead of essentials  nobody is gonna work for eight solid hours five days a week   and i think that s why capitalists try to push the  we need to make people work to survive  narrative   i don t know where ubi or automation would fit into this  but i m also just word vomiting right now ,evrwe0
29,Getting in significant debt for medical school,i was wondering what people would do in my situation  i am 31 and currently going nowhere  i graduated with a physics degree in 2015  i got top grades but nothing has worked out  i've gotten close to getting on graduate schemes  including a 3 year training course in medical physics which would have been a very good job  but i got rejected   i applied to medicine in september for the third year in a row and have been offered an interview at one university  but there is a catch - i have to pay the tuition fees myself as i have been offered an interview on an unfunded undergraduate course   in the uk there are two pathways into medicine - graduate entry  funded 4 year accelerated courses - very competitive  and undergraduate entry  the standard 5 year course  undergraduate entry is not funded if you already hold a degree  so i will have to pay  36 000 -  9k a year for the first four years  the final year is funded  and i would also have to take out  3500 a year student loans for living costs   i already  owe   32 000 in student loans  so the living expenses will raise my debt to about  50 000  to pay the tuition fees i would have to take out a bank loan of some sort  totalling about  16 000  the figures are probably more than this as i doubt i can live on  3500 a year   i just don't know what to do  i could go to the interview  but it would be very hard if i got an offer and then had to turn it down   i still live at home and my parents are on my case all the time now  some family members told me to go into accounting  but i have no interest in that and know i would be depressed for the rest of my working life  i would rather work retail  am i being a brat here  my dad has a  work to live  attitude but i don't see the point  i would rather not exist  i've worked jobs i hated before  crap minimum wage jobs where i was treated like dirt  but i got through them because i knew it was temporary ,eupxy1

46,Co-worker asked to lie about harassment; car accident on company time,i have two jobs  yesterday  i found out from a co-worker that she had been sexually harassed at work  but our boss told her that she should be flattered and deny that the harassment happened  our boss is a woman so i feel like she should know better  but i guess not  anyway  i was shocked and furious    later at my second job  i was driving to visit a client and a truck rear-ended my small car  the other driver didn't have insurance  so it's up to the kindness of my insurance company  ha  ha  whether they will waive the  500 deductible for repairs  i asked my boss if the company would help at all with my car repairs  seeing as i was driving for them  she said probably not  but she would check with hr  sorry   people and culture  still waiting to hear from my own insurance company about what they'll do   i have to work that job for 30 hours to make  500  the situation makes me feel like an indentured servant  we're unionizing but still in the early stages   also deeply disturbed by the sexual harassment situation  i couldn't even tell my best friend about it because i thought it would be too triggering for her  i knew my boss could be mean  for some reason she's slightly nicer to me than to other people  maybe because i have called her out a few times  but this is a whole different level    these jobs are both nonprofits that talk a huge game about helping marginalized people  more proof  not like we needed any more  that something as elemental as helping people gets extremely fucked up when it's turned into paid employment ,ev85r2

53,From HATING Work to Millionaire in 2 Years,  i know this is a clickbaity title but i need to get your attention for this one  and i will make it as straight to the point as i can    1  you dont hate work    what you hate is  slaving away for minimum wage  doing meaningless tasks  not getting the recognition you deserve  getting told what to do from people that are not competent etc  the list goes on and on and i know that from experience   i myself hated my job for 6 years until finally my employer gave me a huge favor and fired me  now i am so grateful for what was at the time devastating to me  i knew i was not happy at the place but i didn't have the courage to leave  that decision was luckily took care of by a termination without notice   so now i'm finally  free  of the work i hated so much  free of all the gossip between coworkers  free of the shitty attitude of my boss   and i'm not gonna lie it was a huge weight off my shoulders  it felt great for a few weeks    after an initial period of relief i started to fall into a hole of meaningless day to day activities  days filled with constant pleasure seeking like  sleeping in everyday of the week  drinking with friends  watching youtube etc  what i didn't know at the time was that seeking instant gratification was the opposite if what makes life truly livable    2  you want to work   even more you need to work   you need to pick a challenging task  get after it and feel great about your accomplishment  if theres no real struggle in the beginning there is no real happiness in the end  nature built that into us  otherwise the human race would have never started to build shelter  invented tools and made it this far   back to my story  so i'm noch 2 months unemployed and i fail even worse compared to still having a job   because of all the freetime  or better  because of freetime being wasted    so i started picking up tasks i wanted to do for a long time  learning to play the ukulele  read books  working out  meditation  yoga etc  i tried a lot of things and the more different things i tried i learned what i enjoy and what i am good at  the amazing thing is that usually the things you enjoy you are good at and vice versa  so through reading a few biographies about steve jobs  elon musk  philip knight  richard branson i had the urge to try and see if a had what it takes to be an entrepreneur  just for the reason to take a difficult task and dedicate a few hours  everyday  to see how far i can come  the emphasize  is on  everyday    the crazy thing is that it never felt like work  it just felt like a puzzle or a game you try to complete  i enjoyed doing it everyday  it was not work  although from the outside it sure looked like it    3  you want purpose    what if your current work was meaningful  challenging  rewarding  diversified  respected etc  how would you feel about work   you sure would not be  antiwork  would you    so the problem is not work  the problem is that your work is not aligned with your core  with what you truly want to do in life  this can be being a teacher  nutritionist  personal trainer  marketeer  dog walker etc   it doesnt matter what it is  all what matters is that you find that thing  or things  you enjoy  since you enjoy it  you will be good at it and you will for sure find a way to use that activity to add value to other peoples life   they will be happy to pay for that activity    amp x200b    4  transform your negativity into positivity   how far has being negativ brought you in life  for me it took me straight to depression and unemployment  but you don't have to go all the way like it did  you can use the energy of all that negativity and let it fuel your dream   take all that hate  anger  feeling of injustice and put it towards trying out new things  thats all im asking   i don't expect you to be a superstar in the next activity your trying  nor do i want you to be demoralized after trying 1  or 20  activities you don't like   you only need one thing that you truly enjoy with all your core   you are set for life  you found your so called purpose    amp x200b    5  be grateful and dedicate 100   no matter how shitty your situation seems at this point  there are always things to be grateful for  even if its just that you are alive  breath  are able to experience this wonderful planet  i know this kind sound silly  but it's crucial to remain grateful   this will put you in a completely different state of mind  a state where your mind is fully positive  sees the solutions instead of the problems and is just fully committed to get you where you need to be     just trust the process of your inner being    amp x200b   to close to loop to my personal story  after being unemployed 3 years i never worked a single day  all i did was following my passion and purpose to deliver value as best as i could  this was not only beneficial for my financials  but even more important for my wellbeing  i don't care about the money i make as long as i can continue doing what i love  the money it just a side effect of you living up to your highest potential     amp x200b    and i know you have the potential to achieve everything you want    amp x200b    tl dr     find a job you enjoy doing  and you will never have to work a day in your life     mark twain   amp x200b   disclaimer   there is no catch  no self promotion  no newsletter  nothing   all i want for you is to reach your potential without wasting more of your precious time  if i can save one of you from the pain i experienced through the last 6 years then i reached my goal ,evl3zr

74,isn't it weird how people are afraid of machines taking jobs?,only a short while ago we dreamed of higher productivity  lower working hours  and less inequality    if industrialisation continues as it is then machines will soon replace many jobs and ramp up productivity with relatively lower cost in the long run   i hear a lot of people using this as a horror story of the future  that the machines are coming for us and will take our jobs and make us all starve  which is firstly unrealistic  as a capitalist society would collapse as soon as the consumers all die off  rich people cannot take money from themselves     it makes more sense then to assume that the advent of machines opens us up to not having to rely on a give and take society  that we have in effect come close to achieving that long sought after goal of leisure and creativity  if we establish renewable energy sources and place machines in control of our necessary faculties then we can feed everyone and allow those who once spent their days driving tractors to work on creating more and more advancements to those machines  or perhaps to the food themselves    jobs are only necessary because we need money to buy the things we need to survive  but place robots in charge of the unpleasant  repetitive  and unsafe jobs and there is no need to provide an incentive to work  people will do what they wish to do   success will be measured by progress  not profits  you pick up food at no cost to anyone  you find your place in society through your passion  you work together with all of humanity to make the world a better place  no robbery  no insurance fraud  just people working on the systems the protect us and provide for us  they will not turn on us  because they are an extension of ourselves    i do not have all the answers to what may or may not happen in the future  but it seems obvious to me that we should work towards mechanising the world  harnessing renewable energy  and helping others    i am but one person alone evaluating a culture of capitalism that seeks to become rich in the short term and benefit from the material wealth that it provides  we are afraid of losing our jobs  of being poor and starving  but if we could all lend a hand to each other and work together  we could achieve a free society of progress and passion    obviously  dont praise the employers that lay off millions of workers to replace them with machines  but work towards your government giving everyone the right and ability to exist  and make mechanisation both a possibility and a sustainable necessity  in order for us to transition from human driven labour to robot driven labour we have to make it possible for humans to be replaced  and that means sustainable services that help people gain upward momentum such as education  shelter  and food    your government may seem corrupt  but it works for the people  change the minds of those who fear a change in society and rally everyone together  this is a three step process  give people the ability to survive without jobs  remove the jobs and replace them with renewable energy powered machines  give people the resources they need for free and allow humans to reach their full potential    tl dr robots are the answer not the problem  your government and your employer is the problem   thanks for reading,ew3jti
75,Showing and knowing your worth,i always feel caught between my competitive drive at work and my perspective on labor management perspective    i always want to out-perform at work and typically will work well past my salaried hours  even working through lunch  this has helped me a lot for promotions but i definitely feel like i should not be doing this  with that said i have zero tolerance for no promotional opportunity within a years span at any given job   the problem is that sometimes i feel like i m scabbing  me staying late and working past my time puts my coworkers who stay within their hours  i work in it and i don t know how many people are aware of how you can get absolutely taken advantage of  i always fantasize about unionizing but i m scared to death of what that would mean for my career and especially my personal safety    management cannot exist without the working man  no job or industry can exist without workers  no billionaire is self made  we desperately need a union or organization to represent the people that truly make our society possible    im caught between going above and beyond to further my career which is continuing the cycle of abuse that makes enemies of your coworkers   does anyone else feel like this ,ew94th

85,Plan to minimize dependency on capitalistic society - do you think it is possible?,i have been thinking about this plan for some time and now i ask you  fellow antiworkers  do you think it can be done   1  buying homestead with large established orchard and woods - fruit trees are relatively easy to maintain and i love to eat fruit very much  so much it has become my main staple  so essentialy orchard would help to keep food costs a little bit down and it will be healthier than store-bought fruit  i am planning to also have root cellar to stock fruit during winter months  there will also be woods which could help me keep my heating costs down  for basic electricity i will have a pair of cheap solar panels  so no electricity cost there  2  surely there will be some expenses left  land tax  public water  it is obligatory    expenses for food which i will not produce myself  rice  oats  yogurt etc  and some heating  i planned to save the amount to keep these things paid but there is the inflation thing so i guess i will have to invest to win a battle with it  for transportation i will use my bicycle - store and all other infrastructure is reachable with it   yes  there will be a lot of work  but it will be more enjoyable and since i will not have my daily job anymore i will have a lot more time  i will have to live frugally but i will be happier in the end   so  what is your opinion  is it doable  what would you change in that plan ,evpel4

94,Intergenerational bullshit,i ve been thinking about how antiwork can be applicable to school  growing up  the importance of school was emphasized very heavily in my house  my parents both grew up in a tiny east african country and were the children of subsistence farmers  my dad now works at an organization in new york city thanks to the opportunities being educated afforded him  so i m not shitting on school entirely because i wouldn t be here typing this if my dad hadn t been lucky enough to receive an education  however  there are so many stupid  negative ideas that get drilled into the heads of students  some of which i saw through and some of which i didn t until recently     but if i don t get good grades then i wont get into a good school and if i don t get into a good school then i won t get a good job and then i ll have a bad life    this was a common refrain among my classmates in the honors classes  it was such bullshit and even the teachers would be charmed by this devotion to school for sake of having a  good job  and  good life  my friend and i find it funny that most of our peers who had that attitude didn t even end up going to  prestigious  schools  like a lot of them went to state schools  which is totally fine  but i just find it ironic because they could have gotten there with half the effort  i kinda feel bad for them because during high school  they seriously neglected their mental and physical health and for what  a so-called  good life    while i never got swept up in thinking that the difference between an a and a b would determine the rest of my life  i did absorb some of those harmful ideas that i have to be productive all the time to be worth something  this idea was especially insidious for me because i have adhd and have struggled with being productive and focused my whole life  i hated myself for not being able to be the perfect student and held myself to really high standards to basically punish myself  in tenth grade  i found an online community of really dedicated and organized students and would wish i could be more like them    things took a turn when i read a blog post from one of these students  she was like twenty and she wrote about how she had spent the last semester working herself to the bone taking seven classes in one semester and working two jobs  her health deteriorated to the point where she was fainting but the blog post wasn t about learning from that  it was about how through her efforts  she graduated early and got accepted to law school  making her the youngest student there  she said she was proud of herself for what she had done and it s not like she isn t a seriously accomplished person but at what cost  what s even scarier is that at the time that i read the post  i wished i could be more like her  looking back  i can see how insane that was and it s just so shocking to me    i m nineteen now and i m working to get past that productivity at all costs mindset  i m glad i never had the discipline to push myself to that level  i feel really bad because my generation had to deal with a lot of pressure to succeed from a very young age  i get that we re lucky we don t have to be child laborers but it s just insane how we re inundated with this capitalist nonsense  things are just so competitive these days and the middle class is getting smaller and smaller so i don t blame my peers for pushing themselves so hard  it s sad that a lot of us spent our youth working in preparation for a lifetime to be spent working  ,ewpduj

127,Chatty coworkers who are too dumb to even know they're NARCS (a vent post),i always considered myself friendly and outgoing -- able to hold  enjoy  and even  totally carry a conversation -- but at work i shut down my chatty teammate constantly  i'm downright antisocial  headphones on with nothing playing through them  no good morning or how's it hanging  nothing  why    well for one thing  he's an idiot and a kiss ass  but he's also obsessed with small talk  always asking me the most mundane shit  what did you have for dinner last night  like  and being nosy about my personal life  he has asked questions that were obviously  subtly  trying to find out if i'm single  dating  or a lesbian  when we shared an office i avoided even going to the bathroom because i had to pass his desk and that meant 5 seconds of headphone-free conversation opportunity  i couldn't reach into my bag or open a desk drawer for anything  because any noise i make  he's slipping his headphones off one ear  listening intently for anything he can react to with the almighty spoken word  he even comments on anything i eat or drink  which i fucking hate for plenty of reasons  not limited to some eating disorder adjacent issues  i hate feeling observed constantly by this man  tell me how i'm supposed to respond to him exclaiming  cheezits again  or  oh didn't go with the cheezits this time   oh right - i don't    i'd bet anything he's a dude who listens to  charisma on command  videos while brushing his teeth  memorizing  how to start a conversation with anyone  but it's all a fake office persona for ladder climbing  everything he says to me is like he's my camp counselor  and i'm a kid with a troubled home life  and he thinks there will be an oscar-winning movie one day  commemorating his noble efforts to coax me out of my shell  but i have no shell  and he has no charisma or conversation skills and he's the only one who doesn't know it  and worst of all  he's a snitch and he's too stupid to realize it    i'm sure he's  read some book  listened to some podcast that says  in order to truly  hustle to kiss as much ass as needed to become a ceo  lmao  you need to remember any little snippet a person says and then relentlessly beat it to death    before i got wise  i mentioned  half  jokingly that instead of implementing our big software upgrade  i was going to buy a one way ticket to spain and just say  i'm not coming back  i'm hanging with hot spanish guys  the result  weeks  weeks  weeks of him responding to unrelated shit with  gotta get those hot spanish guys right  and  in earshot of anyone in the hallway   have you talked to  manager  yet about going remote   moving to spain  like  fuck off dude  see if i ever try to be nice and friendly to you again when you blab my business like this    same with weed  i made it known i partake  but i only use implicit language and speak quietly because  i'm  at  work  cue this dumbass openly talking to me about weed  other drugs i don't even use  telling me he just bought weed from  his guy  like not even a story just stating the fact for clout  blah blah blah  with an open office door to a  very  busy hallway    once he bopped into our office saying  upbeat and high volume   hey   coworker  said he's gonna quit and go to graduate school in ireland  sounds like something you would like  and i thought  hmm  sounds like something  coworker  probably doesn't want this jackass using as conversation fodder where any manager could overhear  so i go chat with  coworker  and tell him to be careful with what he tells my teammate  and  coworker  looks rattled and says he'd  just  told my teammate that  and that he needs it to stay on the dl  well of course  that's obvious to anyone with a brain    anyway  there's nobody i can complain about him to who hasn't already heard it a hundred times  i just gotta say  my manager is a pretty difficult woman to get used to  and she doesn't mince words  and there have been many times i was afraid she hated me and was going to fire me  but still nothing  nothing  has ever made me want to quit like this teammate does  sometimes i can hardly get out of bed thinking about how i've got to tolerate him another day  sometimes i don't  and call in sick    i can't stand him  i can't stand how antisocial he has made me become out of self preservation  i hate him for that  and i hate office life for just being like this  like this is just how it is  and i'm the fucking weird one for opting out of the good mornings and the what did you have for lunches and the how was your weekendses and the did you see the newses     tl dr  teammate sucks  coworkers in general are probably not your friends  not for real  give them nothing  they could be the kind of 32 year old honorary boomer idiot who doesn't understand not wanting to waste away in an office job  because that is still their dream  and will unwittingly get you fired ,et4zbr

140,My case: is this normal? Did I do the right thing?,so for context i am european and live in a poor european country  even though unemployment rates having been hiting low values  the salaries are very low with the average being around 900 month while rent of a room in one of the major cities is around 400  month  room  not apartment    i graduated in pharmaceutical sciences 3 years ago and since then had several experiences  pharmacy  hated it  then 6 months of call center jobs until i found something better  6 months in a consulting company that randomly fired half of the people they had hired because after 6 months they finally admited they precipitated and should have only had hired the people after getting the projects  which then they didn't get  then 3 months of unemployment  14 months of a research grant  this was experience was good but research is quite unstable here  you don't get social security protection  one of my bosses was a bully and the other one was a great person  but a bit too slow  and maybe dement    so i decided to enroll in a programming bootcamp  in fact i was applying to phds abroad but didn't get any so then i started doing another master in bioinformatics but the bootcamp opportunity came up and seemed good  these bootcamps here cost around 6000-6500  for three months of full time training  8h day  this one was organized by a human resources firm  was free and they paid us a small monthly stipend  it lasted 3 months  but part-time  6h day  and then after 3 months we would have a 6 months internship in a consulting firm  during this period if we quit we would have to reimburse the human resources firm   in the end after that 3 6 period the company in which we interned would give us a contract and we would have to give preference to accept that contract or refrain from accepting a contract from competitors for a period of 3 months after the training  also  they said that the conditions offered by the company vary but on average  most of them asked for a permanence period of 9 to 12 months  in which if we quit  we would have to pay back to the company the value of the training   so  it seemed like a good deal and i took it   fast forward to the 3rd month of the training  thus the last month of the theoretical training just before starting the 6 months internship  the company of the internship invites us for a meeting and gives us a contract that we would have to sign now and that would force us to accept a contract after the 6 months of training  whilst before we had to give preference but were not forced to  and furthermore  that contract would have a 24 month permanece clause  me and some coworkers spoke out and declined to sign so everyone else  15 people  declined to sign  the human resources company had meetings with the other company  and this time they call us to have individual meetings with which one of us to present the new proposal  in this new proposal the permanence period decreased to 12 months  but the work hours would be more and also we'd still be forced to sign now and not after the internship  this company is a multinantional consulting firm with a terrible reputation of making workers staying overtime  more than the other consulting firms    i declined again to sign the contract  i said i would like to do the internship with them but would only analyze the contract in the end of the internship like it had been initially told me and liked i have agreed upon  and in the training contract i signed it only says i have to give preference to their contract in the end of the training  they said if i don't sign i won't have the internship with them  so i didn't sign because i don't like coercion    however this time  of all the 15 people of my training only me and another one did not sign  all the rest did   the salary is around 1200 month which is a bit above the national average and it's good because we only have a 9 month bootcamp  but i just don't understand why they want so bad for us to sign now    i believe they want to trap people because when they realise during the internship they will have to work not 40h week but 50h week or more  maybe in the end people would prefer not to sign with them and wait three months to free to search another job  but they claim nobody will force you to work more than 50h because it's illegal  even though on online reviews i read comments of people who say they work 11h to 12h day  and they also say the training is very expensive and thus they need to have assurance   during the internship we'll be getting less than half of what a junior does  so i believe the training  which i highly doubt costs what they claim it costs which is 10550  per person  will be paid in those 6 months  in any case even if they need more time to pay off the invesment  why was i told in the beggining i would only have to sign after the internship and the average would be 9-12months   all my colleagues say they are satisfied and that this is the better offer possible  all the rest are much worst  i still felt i was being mislead and not treated with transparency and declined to sign  was it a stupid move or did i do the right thing ,etkns3
141,I complained about a lazy coworker and it backfired. Now what?,to summarize  i work in a very disorganized team and after one person had quit i got their workload on top of mine  my current work depends on what john  one rank higher  does  when i got the position i noticed that i was being asked to do things that were not in my job description  to give you an idea  all others in the same rank as john have three projects and do reports that i depend on to enter information to databases  john has one semi project where he enrolls patients and submits their biopsy requests  after we get the biopsy reports i do a weekly presentation  summary of results  and update two databases  in reality john should be doing all those things and i should only be responsible for database work    i tried to be very diplomatic and professional and tell my manager of what was happening  my manager is non confrontational and wouldn t do anything  i ended up expressing how i had too much work load to do the presentation so he would take it since the presentation had a treatment history part  something only john and others in his rank should be doing and 100  not in my job description  as expected  john says he doesn t know how to do treatment history so i teach him how  also not my job because i m not supposed to be doing that part anyway  and after he does it once he comes to me saying the main doctor  sarah   responsible for the study wants the treatment history on the summaries i prepare  i said  ok  so you gotta do the presentation before u do the summary so i can copy it  and he casually says  no i think you should do it  and walks away    it rubbed me off wrong so i told my manager  let s fall her patty  again the day after  patty says ok write me an email with this and i ll figure it out  turns out patty forwarded my email to the team lead  abby  and abby went to sarah and told her what i said about john word for word  after i had already left work i get frantic calls from the big boss sarah s assistant and abby about coming to an urgent meeting  since i was already out i called patty to ask what had happened and basically they called john and told him what i complained about word for word and were wanting me to come to the meeting  basically they staged a confrontation instead of reminding him of his job description    now sarah wants to hire a new person to take over the study with john so i would be back to my older projects  i guess i was semi fired  lol  john is upset  and according to patty denied everything i had claimed  and the real kicker is that sarah said the parts john should be doing are  easy  and i had no right to complain about having to do it  this is not the point  this dude gets paid twice i do and it s his literal job to do those parts  not mine    so i m stressed out and tense to say the lease  i have a lazy coworker with a grudge and a boss who thinks i m a slacker  i regret saying anything and i m scared i ve gotten on her bad side and what if she will want me completely off the team  before all this i was supposed to be taking two weeks off so i m dreading coming back to this work environment with hostile people and don t know how i m supposed to closely interact with them  i was honestly expecting my manager patty to email him privately and explain what his job entails and what mine does  but i knew she was non confrontational and she ended up making this ten times worse than it was    i know i made mistakes but the reaction i got is scaring the hell out of me  what do you guys think will happen  and what steps should i do besides looking for a lateral transfer before she fires me  my fianc  says i m overreacting and i won t be fired but i honestly don t know  any help appreciated  thank you,etmlhs

173,I am an idiot. Dont make the same mistakes as me. Learn from my mistakes.,so i was told to post this here  let me first establish a background before i talk about my  performance review    background   i am a 31 year old guy  i work as a software engineer  in the last two years i decided to improve myself and give my 110 percent  to everything i do in life  i achieved many big goals in my life due to my changed mindset and recently passed all the five dutch language exams to qualify for the nationality  i also lost a lot of weight and i am on my way to gaining six pack abs  still a long way to go but i have a flat stomach for the first time in years     i decided to apply the same principles everywhere  including my work  the cream rises to the top after all right    i have been killing myself for the last ten months  i finish a task as quickly as possible and pickup the next without wasting time  while some colleagues are waiting for the next day to pickup new tasks  i pickup a new task as soon as i finish   if the tasks are finished in the sprint i pickup tasks from the next sprint  in the current sprint i did more than three times the work compared to  other members of the team  we are ahead of the planning as well  not only that i offered to do every single team demo when other people didnt want to do it   few weeks ago there was a planning week at my company  no one was doing work on the planning days  i squeezed in 16-20 hours of work in between those meetings   that was the reason that at the start of the sprint i had already finished most of the work   in the evenings i workout and read a non-fiction book to improve myself  in the last two weeks i was so tired that i had no energy to workout or do anything  my body was crushed with tiredness and in pain at the end of the day  i tried reading books but my brain was blank and i couldnt retain anything     doctor and reactions from reddit   i posted on reddit about it and people told me to visit the doctor  they also told me to tell my boss why i am doing this  how can my boss know that i want a promotion    i went to the doctor and she told me that i have to care about my health  if i continue like this i am on my way to a burnout  she told me that i seem frustrated because people dont see my efforts  she said that i should tell my boss how i feel   so i did  people had told me to bring a list of my achievements to my boss and tell him why i deserve to get a promotion which backfired and probably cost me a good increment today   two months ago in one of my regular meetings with the boss i told him that i wanted a promotion  i wanted to grow to a managerial role  he told me i was not there yet  he gave me reasons which he repeated today in the performance evaluation    performance review   so today was my performance review  i was 1000 percent sure that i will get an excellent review  if nothing else i would get a good increment right  i am not getting a promotion but i should atleast get a decent raise  here is his review in total he is a good guy  he was never an asshole to me  there were three people there  me  my boss and the account manager person responsible for deciding my increment   boss   so i think lovesprite thinks much higher of himself than i think of him  he thinks he is here points very high  but i think he is here points much much lower  there are other dimensions to how i rate things and not only how much you deliver as an individual  if we talk about work he delivers work on time with good quality  he is doing well  but two months ago we had a meeting which was the most useful meeting we had in the entire year  we found the bottleneck for lovesprite  personally i dont care if lovesprite is delivering 110 percent of the work  i care more about the performance of the team  he should have a team mindset  he should not care about his performance as an individual  he thinks of himself as a delivering machine  when you have such a high opinion of yourself i think it can be dangerous  i am looking for the correct word but maybe you start to resent your colleagues   account manager   so how would you rate him in getting up to speed since starting the job last year   boss   i would rate him average in getting up to speed  i didnt hear anything extraordinary about that    account manager   how would you rate his technical ability   boss   i would not say its extraordinary  i would say its between average and high   account manager   how would you rate his participation in the teams   boss   i think he participates well in our scrum events  he also does the demos when people dont want to   account manager   so if i want to summarize he works well  delivers on time with good quality  he needs to work on his team skills   boss yes  so that is correct  team is more important for me and he should try to pay attention to that   account manager what do you think about lovesprite's ambitions  he wants to be a manager   boss   so he should decide if it will make him happy  two months ago when he came to me about the promotion i asked him why he wanted to do it  he is years away from that promotion but he should ask himself would he be happy seeing other people deliver  a manager delivers very little  there are many other jobs in the career path in a big company  if you dont feel happy with something you shouldnt do it    reflecting back   so this was the result of my hard work in last year  nothing extraordinary just  average to high  i was surprised that 90 percent of the conversation was focused on me not being a team player  never mind that i got ill delivering 70-80 percent of the stuff of the team  never mind that i got so much stress to make sure that we are ahead of schedule  never mind that i worked super hard to the point of burning out just so i would get noticed for a promotion  its all about the team  till you start performing bad then its about you and you will be fired    i am going to work like my colleagues now and the rest of this community  give my 70 percent to the job and focus on my health  i started getting lots of issues in the last year  my memory has become horrible and i feel stressed and anxious all the time  focus on yourself first and dont be an idiot like me ,esw471

them that the go live wouldn't be possible with just three developers  they just shrugged their shoulders and said  we got to make do with what we got  3  one of the new requirements was to make the system read handwritten info on the documents with 90  accuracy  this wasn't in the old system and apparently was a major selling point to win the contract  we used some questionable commercial  net library with licenses they had on ice  it failed miserably and we were just told to  fix it  4  they forgot to include the client's responsibility for doing some of the it work  the client barely did any of this work and held us responsible for creating the databases  installing software  setting up the environments  and the whole 9 yards  us 3 were expected also do all of that on top of writing code   5  hours typically were 7 am to 11 pm 7 days a week  in the last month it was 5 am to 11 pm 7 days a week  pm designated 1 hour of  and i shit you not   family time   6  during final month  pm sent  wake up  calls at around 5 am where i was to wake up and monitor the test system and make sure test system was processing normally  then send a report  7  travel each month  pm wanted itineraries so he will know exactly what times we will be available  company is infamous for being late paying back expenses  i had a  900 expense that took 2 months to pay back  8   company provided no version control server or ci for the project  we couldn't use a public repo for obvious reasons  9  company was stupidly stingy on equipment  laptops were early gen i5  8 gb  and 5200 rpm hard drive with piss poor battery life  the much better computers were reserved for managers who only used it for word  excel  and browser  company don't provide remote test vms and expect devs to run test vms on your own machine using shady unverified windows os passed around in network drives  10  one of my coworkers' sister had a wedding  he had this on his calendar months in advance  despite working a few hours on the wedding day  he was chewed out for not being fully available  this was on a saturday  11  that same coworker was out for a day because he fell so sick he had to go to the emergency room  he was prescribed some medication that made him drowsy and mia for most of the day  the pm was extremely angry bitching about him to me on the phone  he went silent after he was told about it  12  the other coworker  a much older guy and one of the nicest person i have met  was frustrated by the lack of resources  he noticed a guy on bench  waiting to work on the project  with the experience  he tried to recruit him to work with us  the pm found out  yelled at him in front of everyone for  doing her job for her  brought him into the conference room and threaten his performance reviews tied to raises  13  this happened nearly every other day  pm calls me and ask to do x feature and to release next day  i told him that it will much longer than a day  than he says   that's not acceptable  it needs to be next day  we go back and forth  i warned him that it will likely be broken because it's rushed  so i rushed the feature  it breaks in several places   surprise pikachu face   why is it not working  14  nearly every day when i was on client site  we worked in a conference room  pm told us we couldn't leave until we push out a new build which is usually super late at night   15  i was yelled at in front of everyone because i was 10 minutes late to an impromptu phone call  i was showering  16  product was broken since we were tired  pissed  overworked  and understaffed  clients saw the broken product  what did the pm do  tell the client it's just a fluke and then tell the two testers to manually modify the data so that it appears working  17  pm did have a plan if release goes sideways   which it surely will  and if clients extends the contract  it's called  give up our thanksgiving  christmas  and new years vacation days  to work on it   about a month in  i see the writing on the wall  i needed an exit plan  i started interviewing for other positions  i had four interviews that i was able to pass along as  doctor's appointment  i failed each one miserably  interviewing while deprived is no bueno    after the second month  i cried every day  i wanted to quit  my mother had severe medical issues that left her in constant pain  i had to take care of her needs and work was barely paying the bills already  i was losing a lot of money because while i was away  i had to have food and necessities delivered since she was unable to drive and rest of our family didn't give a fuck about me and my mother  i was unable to expense that for reimbursement     i remember arriving to my hotel room at 10 pm  with dozens and dozens of missed calls  missed texts  and emails  i was seriously considering hanging myself in the closet to end all of the suffering  if i was dead  i didn't have to drag myself out of bed still half asleep at 5 am or put up with my boss's constant complaining  that led me to my decision to put in my two weeks in right there without a job lined up    after i put in my two weeks in  the pm and the pm's boss decided to be nice offering gift cards and free meals  they asked me  at the very least  to work an extra week  i refused  i was scheduled to travel my final week  i said no because i had an interview lined up that week  a load was lifted off my back   into month four and it's time to release the product to production  the product was unfinished  broken  and absolutely not ready for prime time  we had a final intervention with the pm  he said  we're going live whether we like it or not   release time  we push the build to production  it was slow  clunky  and put together with gum duct tape and spit  not acceptable to the client and the testers couldn't fix data in the backend fast enough  client threatened to sue  pm calls everyone to book a flight immediately    the company i worked for has what they call a  swat team    when things get rough  they call in a bunch of senior developers and managers to rectify the situation    i had to work with one of them on my final week  he was a guy who went to the us from bangladesh on a visa  he told me  sounded like he was about to cry  that if he don't fix this then they will revoke his visa and send him back to bangladesh   i never felt so happy and free on my last day ,eu183r

180,I want to tell you guys what I've been doing for the last 6 or 7 years. Working for an employer that gets it.,just want to start by saying in no way is this bragging or rubbing anything in  i just want to share my story of how i have been living since i was  21  i just found this sub in which i share the sentiments exactly and i was lucky enough to find an employer who does as well  without revealing exactly what i do or where i work  i just wanted to post this as proof that a business can be profitable and successful  while paying employees a livable wage and treating people like actual human beings   sorry about how long and ramble-y this will be but here we go   i never had a job interview to work where i do  in fact i never even gave them a resume  i met my employer at a bar and he was like  hey you seem to know some things  you want a job  and that was literally it  i fucking hate writing resumes and bullshitting my way through a cover letter just to make it look like i actually want to work where ever it is  so skipping that whole soul destroying process was a dream  i agreed immediately  i was studying software engineering at the time because i thought i should  get a real job  after playing music for years and ended up dropping out a month after i got this job   i work 4 shifts a week  3 weeknights and one on the weekend during the day  so every day except saturday i just do what ever i want  go get lunch  go for walks  play xbox  do gardening  write music  what ever  and then go to work when it gets dark  i also still have my saturday nights free to hang out with my friends who do the normal 9-5 as well   i get paid for 8 hours even though i don't think i've actually worked that long since the first year i was here and was still learning the ropes  my boss knows this and doesn't give a shit  he has the sentiment of  well if you're done  you're done  no point of being here  i've worked out a system where i can do what was originally 8 hours of work in 6 or less  my boss still believes its 8 hours worth of work and just because i'm efficient at it  that doesn't mean i should be paid less  also if i have to come in to sort something out when i'm not scheduled for what ever reason  even if its only for 5 minutes  that's 3 hours pay for the trouble   i should also mention  my boss also pays me pretty decently  like i'm not earning big money  but he could be paying me far less  it's more than enough to pay rent  bills  food and a bunch of leisure time  aka the pub  as long as the customers are happy and everything is getting done it's cool  he isn't hovering over my shoulder every two seconds  in fact the last time i think i saw him we ran into each other at a music festival  which he also gave me and my girlfriend free tickets to  he works in a different location but it's the same business  i'll send him a text or email if i need anything out of the ordinary and send him an email report every week of whats been going on  which is pretty much fully automated now   we also have free reign over our schedules  we only really require one or two people to be here at a time  so if me and the other employees want time off we swap shifts around at our own leisure  we do have a sort of unwritten rule that if you take a day off  you have to take a future shift for who ever fills in when ever they ask  but that isn't policy or anything  we just do it  like i went to canada for two months once  came back and was filling in for people during football season all the time to make up for the extra time they put in so i could take a holiday  no problem  we all help each other out when it comes to things like this   also my boss has a zero tolerance ethic for shitty customers  he says if they cause problems we are doing well enough that they are considered more trouble than what they are worth  we have full permission to tell dickheads to kick rocks  though in the 6 or so years i've been here  that has only ever happened 3 or 4 times   now the downsides   -the strange hours took a while to get used to  my ex hated that most nights during the week i started work pretty much the same time she was finishing and regularly chewed me out for it  my current partner has similar hours to me though so that's all good now  but it was really stressful for a while and i was pretty lonely until i met more people that have similar free time to me  and trust me there isn't many so this took a while lol   -having so much free time means i spend way more money on keeping my self entertained than i really should  i have barely any savings  but that's not at the fault of what i'm paid  i just always have to be doing something or else i get antsy and generally that costs money   and that's really it   my boss can do all that for us because he isn't greedy and your employer almost certainly can too  they just don't  all the employees where i work live relatively well and get way more time off than the average person  it really is only because our boss isn't obsessed with money  the company is making a profit  he gets his cut  he is happy with his income and isn't interested in making more and through that we get a much more relaxed work environment  i really feel like this is close to how it should be for everyone  maintaining productivity  while keeping our humanity ,esai1g

254,The Prisoner (Short Story), op here  i just wrote this short story  heavily inspired by the antiwork subreddit and philosophy  and i thought y'all might be interested  and would be willing to give some feedback  i'd like to know if y'all think the naming gimmick was stupid  or if the message was too heavy handed  or just any critiques in general  if this doesn't fit the type of content allowed on this subreddit that's totally fine  this is my first short story    amp x200b   the prisoner wakes up filled with hatred  the same way he does every morning  his hatred is bitter and tinged with regret  if he shared his bed with someone he might have lashed out at them  who his hatred is targeted at he isn t sure  after all  he was the one who had set his alarm   the prisoner turns off his alarm and lays in bed  gathering the willpower to start the day  realistically  he knows that the day will start with or without him  but as long as he is still in his bed he can pretend that it won t  he hates mornings  but he knows everyone else does too  and that comforts him   after a while his hatred fades into resignation  and the prisoner leaves his bed to start getting ready  after showering and dressing he goes to his fridge and wonders if he should eat breakfast  after all  he is hungry  he decides against it  eating this early always makes him feel sick  a week ago he had tried eating some eggs and almost vomited  or maybe it was a month ago  time blends together when each day is indistinguishable    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  the prisoner and his car creep along the congested city street  his eyes occasionally flicking towards the sensor that represents the temperature of the engine  he s not sure what that sensor is called  but he does know that if it reached the red  he d be screwed  that had happened to him once on his way to work  he hadn t even noticed until the engine started making distressing noises  he ended up being an hour late to work that day  and was nearly brought to tears in front of his boss  at the fear of losing his job  that would be the death of me  thinks the prisoner  his heart twinging at that painful thought  if he lost his job  then - his eyes flick towards the sensor - who knows what would happen to him   he passes by city hall twice a day  and the mild enjoyment he used to feel at seeing such a beautiful building has quickly faded into indifference  a long time ago  when his life as a working man was just beginning  he would crane his head to catch a glimpse of the lofty lady liberty statue  but now he would just stare at the street ahead  occasionally flicking his eyes towards the sensor  today though  there is something new to see  a small group of people holding signs  maybe a dozen  are just off the street in front of city hall  one even has a megaphone  and seems to be shouting about something  the group are shaking their signs in agreement while a single police officer stands on the steps regarding them with contempt  the prisoner wonders what they are all doing outside on a cold winter morning  and on a work day no less   as he drives  the prisoner reads some signs  just to find something to think about  most of the signs have something to do with rich people  or taxes  or something  he s certain that money is involved  one sign sticks out to him though  because it simply reads  free yourself  the prisoner finds that extremely odd  free himself  he is free  what is that sign insinuating  no  he doesn t like the sign at all  or the woman holding it for that matter  i am free  thinks the prisoner  more than just free  his life was going great  thank you very much  he has a job that pays the bills  and if he keeps working hard  he might one day be promoted  sure  there weren t many developments on the romantic side of things  but who could spare the time to go on dates  come to think of it  a lot of his interests had fallen to the wayside in the past few years  but what can you expect  being a working man  he used to go camping  he remembered suddenly  and would stare at the stars  far away from the well-lit nights of the city  things could be much worse for him though  no  the prisoner reassures himself  i m very grateful for my lot in life  those people with the signs are just troublemakers  riling people up over nothing  they should be grateful that things aren t worse  they should be grateful  like him    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  the moment the prisoner sits at his desk he feels his mind numb and his eyes glaze  that s a blessing though  it makes the clock go faster  he checks his work email  then his mailbox  and takes stock of his tasks for the day  nothing out of the ordinary  if he really tried  he could finish it all by lunchtime  but that would present a slew of problems he would rather just avoid  if he finishes his work early  his boss might give him more to do  nothing important  just time wasting  he might have to reorganize their client files  or digitize some old records  and even if his boss didn t notice that he wasn t doing anything  then he would be stuck without anything to do until 5 o clock  he wouldn t even be able to check his personal email or read a book  because they were always watching the security cameras and the employees  screens to catch any time wasters  having nothing to do was worse than the work  at least when he was working time didn t warp  turning minutes to hours and hours to lifetimes  or at least it didn t warp as much  no  it was better to avoid all that and make his work last the whole day  he wouldn t want to be a time waster   as he types  at about half the speed he is capable of  his mind returns to his past  why hadn t he gone camping in the past few years  it had made him so happy  looking up at the endless night sky had always made him feel small  but in a comforting way  sure  he was insignificant  but he had the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the stunning  unending universe  look  it s the milky way  what more could one want  he was like an ant meeting god  and his friends  those were the best times of his life  just him and his friends  wasting time in the woods  it s been years since he d seen his friends  they d tried to meet up a few times over the years  but the plans always fell through  it seemed like nobody ever had time anymore  or maybe nobody had the energy  or the soul  the prisoner feels a sense of loss  anyway  that s just what happens when you grow up  you start working  you move on to more important things  and you lose touch with old friends  happens to everybody   nearby footsteps bring the prisoner out of his line of thought  he recognizes them as the short  angry footsteps of his boss  the warden     good morning  warden  says the prisoner    good morning  prisoner  says the warden   could we chat for a minute    sure thing  says the prisoner  as if he has a choice   the warden begins pointing out the various flaws in some report that the prisoner can t even remember writing  his paternalistic tone fails to cloak the ever present threat of termination  and it is a threat  if he was fired  chances are he wouldn t be able to quickly find a job that paid enough for him to keep his apartment  his savings were meager  he would probably be evicted  and then where could he go    i ve talked to you about these kinds of simple mistakes before  prisoner  the warden sighs   i hate these types of chats  you know  i m your boss  but i m also your friend  right    what  says the prisoner  startled out of his thoughts    we re friends right  prisoner     yeah of course  warden    of course what    we re friends    great  remember  always give 110  percent  everyone at this company is family  and you never want to let down your family   i hate you  thinks the prisoner    i hear you  says the prisoner    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   you know  you shouldn t let him talk to you like that  for that matter  none of us should let him talk to us like that  says the dissident  poking at his salad with a plastic fork    he s our boss    so  we re all adults  why should anyone have the right to talk to us like that  did you hear how condescending he was   prisoner  this piece of paper is eggshell white  and i specifically asked for ghost white  one more screw up like this and i might just be forced to terminate you    the dissident s poor impression makes the prisoner laugh    he s an asshole  but he s still our boss  bosses are assholes  it s like a law of nature    it shouldn t be  i mean  why is it ok for him to treat us like that  we are the ones who do all the real work in this company  he treats us like we re prisoners in a camp or something   the dissident s words remind the prisoner of the sign he had seen on his commute  he starts to get irritated  the dissident is his friend  but sometimes it feels like he isn t grateful to have the job he did  doesn t he know things could be a lot worse    you re just being dramatic  we have it good  you know  we live in a free country  and people all over the world have it a lot worse than us    do you feel free though    what do you mean    i mean do you feel like you re free    i am free  says the prisoner    but do you feel like you re free  do you enjoy life  do you spend your days prancing through fields of flowers  just reveling in your freedom  the dissident started to get worked up   no  you spend your days the same as the rest of us  doing pointless bullshit under the thumb of that wannabe tyrant  and when you go home  do you do something you re passionate about  no  you go back to your crappy apartment  watch tv and wait for the next day to start  because you re too goddamn burned out to do anything you love  just like the rest of us  the dissident stands up like he s giving a speech  although nobody else in the break room is listening   what good does it do to live in a free country if we all live bland  passionless lives    shut the hell up  hisses the prisoner  it doesn t seem like anybody is listening  but if somebody reported the dissident s behavior to the warden  they would both be in big trouble  you can t just going around saying anything you want like that  some opinions have to be kept secret  for your own safety  besides  the dissident is pissing him off  doesn t he know that he should be grateful    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  the prisoner had finally left work  and was driving home  he wasn t feeling the relief that he normally did when the day was over though  he couldn t stop thinking about what the dissident had said  doesn t he know that there is no point in trying to change things  people have to work if they want to live  and if you want to work  you have to do whatever your boss says with a smile  and that is just the way things are  and if you work harder than everybody else  the prisoner tells himself  then one day they ll recognize that and you ll be rewarded  that s how the world works  his eyes flick towards the sensor   as he draws closer to city hall  he sees something that fuels his anger  the dozen or so sign holders from the morning had grown into a crowd of at least a hundred  illuminated by street lights  the single contemptuous policeman had become twenty  wearing helmets and holding riot shields  the police are stationed in between the front of city hall and the crowd of protesters  the protesters are moving up the steps and towards the large entrance as a pack  at the back of the crowd  just off the side of the street  he could see the woman from this morning holding the same sign   free yourself   the prisoner feels a surge of rage  who the fuck does she think she is  he is free  and he is happy  the prisoner s sweaty hands clutch the steering wheel  his face twisting with rage  that bitch doesn t know what she s talking about  doesn t she know that people get what they deserve  doesn t she know that things could be much worse  doesn t she know that  they  could take away what little we have if we piss them off   that woman with the sign is just as bad as the dissident  they should know better than to challenge the people who sign our checks    almost subconsciously  the prisoner starts to turn his steering wheel towards the object of his rage  soon he is swerving across lanes at the woman  who has her face turned towards city hall  within seconds his car would fly over the curb  destroying the woman who dared to imply that the prisoner was wasting his life   free himself  free himself from what  he has a job  he works hard  and one day they will give him what he deserves  there is nothing wrong with the system  people just want to be given things that they haven t earned    the woman turns around and screams  paralyzed with fear as she sees the car barreling towards her  she drops her sign while one of her friends tries to pull her out of the way  it s in vain  they won t be fast enough   this woman  and the dissident  they believe the world is unfair  they believe that we re being taken advantage of  they believe the game is rigged  but that s not true  it can t be  if that s true then that means everything i ve sacrificed  my friends  my love life  my free time  my happiness  it was all for nothing   it was all for nothing   at the last second  the prisoner s car changes course  narrowly missing the woman  his body is shaking uncontrollably and drenched in a cold sweat    what the fuck was i thinking  the prisoner says to himself  he starts driving normally again  changing lanes to gain distance from the protesters   as his nerves slowly steady  he tries to figure out what had come over him  why had he done that  he could have killed that woman  and himself  he couldn t quite remember what line of thought had led him to such a drastic course of action  he ponders it for a few moments  then shrugs when he can t find the memory   he glances up out of his windshield at the sky  it s already dark out  winter days were especially short  and he stayed a few hours late at work  at the request of the warden  no stars  that s fine  the prisoner is a working man  his mind is on more important things  after all  the prisoner has work tomorrow ,er2bgi

291,I snuck out of work last night just so I could work overtime without being scolded.,i don't even know if this is the right place to post this but i just had to tell somebody about this because it's ridiculous   i'm currently on 4 projects but my boss has been prioritizing his favorite one to the point that i'm not  allowed  to work on the other three  and now i'm severely behind on the others  i'm getting a lot of pressure from other consultants and colleagues because they're basically waiting on me to do my part   literally the only way to catch up is to work on them between other tasks  at lunch  etc  but every time my boss has caught me working on them he calls me out because i should be spending my time on his favorite one  he scolds me for not focusing on just the one he likes the most  normally i'd just let it turn into his problem but my reputation is basically on the line if these others aren't just as successful  they're all just as  if not more  critical to get done successfully   so last night after working a 10 hour day on his project  i actually had to sneak out of work without letting him see so i could work from home and catch up on other stuff   the worst part about this is we're not paid overtime and i know i'm only exacerbating the problem by probing to my company their staff is willing to work 70 hour weeks with no overtime pay because they don't know how to properly staff a company ,erufpj

293,I need to negociate a better salary,they fired an entire department and transferred most of their responsibilities to me  i went from having a decent schedule with plenty of time to complete all of my tasks to an incredibly busy schedule  especially at the end of the month  i just learned that someone who helps us out from time to time is paid way more than i am and i even train her sometimes  i have mastered all of their data systems and have all the knowledge that one can acquire from working here  but right now  i don't have the motivation to handle all of my workload with the little amount that i gain every hour  i am a data entry specialist and in canada  they're paid 19  an hour on average  which is what would be negociating for    do you have any tips as to how i should proceed  have you ever had to negociate your salary before  i'm so uncomfortable with it  but i'm done being exploited ,eret6i

But have worked at more places then anyone at my age short age . 21 . lol my username is fukcmoney 🤣 that’s how u know I’m serious .,i ve had 11 jobs so far and i barely turned 21 years old last month   it s funny because my longest employment at any of those jobs was about a year   i can t stand working anywhere   the thought of me having to be somewhere i wouldn t ever be at on my own time or doing something i d never do literally hurts my soul   so i quit and find another job to just survive boredom   i ve met the same kind of people at every single job they talk about the same shit it s lame asf   anyway i don t know what to do   the only reason i work is because i m broke asf i work so hard for the lamest money     i still live with my parents  random fact my dad works 80 hours a week   and he s been doing it for 30   years     i don t go to college and i m in debt already   from the stupid law and traffic tickets and you know just life and society s fees   i m a sagittarius so i wander the world carelessly and now i have to pay the  consequences  i can t even afford to fix my car anymore because of my debt   i fortunately know a lot of people because of my way of life so i can ask anyone for rides or anything at anytime   i m eternally grateful for that   but what bothers me is i can t get my own place  i feel like we all have a right to our own place we shouldn t have to die at work to just have somewhere to sleep wtf     i can t express my art  i love to write and draw and write music and play sports and photography  because i don t have the funds to back it up or go to school   i hate banks so i deleted my bank accounts a while ago and just carry cash   i basically hate our society so much   people try to make me feel inferior many times but my knowledge of life always shuts them up when i explain it should be mind over matter   materialistic things hold no real value   i m not asking for any sympathy because i understand that my situation can be waaayyy worse   just felt like getting it off my chest   i just wonder where i m gonna end up and how i will support myself soon and how i m gonna even one day look out for my family and parents   i never felt a more relatable community on reddit   thanks everyone for reading  ,er4rtb

301,"I landed a dream job without any effort, but I’ll probably end up losing it...",basically i applied for a security job at a big company and got a better job because i looked  presentable  at an open hiring event  i was also the only white one in the lobby and have the sneaking suspicion that it might have had something to do with it   i make  15 an hour just to drive around to different sites at my leisure and ask if they need anything  sometimes they have uniforms for me to deliver but usually the guy on the shift before me  the person who trained me  takes care of that  i just drive around and watch netflix or listen to music  i get an hour paid lunch break  but honestly nobody would know if i just sat there in a parking lot all day     here s the problem  while training the manager and guy training me casually said that the procedure for when there s a sleeping guard is to take a picture of them and send it to the manager  he d then fire them   tonight    on my third day alone in the car   i finally encountered that on my last site  which i ve heard is a problem site  i drove up to a security car at this industrial place and inside was a sleeping older woman guard  i knocked on the window and pretended not to notice awkwardly   and asked her if she needed any uniform stuff  and went on to the guard shack to check on the other ones   i feel bad for not saying that i wouldn t report it because she s probably losing sleep right now     i d totally be fine with just not reporting anything  and that s what i m doing    but i m worried that the boss will notice the discrepancy between the person who trained me  the other shift  amount of reports and mine  i m just hoping he won t notice   but i don t know   the other guy told me he caught 2 guards within the last couple of weeks ,erqhk0

305,Practical solutions for people compelled by anti-work ideas,hello  i just found this sub recently and have found a lot of the ideas here resonating with me  but i've also come across a lot of defeatism and suicidal ideation    i wanted to start a thread where we can talk about practical  realistic solutions to the serious problem of  having to work    i will share what i've come across in my own life experience  14 years of work  research  and so on  but i'm not trying to create a prescription for anyone here  i'd rather start a discussion and see what ideas other people have    standard early retirement  fire refers to  financial independence retire early   the most popular strategy for early retirement  because of its perceived low risk  is to amass a large amount of investments such that you can safely withdraw 3  from your nest egg  almost indefinitely  this is the most popular method advocated for in r financialindependence  figure out how much you spend in a year  then build up a nest egg such that you can cover your living expenses indefinitely    or  you can create  passive income  which is income that one does not need to actively create through labor  there are some debates about what this means  some people consider buying investment properties to be passive income  though of course there is a lot of labor and work involved with being a landlord  unless you pass off your properties to a property management company  even then  there is work involved  like paying taxes  overseeing the higher-level context of your real estate portfolio  etc    there is also a strong community in r leanfire who are approaching the issues of r financialindependence by looking to retire early with a smaller amount of money  such as saving up  300k and drawing the 3  or using super-low-cost-of-living arbitrage strategies by moving to countries or geographic locations with very low expenses  for example  there are places even in the u s  where a person can buy a house for  25k in decent shape in rural places     passive income   as aforementioned  passive income generally refers to the automatic generation of capital that doesn't require labor  there are quite a few ways to set up passive income or semi-passive income  all of which are fairly difficult and time-intensive  can be risky  and don't have guaranteed incomes  few things in life have guaranteed outcomes  anyway  but    real estate   entrepreneurship  starting a business    social media strategies  like running ads on a youtube channel   i don't know  i'm sure there are a lot more  marrying into money  or something like that  cryptocurrencies and speculation  etc     alternative work styles  while this still includes work  there are lots of alternatives to the corporate 8-5 hellscape  this includes things like remote digital work  like the digital nomadism movement  seasonal work  finding a career with serious vacations  like teaching  becoming a freelancer or independent consultant  and so on  all of this requires work  but gives the individual a little more independence and autonomy     alternative living styles  things like van living  wwofing  i don't know if people still call it this  it's basically working on a farm in a commune in exchange for food and board  which sounds awful to me  but it's something  if you're healthy and like being outdoors  extreme minimalism   freegan  or hobo-style living   how to drop out  ideas by ran prieur  becoming a monk  feel free to add     finding a job you love  this is probably a myth and is steeped in capitalist ideology  but perhaps you could find employment that either does not make you want to drop off the face of the planet  with some self-searching and finding a job that matches well with your psychological disposition  you could potentially find a position that is significantly less awful than what you are experiencing with your job now  for me  this meant switching from corporate-nightmare-land to academia  which is better suited to my psyche     general personal finance  it doesn't solve the systemic issues of having to work or the evils of global capitalism  but learning how to budget and live on less than you earn can certainly help your mental health  reduced stress  reduced anxiety  and can help move you in a direction toward the financial necessity of needing to work  such as giving you the freedom to start a business or buy real estate with savings  from what i've read in survey data  about 50  of americans are only a  300 emergency away from bankruptcy  this one is highly debated  obviously people need to be paid more  but people can also complete training and try to improve their position  within reason  either way  educating yourself generally in personal finance can help with the pain of having to work daily  and is probably the starting point for most people to create an escape route    that's about all i have for now  i hope some other people will chime in with their ideas or strategies about their practical solutions for not having to work  as it seems like it would benefit the sub and would give us something to talk about today    all the best ,eqyy9a

312,The Prisoner (Short Story), op here  i wrote this short story heavily influenced by the antiwork subreddit and philosophy  and i thought y'all might be interested  and might be willing to give some feedback  i'd like to know if y'all think the naming gimmick was stupid  or if the message was too heavy handed  if this doesn't fit the type of content that this subreddit allows  that's totally fine  this is my first ever short story    amp x200b   the prisoner wakes up filled with hatred  the same way he does every morning  his hatred is bitter and tinged with regret  if he shared his bed with someone he might have lashed out at them  who his hatred is targeted at he isn t sure  after all  he was the one who had set his alarm   the prisoner turns off his alarm and lays in bed  gathering the willpower to start the day  realistically  he knows that the day will start with or without him  but as long as he is still in his bed he can pretend that it won t  he hates mornings  but he knows everyone else does too  and that comforts him   after a while his hatred fades into resignation  and the prisoner leaves his bed to start getting ready  after showering and dressing he goes to his fridge and wonders if he should eat breakfast  after all  he is hungry  he decides against it  eating this early always makes him feel sick  a week ago he had tried eating some eggs and almost vomited  or maybe it was a month ago  time blends together when each day is indistinguishable   the prisoner and his car creep along the congested city street  his eyes occasionally flicking towards the sensor that represents the temperature of the engine  he s not sure what that sensor is called  but he does know that if it reached the red  he d be screwed  that had happened to him once on his way to work  he hadn t even noticed until the engine started making distressing noises  he ended up being an hour late to work that day  and was nearly brought to tears in front of his boss  at the fear of losing his job  that would be the death of me  thinks the prisoner  his heart twinging at that painful thought  if he lost his job  then - his eyes flick towards the sensor - who knows what would happen to him   he passes by city hall twice a day  and the mild enjoyment he used to feel at seeing such a beautiful building has quickly faded into indifference  a long time ago  when his life as a working man was just beginning  he would crane his head to catch a glimpse of the lofty lady liberty statue  but now he would just stare at the street ahead  occasionally flicking his eyes towards the sensor  today though  there is something new to see  a small group of people holding signs  maybe a dozen  are just off the street in front of city hall  one even has a megaphone  and seems to be shouting about something  the group are shaking their signs in agreement while a single police officer stands on the steps regarding them with contempt  the prisoner wonders what they are all doing outside on a cold winter morning  and on a work day no less   as he drives  the prisoner reads some signs  just to find something to think about  most of the signs have something to do with rich people  or taxes  or something  he s certain that money is involved  one sign sticks out to him though  because it simply reads  free yourself  the prisoner finds that extremely odd  free himself  he is free  what is that sign insinuating  no  he doesn t like the sign at all  or the woman holding it for that matter  i am free  thinks the prisoner  more than just free  his life was going great  thank you very much  he has a job that pays the bills  and if he keeps working hard  he might one day be promoted  sure  there weren t many developments on the romantic side of things  but who could spare the time to go on dates  come to think of it  a lot of his interests had fallen to the wayside in the past few years  but what can you expect  being a working man  he used to go camping  he remembered suddenly  and would stare at the stars  far away from the well-lit nights of the city  things could be much worse for him though  no  the prisoner reassures himself  i m very grateful for my lot in life  those people with the signs are just troublemakers  riling people up over nothing  they should be grateful that things aren t worse  they should be grateful  like him   the moment the prisoner sits at his desk he feels his mind numb and his eyes glaze  that s a blessing though  it makes the clock go faster  he checks his work email  then his mailbox  and takes stock of his tasks for the day  nothing out of the ordinary  if he really tried  he could finish it all by lunchtime  but that would present a slew of problems he would rather just avoid  if he finishes his work early  his boss might give him more to do  nothing important  just time wasting  he might have to reorganize their client files  or digitize some old records  and even if his boss didn t notice that he wasn t doing anything  then he would be stuck without anything to do until 5 o clock  he wouldn t even be able to check his personal email or read a book  because they were always watching the security cameras and the employees  screens to catch any time wasters  having nothing to do was worse than the work  at least when he was working time didn t warp  turning minutes to hours and hours to lifetimes  or at least it didn t warp as much  no  it was better to avoid all that and make his work last the whole day  he wouldn t want to be a time waster   as he types  at about half the speed he is capable of  his mind returns to his past  why hadn t he gone camping in the past few years  it had made him so happy  looking up at the endless night sky had always made him feel small  but in a comforting way  sure  he was insignificant  but he had the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the stunning  unending universe  look  it s the milky way  what more could one want  he was like an ant meeting god  and his friends  those were the best times of his life  just him and his friends  wasting time in the woods  it s been years since he d seen his friends  they d tried to meet up a few times over the years  but the plans always fell through  it seemed like nobody ever had time anymore  or maybe nobody had the energy  or the soul  the prisoner feels a sense of loss  anyway  that s just what happens when you grow up  you start working  you move on to more important things  and you lose touch with old friends  happens to everybody   nearby footsteps bring the prisoner out of his line of thought  he recognizes them as the short  angry footsteps of his boss  the warden    good morning  warden  says the prisoner    good morning  prisoner  says the warden   could we chat for a minute    sure thing  says the prisoner  as if he has a choice   the warden begins pointing out the various flaws in some report that the prisoner can t even remember writing  his paternalistic tone fails to cloak the ever present threat of termination  and it is a threat  if he was fired  chances are he wouldn t be able to quickly find a job that paid enough for him to keep his apartment  his savings were meager  he would probably be evicted  and then where could he go    i ve talked to you about these kinds of simple mistakes before  prisoner  the warden sighs   i hate these types of chats  you know  i m your boss  but i m also your friend  right    what  says the prisoner  startled out of his thoughts    we re friends right  prisoner     yeah of course  warden    of course what    we re friends    great  remember  always give 110  percent  everyone at this company is family  and you never want to let down your family   i hate you  thinks the prisoner    i hear you  says the prisoner    you know  you shouldn t let him talk to you like that  for that matter  none of us should let him talk to us like that  says the dissident  poking at his salad with a plastic fork    he s our boss    so  we re all adults  why should anyone have the right to talk to us like that  did you hear how condescending he was   prisoner  this piece of paper is eggshell white  and i specifically asked for ghost white  one more screw up like this and i might just be forced to terminate you   the dissident s poor impression makes the prisoner laugh    he s an asshole  but he s still our boss  bosses are assholes  it s like a law of nature    it shouldn t be  i mean  why is it ok for him to treat us like that  we are the ones who do all the real work in this company  he treats us like we re prisoners in a camp or something   the dissident s words remind the prisoner of the sign he had seen on his commute  he starts to get irritated  the dissident is his friend  but sometimes it feels like he isn t grateful to have the job he did  doesn t he know things could be a lot worse    you re just being dramatic  we have it good  you know  we live in a free country  and people all over the world have it a lot worse than us    do you feel free though    what do you mean    i mean do you feel like you re free    i am free  says the prisoner    but do you feel like you re free  do you enjoy life  do you spend your days prancing through fields of flowers  just reveling in your freedom  the dissident started to get worked up   no  you spend your days the same as the rest of us  doing pointless bullshit under the thumb of that wannabe tyrant  and when you go home  do you do something you re passionate about  no  you go back to your crappy apartment  watch tv and wait for the next day to start  because you re too goddamn burned out to do anything you love  just like the rest of us  the dissident stands up like he s giving a speech  although nobody else in the break room is listening   what good does it do to live in a free country if we all live bland  passionless lives    shut the hell up  hisses the prisoner  it doesn t seem like anybody is listening  but if somebody reported the dissident s behavior to the warden  they would both be in big trouble  you can t just going around saying anything you want like that  some opinions have to be kept secret  for your own safety  besides  the dissident is pissing him off  doesn t he know that he should be grateful   the prisoner had finally left work  and was driving home  he wasn t feeling the relief that he normally did when the day was over though  he couldn t stop thinking about what the dissident had said  doesn t he know that there is no point in trying to change things  people have to work if they want to live  and if you want to work  you have to do whatever your boss says with a smile  and that is just the way things are  and if you work harder than everybody else  the prisoner tells himself  then one day they ll recognize that and you ll be rewarded  that s how the world works  his eyes flick towards the sensor   as he draws closer to city hall  he sees something that fuels his anger  the dozen or so sign holders from the morning had grown into a crowd of at least a hundred  illuminated by street lights  the single contemptuous policeman had become twenty  wearing helmets and holding riot shields  the police are stationed in between the front of city hall and the crowd of protesters  the protesters are moving up the steps and towards the large entrance as a pack  at the back of the crowd  just off the side of the street  he could see the woman from this morning holding the same sign   free yourself   the prisoner feels a surge of rage  who the fuck does she think she is  he is free  and he is happy  the prisoner s sweaty hands clutch the steering wheel  his face twisting with rage  that bitch doesn t know what she s talking about  doesn t she know that people get what they deserve  doesn t she know that things could be much worse  doesn t she know that  they  could take away what little we have if we piss them off   that woman with the sign is just as bad as the dissident  they should know better than to challenge the people who sign our checks   almost subconsciously  the prisoner starts to turn his steering wheel towards the object of his rage  soon he is swerving across lanes at the woman  who has her face turned towards city hall  within seconds his car would fly over the curb  destroying the woman who dared to imply that the prisoner was wasting his life   free himself  free himself from what  he has a job  he works hard  and one day they will give him what he deserves  there is nothing wrong with the system  people just want to be given things

that s not true  it can t be  if that s true then that means everything i ve sacrificed  my friends  my love life  my free time  my happiness  it was all for nothing   it was all for nothing   at the last second  the prisoner s car changes course  narrowly missing the woman  his body is shaking uncontrollably and drenched in a cold sweat    what the fuck was i thinking  the prisoner says to himself  he starts driving normally again  changing lanes to gain distance from the protesters   as his nerves slowly steady  he tries to figure out what had come over him  why had he done that  he could have killed that woman  and himself  he couldn t quite remember what line of thought had led him to such a drastic course of action  he ponders it for a few moments  then shrugs when he can t find the memory   he glances up out of his windshield at the sky  it s already dark out  winter days were especially short  and he stayed a few hours late at work  at the request of the warden  no stars  that s fine  the prisoner is a working man  his mind is on more important things  after all  the prisoner has work tomorrow ,er1ywq

337,I'm not depressed. It's my lack of freedom.,so as an mtf  i had to get my letter of diagnosis so i could start hrt  while discussing things with my therapist i started talking about some of my internal thoughts and dialogues   and as helpful as she has been  she's very set on me getting on antidepressants  this bothers me a lot because i'm very attuned with my inner mind and have spent a lot of time self reflecting   i know where my depression symptoms come from  and it's the fact that living in this world is like a constant battle  nearly every part of my day is spent actively going against my 'true nature'   i dont want a fucking pill that'll alter my brain to be more comfortable with this because its not just me  when i try to defer to google i get stats like   more than 25million american adults are on antidepressants   or 1 in 6 americans are on antidepressants  or more than a third of american adults are on medication related to depression   and i'm sure these numbers would be even higher if more people could afford healthcare and were given the chance to try to get help   but at what point do we stop and think weather there is really that many people with  chemical imbalances  in their brains  or maybe its that humans haven't spent the last 300000 years of evolution to exist in this system that we're forced to abide by today    i think its the latter   i know why i'm  depressed  and its because i'm terrified of financial instability  its because the only options i have are   work my dangerous hard labor exhausting job for barely decent pay  work an easier less dangerous and stressful job for worthless pay  probably still way more stressful than necessary   or take out impossible to pay off student loans and maybe get the job i want  which would still be barely decent pay   all of these options  by the way  still keep me locked in the 40 hour work week where i have no real control over my time   so you know what   i'm calling bullshit on this depression epidemic or whatever the fuck you want to call it   this is a result of people being forced to commit suicide of their personality  and ambitions in order to serve the system in the hope of having some smidgeon of financial security ,eqt5q7

346,"Well, this is it.",hello all  brace yourselves for a post of venting and a part of my life's story   i have had a bunch of thoughts lately about life  maybe this isn't the right place for it  but for me  it seems a better place than any for me to post  or maybe  vent  i've never been one to think that i'm depressed or in need of help  i also have a feeling in the back of my mind  that i have to  for whatever reason  justify my lifestyle   i went through all the normal things like school  work  social life  typical blah blah  school and work overlapped most towards my senior year in high school  since  i was a straight 'f' student  literally almost failed everything and was always told i never applied myself  which  to be completely honest  is absolutely not true  i was hardly ever motivated  i didn't have it in me  i just wanted to get out of there so bad  especially having been held back my freshman year  making it a 5 year high school run    moving on from my high school  i had literally no desire to continue schooling  i also had no idea what i was going to do to survive in adulthood  but for some reason  i wasn't anxious about it  i really didn't care  and still don't to this day  about  missing out  on college  so  i went into retail while still living with my mom and went from there  after that i got a pharmacy tech job that lasted 7 years  then bought a house at 24 years old  then went to be a medical technician  delivered hospital beds  etc  then a shred-it driver working the downtown city route  nightmare  especially in a decent sized truck  the money was great  and helping me definitely start paying off some of my debt from spending too much on music gear  lol    something happened though  i feel like i snapped one day  once  i would never have quit a job without another lined up  things began to change  while at shred-it  i started losing it with the 60 hour work weeks and the constant feeling of thinking   why am i spending my time making this money  and not being able to enjoy it  oh  wait  society expects people to be a drones for 60  years and then   have their fun  from what i can tell  most people i was around were workaholics  so i'd ask them what they were going to do when they retired  the depressing thing was  they'd always say they didn't want to  that they'd have no clue what to do if they didn't have work to do   after leaving shred-it  i left to work closer to my house at a local call center for a pharmaceutical company  i maybe lasted 5 weeks through the training  i overestimated my ability to multitask  and when i finally got on the first 'live' call  it was a nightmare to me  everything they trained me to do wasn't what the call pertained to  i started feeling immediately overwhelmed and stressed  i felt so trapped because   how am i going to pay my bills  i applied to other companies that were way less stressful  they would see my resume with 'pharmacy tech'  'med tech'  shred-it driver   not that those are prestigious  just more difficult than regular retail  and tell me that i was  overqualified  to work at retail   i'm legit not bragging  the titles are more prestigious then it sounds   here is where i am now though  i landed a job at a health food grocery store  i get in there trying to do my  be as available and helpful you can be  to the employer and my peers  things were fine for a time  met plenty of nice people  and would say i had the best direct boss  i'd ever had  however  certain things wore down over time  like usual  the company starts imposing quotas on things that were ridiculous  and just generally making things worse for employees   like i've experienced at all my jobs  i started getting interested in doordash and other gig economy jobs  did a few  and didn't mind doing it  fast forward to a few months after i start  i had told my boss to update my schedule since he volunteered me to another store for a day  however  since 3 people had control of my schedule  it never got changed  and me being lazy like i am  i didn't mark it down either  i woke up to a phone call the day i was suppose to be at the other store  a 30 minute drive away  everything flashed before me  my life  my jobs  all the bs  i decided to not answer it and shut it off  i really do feel bad for my former coworkers there  but  i seriously couldn't take the rat race anymore    here is where things turn for me  in a good way  i realized that i had to give the gig economy a try at least  so  i did more and more deliveries  still didn't make enough  i contemplated on selling the house and trying to either 'van life' it or buy an rv to live in  my mom panicked and offered to help me figure things out  so  with the massive help from my step-father and mother  we renovated a room in my house and turned it into an airbnb  i have been running it for a month now  and have had enough guests to be able to pay my entire monthly mortgage  by itself  now  i just drive and host  i have literally never in my life been happier  i can be a lazy mofo and not give a damn  i hardly set alarms anymore  i go to sleep randomly  sometimes i wake up at 11am  other days i sleep in til 5pm   that's right  5pm  because that is what i want to do   how can i pay all my bills just doing food delivery apps and guest hosting apps  i keep my stuff as low as i can  i never want to have kids  nothing against them  just not for me  i never want to get married  and i am pretty sure i bought my house in a  buyer's  market  my brother is a project manager for at a major company and can't even afford homes where i live now  you know why  he chose to get married  chose to get a degree  and when the marriage didn't work out because she wanted to talk to some other dudes  they had to sell the house they just bought  taking a massive hit   my point is  i didn't go to college  i live the mid-west  low cost of living  no kids  no wife  i live in my own basement  partially finished  play video games  smoke weed  watch dumbass shows  play guitar  record music  deliver food on the time of my own choosing  i honestly feel like i am retired now in a weird way  i will have walked away from all this owning a small business  being my own boss  no debt other than my mortgage  paid off car  i own everything i really even ever wanted  every day still  i always have this feeling that i am   getting away  with something  like  i am breaking the law or something  i honestly believe that this is all the things that society has told me  lingering in my head  hopefully it will go away one day

How did it work out ?,becoming increasingly more unhappy at my current job as time goes on  i don t earn enough to even buy or rent my own place and be independent which i think is another reason i m hating it as i m just thinking what s the point in working if i can t even earn enough to live the most basic of lives   i have enough money saved up to last me quite a while but i have nothing else lined up and i fear that even if i quit and enjoy some time of freedom i will simply end up doing the exact same job  retail  that i m doing now just at a different company that also doesn t value employees at all   anyone out there quit with nothing else lined up   did it work out for the better   worse   or the same  ,eqwwbp

351,How To STOP WORKING FOREVER IMMEDIATELY With The Freedom Dividend.,i posted this in the official andrew yang subreddit  and although this is a different subreddit  i wanted to get other thoughts about this too  this is a thought experiment i think is viable enough that i will try it out with four or five buddies that i have  if andrew yang is elected president   andrew yang's campaign revolves most centrally around implementing ubi  or the  freedom dividend  as he calls it of 1000 dollars a month for everyone in the united states over age 18  now  i'm sure that this policy is great for bringing everyone up to just under the poverty limit  and he believes that it will still encourage people to work to financially better themselves  he does reference various studies regarding hours worked with or without ubi  and it shows that there is little to no difference  but i can rebuttal against these fairly easily with these arguments  1  the people who were given ubi knew that it was a limited time ordeal  and not guaranteed over an entire lifetime  they had to continue to work in order to financially support themselves after the ubi trial was over  2  there haven't been any ubi trials done with an entire country  meaning that all of the inhabitants of that country receive a ubi  if this was the case  i am almost certain there would be a good number of people who also thought about doing what i am about to describe  and would be able to never work another day in there lives  given that the ubi is a lifetime guarantee  onto the step - by - step process   step 1  gather 4  buddies together  you need people that you can trust  you can even live with a special other  and invite another couple to get to 4 total people with 18  years of age   step 2  look for an apartment with 2  bedrooms  depending on who you are living with  buddies   special other   another couple  the number of bedrooms may vary  i found multiple listings for 4 bedroom apartments for up to 2000 dollars  with most being around the 1000 dollar to 1500 dollar range in my area   step 3  pool all of your money together and do some budgeting  the more people involved in this method  the less budgeting you will need to do  it all depends on the goals of the group  for instance  if i had 4 buddies together  we would receive a collective 4000 dollars a month  using a 4 bedroom apartment at 1500 dollars a month as a example  we would be left with 2500 dollars  factoring in food expenses and most other amenities  take off an additional 750 dollars a month  leaving us with 1750 dollars a month to do whatever we want with  i would personally invest it somewhere to grow it safely  probably in an index fund  but i could just as well spend all month partying with my buddies or playing video games  i never need to work again  if  for example  i don't like my buddies all that well  we can live separately as with most of the houses i examined the bedrooms were separated off from each other  no need to interact with each other if we don't particularly enjoy each other's company for whatever reason  again  this method works better with more people  for instance  instead of 4 buddies  i could have 8  an 8 bedroom apartment i found in my area costs 3000 dollars a month  8 buddies get a total of 8000 dollars a month with the freedom dividend  so after rent we are left with 5000 dollars a month  factoring in food and other amenities and we are left with 3500 dollars a month to do whatever we want to with  no need to work  more people in a group - more overall savings  more overall savings - more potential growth through investments  3500 dollars a month invested well can quickly make a fortune  so not only do you not need to work or do anything economically productive at all  you are potentially also getting significantly richer through investments and whatever compounding interest you do   again  this may be viable for a specific group of people  i  for one  absolutely hate working  and if i had the chance  like the one andrew yang is giving me  i would quit immediately  and no amount of money offered to me would change my mind  the fact that i am also very frugal and generally anti - materialism   consumerism only helps me in this scenario  i am wondering if anyone else plans to do this on this subreddit like i am if andrew yang is elected president and passes the freedom dividend  what are your thoughts on this ,erkb9u

359,Excellent succinct summation of the last 40 years of corporate and CEO/Elite treason, link http cluborlov blogspot com 2019 08 resurrecting-american-economy html   donald trump has recently ordered us corporations to move production out of china and into the us  easier said than done or  rather  undone  moving production to china  and  in case of it  to india  allowed us corporations to benefit from the large wage differential and an easier regulatory environment in order to be more profitable  they spent these excess profits by buying back their own stock  paying generous dividends to their shareholders and using their artificially inflated stock prices to justify exorbitant executive salaries and bonuses   along the way  they impoverished american workers by depriving them of gainful deployment  eroded the skill base of the american population and  perhaps most importantly  destroyed demand for their products because more and more americans could no longer afford them  as these trends played out  making china prosperous and the us increasingly distressed and impoverished  with close to 100 million working-age people permanently jobless  us corporations could no longer profit from their offshored production to the same extent  and so they took advantage of low interest rates to borrow huge sums of money and use it to continue buying back their own shares  paying dividends and continuing with the exorbitant executive compensation   by now  many of the major us corporations are financial zombies  waiting for an uptick in interest rates to drive them into bankruptcy  and it is these zombies that are being tasked with bringing production back to the us  good luck with that  which is to say  it is highly unlikely that such an effort could possibly succeed  but even if it could succeed  would it solve the problem which is that the us is gradually degenerating into a bankrupt third world country  perhaps not  because  you see  the entire theory of  making america great again  is based on a fallacy which is that china became the world s largest economy  by purchasing power  and the world s factory simply by virtue of the fact that american corporations offshored production to it ,er0eml

361,Here's a story from my retail days that I think you'll enjoy: The time I organized a worker's revolt and won.,when i was younger  i worked as an assistant manager for a local outlet of a large sporting goods company  once a year  we would have a week-long sidewalk sale  and it was a gruelling week  shifts started at 7am and ended past 11pm  to save money  the district sales manager hired the minimum amount of staff and paid them minimum wages  plus it was august so it was hot and humid outside  which is where we spent the bulk of the day   so here's the first kicker  as an assistant manager  i was under contract  so despite working 75  hours in one week  i was only getting paid my normal wages  the part-time hires were forced to leave their day early to avoid overtime  so at the end of every day it was just me and the manager and our third key  we were all miserable and exhausted   for the record  the manager and third key were both  work until you die  types and constantly complained that the young part-timers were lazy  which was not true at all    however  the long  shitty week was due to end on labour day  which is a national holiday and a much needed day off  everyone was looking forward to it  the weekend before  the big boss came to see how things were doing  and he inquired about how much it would cost to pay the fines for being open on a holiday versus the money we would make in sales  the fine was a laughable amount  so mister big boss decided that we would be working that day instead   when i was told this news  i almost became delirious  and i made a decision that i still congratulate myself for today  despite the entire staff being told that we will be open  i quietly went to every single part time employee  their average age was 16  i was 18  and told them that there was a change in plans and that in reality we would be closed  i made it clear that tomorrow morning they could stay in bed and spend the day with their families  they were a little suspicious but i reassured them saying  if they call you  tell them i gave you the day off and that you won't be coming in because you made plans with your family  also  they aren't going to fire all of you  just me   come monday  nobody showed up including yours truly  around 8 30am i got a panicked call from my douchebag sales manager asking whether or not it was true that i gave everyone the day off  i said yes  and that i wasn't planning on showing up either  i was promptly fired  but they had to cancel the day because they were only four employees   take that  corporate assholes ,erey9p

366,The managerial/owner classes and “free stuff” (Semi-rant),back in september  i  along with two others from my department at work  were unceremoniously transferred to a different department  at the time  management explained that there was not enough demand for work in our department to justify our staying on - this despite the fact that there was never a shortage of work to go around   as the departmental move allowed me to work from home  i semi-reluctantly accepted the new position   fast-forward to today  when i receive an email from my old boss  because my old department is now horrendously understaffed - and who could have ever predicted that  am i right  - i m now expected to pitch in on my down time to help them on an ongoing basis   i will not be receiving an increase in my wages for this extra work   this is a story repeated over and over again in late-capitalist america  working people are expected to take on ever more labor  work ever longer hours and ever increase their productivity for the same  or less  pay  and it should therefore be abundantly clear to anyone paying attention that it s the managerial and owner classes who really want  free stuff  - free man-hours  free labor and free output  they want it from you and me  and they know that they can take it  because - by and large - we have no other choice but to accept their terms   by contrast  the  free stuff  that we want is nothing more than our fair share of what is being taken from us  and we want you to have yours  too ,eq9owj

This is why corporations have such incompetent management,so i work at amazon and i've avoided taking on any more responsibility at the job because management is just one big clique of assholes  and they don't give me enough hours to want to do more work    there was an internal job posting for a position we call a lane monitor  basically your an associate who does whatever the fuck you were already doing  but management can come tap you on the shoulder and ask you to run a specific lane while they do something else  fuck around with their friends in the back  i don't mind doing this since i won't have to put up with the other assholes and i get to do the same job i've been doing basically  just with more power   there's also an opening for a trainer so i'm taking a risk applying as they might try to get me to do that but i'll get more hours so i guess it's not all that bad  now we get into the meat of the story   i went to hr to get the application and they have this white chick that's fairly new  i included her race because most of the complaints about her come from all the minorities in the building but she could just be an asshole  i don't know  i asked her for one of the applications and her ass snapped at me with attitude   you can't get one right now  i knew this was a lie because a good acquaintance of mine held the position before getting promoted and they've been begging people for the last week or 2 to apply  i was seconds away from walking off before another manager lady walked up and cut her off saying   hi awesometjgreen  the applications are over there sweety  and she pointed me in the right direction all while hr bitch gave a look of shock and anger all twisted into one   now this manager lady for some unknown reason is really nice to me  she's a raging bitch as well  i've seen her write people up and turn all red over the slightest of mistakes  yet whenever she comes by to check my work  pretend she's working  she's super polite and talks about her family and shit   if it weren't for her stepping in i wouldn't even be able to apply for the shitty job  this is why greedy corporations deserve to fail  they only promote their friends or people they like regardless of who they are or what skills they bring to the table  i wouldn't be surprised if after i turn this shit in and wait i see some bootlicker get the position and we have to deal with him or her fucking up everything  they just promoted some dude to our logistics team  directing the trucks and shit  and he's literally been fucking that up for weeks since he basically has no experience on the job ,eojgdr

419,Organizing For A Work-Optional Tomorrow,i've been lurking on this sub for a few months now  and i'm finding it equal parts cathartic and frustrating  i feel like we're collectively on the cusp of some greater good  but i don't know that we're anywhere closer to actually doing something about it   in many ways  i count myself very lucky  i have what many people would consider a very comfortable job doing something that i usually enjoy  but  so many other people  aren't  this lucky  and even i have times when i'd rather be doing something else for a while  it frustrates and angers me that virtually no one has the freedom to simply take a few months to focus on some particular hobby  or to take a chance on some new potential career  all because taking those opportunities comes with incredible potential risk in our society   it's 2020  and we're just starting to realize that work should not define us  we're more than a job  i firmly and deeply believe that not  everybody  has to work  and i look forward to the day when automation has made more free time for more people  but  man  getting from here to ther is going to be  messy as hell  and i'm not real excited about that  all you have to do is be honest about this stuff on social media and watch the backlash to know that a large portion of the population is not ready to hear this truth   so  what do we do about it  how do we educate and advocate for ourselves  i lean pretty left  but i think there's an opportunity here to rally around freedom from work without tying ourselves to any particular political party or political movement  i don't think you need to be a socialist to see this stuff  even a die-hard capitalist can be convinced that in a modern economy there can be more individual freedom from tying work to the ability to simply live a modest  decent life   anyway  i would love to hear what other people think about this  do you have experience doing political organization and advocacy  what do you think   to quote bob black   workers of the world  relax ,epnw15

450,Mandatory Conference?,my employer is having a company wide conference next week   it's in the big city next town over     they got all of us a hotel room and bought out bars restaurants   it's a 2 day trip with 8 hours of exciting  breakout sessions  and speeches each day from the big dawgs   then a  mandatory  cocktail hour  professional attire is also  mandatory   i am not attending   when i received the invitation in my email there was an option  if you cannot attend  please decline your invite by selecting 'no'  so i selected no   now it is apparently a problem as managers have told all of us that the meetings throughout the day are mandatory   i haven't had a discussion with my boss yet  but i'm kind of surprised at how my employer feels entitled to my time so much as to attempt to require me to leave my wife and pets at home  or bring my wife with me and board my pets   it's like they are shocked that i'm not jumping at the chance to go spend a full 48 hours with my coworkers     i made another post the other day on this sub about the slap in the face of a pay increase we all just received   i really don't feel like the company has displayed enough interest in my future to warrant my submission of so much of my own time and energy     i expect some backlash  if not today  when everyone returns from the conference   not sure how i'll respond to their questions ,eq216w

501,What I’m learning to unlearn: valuing my moral character by how productive I was that day,this is a semi rant-   i m only a college student  and yet i already do this    every night i look back at my day and think to myself - was i productive  did i get enough done  if not  i feel anxious  like i m lazy  useless  a mooch to a society    i ve felt guilty even looking at my phone for five seconds at internships  even when there was absolutely nothing for me to do  i get it  they don t like the millennials and zoomers wasting time on their phones  though i can tell you right now my bosses sure take time to sit on the couch and do nothing   i ve worked at a summer camp before where i was so hot and overworked with these impossible children that i got a heat stroke and fell asleep  no one asked me if i was ago  all i got was a reprimand and a warning - and if you re wondering  it was a 40 hour job with below minimum wage pay  i got a fever multiple times that summer  and was still required to swim with the children even if i was sick or having a very heavy period  keep in mind  i was a minor at this time  so apparently that means i m strong enough and have the free time to do this without a fuss  because i m supposedly naturally energetic  and never have dealt with stress before  obviously    the level of work i put in for college classes is insane  and the competition to do well vastly overshoots the need to learn  ask anyone  they d cheat on a test or project to avoid getting a bad grade even if that meant they never actually learned the material or did their own work  why  because the fear that you won t get the grades to graduate and get a good job outweighs any sort of desire to just learn and be a better person  when i ve expressed this opinion to people they sort of just laugh  it s too idealistic  i ll resent this type of thinking when i m older  college is for a career  not to get a major in underwater basketweaving gender studies  or at least that s what i ve been told   not to mention  i have to take so many hours that i usually don t have time for more than one meal a day  or at least one meal where i actually can sit down and eat    i m in an artistic field  though in a branch that s supposedly more organized and lucrative  everything is about what hustles i ve done to pit on my resume  i d rather work on less things and spend more time on them  but that doesn t appear as credible  i ve been chastised by peers for dropping some things due to the stress they put on me   you ll never get a job if you don t hustle  it s the mentality    even my parents have made fun of me for spending time relaxing  even when i m reading  which i thought was supposed to be intellectually stimulating and good for you   point is  all of this has led me to hate myself for simply wanting to take time off  for wanting to sleep enough at night and taking time for my own things  i want to unlearn this  and i intend to  i do want a job and i want to be independent  but i also want to live and be a human and actually enjoy the world around me  i know i m not the only young person who feels this way but is told they just don t know enough to make these types of statements    ya feel ,ep5w52

612,Mods Respond to Survey Feedback,hey  y'all  as always thank you so much for your continued participation and support of this subreddit  we make this survey twice a year  not only so we know who is using this subreddit for their benefit  but also so we can have your feedback and thus improve   we got lots of  thank you 's  which is really sweet  much appreciate that   here's some feedback and suggestions we thought notable     free talk friday   gt i think a regular share your misery   solidarity thread would be nice   according to the survey  roughly 30  of the users miss the weekly  free talk friday  thread  while 68  don't care either way  so we decided to bring it back  automod will post and pin a thread every week from now on        why do we care    gt thanks for putting this together and reading the responses   you care more about my feedback than anyone i've ever worked with   and   gt making a poll shows you're quite serious about the quality of the subreddit   not saying that's bad or good but i sort of assumed this was the fruit of someone's shitty work day   is there any goal or agenda you're trying to accomplish   the main reason we do these surveys polls is that u onedayitwillbedaisy is bit of a data nerd  but yeah  we really do care about the quality of the subreddit  as for a goal  well the goal is to reduce folks' workload  feelings of isolation in hating work and maybe  some day  ending work itself  this survey helps us towards that by improving this sub as a platform for those goals        election   gt i'm not american   sorry about the americentrism in this survey   editor's note  i take all the blame for badly written questions  we should try to always generalize and make our questions as accessible as possible and if there's any way for us to do this in the future  let us know        free speech   gt try to not suppress free speech  no freeze peaches here  sorry  the subreddit has rules  it is heavily moderated and we plan to keep it this way  we know this is a pretty stone cold response  but there isn't much else to say  we aren't the government and therefore don't have any obligation to the 1st amendment        positivity    gt it would be cool if there was more discussion and solidarity in this sub  although i agree with the premise 100  i find browsing it to be depressing   and   gt people whine a lot  could do with some positivity  and   gt please don't let this subreddit turn into another  r collapse https www reddit com r collapse   comment by u abolishwork    this sub  does  have a propensity for depressing news and though we as mods try to uplift some positive threads  e g  people getting out of the rat race  people quitting their jobs and feeling great  people trying to build worker solidarity  the negative tends to outweigh the positive  this is something we are well aware of but have mixed opinions on  some of us think the negativity is important in of itself  i e  it's not whining and that's dismissive  but that the human psyche can often overplay the   negative to the detriment of the positive  part of us rectifying that will be to put in weekly free friday chats  which will hopefully get more discussion and more positivity  we'll also try to pin threads we think are awesome anti-work threads that highlight the positivity that can be inherent in the movement   as for  r collapse https www reddit com r collapse  i think there's some genuine risk of  doomer  talk getting a hold of the sub  but similar to my other point i think mods have enough tools in their arsenal to combat that push  i also think there is much more general negativity towards capitalism and the state then about all of us needing to build emergency shelters  fallout basements and gather water bottles and canned foods  that's my perspective and experience though  maybe someone else has more to say   comment by u onedayitwillbedaisy     i don't like the  life sucks and we can't do much about it  vibe of some posts and comments  but i don't have to like everything on the subreddit  probably the best way to bring some positivity to r antiwork is to share things that inspire you  and upvote stuff you wanna see more of       amp x200b     solidarity    gt i love this place  but we have to watch out that we fight together against work rather than fight each other  i've seen a lot of fighting between physical labourers and office workers  each insisting that they have it the worst  we need solidarity with each other   yup  let's not fight each other         more demographic stuff   gt more demographic stuff like race  marital status  age  and sexuality would be cool to see  noted  we asked about age in  january 2019 https www reddit com r antiwork comments apywuf survey results  and  july 2019 https www reddit com r antiwork comments cei8pp survey results  both with similar results  it should give you an idea of how old the anti-worker is on average        reposts   gt i see a lot of reposts  as in the front page of antiwork will often have duplicates   for the record  we remove lots of reposts  almost every day  sometimes we allow duplicates within a short time span  because for some reason the second post often gets a lot more attention  and it doesn't make sense to remove the first one  the best way to help us deal with reposts is to report them        privacy   gt if possible  maybe don t use google surveys   ok  that one's from the survey we did in july last year  i honestly forgot to look for a good alternative  so to make up for that  i wanna ask you to check out  privacytools io https www privacytools io  a site that provides services  tools and knowledge to protect your privacy against global mass surveillance   basically  it tells you why you should use firefox rather than chrome  and what alternatives there are to twitter  gmail  whatsapp  etc        book club   gt a book club  not joking  like a monthly book the subreddit could read and comment on if they chose   not the first time this was suggested  we're currently busy with other stuff  e g  this survey  expanding the faq  etc  but we'll keep the book club thing on our to-do list

621,A bit of a rant about pay to play employment,i recently applied for a job for a tax company as a customer service representative and receptionist  i have an interview later this week  researching them i found i need to take an expensive  350  course that for my area would require a bit of travel  i'm guessing the price but it's listed around  300 to start before  well taxes   all to work for minimum wage assuming you pass   in canada that's not as terrible as it it in the us but yeah forking over money for training they should give workers for free is just bad  i realize it's partly to make sure people are serious about the job  yet knowing that after you pay the fee and do the course it's still not guarantee you're even going to have a job at the end of it is just unethical     if it's about just learning software  they really should offer it as free training especially if you are already hired   i think insurance in my area is the same  - even worse because you are told to take a  prep  course before getting licensed at the first level  no wonder why the recruiter was interested in me  guy with about 1 5 years of experience  because they saw a way to make money off me first    imagine hired at mcdonalds and have to pay them to train you to flip burgers instead of providing free employee training which for a job that does not require experience in doing so should be logical and done  that's how this feels  it's an insult  and yes  only for minimum wage and from what i've read the job dealing with angry customers   i remember a slogan in mcdonalds about  earn while you learn  i feel like this experience is going to be more  pay to learn and maybe if you're lucky you'll earn later ,elsaal

646,Why is nothing ever done about bad bosses?,i work in fast food  there is this manager who has had it for me for awhile now because she thinks i'm disrespectful and mean when in reality most of the time i've been  disrespectful  are because i'm overloaded with stress  tired  or have been working my ass off and am not in the mood    maybe it's because it's mcdonalds  but they have this thing about standing around when we have nothing to do  but sometimes  depending on which position you're working there's literally nothing to do  especially for the position i work every shift  which is back boothe    it's kind of retarded because if we have no orders or anything  this manager won't let us joke around with one another or have any fun  i get it's work  but i don't have the luxury of being able to go out whenever i want  work is the only place i go other than home  because i don't have many friends  sometimes i just don't know what to talk about either  because i've become so used to being alone that i tend to think about shit nobody else is thinking about  it weirds people out    but i've had several incidents with this manager sending me home for no reason  all include yelling at me over something small  i don't understand how it's acceptable to mistreat the people who work for you    she kicked me out last time and told my boss i quit even though she told me to go home  it doesn't make sense as to why she still works there    today she yelled at me in front of a customer for  not being nice to customers  because i was trying to take this guys order and also take money  like guy over the speaker was asking me a question  and she was yelling at me to talk to my customers but since i was busy handing the guy money i couldn't stop what i was doing  apparently that warrants me being yelled at and sent home as punishment ,en0klk

710,My idea on how change can be achieved,i don't believe voting for the right political party can work  not because ethical political parties don't exist  but because the wealthy people who control the current unethical parties are too powerful to let someone they don't like thanks charge    i don't have proof to support that there are powerful people who decide who gets to be president and who gets to pass laws  i just believe it from what i see  the few times someone who has honourable ethos actually becomes president  they are either killed  taken down by other means  or the changes they made are reverted as soon as they step down  those who control the world have the power to put the people they want in the government and they also have power over through other means  like corrupted judges  police and military higher ups  etc   if someone has proof or indication that the above isn't true  they are welcome to enlighten me   back to my point  the basis of their power is money  through vast wealth they control almost everything  except other wealthy people   so in my head the only real way to counteract their wealth is with wealth  wealthy individuals with honourable ethos needs to group up and push their own agenda  push their own candidates for presidents etc  they can also focus on using their wealth to improve humanity wellbeing in other ways  like nonprofit humanitarian aid  fighting climate change etc   wealthy people with honourable ethos might sound impossible for some people but i don't think that's true  again i don't have proof  i just feel it's actually impossible that there aren't any ethical corporations that treat their workers as best as they can  ask yourself  if you were the wealthy owner of a business  would you not treat your employees as best as you could  i know i would  i can't be the only one   also don't forget  we live in an era where a lot of people make loads of money from youtube  blogs  etc  ways that don't have workers to take advantage of   so  if you ask me  you should probably focus on achieving wealth and using it to better our world  although  personal exploration  expression and freedom do come first  so try to build wealth in a way that fulfills you  and that's probably the best way to achieve wealth    i understand that we live in suffocating times  but i believe there also more opportunities than ever   thanks for reading ,ektnuh

717,Stepping up to a role with higher responsibility,so  i am working as a business analyst and ours is a medium size firm and we are understaffed in a lot of departments  my boss has been asking me to  step up  and assume more responsibilities  i e  take up a line management project management role  as it would impact how they plan out my career development and offer me raises and promotions in the long run  i e  entice the slave with some carrots    i said my thanks for the consideration but no to the offer  one reason i gave is project management and business analyst are two different skill sets and i am already over stretched with the tasks i have as it is so taking on more work will end up in me underperforming in both the areas    secondly my role  salary and hours of work are what i have been signed on for as a part of my contract and i am not ambitious to develop my career for promotions i am not interested in and skills i don't have any inclination to develop  i'd rather love to progress as a senior business analyst at some point in future i e a few years before i retire and till then continue the same work i have been doing   the above two reasons are incompatible with the  real life situations  with work because you never get to work on things you enjoy working on and end up doing a crap load of work that you have no heart and will to do  i am sure my refusal will come up in the annual appraisal discussions  which is another story altogether  and i will be told that i am  inflexible   siloed   not a leader  etc but fuck all that    the mantra with all organisations is the same    1  hire resources and overstretch them with work  2  fire resources and add additional work on the resources that are left 3  of the resources that are left identify the ones which are relatively good in work desperate for money and entice them to step up and take in additional roles  4  ask nicely  if they say yes  battle is won and load them with more work  if they say no   bring it up in annual appraisal and force them to take up the additional work by indirectly giving an indication they will be let go 5  the good desperate employee reluctantly takes the additional responsibilities  gets stressed   is unable to perform and loses whatever little motivation is left and starts looking for other jobs 6  employee finally resigns and starts a new job - but continues to step 1 in the new firm,elfv0f

729,This subreddit is my gold.,i come here regularly to know i'm not alone   i don't believe life  who we are is the sum of being a slave to an employer or a benefit system   it is absolute bullshit to force people into work when a significant proportion of the population were born into a situation where they never had to care about it because they were born into money   what i've learnt is there are also a lot of highly paid 60  hour workers who are just as stupid as forcing everyone to do pointless work  once you get past a certain income level you could chuck it in  shove your money in savings and live off of that   does the queen work  no  does anyone in the royal family in the uk really 'work'  no  not like forced to  and that's simply an accident of birth   fuck this life of the rich trying to make you suck their assholes to make them feel better about themselves   find yourself  find your dreams  keep speaking your truth  great reading everything you all post  something for thought  surely with all the riches the rich own  if they really thought about it  if they really wanted to that could give what would be a relatively small amount to them to someone to live without being 'forced' to work  they wouldn't even have to give it - they could make the interest from it in a bank account and give it to someone who wasn't born into their situation  it'd be no sniff to them  with all the money in the world and resources we have  i'm sure this could be done if people accepted a basic standard of living and a few niceties  get rid of greed  live from only what you need  pool together for cheaper food  help each other find the cheapest deals  this would all be possible with a caring  loving society that wants to flourish and help everyone follow their best path   also  animals  they don't work  they hunt for food  thats it  we're animals really  yes we're expected to follow rules laws  most people rarely do this and its only these that hold them accountable  the rich don't follow rules or laws  their money helps them stay clear of them or buy their way out of it when they fuck up   capitalism is bullshit  we need some serious changes in life  for starters booting out all the narccistics and rich dickheads who go about encouraging this system because it makes them feel good about themselves  that's all it is   when the world starts to become about good character rather than just making money  the right people will be around to make the world better and we can ostracise the people who have no morals  who don't give a damn  it's clear most of the rich don't give one  because remember they need the poor to be rich   i would seriously like to start a uk group with meetups  i really struggle with my own personal struggles daily so this may be a push for me  we need to see some siginifcant changes in this lifetime to stop the suicide rate - but honestly i'm starting to think its on purpose  we're overpopulated  and if you've ever read anything about narccistic abuse well thats what they want  if you're poor  struggling  not finding ways to be happy then the rich get off on you dying  stay alive  find ways forward  best find ways to find you be above this system that defines you and who you are by a paycheck and a job and find a way to be happy  that will piss them off the most   to be clear i believe in keeping busy  doing things you love  being productive and helping others when you can  i believe in doing these in a way that best supports you  not being exhausted  keeping fit and healthy and not being forced in a kafka esque way to do  it's unnatural and disgusting to expect another human being to do anything really productive with a finger and a camera pointed at them all day scrutinising them for the benefit of the ego of another  i also believe in the value and serenity of doing nothing   keep being awesome,ek3kh0

745,It's a small thing but...,i work for a large  well-known christian charity  although not christian myself  which makes every official meeting awkward as fuck because we're expected to participate in prayers and devotionals  also being a bi butch woman when this charity is well known for their transphobia and homophobia is fun  i'm a groundskeeper  i enjoy the work  my supervisor is a pretty decent  understanding guy with a thorough dislike for the shit that comes with capitalism  he's straight up told me to prioritize myself over this company  because no company will care for my health    but without fail  i'm consistently getting fucked over by his boss  the supervisor for our department and the same department at another building  who has no real conception of what our building needs  we all consistently get dicked around by him endlessly   so in this last week  he moved one of our two custodians to the other building  decided we only need one custodian  when 2 could barely manage to stay on top of everything  and told us that we as a department need to share the remaining custodial responsibilities  shit sucks  but alright    with that change  they decided to list a job posting for a second maintenance person  despite our current guy having pretty much everything covered  another change that makes 0 fucking sense  but i'm not the big boss so what the hell do i know    as a groundskeeper  i'm responsible for snow removal  which means i need to be here before the building opens  in order to clear the entrances and parking lots  previously i was in at 7  but the maintenance guy made an issue because he has young kids and is a single father  so he needs to be home when they're off school  i get bumped to coming in at 8  which makes my job harder when the maintenance guy doesn't help with snow  but i understand and don't have an issue helping him out   i come in today though to find that i'm now working the custodial shift  930-6  which means parking lots won't be cleared  entrances might be  but we're most likely gonna be getting complaints because things aren't done in time  and despite everything  those complaints will be reflecting on me directly  with the added bonus of working the custodial evening shift  1-930  on fridays  and covering friday events  which we're supposed to alternate covering  but i've been working every one of them for months   today  i've been assigned cleaning duties on top of snow removal  the maintenance guy is doing his usual stuff  so the whole  sharing custodial duties  is yet to happen   i suspect that rather than actually sharing these duties  they're being pushed onto me  and when the new maintenance person is hired  they'll be taking over snow removal mainly  and it'll be pretty likely that the new person is a guy  just statistically speaking  so i've been corralled into being a custodian by the looks of it  without so much as a  do you mind helping out   the other day the maintenance guy said to me that  it'll be good if you do more cleaning  snow removal is hard  especially for a female  this will make it easy on you  nevermind the fact that i've been doing an excellent job imo of staying on top of this massive property with very little help  despite the fact that he's supposed to help me  i don't really want to make a stink about this comment  he and i get along well  aside from this  english isn't his first language  and he comes from a very traditional country  trying to explain why benevolent sexism is an issue is hard normally  with these added factors i think it'll just lead to an argument that i don't feel like having  not to mention  cleaning isn't fucking easy    i'm not making an issue of the shift change yet  tbf i did ask my supervisor if he could change my shift because driving in rush hour doubles my drive time  which i can't afford the gas for  but if i start being told to do more custodial  i'm going to make an issue  aside from the maintenance guy's comment  no one has said anything about me being female making me better at cleaning  lmao he should see my house  he'd change his mind  but i feel as though it's being heavily implied  and i'm being pushed out of my position and into custodial because i'm female   on top of all this  they pay minimum wage  and or far below the average for these positions  most people who work here end up using the services they provide to low income people  i'm consistently short every month  and during christmas  they had the audacity to all but demand we volunteer for their charity drive because that's where they make all their money  all this while my big boss can afford to go to europe for a month  but we're supposed to grit our teeth and be grateful that we work for a company with such a great mission to help the poor  they sell us this idea  and i'll admit for a while i was proud to help out  but now i realized that the more people who use their services  the more grants they can qualify for  they're keeping us in poverty so they can continue making the big bucks   i'm going for surgery at the end of the month  i'll be off for two months for recovery  my province is in a pretty big recession  and just lost a shit ton of jobs thanks to our new shit head corporate shill government  my plan was to find a new job in that time  but it's looking more and more like i'll be stuck here  these bastards don't even offer short term disability  i was told my sick days are my  insurance  which is great and all  for someone who never gets sick  that's not me   i don't know if i should even bother making an issue about this or not  because if i bring up how sexist it is to force the only woman doing a  man's job   as the previous custodian described my position  into cleaning  they can wriggle out of it pretty easy because nothing was  directly  said about it   sorry for the rant  i'm angry and have nowhere to turn  my bf is tired of hearing about this shit ,ekw4op

765,Notice how workplaces want to make the most out of the working day yet only give you the least amount of annual leaves?,i made a similar comment to this a few weeks ago to an askreddit post but unfortunately didn't get any traction  nobody else really contributed lol  this is probably quite flawed but hope you can see what i mean   so anyway  to elaborate on the title  in many countries there is typically law that specifies the minimum number of hours an employee must work per week to be considered full-time  as well as a maximum number of hours worked before overtime pay comes into play  in the us  if you work 30 hours per week  apparently the irs considers you a full time employee and the department of labor requires overtime pay for any work over 40 hours   same goes for annual leave  there's usually a law on the minimum number of days an employee must be granted every year  something between 10-20 days for a lot of countries   here's the thing  notice how pretty much all places of work requires you to work 8 hours everyday for a total of 40 hours per week yet you're only granted the minimum number of annual leaves per year    the places we work for are willing get away with as much as they can on us  i bet you if we didn't get overtime pay until after 10 hours  while still getting paid the same amount as when we work 8  most companies won't hesitate to make 10-hour days the standard number of hours we must work everyday   of course  i'm not talking about all companies  there are probably few great ones that grant 6 hour work days with 40-hour workweek pay as well as being very generous with their annual leaves  but i think i have a better chance of dating that cute girl i saw at the mall if i asked her out as soon as i meet her than finding a company like that ,ekjqe2

797,Age 37. Some perspective and lessons learned.,i have experienced it all  over a dozen jobs  3 different career paths  hunger  cold  homelessness  clinical depression  loss  and years of isolation  all of this with asperger's   i have learned some truths that those who have not experienced my situation do not  first of all  work is not optional unless you are born into money  most jobs involve working only to make enough to pay rent  food  commute  and self-maintenance  which means absolutely nothing left for anything else   work in 2019 is more akin to slavery for most people on earth  most countries have more vacant homes than they do homeless people  you can google that  and most countries produce more food than can be consumed by people   yet  the world is still made to struggle  the rich are slowly increasing their life expectancy while average people die at the same ages they did 20 years ago  all governments are actively consolidating power over their citizens to make them better and more desperate workers  healthcare is closely tied to your job almost everywhere  your boss is allowed to tell you what you can and cannot say and what you can and cannot do in your personal life outside of work  people get fired for it all the time  especially social networking   it starts with schools  schools force kids to get out of bed early in the morning against their will and then sit in a facility all day  being told what to do and learning subservience and giving up control of their days to other people  preparing them for a lifetime of servitude to the 1   37 years on this earth  most of those years either in forced training  school  or employed  and this is my take-away ,eiji0s
