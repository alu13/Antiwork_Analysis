52,Scrum - cult?,every time i mention that scrum is micromanagement on steroids either in work  or in dev-related forums many angry developers coming out of the woodworks frothing at the mouth about how i  just don't understand scrum  or that i  am obviously not skilled enough  and that's why scrum doesn't work for me   the scrum manifesto and how scrum is wielded by management in workplaces are very different things  the reactions of my fellow devs give me the impression of some capitalist cult kneejerk reaction  i swear the software industry has the largest proportion of kool-aid drinkers ,cv6js4

54,My Boss is Holding My Raise Hostage,so  in my 20s it might seem like a real problem not to have a driver's license  but i have a perfectly good reason  that reason being  severe general anxiety disorder  i got my permit at 15 and tried to start  but i quickly learned it destroyed my nerves because i was so afraid on the road  i thought this might go away as i was assured  but it did not after several months and eventually i gave up  to this day i am relying on rides to get to work  it's not an imposition  my house and work are right along their commute path     amp x200b   i give you this context because today i learned from my boss that i had elapsed by probationary period two weeks ago  but i would not be receiving the concurrent pay raise that would usually come with the end of that period because he didn't trust that my ride to and from work would be reliable  despite the fact that they have proven otherwise  not once have i even come close to being late for my shift     amp x200b   i tried to protest and point out why i didn't have my license yet  but he has still refused until i can present a valid driver's license to him  so  in essence  i am either going to be forced to drive which will induce severe daily stress and anxiety on me  or i will simply continue to make the shit pay i currently make for all of eternity      whiile any advice for dealing with this would be appreciated if anyone knows some way around this for certain  i made this post simply to highlight another workplace abuse in the long long string of them ,cukz3e

57,"My job completely prevents me from taking care of myself, it's so frustrating.",i've been getting all these health issues  which were most likely triggered by stress from work  all the hours of work cause me to put off doctor's appointments to treat the health problems my employer caused in the first place  and everything worsens   i've also had a pest issue in my home  and car issues  my job has slowed down the process of treating these things - it's like they all pile up and linger  but if i worked less during the week  i could take care of them in a few weeks   i'm quitting my job soon  and i have this huge list of things to catch up on that i couldn't do because of work  doctor's appointments  pest control  etc  it made me truly realize how much my job holds me back   i find it absolutely insane how people have no problem with a work arrangement that is so intrusive  god forbid  if any disasters happen in your life  you can't just take a break to take care of yourself  no matter what  you haver to be at your employer's service 5 days a week  all day  then  there's only so much you can do during the weekend on top of regular life responsibilities  grocery shopping  cleaning  cooking  exercise  bills  etc   what pisses me off even more is that the employer prevents you from taking the paid leave you rightfully earned by imposing pointless deadlines and arranging mandatory meetings  shit happens in life  we should be able to just take a break if emergencies come up  the way we are treated is disturbingly inhumane   i cannot wait to quit and finally be able to take care of all these lingering life issues  i just want everything to go back to normal ,cvfczv

61,I found this excerpt a while ago when and it’s really stuck with me. When I came across this sub it made me realise how many other people feel this., but the 8-hour workday is too profitable for big business  not because of the amount of work people get done in eight hours  the average office worker gets less than three hours of actual work done in 8 hours  but because it makes for such a purchase-happy public  keeping free time scarce means people pay a lot more for convenience  gratification  and any other relief they can buy  it keeps them watching television  and its commercials  it keeps them unambitious outside of work  we ve been led into a culture that has been engineered to leave us tired  hungry for indulgence  willing to pay a lot for convenience and entertainment  and most importantly  vaguely dissatisfied with our lives so that we continue wanting things we don t have  we buy so much because it always seems like something is still missing      your lifestyle has already been designed,cwmp6o
62,Why are people constantly saying 40 hour work week?,i have yet to see a job in my experience or those around me that is really  40 hours a week  where i live if you're on 40 hours a week  you're on a salary  we all know a salary is a safety net for employers  with no advantage for employees  that 40 hour week is often 45  50 hours  because you have to eat shit with a fixed income and work overtime as a slave   if it's not specifically 40 hours a week on salary  it's at least ten more or ten less  ten less and you struggle to survive  ten more and you don't get to live any kind of life  if you're in a rostered industry  kiss your ass goodbye to any money over your allocated hours - it's not your employers fault that you're taking 11 hours to do a 10 hour job  right   this  40 hour week  bullshit is just a self-perpetuating lie now  it's a minority of cases  honestly i wish it existed as the majority sometimes   what's the solution  i think it's a 4 day work week that pays the full five  32 hours a week with a wage inflated to represent a 40 hour one  work less  have more fun  and also come back to work more productive knowing your employer gives a fuck about 1  your life and 2  your need for money in order to thrive as a person   the company would be making a sacrifice for the worker because they want to  not because they have to  i think that's the first and only step forward to success ,cwycit

65,I hate my job,i get criticised every week and i've only been here about a month  they're saying my customer service is bad because i don't know where the things in the shop are when someone asks me  and they're saying i don't stock the shelves enough and that's cause i'm serving customers  the manager was saying that my colleagues were complaining about me and it makes me feel shit and now i feel that i can't trust anyone who i work with  i try my best at the job but i'm still criticised  i also feel i have too many responsibilities because i was left to close the shop on my own  and i'd been left with all the deliveries to put on the shelves so i didn't have time to brush the floor  i got my mum to come in and help with cleaning and a coworker had to come in to give me keys to close up and they spied on me and told me off for getting my mum to help  i'm just so annoyed with everything and the job gives me a lot of stress already and the manager is adding to it  i feel like i can't trust anyone at the job and i really hate it ,cwsuyv

73,Above/Below the Line,recently  i had to sit through a two-day long presentation about  efficiency of communication  in the workplace  part of this presentation involved a concept called  above below the line  basically it s the idea that you need to be happy and positive at work  and if you see someone who isn t 100  excited to be there  you need to do whatever it takes to bring them  above the line  i knew it was bullshit from the moment i heard it  but it never affected me personally until about 10 minutes ago    it s a tuesday  probably one of the worst work days in the week   i ll admit  i m not in the greatest attitude  i haven t smiled yet today  but why would i  our operations manager comes up to me after our morning meeting and asks if i m ok  i said  it s just one of those days  he then proceeds to ask me  are you below the line  i gave him the biggest blank stare possible and just replied  yeah  i guess so  he then proceeds to ask what he needs to do to get me above the line again  i proceeded to just walk away    why is there this idea that you should be happy at work  i show up at 7 30  get my work done  take my hour  lunch  break  and then leave right at 5  i am not here to put on some fake smile and act like this is the best part of my day  a lot of days  i m pretty agreeable and i have a genuine smile because i m alive and i have some fun stuff to look forward to after work  but some days  i just don t have anything great going on and i m sorry if my  grim  demeanor bothers you  it s one thing for my wife or friends to ask how they can help me be happier  but i don t need a damn coworker trying to put a smile on my face    sorry  rant over ,cw5hv9

95,Gaming and other cheap entertainment,many talk about gaming as if it is harmful but gaming is quite an enjoyable and cheap form of recreation  it is similar to eg netflix or even reddit    people who engage in  normal  life script recreation eg goes out  goes on relationships  dates and goes to concerts  nightclubs  etc then this is expensive  plus if this progresses to procreation  it becomes even more expensive  gaming  on the other hand  is very cheap and coupled with not breeding can allow you to reduce expenses while still living a very happy life  this can allow you to survive on a lower wage or even allow you to retire early or have financial independence earlier    there are also social benefits of gaming eg it is a good way to reduce consumption and not be exploited as much by the capitalist machine ,cvy01m

106,A company built to eventually generate passive income and minimize work for all employees over time?,warning  long as fuck post consisting of bullshit i've been thinking about for a total of 1 5 days  definitely room for improvement here  feel free to contribute your ideas   -----  had a thought the other day about a potential company structure us antiworkers might be able to create  something that can exist within the current system to tide us over until we can finally overthrow it  here's the tldr    gt  company's main goal would be to find some way to generate a passive revenue stream with minimal upkeep required  so that everyone involved in creating it could sit back and collect a paycheck benefits with minimal time spent doing occasional updates maintenance to keep it viable   i work in software so this is kind of software-centric  and i don't know how well it could or couldn't translate into other industries  i'm just trying to think of a way to exist in this capitalist hellscape without having to spend 40 hours of my only life every week at some bullshit job enriching someone else in return for scraps of the value i create   anyway  there are a lot of software companies that will develop an app  api  etc  that pretty much just generates money with minimal upkeep involved  what if all the programmers involved in creating such a product could just share the spoils evenly  instead of the riches going to some greedy fuck's pocket at the top of some company  maybe there are parallels to these kinds of products in other industries  i dunno   here's how i think it could work  open to suggestions   -----    detailed and boring ideation below     stage 1  formation  a limited number of people mutually agree to work on some product idea  probably for free  probably in addition to their existing full-time jobs  more people can be hired to the company by majority or unanimous decision  with the understanding that each person brought on would get an equal share of the profits generated once the company enters its final  maintenance phase  more on that later     stage 2  development  at the outset  all co-owners of the project will determine an end goal  a profit threshold after which the company enters  maintenance phase  again  more on that later  but essentially  before any work starts  everyone involved decides  after we're each making  x in monthly passive income  we're going to stop active work on the project and transition into maintenance  alternatively  instead of picking some number  every member could agree to transition into the maintenance phase at any point by unanimous vote   product is worked on for as long as it takes to reach the profitability goal  all profits could be evenly distributed from the start or kept in company hands as a financial buffer  depending on what all co-owners want to do  if there are costs associated with keeping the company running  web hosting  materials  etc  it may be wise to keep a multi-month or multi-year buffer in company coffers at all times   critical business decisions  including hiring and firing  should be made democratically  either by majority or unanimous vote  if you're going to decide things with majority rather than unanimity  everyone should probably agree on that being the rule to prevent conflicts     stage 3 -   maintenance  after the profitability threshold determined above is crossed  maybe it's crossed one time  or crossed on average over x months  depending on what people want  or everyone votes to do so  the company enters its final  maintenance  phase  this is exactly what it sounds like  nobody is obligated to do any more work  and everybody sits back and collects a paycheck   okay  so there's always going to be a little bit of work involved after this point  someone has to process the payroll and shit  so either someone can volunteer to do this forever  or you can do it round-robin style  etc  also  some work will have to be done occasionally to keep the product working  update software to prevent security holes  etc  any member can volunteer to do this  you can split it up  whatever you want to do   there's one critical piece here  after the project enters this phase  even if one of the contributors decides to say  fuck it  and not do any maintenance work anymore  or they die  etc  they can't be fired  if someone decides to check out  the remaining members will have to pick up the  ideally minimal  slack to keep the money rolling in and keep the company from collapsing   i don't think most people who help carry a company to this stage will be so greedy as to abandon the project completely  especially if the work left to be done is minimal and occasional  but the possibility remains  and i think that's okay because it guarantees the passive income to every member after the maintenance phase is reached  in return for their contributions toward the company's profitability  if everyone decides to abandon the project and the company falls apart  so be it  i think that's pretty unlikely  though   extra work by any member to improve the product at this point should be welcome  but it won't result in any greater share of the profits  everyone gets an equal share regardless of the extra work they put in  period   -----    anticipated questions   gt  a competitor has shown up  or market forces have shifted in such a way that our company isn't going to be viable anymore  what do we do now   i'm wondering if there should be an optional 4th stage  called  re development or something  essentially  all members or a majority would have to vote to enter development again for some time in order to stay competitive  this would be a limited-time thing  after which the company would return to maintenance mode   alternatively  a new company could be spun off from the original one  and it could fork source code from the first  in the case of software  to create an even better more competitive product  i think it's important that all members of the original company be provided a chance to join this new company at its inception  with the understanding that their income from the previous project might decline to  0 once the new competitor is launched    gt  why can't we fire anyone after the project enters maintenance   because ideally  no more heavy work should have to be done  also  if someone hasn't been fired up to this point  it's because their contributions have been valuable enough to keep them  therefore  the product in its profitable state couldn't have existed without their contributions  and they should get their fair share of the reward   this is also meant to protect against personality conflicts political drama  it's like being a tenured professor  once you're in  you're in  and barring any extreme legal circumstances you'll keep getting your paycheck  everyone benefits from doing things this way because they're guaranteed a paycheck healthcare other benefits no matter what happens in the future    gt  how are these rules enforced   when forming your company  you'll need to get this all codified into legal language with the help of a lawyer  this is just a framework  and you can tweak it as you please  but hopefully you'll stick to the main idea of creating a passive income stream for everyone involved in your project   -----  what do you think  again  totally open to suggestions on this  are you interested in starting this kind of company  i'm a web mobile developer  let's talk  i'm willing to front the initial costs like getting a lawyer to codify this stuff into a formal contract  pay the web hosting bills  etc   also  i'm  hereby placing this whole idea into the public domain  so feel free to use remix it however you like with zero attribution ,cxa3p1

117,Its downright impossible to slack off as a software developer nowadays,every fucking organization has adopted or is adopting scrum  for those outside software it  scrum is a project management process that is really similar to a white collar death march  its not exclusive to software it but it is used most often in these fields   i am underpaid so i wanted to give a big fu to the man by slacking off but every day there's this  daily-stand up  where every member of the team has to state the following the rest of the team   1  what tasks did you do yesterday  2  what tasks are you planning to do today   every  single  fucking  day  not to mention every task you do has to be estimated and the actual time it took you to finish that task is recorded  sure you can give a really high estimate so you can slack off  but the other team members have to agree and your boss is watching you give estimates so you better give the impression that you can do things fast    you are cucked beyond belief if your team has a bootlicker that will call you out for giving an unusually high estimate for a task so that you can slack off  then every month your performance will get reviewed and every data point on how long it takes for you to work can be seen by the boss  lets not forget about the open office plan btw    this shit is micromanagement on steroids  software it is a meme unless you get extremely lucky working for google or facebook right out of college or are self-employed ,cx6c9k

132,Am I making a good move?,for the last year i ve hated my job  the long  mostly pointless hours  the exploitation of my work  with lack of recognition  you know  and for the last year i ve been job hunting for something more ideal  i ve gone on at least 40 interviews and had a few offers but none of which i wanted  my field is extremely competitive  the other day i finally got an offer on something i was interested in  it s part time  with potential to turn into full time  and i would get to work from home 90  of the time  this is ideal because i hate being cooped up in an office all day  the problem is  that until this does turn into full time i ll need something else to make up the rest of my salary  so i may have found a similar opportunity in the same field at a different place for a 50 50 work from home position  so i m leaving my comfortable job where i don t have to worry where my paycheck is coming from  to work for 2 places mostly from home making slightly more  am i making a good move ,cr6twu
133,Feeling like jobs just want to stright up control your life.,hello  my name is karrieal  its going to be a long venting post so please bare with me  i recently quit my job today and abit stressed out   ever since i graduated high school last year i had a shit load of jobs  ranging from amazon to restaraunts and fast food joints and now to a office job  i fucking hated all of them and quitted on the spot especially restaraunts because standing for hours hurted my feet to the point they permentantly fucked up now and management being assholes  so i landed this office job now    when i got this office job  basically doing data entry on criminal employment  everyone was nice and looked like a peaceful environment  as weeks go by everyone started to look different  all i saw was depressed faces  and thats when my supervisor came to me saying that    hey so you have to turn your computer off everytime you take a break  get up to get some water  and go to the bathroom  basically everytime i get up  i was like  what the fuck  but i needed to stay at this job because i'm paying bills now    so today  a couple minutes  when i came back from the bathroom she was like  you cant use the bathroom for more than 10 minutes  do it on your break  so you saying that i cant take a shit now  come the fuck on  not like i'm fucking missing anything and its light work today   then  i wanted clean my water bottle to get some water so i washed my bottle out etc  supervisor came in and told me i cant use the sink to wash my stuff out  im here like  why     so nobody would think you're stealing companies belongings  but uh this is my shit     then one of my coworkers told me the other day  we having a potluck soon  its manatory to bring something homemade  lemme know what your bringing  um mandatory  i barely cook for myself  what  you expect me to whip up some buffet for 50 people   anyways  i quitted today  and yes i told my manager everything  her excuse    her   oh dont worry about the supervisor  she's pregnant and she saids things she dont mean too  yeah fuck no  just because shes fucking pregnant doesnt give her the excuse to stalk my every move like i'm some bad ass little kid and make my life a living hell   i couldnt take the stress of people watching my every move and stalking me  i dont get paid much to deal with this shit  every week i get a lunch money paycheck  i feel sick mentally especially as a person suffering from depression and anxiety for years now  i dont see the point of giving a 2 week notice  i did one time at a fast food job i had and for the next two weeks everyone there treated me different and being passive agressive on me  thats only some dumb tradition just to search for another person to replace me  fuck it  i'm done    next job i get  i'm going to save money to make my own business  im tired of getting up so early  i'm tired of dealing with people and doing useless work  i feel so mentally drain and feeling so negative i just cry at night most times hoping things will get better in time  i look at this subreddit everyday for months now and makes me less insane because people go through hell at these jobs like i am and i'm glad this exists   i just feel like a job is not for me and never was ,crbx6p

146,Does anyone else feel like they're always on thin ice? (small vent),i just wanted to comment on the way the modern work environment uses a deliberate background anxiety of uncertainty in order to control workers by fear  at my workplace  people kind of have an unofficial mantra that goes  as long as you deliver  you'll be fine  i think that people see this as reassuring in a way  but if you look at the root of the idea  it's really not  it's basically saying that you  must  perform and try to muster up the energy to donate your life at every possible moment  or else you will lose your means to survive or keep your current standard of living  it is basically saying that you are never  actually  secure    i see this obvious everyday anxiety as deliberate cruelty  the people on top know that they are making people feel this way  but they happily allow it to persist because it keeps them in power and everyone else's heads down trying to survive  it's dystopian ,csivii

162,"Work doesn't just ruin our lives, but it destroys our relationships and society as a whole",i'm probably one of the lucky ones  my job isn't stressful and requires only about 20 hours per week of my time  i work from home every friday and generally all my afternoons are free  this should be the life  right  don't get me wrong  i'm grateful to not be stuck in some of the horrible jobs ive had in the past  but here's the problem  society is so structured around everyone working 40 hours a week that even if you don't  your stuck in that same lonely trap  because everyone was so busy and stressed by full time work  my friendships deteriorated years ago  over the years the good friends i had became more sad  angry and irritable  when we got together they seemed to be to anxious to leave  we weren't having fun anymore  once a week get togethers became once a month  then maybe 3 or 4 times per year  my husband's job seems to be taking a toll on him as well  he comes home very stressed  is in a bad mood  unless he has a few drinks  and i feel we are drifting apart more too  i've thought of looking for other things to be involved in  see if there are social activities im the neighborhood or something like that but there's nothing  i leave work and walk out on to totally empty streets  everyone is stuck in their offices for a few more hours still  i live in a suburban townhouse development and the homes are really just places for people to sleep between work shifts  ive lived here 14 years and i know no one  i never see anyone  there is no sense of community  even if you can get yourself out of the 40 hour per week trap  you're affected by the damage it does  the disconnection takes its toll  when you're disengaged from people its harder to have empathy for others  society just gets colder and lonlier and worse  it's every man for themselves   the real work that needs to be done to improve our cities and towns isn't being done  because everyone is busy working to make a few people richer instead of improving ourselves  we waste our lives  toiling away to support businesses that at are at best unneeded and at worst doing active harm to people   i read a few books on this  bowling alone  lost connections and bullshit jobs  and the conclusion seems to be the same  work  in the current state its in  is ruining us  we no longer have time for friendships  or to raise our own children  or do the things that we personally value or would find rewarding  things need to change  we need to cooperate to make this change  but work keeps doing it's best to pull us apart  it leaves us too tired  too lonely  too depressed to do anything other than lay down on the couch and flip on the tv  i wish i knew how to help fix this  but i don't know where to begin ,ctalx8

190,Customers talking to you like you’re extremely stupid?,i just wondered how many of you are dealing everyday with customer service roles where the customers frequently talk down to you and treat you like you re an utter moron and shit under their feet    honestly  my main point is that nobody should be spoken to abusively or condescendingly  all employees of all organizations deserve respect from customers and clients  to have requests calmly made  and to have explanations reasonably given for requests if needed   i work in an area of retail and i just have to say that this really gets to me sometimes  i actually have a college degree and graduated with a gpa above 3 9  i went to college on scholarship  i work retail because i m too disabled for full time office work    like i mentioned  regardless of my intelligence level  why do customers assume retail workers are too stupid to do our jobs  i have lost count how many times customers argue with me about the functioning of my own register and how it works  or have argued with me about whether or not a product was priced a certain way or not  just different things like that  the belittlement of my mental capacity is just too much sometimes and i get annoyed    if any of you are dealing with this i d love your advice about how to deal with it  thanks ,csdbst

197,"You seem like people who would appreciate my rant about employment ""Red flags"".",  i saw that there are people here  who like the jobs where you have multiple months off  and you scoffed at people saying you'd get bored   i feel i've found my people  i have had bouts of unemployment  they would have been fine if it weren't for the financial aspect  after i left my last toxic workplace  i just took a week to relax and sleep and emotionally heal from the damage they place did to me  it literally almost gave me an hour  i almost killed myself over a fucking  15 an hour job   that week off of doing nothing  not worrying about any schedules  no plans  was one of the most healing weeks of my life   i am working right now in my life more than i ever did  i don't know if i'll ever get the full freedom from work  but  my future goals involve saving up to have extended time off   my boyfriend and i are moving to a cheaper rent  so that he can go to school to get a better job    we were really gonna try to stick it out where we currently live  we thought going into a different field would be a different experience for him  unfortunately  the state of america in modern day  and how capitalism has managed to make it legal to fire you if you form a union  among a myriad of other issues  the vast majority of entry level jobs are full of bullshit  doesn't matter the field   i've had many people tell me he needs to not be lazy and get a part time job   i've chosen to support him  i make enough money to support him  i also wasn't complaining about supporting him  i didn't say i couldn't  i was just sharing   hey  i'm about to do this thing    we  don't want him to get a physical psrt time job  because part time jobs love to do this thing of  oh  you're only available 25 hours a week  alright  well we'll feel fully entitled to  all  of your time  schedule you on days you wanted off  and threaten your job if you ask for some basic respect of your time   and they'll inevitably do the thing  where they schedule you close one night  and open the next day  and they will never give you a consistent schedule  even though it's what every  single  employee  wants  and they'll never post it in a timely manner  and change the schedule on you without telling you and then discipline you for being late  because apparently being a manager in a retail store means you can actively ignore details  like fred picks up his kid every friday  so he can't work close  but you schedule him anyway  while micro managing and yelling at your subordinates about things that are out of their control   apparently i'm an idiot for not wanting him to deal with this nonsense and focus on school    there area couple basic online jobs that would bring in an ok income  and pay a lot more than the awful minimum wage job in the area  so we're going to try to get him those  but if not  he'll still be taking care of the house  which will be such a blessing with how much i'm working  and learning extremely brain intensive things like coding  i don't want his head space occupied about how he didn't meet the quota for inventory    he's getting a software development degree  i'm going to get a marketing degree  we've talked about how i could help him get into freelancing by working on the marketing stuff    the big plan is to go to south korea  we hope he'll have a remote job  or maybe freelancing  by then  we'll have free housing  i'll be a tefl teacher in the public schools  i am currently a tefl teacher online  i do really enjoy the work  though it's not what i'd be doing if i didn't need to pay bills   it's common to get to south korea  work in public schools for the first year  and then move to a hagwon  private school  because they pay more  but you get far less vacations  you're often working extra on the public holidays because public school is closed and parents still send their kids out  and a lot more stress   i am hoping to stay in sk for 3 years  and will gladly take the 2 weeks paid vacation  with the many paid public holidays off  you also have to come into the office during winter break and sit around all day  the smart ones do something meaningful to them during this time  msny study their distance masters  or write their novels  i'll be working on my passion project  i will happily trade a little more money for a lot more time   i'll stay in sk for 3 years  i'll then use the savings from those 3 years to spend 18-24 months living in cheap beautiful tropical countries and working on my passion project   i saw multiple people here talking about how you buy free time  and that's your priority financially  i 1000  agree   and then onto the next multiple year saving plan to save up for the next passion project   i've never seen myself retiring from a company after 45 years in the same office  one week of vacation is pithy nonsense and you're lucky to get that much  also  many of those days get eaten up by life  with things such as  family emergencies  sick days  your car broke down  you rarely get to live your life for yourself   and our society has made us out to be the lazy ones  the immature ones    as long as i'm not negatively impacting anyone else around me  what does it matter  i'm lazy for being dilligent with my money and prioritizing my life over leasing the brand new car   there's somebody on youtube i love  their channel name is creativity rv  their sister died and it compelled them to completely change their life  when their sister was sick  she said to them  i'm paraphrasing from memory    are you happy with your life  because i always imagined you in a field  making a painting or working on your novel   they weren't happy  they were in a corporate job that was making them miserable  they bought a house and their boss said something along the lines of   i love debt equity    what do you mean    now i own you for 30 years   they hsted that  and rebelled against it  shortly thereafter  against all  sense  they sold their house  bought an rv and set off  they now make a tiny income on youtube adsense  they have written a couple books  and little other odd things to survive  and they couldn't be happier    in a recent video  they talked about the importance of not working  they'll drag their couch outside the rv  lie there and watch the clouds and sleep  not caring about time  until they feel fully recharged   they do still have to work to make a living  but not in the traditional way  and in a way where they can travel full time and fully enjoy life   i've seen a lot of people like this  i feel grateful i grew up in a home that never placed a high importance on a career or being financially successful   i'd much rather be the hippy with the off brand hiking boots  the falling apart backpack  knowing i have no debt  then to be the one who gets turning heads from my vintage cadillac that is just hemmoraging money    i am getting a marketing degree purely for my south korea goals  and the other reason is because i can get it for minimal to no debt  same is true for boyfriend's degree  i've gotten criticism for this  but i really don't think it matters  i am not interested in a teaching degree  i'm not interested in a teaching career  i've had it suggested it to me because of my plans  i just like it  and can see it propelling me to my next goals  i have no idea what life looks like after 10 years from now  and i'm ok with that  i may get some skills that will help my boyfriend with his path    i personally think there is merit in getting a degree for the sake of having a degree  so many jobs  literally did not care what my degree was in  they just wanted me to have one  because we have to keep creating  others  in society  and even if someone ditched most of their classes  smoked weed all day  didn't work  and scraped by with a bunch of c- grades    they're more valuable than the person who went into retail work straight after high school so they could feed their family and have worked 10x as hard as the college grad   so i'm not interested in doing the  puritan  college route  where i pick a degree in my ultimate passion and sacrifice everything i have to get into that field  and then face extreme shame if i ever change my mind   something like only 30  of american college grads are in a job relevant to their degree  i'm just skipping the steps to get to the other 70   i remember a fast food job i worked  the manager told me i could get a management job if i got a business degree  all that time and money  to get  this  at the end of it  i don't know why anyone would submit themselves to that   thanks for reading if you got this far  my boyfriend and i are really excited for our next step  i'm excited to give him the opportunity to focus on school  i'm excited for so many of my future plans  i'm also really glad that i  hopefully  found my people  you seem to be understanding that many of us need to work  you also seem to not be the type to act like you know my life better than me  something i've been dealing with a lot lately    so hi  if you've got plans for the future  anything

226,I'm looking for good careers for an anti-worker. Any thoughts?,i was thinking about being a part-time registered nurse in california which means working two twelves  the union is pretty strong there too  the thing is i have to pay my dues and my health will suffer just to get to that point  it will be hard working night shift  and sometimes i won't be able to eat between breakfast and dinner  both of those will contribute to a shortened life since that diet will leave you susceptible to diabetes and that schedule will lead me to cancer  also  some lucrative nurse jobs might have to force me to cross the picket line which is something i will absolutely not do despite travel nursing being interesting to me   also  nurses actually do real work with some value  the people there probably got there because of capitalism  a sedentary lifestyle  a system that promotes opioids  bad diets  etc  but i'm sure my work will have some value despite the patients really having no hope  it's better than a bullshit office job where you're only there to checkmark a box to make someone above you look important   my other goal is to read subversive literature in the corner of some office where i listen to a podcast and get lost in the shuffle with generous benefits  pto  retirement  m etc  i'd like to work at an ngo or non-profit but reading what goes on through r nonprofitcritical makes me kind of want to not to and the issues i'd deal with would be too close to home   basically i want a job where i can work on myself during down time like the recent previous example or have a job where it's not bullshit  i am lucky enough to be able to choose which hell i want   r antiwork   you're my last hope  thanks for reading ,cts9l3

241,Got a written warning for reading a paperback book during downtime.,today i got a written warning for reading on my downtime  not taking a lunch break when my boss wanted  everyone pretty much takes it before leaving and goes home early  and for taking 1 ot hour      i have this job  i started this job a year ago  it's a help desk position for a giant company  the largest for their type of company in the world  actually  i have so many complaints with this place  all the way back to the start  i'm a contractor because big companies contract work out to save money  my contractor company bait and switched me  telling me in the first interview a higher rate of pay than what they eventually offered at the time of signing papers  not enough to make me run for the hills  but definitely below what i should be paid  i took the job because i am desperate  live in a rural area  and for the low cost of just traveling an hour to and back a day  i can make enough money to barely afford a life      i busted my ass  60  hour weeks  on rotating shifts  you switch every week from 6 am - 4 pm to 8 pm - 6 am to 10 am to 8 pm and back to first shift  it was brutal but i did what needed to be done to get to a stable place in my life  the shifts were hard  but they allowed you to get a natural 50 hours  10 hours ot  every week  just by showing up for work     i went beyond the shifts often because people were late  or i volunteered for extra work on the weekend  my manager knew i was using ot but he saw i did a good job and let me be  i learned like a sponge and soaked up everything they threw at me  soon i knew everything about 200  applications  networking  enterprise-level computer imaging  active directory  company procedures  data workflows  i am helping take hundreds of calls a week for a two man team   making hundreds of tickets a day  i get so much experience at an enterprise level  it's got to count in the long run  right   after three months of being a great worker  i was promoted to the supervisor position of help desk  still a contractor  no raise was given to me by my contractor  they conveniently ignored when i got the promotion  i was too tired and busy to fight for a raise because i was excited my efforts were going to get me even more promotions very soon  my contractor craftily told me that the only  way to get raises in this company was to get promotions  so i bided my time   my schedule becomes set  no more rotation  i start coming in at 4 am  waking up at 3 am  and leaving at 2-3 pm  so 9-10 hours a day  i do this to get my reporting for management done during my first two hours there  when it's quiet and not hectic  and so i can be available for third shift to tell me what happened while they were manning things alone  people think it's crazy  but my boss knows this provides it coverage when no one else is in the it area to provide it  he lets me do it and i'm honestly okay with it  because i am no longer on rotation  i am getting enough sleep and no longer having micro-naps while i'm driving      as supervisor  i know everything and i basically carry the help desk with my knowledge of processes  i suggested changes to the way the help desk worked and everyone on my team enjoys me and our work now  i try to do the best job i can so i get noticed by the departments down the hall that pay twice what i make now  if i can make that kind of money  and learn what they do  and get that experience  i'll be set for life  i just know  i fucking know it  it fuels everything i do  that dream of making it  my contractor tells me after i interview for a position like that that i definitely am first in line to get it  months pass  the promotions never came  i figured out the big company was more interested in hiring overqualified outsiders to be safe  or getting h1b visas in for sweet government kickbacks      however  financially  i was finally getting things in order  settling some debts  feeling secure  then the big company changed my management       new management comes in and is cleaning house as of this month  they are writing people up for things  reducing costs  etc  they notice people taking ot and tell everyone to stop it in a general email  so i look at working 8 hour shifts  instead of the 12 i usually did  i immediately know this is going to kill me  i calculate my new paychecks  my landlord raised rent and now a single check will not cover my rent  i feel like the skeleton of economic endgames is tap dancing on my career grave because i  am  financially  fucked   i take the 8 hours and swallow it  i start to weight options  i cut off expenditures  i go to my contractor and ask them  please  god  a raise  they tell me that because i received a  mandatory  cost of living raise  not col  it's only half a percent  already this year  everyone received it  that i am no longer eligible for raises this year  that skeleton takes his top hat off and starts rattling his cane in my face      because i am a supervisor  i am taken into many meetings at various tables about all the stuff that's going to change for help desk  more responsibilities  more things we are going to take over on to make the new management look good  good  good    oh  by the way  they tell me again  no more ot  especially not mine  they also say that it would be best if i came in at 6 am and left at 3 pm  and i must take a lunch during the day  because you know  at the manager's old job  back in the 1980's or some such  someone sued the company for not being given lunches  so we must take ours    ouch  i am trying with  8 hours  but i have my reasons for leaving for work as early as i do  because i live in a rural place  there's only one road out of the mountains  around 5 am  tons of people get on this road to get to the city  they drive like madmen to get there  brights on  riding your ass the whole way on a twisty road with blind curves and semis crossing the lines  it's stressful and scary and i prefer to leave at 3 30 when it's empty  sometimes i can even get to work in under an hour this way   i prefer 6 am  is all my new manager says  and that's that   by the way  i ask  while we're here  can you talk to someone on your end about the raise  i heard the big company can influence the contractor on getting people raises   why  no i can't do anything about that  don't you know i have it hard  too  i'm only making 90k  but i should be making 100k because i'm a manager and not a specialist anymore      oh yeah  i totally understand that  what a hard time you're having       the skeleton's head falls off onto the table we're sitting at  but my manager doesn't seem to notice   so i wake up the next week and come in at 5 30  i leave at 1 00 to stay under 8 hours  the next day my manager assigns a meeting at 2 30 pm  i ask if we can take it earlier  he ignores me  so i have to stay over to meet with him  i read a stephen king book about a child murderer during the downtime at help desk to take my mind off everything that's going on    i have the meeting  i am going to train the new hire that's coming in  and by the way   we need you to write up a whole training regiment for her by friday  the skeleton is in the parking lot on my way to my car  holding up a time card that says 9 03 hours of time for that day  like a demented olympic judge  and i feel like i just took a dive from way up above the concrete      today i get a call on my cell phone this morning  my manager has called me from the meeting room right behind me  telling me to come in  why here's my manager  seated with a woman  ah  it's my contractor company rep  i've talked to her many times  told her about what's going on at the help desk  been a good friend  now i've finally met her face to face   my manager says   you disobeyed me  i told you no more ot and you have 1 hour of ot on tuesday  you came in at not 6 exactly and left at not even 3  i am going to have to have you sign this written warning       my rep agrees   yes  we told you when you signed up you must ask a manager for ot  they didn't  but i'm tired  i'm really tired and i see no hope in this situation  i don't even argue  i just write on the paper for comments  you do realize i am paid less than the people i supervise now  right  i don't get the natural ot they do  how do you think you'll ever get another  fool  to do this job if it means a huge rise in responsibility  no raise  and less pay overall      i read this message out loud as i write it  they stare at me  goggle-eyed  they have no response because this was a pageant  not a meeting of rational minds  they said their canned hr warning and did their grim dance  right there in the meeting room as my co-workers watched me in greedy  lurid fascination  already gossiping about   getting chewed out  yuk yuk    my manager does finally say something   well  would you like to go back on rotation   i set my head down on the desk and look at the floor  the skeleton is underneath the desk  staring at me  it gives me a thumbs up   my manager then says  also  don't ever read a book at the help desk again  you are setting a bad example for the other help desk workers if you aren't seen working when you are the lead  this is an official warning   while i work to learn and grow and do a good job in the workforce  that skeleton of disappointment  of absurdity  of banal pointless labor for no real reason  it's there in the corner while i work  staring at me  doing those really obscene push ups where you clap with both hands on each push  maybe even winking  just waiting to throw me the stupidest fucking dance routine it can come up with      i'm tired  i think they're crafting a case to dismiss me  it's really weird  two months ago  the old management loved me  and they let me do what i needed to do to tread water  it changed really  really fast   i'm going far  getting nowhere  one of my friends who heard my story of today said don't be sad  keep going  i have so much to offer  i said i feel that while it might be true  i also feel like i'm running out of places to find and put my effort  they all seem rotten  am i crazy if i keep doing what hasn't worked before      i'm really  really afraid the next place i go to  that skeleton will be there ,cu6e4e
242,The job market right now for those without connections or wealth,as an adult  most of the jobs i ve worked have met one of the following criteria    1  servant class to the wealthy  eg customer service or retail for luxury industries   these jobs paid higher and the workplaces themselves were good  but it was basically like being a servant by kissing a ton of ass to rich people who can be very rude  and dealing extremely expensive luxury goods  i ve styled children for family holiday photoshoots  dealt with  gold rewards cardholders  who spent over  10k per year at my workplace  and overnighted one of a kind occasion gowns to customers  spoke on the phone with actresses in la about their makeup appointments  and resolved delivery issues for businessmen buying designer bag for their wife  i did these things while living a working class lifestyle and the difference got to me     2  various grab-bag working-class-pay jobs  lower end retail  generic customer service  tutoring  domestic labor like childcare basic cooking housekeeping   these jobs paid very low  often without benefits  but had friendly and team oriented environments with flexible scheduling and part time options  honestly  these are my favorite jobs because my health stays okay and where i m at again now  retail     3  temp contract jobs in entry level office work with zero benefits  status or job security    the office placements through my agency were generally okay  because they were higher end places looking to save money while having some low status person be a warm body to finish a task or fill a seat  not terrible  but you can be sacked at any moment and your hours can be cut  plus you never really feel like you belong where you work which is extremely lonely and depressing     4  office jobs that are open for a bad or suspicious reason   i ve landed what appeared to be a fantastic office work opportunity with upward mobility  benefits  pto  and on the job training a few times now and quickly realized that the job was open for a reason and not a good one  extreme overworking  abusive boss  piss poor morale  disrespect and company culture problems to the point of causing illness to me  etc  i stayed in these several times until my health collapsed  i keep seeing some of my old jobs reposted again and again online every few months  because i m sure the horrible pit of misery that that part of the company is hasn t improved ,cubiy5

315,Possible Corruption I've Encountered,so this is going to be a bit different from a lot of the more general posts on this sub  but i couldn't really think of a better subreddit to put it in  this is more of a vent post about what is possibly the biggest corruption i have encountered in the workplace   so i've been working at a manufacturing firm for a year now  and was staffed by staffing company 1   sc 1  a few months back they were removed and replaced for reasons that were never revealed to us contract workers  so sc 2 comes in and on the first day made a promise that they would honour all of sc 1's policies  benefits  etc   well  immediately after the first week  this staffing company gets everyone's pay incorrect  they seemingly never realized that some contractors that had been there longer had a  50 cent raise  and that one of our breaks was considered on the clock  most people were losing about  10 on every paycheck  weekly  for the next couple months  we had to go to their office individually to correct each paycheck  even after they should have had us in the system to be getting correct pay  we were still getting shafted for a bit and had to keep micromanaging our every paycheck  a lot of people i had talked to never made a fuss about it and it seemed like many people perpetually took the ghost pay cut and probably thought it was taxes or something  but anyways  as for those of us who made a fuss  we were back to our post-gross amounts that we were used to getting   the next issue that came up was regarding holiday pay  sc 2 is now claiming that they have literally zero records whatsoever of what sc 1 was doing  and is relying on word of mouth or something i guess  some of us are getting our holiday pay and some aren't  it's supposed to be active for us after we have been staffed for 10 months  but they claim they have no way to know who has been here that long  some people show them check stubs individually  and we get stuff sorted out  like always  other people are clueless and just take the pay cut    the final thing they give us trouble with is a bonus of  200 that we would receive after 10 months as well  they really tried to fight me on this one  and i was basically the only employee that was doing anything to fight back  i gave them a copy of my sc 1 documents to show them evidence  which they then hilariously claimed was the first time they have been capable of getting hold of such papers  they never asked a single employee for this in their introduction meeting   time goes by and after a very long time  me and a couple others get our bonus cash after a lot of work done mostly by myself  they made sure to let me know that sc 1 had actually completely changed their policy a few months before they left the mfg  firm  and that the bonus is no longer offered  so i shouldn't tell the other employees that i got the money  they then start saying ridiculous things like you only get holiday pay once  as in for one holiday  and then have to work another 10 months to get it again  which  honestly sounds like lunacy to me  what company only pays for a single 8 hour holiday once every year  i double checked the original document and it says  verbatim   holiday pay will be paid when a staffing employee has worked 1500 hours  10 months  in the past 365 days from the holiday  i feel like they are totally rules sharking that statement and intentionally trying to twist what is slightly ambiguous wording  when this was discussed with sc 1's onboarding  they verbally made it very clear that holiday pay  kicked in  after the 10 months and stayed for all subsequent holidays  there is some ambiguity with how that thing is worded but it just seems ridiculous to think they meant it starts over   but going beyond all of that  there really isn't any evidence that sc 1 actually did do away with the bonus  they keep sticking to that point  but how can we possibly know that they aren't just making it up to avoid paying us  because it really seems like they are jacking wages benefits left right and center from hundreds of employees  what really pissed me off was in a meeting  following  the time i gave them the papers and made them well-aware of the bonus  someone asked them about it in the after-meeting questions portion and they put on the fakest  what bonus  we weren't aware of any bonus  timothy  do you know what she is talking about  kind of thing  you know damn well what she is talking about  and after someone from my group whispered to her about what to actually call the bonus by name  they referred back to how sc 1 cancelled that before they left  the whole situation has me seething  but i feel powerless to do anything at all because there is so much information being withheld ,cnd1j9

345,The pressure on IT Guys.,i like technology  i always have since my childhood  i have spent a lot of money on computer accessories some of which can be considered a complete waste of money to others  however   the professional it world is a different beast  you are expected to dedicate your life to tech   you have to have a home lab at home   learn about how every printer works   constantly be on the know-how of recent developments in tech   learn the trending programming    framework or development strategies  although i am aware of the importance of upgrading skills   the this is i just don't care most of the time   samsung released a folding phone   good for them   apple screwed over their customers again   maybe this time they will learn and not buy from them again  huawei is banned in a country i don't live in   let the parties involved sort it out   some aspects of technology are interesting and fun  to me but they are just a small part of my life   majority of my friends have zero interest in technology and most of the times i do actually want to listen to them talk about their trip to spain and hold conversations about potatoes   their family tree or whatever      whats worse is that the pay is peanuts compared to what those who expect a lot from you  about technology that their careers are based on  are paid    i have been thinking a lot about a career change   my uncle did it a few years back   he saw that most promising tech careers are towards advertising-tech   financial-tech  and wasn't really interested  he picked up small scale farming and hasn't used a computer productively since   i know that there are careers with more insane demands   but two things can be wrong at the same time ,coqii6

382,Office jobs are just as bad as the blue collared ones,just how the heck can people tolerate sitting down 8-12 hours a day on a chair staring at a computer screen for so bad years  just how  it is known that sitting down for extended hours is bad for the spine and standing up is a much healthier choice  which is why a standing desk should be a compulsory requirement for all office jobs  and there is the damn computer  this is absolutely a torture staring at the screen for so long without any chance to relax your eyes  further more the additional screen time we get after work from entertainment is nothing but extra stress to our eyes  it is like we are spending 2 3 of the day staring at a screen  two thirds  there are so many different things to see out in this world and we are spending so much many on a screen  i am really starting to hate computer and want nothing to do with them in a job  a janitor sounds like a better option over a data entry assistant at this point ,clh2h2

400,They're onto me.,the society where i live and situation in my personal life has created this environment where i can work only two days a week  sometimes working a bit more  but for the last year i've generally worked 2-3 days a week  now i think that things are changing for the worse  i work in restaurants as a waiter  i work for a company that rents out hospitality workers to restaurants  it's a zero-hour contract and i'm allowed to accept or deny shifts that are offered to me and this system has allowed myself great liberty to organize my life the way i have more free time  i can do this  because i'm a good worker  i know i am  so there is always restaurants that offer shifts for me or ask for me specially when they contact the company i work for       resturant worker mindset is radically different from my own personal views on work and employment  in the industry everybody is pushing hard  and people do long days and long weeks and the culture is all about working hard  cooks and waiters see themselves strong and needed when they work those crazy hours  and everyone in the industry are a tight group  pushing forward together  every day  while i can honestly respect hard workers and their contribution and determination and passion  i don't want it myself  when i was younger  i too worked this way  i did it because i had found the thing i'm good at and i felt that 'this is it  my thing'  but quickly i just found myself drinking and doing drugs with other workers  on a tuesday night after a 12-hour shift  going off on un-healthy sexual trips with other workers and literally not remembering anything else than work from a few years of my life  i understood that gift of life is greater than to spend it at work       now this summer i've been working for a good restaurant in my city  they  rent  me from my company but sort of have agreed that i'll be their  number 1 guy  when they need some extra workers  so i do the weekends there  and rest of the week i'm chilling  but obviously they have this mindset  that i too  am hungry for more work  and they keep telling me  more hours will be coming to you   you're good worker  how you like it here  would you like to do more work during autumn  so on and so forth    in this industry  it is impossible to bring out my  life philosophy  if you will  it's unheard of that someone is refusing work just because  at work  everyone is literally speaking about how busy it was or is going to be and that's good  the harder we work the better  so i need to play along to that tune  because i still need to pay rent and make some money  and i like working in this good restaurant  but i don't want more work  but when they offer it i'm forced to accept it because otherwise they'll find out that i'm just a freak  a fake  someone who doesn't share their ideas of working  someone not be trusted      it's difficult and stressful to pretend to be part of the ratracing slaves that just want more hours  the other night i got really hammered first time in a long time  because i came to the conclusion that they're onto me  that if i don't accept more work from them they will make sure i wont be able to work for them anymore  and their word spreads around this  not very big city  quickly  because they're one of the best    maybe this  working very little has only been a short lived illusion and the gaping abyss of employment is about to swallow me whole ,cn3lyf

428,UBI and Antiwork: Some thoughts on a controversial subject,summary at the bottom for those who want the gist of my essay   is ubi compatible with antiwork  this is an interminable debate within the antiwork community and for obvious reasons  if you go into a grocery store or a mall everything has a price tag  that price tag tells us how much we have to pay if we want to possess the item in order to consume it    the only means we have to purchase an item -- money -- is earned by selling our labor power to capital  thus our work plays an essential role in securing the money we need to purchase the goods we need to live   antiwork proposes to upset this neat relationship between work and living by removing wage work  in so doing antiwork appears to remove the sole source of income we have to secure the goods we need to live    for many in the antiwork community the only way around this problem is for the state or some other authority to provide a universal income that is not tied to wage work  a ubi to cover basic needs that used to be covered by wages  the ubi idea is simple and easy to understand without a lot of convincing or sophisticated jargon because it fits neatly with our experience    our experience is that our income is tied to the amount of labor time we provide to our employer  as we reduce the hours we provide to our employer  our wages should fall  if we work 40 hours  we get paid  200  but if we only work 20 hours  we should be paid only  100  this is how it works when we ask for time off and it seems like it should work that way for a general reduction of hours of labor as well    but does labor hours reduction really work this way    less work pays for itself   labor power is a commodity and like any commodity it has a market price  if you sell less of it in the market  you will receive less income  but this is not the only effect  if you sell less of it  the supply drops  and what happens when the supply drops  the price of labor power rises  of course    the logic here is not particularly challenging  in 1973  many oil producers imposed an embargo on oil sales to protest the low price of oil  the price was artificially set by the imperialist countries agreeing to pay some very low price  the opec countries refused to sell at this price  the price of oil skyrocketed as a result of their embargo  by the time the embargo ended  the long standing regime of artificially low oil prices had collapsed   although it is unclear to many in the antiwork community  the antiwork movement acts on the labor market exactly like the opec embargo acted on the oil market  by reducing the availability of labor power for sale in the market  it raises the price the capitalists must pay for labor power  within certain definite limits  reducing hours of labor pays for itself in higher hourly wages   if you want to protect wages raise the minimum wage   although i think the above argument is ironclad  no one has ever been convinced by an economic argument  people are driven by emotions and there is no more potent emotion than fear in a public debate   advocates for an antiwork position can expect to be inundated with millions of tweets  reddit posts and facebook messages about why any reduction of hours of labor must lead to millions starving in the streets    ubi may seem like an easy answer to the problem  but there is actually an easier one  raise the minimum wage to offset the wage impact of less work    a higher minimum wage is better because it is what everyone already expects to happen  although they may not realize it at first  people expect that if the minimum wage is aggressively increased  employment rates will fall  in this case  we have simply reversed the order  we reduced hours of labor first  then raised the minimum wage to compensate for the reduction    second  raising the minimum wage  rather than ubi  attacks income inequality by aggressively raising the wages of the lowest paid workers upward toward the highest levels    third  the minimum wage can be explicitly set at a level that ensures every wage worker  even the lowest paid  is paid multiple times the meager income that the census bureau defines as the poverty level   fourth  there's no question where the higher income of the workers comes from  by raising the minimum wage  profits fall  income that once accrued to capital now accrues to the working class  we no longer need to follow the tax revenue from its putative sources to the pockets of the recipients of state handouts  everything is transparent    ubi and the state   having said this  if ubi did not complicate the antiwork movement  no objection would be raised to it by me  but this is not the case    ubi heavily relies on the state  and its currency  it is  therefore  a national program  particular to a specific national territory and a more or less specific citizenry  many in the antiwork community reject these attachments but have failed to explain how ubi can work in their antistatist framework    many in the antiwork community also assume the state is more or less the ideal representative of capital against the wage workers  but ubi proposes the state directly assumes control over the basic subsistence of the working class population of a country  how can these two ideas be reconciled  who would advocate to let their survival hang on the whims of their class enemies   tl dr   1  people work because they need the money  ubi says it can fix this problem but it's not really a problem because less work causes wages to increase    2  if it were a problem  raising the minimum wage would be a better fix for a host of reasons i detail    3  ubi relies on the state to work and this is a big problem for people  anarchists communists  who oppose the state ,clz4ic
429,Work sucks.,just as the title says  work sucks   for teens or young people in the audience who may be unfamiliar with the concept   work   aka  a job  is trading your time  skills  effort and ability in exchange for money  which can then be used for goods and services   when you first get involved in work  it can be seductive  you become part of a  team  engaged in a common task  and the fact that you have to show up at a certain time and obey certain rules helps give you structure in your life  the money you earn can be certainly appealing   however  work can also be a drag after awhile  it becomes increasingly intrusive when you discover that there are nearly infinitely better ways to use your extremely valuable time here on earth  i can't say what these things are  only you can answer that question  if your work contributes nothing positive to the earth  doing it may depress you  the money you make doesn't compensate for the icky feeling inside when you realize you're not doing right for other people and going nowhere in your own life  the money  too  is never enough  a  1 200 month rental in an apartment turn into a first house  which turns into a fixer upper which turns into a  370k house  the beat up piece of shit honda turns into your second used car  which turns into signing a contract for some fucking vehicle for 60 months at 0 9  apr  once you start spending it  you realize how inadequate it truly is  if you play this work game for long  it will feel like prison   indeed  for the vast majority of the worlds population  work is nothing more than slavery  they don't call it  slavery  of course because technically people are free to leave their jobs if they are unhappy  once you have been in the workforce for awhile  you will probably start to desire something for a better job as your lifestyle changes  you end up in a cycle though of working more hours for other peoples interests  there's always a limit to the satisfaction you can achieve from it  that time could be better served pursuing your own interests  being creative  spending time with loved ones or whatever the fuck you want  i meet so many people in my life that go  i wish i did this  i wish i could that  but blah blah blah blah   even  good  careers like doctor or social worker can get you down after awhile  turns out  almost every worker is a slave  if not to an economic system then to a government one where they are serving a bureaucracy more than the people they really want to help   ultimately  you may find that you have better uses for your time than any employer does and that your own intelligence is better served trying to make yourself money rather than trying to make a corporation richer  that's when you realize how much work really sucks  it's completely a drain and it should be avoided as much as possible   if you need to do it  then do it  but just remember its only a fucking job  and you shouldn't give a flying fuck if that company lives or dies  you certainly shouldn't be doing more than the absolute minimum amount of effort  effort you spend elsewhere that could give you greater joy in your own life   you can avoid work through a combination of extreme frugality and finding innovative ways to make money for yourself that involve very few compromises  frugality may be painful  but certainly not as much as working long hours at a job you hate  just to pay for shit you don't need  unfortunately i can't tell you the money making ideas  they are unique to your time  skills  abilities and you will have to find them on your own   the ultimate goal is to spend more time doing meaningful things and less time working for some assholes that clearly don't give a shit about you  that  over time  is where your life has to lead ,clo1pw

431,There's undoubtedly a limit to a person's happiness and potential under capitalism,i think this is the worst part of  growing up  and realizing the systemic pressures over us   there's just no escape  i will always be subject to wage slavery  anxiety  social pressure  stress  no matter how much i relax  how many hobbies i try  how much i meditate  leave my hedonist and teen addictions behind  i will still be here  suffering  not being able to find any motivation in a system that kills my energy  my appetite  my will to go on  social relationships  etc  this is why individualistic solutions are problematic  they don't cut it  they aren't made for the majority  but for a little minority that can live off the labour of others  with loads of free time and money to spend  many hobbies are just off limits for the many   also  the mindset needed to  change our lives  is too difficult to find in a constant cycle of forced work and capitalist relaxation  it just dies off  succumbs to the unbearable patterns of modernity  and  worse of all  the  gates to happiness  like free time  creativity or relationships are scarce and filled with worries and commodity fetishism  commodification of human beings makes social existence harsh  it's not about being anymore  it's appearance  it's selling yourself as a commodity that others have to appreciate  in our delusion of narcissist depression   how can people like ex-alcoholics move on amazes me  stoicism does too  cynicism  drone-like waking up at 6 00am everyday on 6 hours of sleep  how can people handle this and progress  and just not go crazy over the state of things  is alienation so powerful  i find myself being alienated as hell too  video-games  internet surfing  movies  sometimes porn  that's my  free time  well spent  and i'm still going on  but it's as hard as ever   then  let's look at the limits to education  even if you are in a country with affordable or free education  you still have to have gone to a good high school or be  intelligent  to pass the entry exams or courses  and then time is looming over you  because as soon as you begin working it all becomes hard as hell  grades dropping  attention span decreasing  like with everything  education as a way to get a better life is also classist   not only alienation  but  how can anyone see this and think it is ok or a matter of personal choice  are people shit  most of the people i know would say that you failing exams or getting a bad job is your fault  like with your psychological problems   you are just too worried   stop complaining and enjoy   just talk to somebody  etc  like it were so easy to change my state of mind and my life already  people think their environment and personal history have nothing to do with them  that they're just as free as everyone else and can change on a whim   not really r antiwork focused but fuck it ,clgfbg
